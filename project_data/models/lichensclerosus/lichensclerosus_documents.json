I am sorry you had a reaction to it.\n\nWhat did they prescribe it for? Just as a moisturizer?

Vaginal tissue is highly regenerative and steroids do not have the same negative thinning effect. It is actually not highly regenerative if it is in the vaginal atrophy stage and you are post menopausal. &gt;The absence of an atrophic effect of the medication is surprising, but could be explained by the rapid decrease in application regimen with VLS improvement (to 3 times per week), and by the fact that most treated lesions were on the mucosa rather than the skin. A different susceptibility to long-term topical corticosteroid therapy between mucosa and skin could explain the differences in induced atrophy, but further studies are needed.\n\n\n\nThis is the only case study I have encountered where they attribute steroid use to vulvar atrophy. Note it is a case study and thus an example of one single person.\n\n\n\nHere is a long term study of 507 women and topical steroids.\n\n&gt;This prospective, single-center, longitudinal cohort study of adult patients with VLS suggests that individualized preventive TCS regimens that achieve objective normality of skin color and texture and are used by compliant patients who attend regular long-term follow-up visits may modify the course of the disease. There was a significant difference in symptom control, scarring, and occurrence of vulvar carcinoma between compliant and partially compliant patients. The adverse effects of TCSs were minimal.\n\n\n\nWhile literature mentions the possibility of vulvar atrophy often I have not found where it has been documented in a large study. Please link your sources. I am not really sure what you are trying to accomplish by posting these links. I never noted anything about a large study. Anytime use topical steroids there can be thinning of the tissue for a prolonged period of time. This is very basic and most dermatologist and doctors do not recommend long-term use.  As I stated the possibility is often mentioned in warning but the actuality has not been found in any studies that I have found. Link sources or do not state it as a known, documented side effect. What I am trying to accomplish is stopping fear mongering and spreading unsourced misinformation.", "(24 y/o, M) Does LS cause irritation on urethra as well? I am undiagnosed with LS currently, but fairly certain I have it. \n\nIt started about a month ago with a skinny shiny white patch on right gland starting near urethra going down. A few weeks later I noticed a second white patch on left side, much larger. It seems like it is thinning but not sure. \n\nIn most recent times I have now starting having irritation on my urethra, looks like it is swelling it closed almost. The redness is spreading outwards and I feel burning sensation on the tip, but does not bother peeing/ejaculation. Is this normal? \n\nI have tried lotrimin and lotion, as I thought it was a yeast infection originally. Nurse practioner prescribed an antifungal we well, but did not help. I have just been using Aquaphor, because I saw somewhere that it can help but it has not. Should I use something else?\n\nShould I go back and get a biopsy or ask for a steroid ointment along with doxycycline? Could this be urethritis as well? Do they go together? \n\nIf someone could please give me some info I would really appreciate it, I am pretty anxious about it as it keeps burning. Thanks in advance! So, my LS does cause me to need an operation once every couple of years to widen my urethra I am afraid. It builds scar tissue inside which causes it to become extremely thin, this causes a lot of pain urinating etc I think you should definitely go for a biopsy and make sure. I use dermovate steroid cream which helps a bit but certainly is not a cure all LS is fairly specialist. Get an appointment with a dermatologist, specifically checking their experience with LS, and get diagnosed and start taking the correct medication. LS can cause narrowing of the urethra and can require major repair surgery if not managed correctly. I wish you all the best. Ya, I had narrowing of my urethra or some sort of growth just inside the urethra that caused my urine stream to be anything but straight for a quite while and also caused some burning sensations during urination.  These seem to be fairly common symptoms with LS.  Luckily treatment helped a lot for me. Ya, seeing the right kind of specialist who is familiar with LS is super important.  I have heard that genital dermatologists tend to have the most exerience with treating LS Out of curiosity: Can I ask if you are circumcised or not? And how long you had LS? Which kind of treatment did you get to ease those symptoms if I may ask? Yes I am. I have had it for around 8 years (diagnosed) I chose to exeriment on myself, so the treatment I used is not exactly fda approved or anything yet.  I am workin on getting it to the point where i can share more info here for everybody else. Sorry i cant say much more at this time Sure that is alright! Thank you for the info, though!", "Itching during flare I am pretty sure I had a mild flare up around mid April (itching, dryness, pain, thankfully no tearing of the skin though and sex hasnt been painful either - I actually thought it was a yeast infection but ended up testing negative)\n\nI have been applying clob every day as my GP told me if I have a flare up then to apply clob daily for a month \n\nBut throughout this the area affected by my LS has been itchy - usually this does not happen/only has done during flares, but it itches after I shower, after I apply clob and pretty much all night. It is mild and enough for me to be able to ignore but it also concerns me a lot because it just does not feel right, it is not normal for me.\n\nDo you think this is something I should bring up to my GP? Or should I continue using the clob for a month and see if it goes away? Mine itches off and on.  Sometimes it is just mild and sometimes it can be really intense.  It will probably simmer down over the month of clob.  \n\n\nDoes your GP have you tapering down to twice a week for maintenance?  There was a miscommunication with my doc to go every day for a month, every other day for a month, and then twice a week, but I did not realize I was supposed to stay on twice a week after the third month was up.  When you go off the clob, flares can get worse.  You are supposed to stay on the clob twice a week as maintenance and you can use aloe in between doses if it is being a bit of trouble (some people prefer coconut oil over aloe).  \n\n\n\nI sometimes still get a bad flare and will go back to every other day or even every day for a week or more and then taper back down again, but mostly the twice weekly and aloe is enough. Hopefully it does! Ty for your response \n\nAnd yes, before I used clob for around a month-six weeks I think then went down to twice a week for 5 months with using hydromol as a moisturiser on days I did not use clob, but then I got this little flare up so went back to using it daily (I think maybe because of a minor yeast infection but I tested for one and it came back negative :/ )\n\nI did not have any problems with twice a week until recently so I am thinking after these 4 weeks of daily trying a couple weeks of every other day then back to twice a week like before - hoping it may work! Yea, it sucks but these flares will happen from time to time.  Sounds like you are doing what you should be doing.  I hope it feels better for you soon!

I asked my doctor to be put on clobetasol but they said this was the same thing just a different name - googled it to find out it is a step down and not as strong, anyone had any success with this? It is not the same thing. It is very much weaker as you note. I use it as part of an ongoing daily management routine after an initial course of Clobetasol, which should ideally be used for initial / occasional use for penile LS for about a month, assuming a twice daily basis. After a month you might then be told to take a break and use clobetasone. I would strongly challenge your doctor on this. They said use it for a week and call back if it does not work, I will just call back next week and say I need clobetasol - really do not understand how it takes me two seconds two find out it is weaker and they go through years of studying to give incorrect information - frustrating to say the least Are you seeing your GP or a dermatologist?  If possible see a dermatologist. I can recommend an excellent private one in London. I would consider it seriously - view it as an investment in your penis. I am seeing my GP whilst I wait for my referral for dermatology - private just is not an option for me because I am a student with very little income Just to clarify, I am using a cream composed of clobesterone, an antibiotic and a fungicide called trimovate. Sometimes longer term usage of steroids can upset the foreskin fauna and flora so the antibiotic and fungicide anticipate any problems. Understood.  The Clobetasol will be very helpful applied to both the inner foreskin and outer foreskin tip. You should expect some skin blanching, reduction in the thickness of the tissue of the foreskin and possibly peeling of the surface layer of the glans. Some people report an initial burning sensation but I did not personally. I was told, and I did this ruthless, that you can support the treatment by washing and wiping  any urine residues away after pissing and use a barrier moisturiser, such as Epaderm, in side and out once the Clobetasol has been absorbed.", "30M with lichen sclerosus I am a 30 year old male with lichen sclerosus(I think). I was diagnosed around 4 years ago and got a partial circumcision 2 years ago that removed most of my problems. Ever since then I have been using steroid creams (dermovate) on and off. Whenever I use it my problems go away but as soon as I stop they slowly come back. The biggest problem is that my frenulum keeps cracking. Now I saw my doctor a couple of weeks ago and he told me that maybe I should get a whole circumcision and at the same time we can extend my frenulum. I agreed and have a surgery scheduled for next week. What I am afraid of is that my penis is a \"grower\" which means that it is significantly bigger when erect. I am afraid that the doctor will remove too much foreskin and my frenulum will get even tighter. I have read about this happening to people online and I am super scared now. On one hand I want to get the circumsision to also decrease the chances of getting cancer in the future but on the other hand I am afraid it will ruin my sex life even more. What do you guys think I should do? Unfortunately the wrong gender to give much advice but good luck with your potential treatment! Well he said extend? Did he not? Its also not the way mine worked. I had a frenuloplasty. He cut down the middle. Not the string but the base then sowed it wide.  Thanks for your reply. Did you also get circumcised?  No, not yet, but I sympathise. I have many auto immunine dieseases and thankfully my urologist diagnosed mine straight away but did not test or treat as it is not serious yet and my immunosupressors work for both. I do not want to lose that sensitivity either :/ I actually might not get it either yet. Thinking about going to a dermatologist and getting a second opinion first. Once it is gone , it is gone. No need to hurry for me either. My only problem is the frenulum cracking, when not using any steroid creams.  Also I can add that I also have another auto immune disease (alopecia areata)  Yeah, absolutely. I mean I got the plasty because I had so much scar tissue and repeated cuts. I mean ill put it this way. You can have a frenulum, a plastied one or none. Right now you basically have worse than none, and that is not staying better. So try an extended one or none. Either way less sensitivity is better than pain. Absolutely on the second opinion though. Never hurts. I know I am late to the party, and not the right gender, but maybe try the steroid creams in conjunction with barrier ointments and see if it helps? I have been using epaderm on my off days of the steroid and it seems to have helped me a lot.

I miss not having to think about these things as much LS really changes one's sex life, that is for sure. Not sure where you are at with your maintenance treatment, but I plan putting on my ointment at times that are not sexy, like Monday mornings. Good point.  Daily topical steroid use is usually not something that should be continued indefinitely.  Once you taper down to a maintenance doseage frequency then it becomes less of an hassle to plan out things like fun in the bedroom. \n \nI like your Monday mornings approach. Once I taper down enough, I will be doing exactly that. Same here.\nIt is also an issue with using condoms and fatty ointments that could alter the function of the condoms... I do not worry about rinsing anything off. If I feel like I might be having sex I will delay applying clobetasol for a few hours, but that is basically it. \n\nMy doctor emphasizes the importance of trying to maintain a healthy sex life, and has told me it is not the end of the world if from time to time we have sex after I have applied clobetasol. Unfortunately these days in putting moisturizer on every time I go to the bathroom, so I am pretty much always gooped up with something when we have sex. Important to note tho, we do not use condoms. \n\nThat said I would not call our sex life spontaneous at all.

Im curious about what exactly you are having done in your surgery. \n\nI had a totally messed up urine flow(anything but straight) for over a year and a half before i started to develop depigmentation or any of the more obvious signs  that eventually led to my LS diagnosis.  Luckily I was able to resolve all that with the alternative topical treatment I have been using. Doc gave me two options: dilation or 2 stage BMG urethroplasty. Still deciding. So your use of steroid cream fixed your stream issues? I have been experiencing some stream issues as well as a bit of a swollen meatus but I am hoping the steroid I am on will help! Were you diagnosed with LS already? The issue with urine stream seems to be mentioned by men on here fairly often for it being something that is not really recognized as a symptom of LS or BXO.    I kind of decided to develop my own alternative treatment instead of using steroids, but yes my treatment fixed my stream issues completely and I no longer need to pee sitting down. I am unofficially diagnosed I would say, waiting on my referral appointment with urologist and dermatologist but my GP consulted a dermatologist and gave me a steroid cream to use for 6 weeks\nI have white patches + very very early stage of scarring (Barley noticeable and only on a tiny area) on majority of the underside of my glans up to about 1mm from my meatus -when looking on the inside of my urethra I can see some minor white patches/depigmentation which is kind of worrying but I have noticed that my urine stream has been going between spraying and a straight line like it should be Ya, it sounds like LS to me.

It is not in the figure 8 shape and it is not around the anus-only on the right side of my vulva. It is not bumpy or dry or anything else, either-it is just lighter. It is not itchy, I do not experience tearing. I cant really speak on the pain during sex part, but lubrication seems fine and no problems inserting tampons. \n\nI developed the spot around 2-3 years ago. I went to a gyno to get it checked out and they said it was nothing to worry about, and something about puberty. No mention of lichen sclerosis. I do remember reading that this disease often disappears once prepubescent girls hit puberty, but I would think I am past that point, no?\n\nEverytime I try to look into it on the internet it suggest lichen sclerosis, so I dont know what else it could possibly be. From what I have seen, no one else has this except for those with lichen sclerosis.\n\nI am just wondering, is this how it started for those of you with a current diagnosis? Or were symptoms kind of always present? Does this sound like lichen sclerosis? I know only a doctor can give me a diagnosis, but that is not an option for me at the moment, so I thought I could try asking here. \n\nThank you so much, I have done some research on this and my heart goes out to those of you who experience symptoms. Hi!  Good for you keeping up with your health. \n\nIf I were you, I would simply keep track of whether this spot changes. Best way to do that is with photos once a month, preferably someplace nobody can nab them. Probably not on Instagram. \n\nIf you later notice a change over time, then you follow up. Otherwise - if it is not bothering you - skin can just do that. My son has a patch on his butt that used to be dark when he was born. Now it is all blotchy and light and it is the cutest thing in the world to a mom, but I am sure he will look at it someday and say \u201cwtf is that about?\u201d\n\nFor me, within a year of becoming sexually active, it was notable that sometimes I had really severe pain after sex. Back then nonoxynol-9 was still commonly used in condoms, and that burn was horrific. I enjoyed being sexually active, but sometimes I would have to shut myself in a bathroom and cry from so much pain afterward, which was confusing for everyone. (Almost always afterward, though sometimes I would notice a tear getting going during, and wish to hurry things along.)\n\nSometimes, fine. Sometimes, fiery pain. And that was by 18. I have no idea what the appearance was - honestly, I never looked, and nobody else did either.  I was stunned when I finally got an obgyn to look and it was so classically figure-8 awful, fifteen years later. There was no \u201cmaybe\u201d.  That is LS. Ripping skin at random. Crying out sitting down. \n\nSo, if you are not having pain, not having itching like there is fire ants having a picnic on you ... just document it over time, if you are comfortable having that kind of a photo album hanging around. If you are not, you could probably just take detailed notes describing its appearance in a private journal. I would personally only be concerned with changes in appearance or sensation. \n\nSkin blotches are common, and lichen sclerosus is not - you probably just have a little random coloration. Bodies are weird. Keep track of it for a few years and see if it changes, and if you have real pain, go back to the doc. Be forewarned that doctors frequently utterly dismiss women\u2019s pain - you have to be persistent, specific, and sound rational, or you will not get help. It is bullshit. I hope you never have that kind of pain, in any case!\n\nGlad to hear the next generation is taking care of their own business. Do not let the internet get you down. Do what you need to to be responsible - documenting any changes is about all I think you can do! - and take care of yourself. We are kind of thinking this disease often strikes people who are stressed out chronically, or traumatized, so continue being a good advocate for your own needs and you are doing all you need to. \n\nBest of luck to you! I second this response! I will definitely try to document any changes in appearance. This response was alot of help and it calmed my nerves a little , thank you!", "Does this look like LS to you? The whiteness is definitely new. Info in comments &lt;3  Sorry to join the many people asking the same question. I have had itching for like 3 months now. I went to the doctors and they have put me on cream and anti fungal cream for different things they think it could be but my doctor said I am \u2018too young for it to be LS\u2019 (I am 23). I should say that was a phone appointment and they did not even look. There is no whiteness elsewhere. Any sort of help would be greatly appreciated \u2665\ufe0f Your doctor is mis-informed if they think there is such a thing as \"too young for LS\".  Your  newly emerging pigment loss and other symptoms match up wIth LS.  I would get another opinion from a doctor who has actually worked with LS patients because it sounds like your doctor hasnt. Absolutely agree, I thought it was a very dumb thing to say to me! I am on day 3 of a 7 day course of treatment, do you think I should finish that before returning? (Sorry if you are not sure hahaha) Treatment like antibiotics? Idk, but beginning treatment for LS as soon as possible is important if you want to get the best results from treatment.  You dont want to wait till things get super complicated. Standard treatment for LS is usually steroid creams not antibiotics She gave me two steroid creams (both 1% though and I am aware LS is a lot higher than that) and Fluconazole tablets (anti-fungal not antibiotics sorry my bad haha) If you finish the antibiotic treatment and dont improve then there is even more reason to suspect LS.  I would probably just finish the prescribed treatment unless you are reacting negatively to it. I was diagnosed with LS at 21! This looks a lot like LS but you would have to get diagnosed and have them look at it first. Thank you so much for your help Did it take you multiple doctor visits to get your diagnosis? Thanks so much for your comment Oh, well then my answer about continuing antibiotics doesnt apply.  I am not sure what i would do there.  Some LS patients in the group here actually say they have had good luck switching to less potent steroids after trying the potent stuff like clobetasol and having skin irritation. \n\nI am mot sure what to think of your doctor's approach of using steroids and antifungals at the same time though.. steroid creams are known for allowing bacterial and fungal infections to proliferate while their symptoms are masked, so using them with an antifungal to treat a fungus does not make sense to me. I had to see multiple different doctors over 2 years and it kept getting worse. At first I was told it was a yeast infection and was given this cream for that but it just made it worse. I suggested to at least 3 doctors that maybe it is LS, but each time they said it was a yeast infection, so I stopped going to the doctors until it felt really irritated (and looked really raw and white) and I went to a different doctor who took one look at said it was LS! It is annoying how doctors will not listen because they think LS only effects women who are 50+ and I almost cried after getting diagnosed after being in pain for 2 years. I would think that if your doctor thought you had some sort of infection they would try antifungal or antibacterial drugs first, and then if that doesnt work you consider causes like LS which would be treated with steroids. \n\nMaybe your doctor thought your pigment loss was just vitiligo and the itchyness was an unrelated yeast infection so they gave weak steroids for the vitiligo and antifungals for the yeast. Still seems silly to not consider LS. looks similar to what happened with me! i was visually diagnosed by my gyno after 2 inconclusive biopsies with a dermatologist. Whereabouts are you based? I am 23 and I was very lucky to be able to go to a sexual health clinic here in the UK, and got diagnosed straight away by a professional. You are definitely not too young for it to be LS! This could definitely be LS, but considering that it looks like its losing pigment inside the actual entrance, it could be something else like lichen planus or desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. Either way, it looks suspicious, and you definitely need to find a better doctor. Can you ask for a referral to someone who knows more about these disorders? Probably a dermatologist, gynecologist, or pelvic pain specialist. Diagnosed (finally) at 25!", "I am super worried.

Borax soaks did not do anything. I have a testosterone/estrogen ointment, that did not do anything either. I keep it moisturized consistently, and I have not had sex since June 2020 due to extreme pain. \n\nImmunosuppressants? Any clinical trials anyone has heard about? I do not know how much longer I can cope. Question about the Tacrolimus (I have osteo and am trying to avoid the topical steroid route): I heard that long term use can cause an increased risk of skin cancer/lymphoma - is this true? Previously some doctors were concerned about this, mostly in children. However there was a recent study (2020) with ~8000 patients that found no increase in  lymphoma. In fact, it is likely that your cancer risk will be higher if you leave the LS untreated, because it increases the risk of vulvar cancer. Try seeing a functional medicine practitioner and healing your gut. Traditional doctors try and heal LS from the outside....but it is an internal issue. When your gut is off your immune system goes off with it. LS is your immune system attacking your skin...so if you fix your gut then your immune system will calm down and so will your LS.", "Biking with LS Hi everyone!

I suggest a saddle that takes weight off the center, mine for a man was to take pressure of prostrate. should work for you as well.\ngood luck I have a stationary bike I work out on- having a padded seat helped me a lot! See if you can get a saddle fit at a local bike shop! There is a saddle out there for every butt /lady part/sack. I work in the bike biz and have dealt with this for years. Do not accept being uncomfortable! You could look into padded bike shorts as well, these are really helpful!", "Clitoris being mysterious Hey guys, pretty sure my clit is doing the disappearing act. I noticed it years ago, and chalked it up to my fun bits changing with age. I am currently a 28 year old female, and I still can feel a good time there.. it is just the skin has started to cover over, like making a little skin hoodie or a turtle neck lol. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this, or do you still have yours exposed? To be honest I have not seen many close up of girl goodies, so I am not sure if it is the condition or me being dramatic. \n\nxox Is it just your clitoral hood? If so, that is completely normal! Thanks for your comment. Is that normal for everyone, or normal for those with LS? Normal for everyone! :) Whether it is normal or not - it can become a legit problem if it is due to LS. Specialist dr has told me the LS is responsible for the skin growing over it which can lead to decreased sensitivity and/or oak. Yeah, that is normal. Now if it fuses over your clit and cannot be gently pushed back or hurts, that can be LS. Yeah the skin is starting come together, and it cannot be pushed back. It is not something I have always had, so this is where I am curious what is going to happen years from now! Sounds like fusing. Do you use clobetasol ointment or cream? Or what does your doc have you use for symptoms? I do not have a regular doctor, but I went to a natural path and she was the one that pointed it out. I have just been going to walk ins, and the one guy I got reluctantly agreed I had it as well but just prescribed me fungal cream in case it was not LS. So I have been using cortisol cream on and off depending how I am feeling.\n\nI am pretty sure it is fusing, but when reading the comments it seems like girls are getting it in the labia areas and not the clit. There no excess skin, just a thin layer growing over. My LS is very clitoris and clitoral hood oriented and your experience sounds like mine. You will want to see an OBGYN or dermatologist soon so you can maintain the fusing issue or it can become irreversible. I use Clobetasol but there is other steroid creams that are not as strong, and Estrogen about 2 or 3 times a week just to keep the fusing from occurring. Damn that is scary. Okay thank you for this. I was not sure if surgery would be a thing in the future where they just cut it back open :P \n\nI am pretty naive when it comes to this stuff. I will do panic research, and then I bury my issues from being overwhelmed until it comes back up again. No worries! Do not want to scare you but also want to encourage you to make an appointment as soon as you can. It is a shitty disease but maintenance is easy, just a tiny little application maybe 1-3 times a week after a shower and it keeps most problems at bay. \n\nIn the meantime, just be gentle down there. If you have any pain, a warm bath with a little hydrogen peroxide and baking soda mixed in the water helps. :) Okay I am going to be looking for Doc instead of the walk ins, cause I never know who I am going to get.\n\nAlso how much do you put in your bath?? Good idea! If you have insurance you can call the number on the back of the card and find out who is covered. I honestly do not measure, just kind of a \u201cdash or two\u201d of both lol I never thought of doing the back of the card thing! Awesome, thanks for all your help. In time when I figure some stuff out I will probably update you lol. Thanks again! No problem! Good luck \u2764\ufe0f", "Awaiting diagnosis Hi all,\n\nI went to get checked because I thought I had thrush (again). And the doc thinks it is LS. I havnt looked down below in a while (I try to leave it alone as it is so sensitive) and I have a black/ blood mark. A lot of redness almost bruising? Change in skin and also white on the edges of my labia. The black mark is about 3/4\" big... I am terrified it is cancerous. \n\nGoing to gyno derm for check and biopsy in 2 weeks but need some reassurance in the meantime :(:( sounds consistent with the symptoms I experience from my LS...so sorry you are experiencing all of this and I will not lie, a vulvar biopsy is not the most pleasant experience BUT it is for your own health and well-being and I think it will definitely help answer a lot of questions you may be having and it is the best way for your health providers to come up with the best treatment plan! you will be okay no matter what, and sounds like you are on the right back to proper treatment. Fingers crossed for you! Thank you both. Might call nhs 101 in meantime as I am freaking out, really anxious. I have been diagnosed with LS but no sign of cancerous cells :)", "Does it look like i have Lichen sclerosus?  Tag this NSFW (I am not a Dr)\nUsually it starts on the foreskin, not under.\nBut I would show a doctor and ask for advice Foreskin is fine... Just a little area around my meatus is pinkish-red as it should be but all the other areas that were never exposed are kind of white or basically discolored you need to see a dermatologist as soon as possible \n. I have BXO that does not affect my foreskin  - just my frenulum and urethral meatus. That being said though, your foreskin looks tight which often, not always, corresponds to having BXO.\nThat does look like BXO to me - not a professional opinion though. Since then I have stretched the foreskin and tye opening is now twice the diametre of what is seen in the picture. Also some are that are now exposed for some time are slowly turning pink. Well that is good news! Keep that going. Maybe it is just the skins reaction to being too moist. If you get your foreskin retracting fully and get some air on your glans maybe that is all you will need! Maybe not BXO at all which would be fantastic! Yes, i just busted a huge smegma reserve and almost threw up because of tge way it smelled. Sounds like you are making good progress lol!", "Would using estrogen cream make me more fertile? I get it is not being consumed, but my grandmother asked me if it would effect my fertility in anyway.", "What are the early symptoms of lichen sclerosus in men? ", "Just diagnosed and feeling confused and helpless I just got diagnosed less than a week ago. I have been using clobetasol ointment and it is really uncomfortable but not painful or anything. I just feel hopeless with this diagnosis. I have so many other health issues and none of them ever improve because my body tends to be resistant to medication/treatment. I am worried that I will not be able to stop the damage from getting worse.\n\nI have read that the scarring that is already happened is irreversible. Sadly I have the LS mainly on my vulva, and the scarring that is already there causes penetrative sex to be very painful. I do not want to spend the rest of my life having sex that is always painful or having to use a numbing cream down there for the rest of my life to avoid the pain. I am married and I already have enough issues with my reproductive areas/organs that makes our sex life difficult to enjoy. This just adds to the difficulty and it makes me feel like I will never really get to enjoy intimacy with my husband.\n\nThis diagnosis has been dragging me down since I got it only 6 days ago. The more I learn about it and its treatment options, the more depressed I get about all of it. I did not know where else to post about this, I figured others with this diagnosis might understand how I am feeling or maybe be able to provide some info or advice about all of this. Hiya. So sorry you get to join this fun club!\n\nI have endometriosis and LS (which theoretically do not belong together, but ... here I am, quite definitely with both). I was diagnosed with Enso at 20 and LS at 30, and now I am 41.\n\nBirth control took care of endo well enough to stop the internal pain, and clobetasol fixed up the external within a couple weeks. I would been splitting open gasping with pain on sitting down before diagnosis - it was awful. I would cry and cry and cry. Childbirth was a walk in the park compared to some of that stuff - in that it went on and on and on, every trip to the bathroom possibly agony, for years. All made much better with clobetasol. \n\nSo, I hope for you that clobetasol gets you through the pain and stops the scarring. \n\nIf penetrative sex remains painful due to scarring, I believe they will give you a set of dilators - even scarred skin will stretch again comfortably, I understand. You might yet be amazed at how surprisingly supple all that skin can be after the clobetasol has had a chance to do its work. Others here have had good luck with another cream. \n\nIt feels horrible hearing the diagnosis. Not only does it just suck suck suck, it is hard to share. Hey buddies, I need sympathy, my vulva\u2019s fucked up...   not easily understood! \n\nBut it does become livable and manageable. It is not a factor in most of my life. If there is a flare that gets away from me, everything is off limits there until it is healed up - a week or two. Probably not a big deal, if married, hah. \n\nOn a practical note, can I suggest (if you do not already) learning to absolutely love oral sex? To be thoroughly happy getting him off orally, with all the extras of kissing and cuddling before and after?  Can still be hugely satisfying, especially if tomorrow it flows the other way just as generously. Or, honestly, to start off orally when intending to engage in penetrative sex - simply to make that time shorter. Get him closer on ... everybody still gets properly laid but you do not get ripped up. \n\nLittle crude, but you will find what works for you both. \n\nSometimes things will be absolutely fine and sometimes they just will not. Seasons come and go. This is a new one. Sometimes your vulva is on fire and cracks and burns and bleeds. Usually, it is healthy and normal enough and does not. \n\nSo so sorry you are here.  Super unfair BS to have to deal with. \n\nYou will maybe wind up having to look at what is happening with your body in a more general way. Might have food intolerances, like dairy or wheat, that might be pissing off all of your body at once. (Or you might not!) It is tough to examine - docs are not going to spend the time and everybody else gets woo-woo. Consider a well-educated naturopath maybe, with care. If you are collecting diagnoses, then something is underneath all of that, something docs do not know or care about. \n\nIt sucks so much. I hope you get some relief soon and find it entirely managed and under control. Plenty of us have been here already. You really will get through and find your new normal - and it will probably wind up being ok. If not perfect, then good enough. \n\nHoping for the best for you!! Ditto to everything the first commenter said! I felt the same way when I was diagnosed. It feels hopeless and awful at first, but try to remain positive and know that there are a lot of options and resources out there that will make this something you can live with. Hope you get to feeling better, stay strong! The people on this page are the kindest and have answered a lot of my questions and made a lot of helpful suggestions so do not be afraid to ask for help. Thank you SO MUCH for this reply!! It is so good to hear that things might actually get better. \n\nOne of my doctors suspects I have Endo and she is been treating me with birth control pills to control the internal pain and the continuous bleeding I experience when I am not on my current birth control. I have not had the surgery to get an official diagnosis, but the signs are all there and I have been tested for pretty much everything else that could be causing the symptoms.\n\nI am so used to being very outspoken about all my health issues. I share a lot of what I deal with on social media in an effort to help others understand what it is like to be chronically ill or to encourage them by example to get the help they might need. But I have definitely found that this LS diagnosis is not easily shared like my other health conditions. Even if I just mention the name of it, people can go Google it and know I have a fucked up vulva and I do not really want that to be widely known information haha. So it is nice to have this little Reddit community to turn to!\n\nFor some reason I have had trouble giving oral sex for years now. There may be related trauma that I have repressed, or I might just not be very used to it. I am not sure. I know my hubby wishes I were more comfortable with it, but since I am not then I never expect him to pleasure me orally. But maybe I can work with my therapist to try and be more comfortable with it and maybe even fall in love with pleasing him that way. It would definitely make things easier on me if I am having a flare down there but one or both of us is in the mood, so I will have to find ways to enjoy that for my sake and for my husband's.\n\nMy belief is that the thing that is behind the majority of my health problems is trauma. Most of my conditions, both mental and physical, can start because of or be made worse by trauma, and lord knows I have had my fair share. Grew up being sexually abused by my sister, verbally abused and emotional neglected by my parents, and abused in literally every single way (emotional, mental, verbal, physical, and sexual abuse along with being raped by one of my boyfriends from college multiple times) by all the guys I dated in high school and college (other than my husband, of course). The same sister who abused me was also extremely mentally ill and she attempted suicide basically once a week. She threatened us with the razors she cut herself with if we caught her in the act, she would have these episodes where she would just scream bloody murder and cry loud enough for the neighbors to hear--we had to call the police on her so many times because she usually acted out when she knew my parents would be out of the house for a few hours at least, and we did not know what else to do because she self harmed each time. Like I said, most of my health issues can stem from trauma and/or abuse, and I think because I dealt with so much trauma for so long, my body decided it needed to respond in multiple big ways. (See? I am very outspoken about everything, sorry if I shared too much haha).\n\nThank you again, so so much! It helps knowing others have conquered this enough that it is not much of a factor in their lives anymore. I hope I get there eventually. Thank you so much! I was nervous to post here, so it is good to hear that it is a nice community where I can ask for help without being judged. \u2764\ufe0f Oomph. Yeah, hello fellow warrior. \n\nYou may also want to join the other fun club on r/cptsd if you have not already, and pick up \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score\u201d (again, if you have not already; you have got the point already. But, it is an interesting read in a world that gives very little validation to people, especially women, whose bodies experience difficult problems after years of trauma). \n\nFWIW, it is not just you. Traveling now and have to be short, but I hear you. Diagnosed 6/7 years ago. Flair ups are a bitch but if you are consistent with the clobatesol it should be mostly ok. At least that is been my experience. I have also noticed that wearing underwear and pants for too long gets me irritated. I sleep naked, sometimes with a pillow between my thighs to allow for air flow! \ud83d\ude00 if i have a chance I will wear a nightie with nothing under in the evening. If I am irritated and it hurts I use a zinc based ointment to cool my vulva down.  It is messy but it helps me. I wish you the best of luck. Please do not hesitate to post questions or concerns. We are all in the same boat. Thank you so much! Luckily because of some gastrointestinal issues last year I have been going commando for over a year now, so I am hoping it will help if I keep doing that.", "New to suffer but not gave up\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Hello everyone. I passed the stage of denial, cry and anger and now I have a question. What kind of natural oils you use for vulva , aroun clit and below vaginal entrance. I dont want to mess up with PH or anyrhing. The other questions is a little bit intimate but which sex positions you realize that are good for you and may not lead to tearing and pain? I use Nigella oil! Also known as Black seed oil. Its helped me with itching I am recently diagnosed, too, and am just starting to get a grip.\n\nIn addition to Clobetasol, I use DHEA suppositories to prevent thinning, and an oil blend called V Magic Cream. It feels very soothing to me and supposedly does not change your Ph balance. You can buy it on Amazon, the ingredients are: \n\nOrganic Extra Virgin Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Organic Extra Virgin Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Organic Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Oil, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Medicine Mama's Proprietary Honey &amp; Propolis Blend.\n\nAs far as positions for penetrative sex, I think that depends on where your tissues are most sensitive. I am most prone to injury toward the top (clit), so rear entry works better at the moment. Thank you so much for both of you! I will def check these out Welcome! I would avoid most \"essential oils\" as they are highly concentrated. I love emu oil (brand Emu Joy: banish my pain). Agree that positions are dependent on your problem areas. My canal is smaller now, so any position where I am on top / in control works best, especially at the beginning. Thank you so much for suggestion. Yess I also feel better on top at the beginning however i realize that being on top also give me the burning feeling around clit due to rubbing. At the same time I am not sure if it happens because friction or the gel I am using. Why did you choose banish my pain version? Sorry I am asking cause I saw a version valled soothe my skin for specially LS That is a great one too! I have tried both and prefer Banish My Pain because I like the tingles and I think it is a little more long lasting. But it is a great company and I buy a lot of their products. Yes I checked and it looks really great. The sad thing is that I live in Turkey and they are deliviring here :(", "should i get a biopsy? 21(f) \nin june i went to my gyno for months i was experiencing, itching that would turns to sores, irritation, redness, stinging when i went to the bathroom, the itching  was worse at night. I was having these problems on and off for a couple months and. now looking back i had flares maybe even two years ago.\n i got a pabst smear and my doctor told me that it could be a yeast infection and he prescribed me a cream and told me it could also be dryness and to use coconut oil.\ni went back to the gyno a couple months later and got another pabst smear and he told me the same thing. since then, i have  still been having these issues with flare ups. I have been reading about LS and relate to the itching and sores and other things like paint during sex: i do not think i have lichen spots but there is discoloration like pale/ whitish parts. should i go forward with a dermatologist appt or go to the gyno ?", "Pelvic Pain? Does anyone else get pelvic pain with flares? Idk really where is coming from but I am tempted to believe everything is very, very inflamed (I mean, I guess idk cus for me it is painful to insert ANYTHING, but the nurse at PP today says it looks fine and she would not know I have LS, had to be assured by the other nurse that this was diagnosed by biopsy --- obviously I am frazzled) and maybe it is referred pain.\n\nIt has been kind of crampy but it is starting to get sharper sometimes (then the whole area feels raw af right now) and I am getting achy pain through the whole area (hips down through groin). This is not terribly new but either it is getting worse or I am hyper focused (because I am distressed af). I have had on and off hip pain since probably the third trimester of pregnancy... so idk maybe it is just that (idk would that be considered repetitive strain?). Maybe it is anything. Maybe it is nothing?\n\nBut I wanted to ask because it is in that area and I have been getting it distinctly along with flares when the LS feels pretty bad.\n\nThey say it does not go internal but there is some case studies of at least vaginal and cervical LS confirmed via biopsy (I personally feel is probably more common and under-diagnosed/reported because the redness hides the scarring in the same way that the white flakes of Psoriasis hide the redness) and I have had that tender, stinging on touch on my cervix (TMI, I know, but if we never talk about it... ya know? The fun of having an IUD and remembering I have not checked it in several years because... OUCH)... so I wonder if it is traveled into my uterus or colon? Not even in a \"it is going to destroy my innards\" kind of way but in a \"WHY DOES IT HURT LIKE THAT\" kind of way. I do not have periods anymore... or idk maybe I do if a period can come and go (I have had spotting twice in the last two weeks - the spotting also correlates with flares during the most painful periods when the stinging is at it is worst (I believe this is when fissures and ulcers happen, as when I have seen ulcers it has correlated to that intense stinging, cannot walk without wanting to cry kind of pain)).\n\nMaybe these clinicians think I am insane. Maybe this condition, after 5 years... is driving me insane. \ud83d\ude1e", "Freaking itchness How do you cope with the itchness wakes you up in the middle of night without straching? My dermo says that my skin looks good but I always feel itchy. Has anyone gone through this, do you have any suggestions? Ice packs are great for the severe itching. You can freeze a water bottle and put it by your bedside so it is ready when you wake up in the night. I think oral antihistamines can also help, but ask your doctor of course. Vagisil wipes help me some. Mostly, I try to keep my nails rounded and smooth and just scratch away. Where I live, we dont have vagisil unfortunately :( Thank you for the advice! According to the specialist I see, you can use a first generation antihistamine like Benadryl. Does it really help with the ithcy feeling have you tried? I have only used it at night when my symptoms are not well controlled by clobetasol. But it does help me get through the night, or I will take one if I wake up in the middle of the night The most helpful thing for itch for me in the past , I am in remission, was ice packs. I would just wrap an ice pack in a light towel and apply to the vulva. They do have products now for this where you can by packs that are the size of a vulva that you can slip into your underwear. Initially, an antihistamine can help. Personally, I used claritan because I wanted a non-drowsy type, but any antihistamine should suffice. Soaking in a warm bath can also provide some relief.\n\nI know the derm said your skin looks good, which, yay, but can I ask how you treat your LS and how you manage your symptoms? Hi, I used dermovate which is requently used for clob in my country for 3 months and then started tacrolin for 1 month after followed by elidel which I am currently using. Apart from them, only coconot oil and another cream to only mostriuze Ah, frustrating...u are doing all the right things. Is elidel estrogen? Have you been using that since the beginning? I wonder if you doctor is open to investigating more and thinking outside the box. In the meantime, ice packs, warm soaks, and antihistamine can help with itch. Oh I am luck, she has so much experience about LS and very open to hear me. She thinks that the itchy feeling might be related to pubic hair so she suggested laser hair removal but I am not sure about it This is so refreshing to here. You are not the only one whose public hair causes itch and or irritation. If you want to remove, laser is one of the safest options, and, since she said your skin looks healthy, you could do that now. Personally, I had laser done like 15 years  ago and I never looked back. Similarly, I have been prescribed hydroxyzine and it seems to help a little!", "LS surgery Hi all\n\nI am a 23 yo female who has suffered LS my whole teenage years pretty much. I am currently on clob prescribed  by my dermatologist and receiving physio due to muscle tightening (secondary vaginismus) \nLast July I had surgery to widen my vaginal entrance due to the lichen being so bad. My whole labia Minoria has fused but my gyno thinks the entrance should still be able to accommodate a penis with no problems however now my LS is under control im focusing more on the sex aspect as this has NEVER been possible. I have emphasised so many times to my gyno I want the fusing sorted by surgery so my  vagina can be more accommodating as it does not seem like anything can fit in there still without me being scared of the fusing tearing!! He has stressed this surgery is extremely painful so I wanted to know if anyone has had this and their experience. Thank you xx I do not have personal experience with the fusing, but, if I were you, I would seek a second opinion from another gyno and also get a dermatologist who has LS experience.", "Experience with Accutane treatment I changed from the pill to hormonal IUD (Jaydess) a few months ago and have hormonal acne now. I had it before but never that bad. It is really painful.\nTopical treatment is not really working so I thought about talking to my doctor about using accutane. \nHas anyone with LS had experience with accutane? Does it worsen the symptoms? \nOf course I am going to listen to my doctor I just wanted to know what people in the community had to say about it. Hmmm. I took accutane years ago before my first LS flare and I never even connected the two!\n\nSorry I cannot be of more help, but I wonder if there is a relation. As far as it worsening, accutane dried EVERYTHING out, so just watch out for that. I have had my Jaydess removed after a year because of the acne, it is so painful and uncomfortable. I am hoping to find a dermatologist to help, but would love to hear if you have any luck finding treatment too. I have not tried accutane, but had friends who were on it years ago. It helped them but made them super sensitive in sun and really dry, so just make sure you do research on those things so you are aware going into it. \nJaydess is fairly new and it sounds like a few folks in here have had the same experience, it sucks.\nWishing you lots of luck sorting it! Probiotics will heal the acne and LS, sounds like you have leaky gut. Steam room should also help with the acne.", "Emu oil?

Like latex allergy.", "Emotional roller coaster diagnosis Late last year I (27F) started having extreme dryness and itchiness. I went to my gynecologist, and she told me I probably had psoriasis, which I then treated for a few weeks with clobetasol. When I stopped the treatment, the symptoms came back, so I resumed treatment and in May 2021 I went back and had a biopsy in case of LS. The biopsy result came back as a yeast infection plus psoriasis. My gyno treated the yeast infection and had me continue with the clobetasol. She also referred me to a specialist to help find the best treatment option. I stopped using clobetasol for a month prior to the appointment with the specialist (as advised by my doctor). I had another biopsy and the results came back as LS. This was two days ago, and I am feeling very overwhelmed by the diagnosis and confused as to why the first biopsy came back as psoriasis. \n\nPrior to the first biopsy, I had known LS was a possibility, and I had actually come to terms with that outcome. But then with the psoriasis diagnosis, I stopped worrying. Now I have to come to terms with the LS diagnosis again, and it is been more difficult. It is been a roller coaster of emotions. I am still in pain from the biopsy and LS, I am confused, and I am upset by the diagnosis but also relieved to know what is going on. \n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience with an incorrect diagnosis? What helped you come to terms with your diagnosis? Ahh good news bad news. I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I am in the same sitch except I am much older. I learned from a ls group that getting a diagnosis can go like this with yeast diagnosis or other dx for years. A biopsy is supposed to give the clearest dx. I thought I was lucky and had been straight up diagnosed 10m ago by biopsy. Then just last month 2 docs said I do not have it. The one who did initial dx thinks maybe the biopsy was wrong and removed 2 additional spots to biopsy. I forgot how awful aftercare of the biopsy is. So lots of empathy for you and not much real help. I have muddled thru and managed things well enough to travel, have sex, and occasionally wear pants. Lots of good info and support in this sub. Hang in there xo I am so sorry you are going through this, I absolutely understand that you are feeling upset \n\nI (28F) was diagnosed at the beginning of this year and had a similar experience. I had been treating for yeast infections when I had flare ups and brought it up with my GP who looked at the areas where I was itchy and sore and said she did not see anything and that it looked fine.\n\nThen went to my gyno for be referred for endo stuff and to ask about the itchiness, where she took a pap and found abnormal cells so that took precedence over anything else so she did not check. It was not until a follow up that she properly had a look, saw the white skin and suggested it could be LS then not long after did my biopsy which came back as LS. My biopsy sucked as my LS is right around my clitoris and I developed a hematoma, but there is barely even a scar now!\n\nI was so, so upset when I first found out, but after about 8 months I have found a lot of comfort in some Instagram pages:\n\n\nUnfortunately there is very little resources for LS\n\nSo now 8 months later, my diagnosis has been really helpful too because it is helped me identify a few triggers (hello, vegetable oils and fried foods!!). I also just generally take care of myself better now, I have also got severe endo so I have had to learn proper self-care and self-love, and it is been such a positive learning experience for me. \nRest, heal, buy yourself some super comfy new underwear and pants that make you feel comfortable and cute. Thinking of you, you have got this &lt;3 Thanks. I think I am fairly lucky in that my timeline from symptoms starting to diagnosis was less than a year. \n\nI am so sorry you are going through another biopsy, especially two at once! Wishing you swift healing from that, and hopefully some answers. Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience! And thank you for posting the Instagram pages, I am definitely going to check them out.\n\nI am glad to hear you have come to a place of relative positivity, that gives me hope. I am definitely currently in a place of negative coping mechanisms and am trying to reframe my mindset. Thank you. With 2 biopsies if one does not hurt the other does lol. Hoping this too will pass. You will get there, it takes time! It is totally normal and okay to feel how you are feeling", "(32m) Sudden phimosis, could this be LS? Related to hypospadias? *I will see my GP in the morning and they might refer me to a urologist. I am pretty anxious and would like to know if this could be LS or perhaps related to my hypospadias*\n\n------------\n\nI am an otherwise physically healthy uncircumcised male with hypospadias. My urethra ends just above my frenulum, instead of at the tip of my penis - well, I think they tried to fix it when I was little, but the second hole at the tip of my penis does not work.\n\nAnyway, I have never had trouble with my penis until very recently. I cannot aim so well so I just pee sitting down, and my foreskin always was a little tight but never uncomfortably so. No problems with sex.\n\nBut a few weeks ago my foreskin started feeling a little tighter. My frenulum hurt a little, but only when pulling my foreskin back. I thought it may have been a small tear and it would heal by itself. But my foreskin remained tighter.\n\nYesterday in the shower I felt a sharp pain around my frenulum when pulling back the foreskin to clean. Today in the shower, my foreskin is so tight that I can no longer get it over the head of my penis to clean! I am quite concerned.\n\nThe area around my frenulum is a little whiter than usual, as is the now tight phimotic band. Since today, it also hurts a little when I pee. No blood.\n\nAt first I was afraid my hypospadic urethral opening is tearing into my frenulum. But then I read about LS. Could it be that? Or both?", "What do you wear to work out?  \n\nWhat do you all wear when your work out?\n\nSweat really irritates my skin, need something that is breathable Wear loose cotton clothing whenever possible. You can also try applying a thin layer of coconut oil to your sensitive areas before working out.  A lot of LS patients have good luck with using coconut oil for keeing their skin moist and stuff, but it may also be able to form a bit of a protective layer to keep sweat and other body fluids off of your skin for a while.  Just an idea... Thank you both! I cant believe how hard it is to find cotton pants :( Dude, I know! Its seems like everything from socks to food has some kind of synthetic filler in it these days.. Men's cotton boxers have been a life saver for me. Running underwear! I have access to Decathlon and I bought really simple running underwear ( they work great! Fabric is synthetic, but one of those dry fast types of fabric and it has tiny vent holes all over. It makes a huge difference how sweaty I get when running or working out and it does not say wet. Thank you!! I know I am late to the conversation, but I wear cotton  joggers now instead of leggings and longer cotton underwear so they do not bunch up and irritate my skin. I really enjoy the style of joggers Alphalete makes. Thank you!!", "Video on sex, relationships, and LS Hey everyone. Just wanted to share a series of videos I am publishing on the topic of sex, relationships, and LS. In this three-part series, I interview my husband about his perspective and what is it is like to be married to someone with LS and the types of hurdles we faced because of it. I share a lot about my journey from painful sex to pain free sex on my blog (main topics are mental health and LS, body dysmorphia and LS, and sex and sexual health and LS), but I thought it was important to highlight the perspective of our partners. If anyone is interested, you can watch part one here: (\n\nPart two can be found here: (", "Feeling helpless ", "Is this BXO? (NSFW) I had Phimosis which does not allow me to retract my foreskin. I have been stretching but I recently discovered, with the help of r/Phimosis, that some scarring is visible in my foreskin.\n\nThis is what my foreskin looked like 1-2 months ago. Unable to retract, even while flaccid:\n\n\n\nThis is my foreskin now:\n\n Ok, good progress, do you use betamethasone cream. It helped me a lot.\nI had some tear scaring that went away in time.\nIf that is LS the cream will help remove scarring and heal the red patches. It has taken me over a year but looking much better.\nGood luck. I have never used a steroid cream of any sort. Also I know the white phimotic ring is supposed to be scar tissue, but aside from that I have have not seen tearing of any time. I do not even know what BXO/LS is. Is it the redness on my glans or the phimosis?\n\nI am using a bit of cocunot oil on my outer foreskin and washing my now-exposable glans every shower. Hopefully the redness reduces over time. LS is an autoimmune reaction.\nI suggest you see a dermatologist and get some steroid cream. It will help with the phimosis and the white which might be LS. I also had a red patch, the dermatologist wanted to make sure it was not a fungal type infection, but no change. This is probably LS as well. \nGood luck. For sure go see a  dermatologist. I think they will prescribe clobetasol 0.05 cream that should help the phimosis and thin the skin. The steroid will make the skin more stretchy allowing your streching exercise to work better. That my opinion, but I am not a doctor.", "How soon after starting clobetasol treatment were you able to resume sex? Two weeks ago I received my diagnosis of LS.

Doc also has me on vaginal estradiol...both have been a gift from the heavens. A new hope for a functional sex life has been restored. \n\nI have been so shut down since this all started and I feel so incredibly good at the moment I am afraid to have sex and be in pain again. \n\nIs this a common mental block?

I am so sorry you are going through this! If you are worried about telling your parents, that is normal; have you told to any of your friends? Would they be willing to be with you when you do talk to them?\n\nAs a mom, I find it easier to have awkward conversations with my kids (or my parents!) in the car or on a walk. That does two things: you do not have to be making eye contact AND there is a known end to the awkwardness: when you get to the destination or finish the walk.  If you are not geographically close to do that in person, you can do it over the phone but start the conversation with \"I have about 10 minutes before I have to... (meet a friend, take a meeting, etc) so you time box the conversation. Just remember they changed your diapers so they have seen it all already, and they only want you to be happy and healthy!\n\nI got diagnosed this year at age 46 and only directly told my mom but knew she would tell my dad. I just did not want to talk to him about my lady bits, you know? He sent a very professional text wishing me the best with my \"issues\". \ud83d\ude04 thank you so much for the advice. i have not told my friends because even though it is not embarrassing it still feels embarrassing, however, i was thinking of telling my older sister as she and i are very close and in other situations where i have not wanted to bring up a topic with my parents shes done it for me and started the conversation. once again, thank you for the advice :) When you are ready see a gymo or dermatologist to sort out if this is yeast or LS. Preferably one that has LS patients.\nThere is lots of information and pictures posted on here and replies you can read.\nAlso links to published articles about LS\nGood luck. \nPS Avoid any water based products. Ointment is better than cream version", "How to Deal w/Partner's High Sex Drive Hey all,\n\nI have been dealing with a lichen sclerosus diagnosis for over a year, but dealing with the itchiness/discomfort/painful intercourse for far longer. Often, intercourse is excruciating. At best, intercourse is only tolerable for me. If it goes on for too long, though, tolerable quickly turns to uncomfortable, then to painful.\n\nMy question is, I have a fianc\u00e9 with a VERY high sex drive. If it were up to him, we would have sex at least 3x a day. As of now, I am just trying for 5x a week, but if we go a day without him getting off, he gets upset. For instance, yesterday we had sex in the morning, and when I was not up for sex in the evening or this morning, he was unhappy.\n\nHow should I cope with this? Any advice is appreciated. I think you need to have a really serious conversation with him about 1) how painful it is and that 2) that continued tearing and irritation can lead to things such as vaginal fusing, closing of the clitoral hood, and other physical morphing down there. Like your vagina can literally start to fuse together... if pain apparently is not reason enough.\n\nTbh, this feels like it lowkey belongs on AITA. You should not have to \"tolerate\" sex when it is that painful. Your partner should be empathetic, not bitter and childish like he seems to be- it is not your obligation to get him off however many times a week (are not we trying to aim for gender equality here? Does not sound like he believes in that tbh). Seriously, though, maybe you should ask him about what his priorities *really* are, this just seems so absurd to me. How much more selfish could you be?\n\nMy partner also has a high sex drive, but he is been the *most* understanding about my LS and always making sure I am feeling okay down there. I, as a person, am important to him- not for the sex, but for who I am. Sex is the cherry on top. This so many times over. Do not be with a partner that views you as just a sex on demand object without a care to your health. This is not how a relationship should be and it is not healthy. It disturbs me that any man child like this is having sex much less in a relationship. He is managed to manipulate you into thinking this and no doubt other aspects of your relationship are normal when it is abusive behavior. I can say from experience that this relationship will not last this way. You will both get resentful and you will not be able to continue forcing youself to have sex with him just to keep him happy. Been there, done that. 5x a week is above average for someone WITHOUT lichen. He is emotionally manipulating you by \"getting upset\" every time you dont want to have sex. That is dangerous behaviour. Sorry to be blunt but I seriously encourage you to share your thoughts with him (show him this post if you have trouble communicating or if he has trouble listening) and if he doesnt want to compromise then I would reconsider the entire relationship tbh. He needs to sort his priorities out!\n\nSex should not be \"tolerated\" you should both be comfy, consenting and enjoying yourselves. He is clearly putting his need for an orgasm over your enjoyment and wellbeing.\n\nHe needs to be educated on this debilitating disorder that can cause physical fusing if not properly cared for. I cannot imagine having to endure sex which is causing you pain will be doing your LS any good either.\n\nI know it is all well and good some stranger on the Internet telling you to dump his ass, but he sounds like a self-absorbed tool that needs a good talking to. I also have a partner with really high sex drive. We went about 9 months not being able to have piv sex, and it was really hard on both of us. I told him that he should hook up with someone else if he had the opportunity and wanted to. He did not during that time, but has since then. \nIf you have not tried using dilators I would suggest that. If you are too sore, you are too sore! There are other places he can stick it, anyways. If he is getting \u201cupset\u201d because you are not having sex often enough, then he is being abusive. He can get himself off if it is that big of a deal. Responding with anger or manipulation is not okay. Please rethink your relationship. It is not worth your health and comfort! (I was in a similar situation once, ended it with him, as he was abusive in other ways as well and my physical and mental health was not good, I am now a healthy weight, my LS is in control and I am happily engaged to a guy who gets it!) \ud83d\udc95 Also! If he is not satisfied, he can also end the relationship and seek out another. It sounds like he just wants you to feel bad and gets some kind of gratification out of that. My ex was the same way. I gave him many chances to leave and offered to end the relationship. He said he did not want to. Then turned around and bitched any time I could not have sex. He is not worth it, babe! As the others have stated, unfortunately, this is not going to work. I hate to sound so pessimistic, but with LS, it is just true. I used to be able to keep up with my husband. We got together at 19, married at 21. We are now 30. I simply cannot go as often as he would like, for exactly the same reasons as you. I cannot hold it against him; he is attracted to his wife! I am so grateful he finds me so beautiful and desirable still, but he has expressed many times that my inability to have enjoyable sex makes him feel unattractive/undesirable, which is so heartbreaking to me. There are other alternatives, obviously, but it is just a bummer. If I would known this was my physical future, I would have broken it off before he was \"locked in\", so to speak. He will not leave me, but sometimes I feel like I unintentionally trapped him.", "I have a thin white band around my phimotic ring. So I have phimosis which means I cannot retract my foreskin at all, When I pull back I can see the pee hole and no more, I can see the tight part which is the phimotic band I was trying for years to stretch it but only recently via reddit I found out it must be Lichen sclerosus as for 2 years or so with constant stretching nothing has happened or changed and I was consistent. Is there any treatment or creams at all ? That is how it started for me. White ring that is tight. Eventually it progressed so much that I could not pull my foreskin back.\n\nTry to keep the area dry, and clean of urine. And see a doctor.\n\nAs far as stretching, I have been doing it on and off for 5 years now. It is only a temporary solution, it seems. I am trying applying tea tree oil this month, while also not using any sugar for a few months now. It seems to be helping, a bit.  LS usually responds well to clobetasol treatment. For penile LS affecting only the foreskin, circumcision is also an option and may actually cure it. I would recommend seeing a dermatologist as soon as you can. Well I have been treated for phimosis with betamethasone cream very successfully. I also have bad adhesions and it is taking time but resolving. \nUntil my dermatologist diagnosed LS no doctor has been able to help with the adhesions for about 40 yrs. This is a skin autoimmune disease and in my opinion and experience a dermatologist is your best option.\nGood luck.\nBTW my nephew in Holland had a procedure for phimosis that resolved the problem without circumcision. You really dont want circumcision imho ! Will look into it, clobetasol is a cream right? It MIGHT clear it up and I could then stretch the foreskin to try getting retraction? Let me know how the tea tree oil works, I got bio oil which is meant to be good for scar tissue etc have not been using it often though need to though. I am doing 75% Tea tree oil,  25% Bio-oil mixture. So far, there has definitely been some peeling from the scar tissue, but it is minimal at the moment. I see, Can I ask if you can retract at all? Does the whiteness on my image look anything like yours? I cannot find your image. For me it started as a white ring on foreskin that was barely tight. At it is worst the opening was so small that I could not even with a finger in. And if I tries to stretch the skin would split and bleed. I have been using the phimocure rings and now can retract with some effort when flaccid. I have bad news, if I stop with stretching the opening shrinks back. So it is important to keep with stretching, and also I think it is really important to keep it free of urine residue. \n\nYou should really see a doctor, at the very least he will confirm your diagnosis. Their knowledge will vary though, mine recommended only circumcision. But I was able to have him prescribe me beta-methasone cream. Unfortunately for me applying the cream only lead to more skin tearing. But it may work for you. Consult your doctor. Yeah, it is a cream or ointment. You would need a prescription for it, because it is a high dose, and you should definitely see a doctor to confirm it is LS before trying to treat it as LS. I think it should improve the elasticity of the skin, but it is possible another med could help as well. In women, estrogen cream is often prescribed as well, because it helps the skin grow thicker and more elastic (and LS often occurs after menopause when estrogen can be low), and dilators for stretching can be used if the vagina is too constricted. A doctor might have some ideas about what would be best for you.

My gynecologist appointment was moved to December and I seriously cannot wait for that. Do you think a doctor would prescribe me clob at urgent care?

I am so depressed my vagina looks like Freddy Kruegers face :( What about your gp ? Explain and say you will keep appointment in December but would like something for now ? I\u201dve already seen multiple GPs and they keep misdiagnosing me with yeast infection or BV and when I mention LS they do not even know what it is. I asked for something sooner with a gynecologist different locations but soonest availability is December I am not sure how urgent care works but I say it is worth a try! Where are you located. Ie what country and health system ? Hey I am literally in the same spot as you! I have only had LS for 1 year now and just recently did i realize it was LS. I always had a suspicion but wanted to see a doctor. They diagnosed me wrong and gave me multiple steroid creams, making the skin thinner and thinner. I am now at a point where I am in so much pain and cannot go through a normal day without excruciating pain. My gyno appointment is the beginning of November and I have been waiting for 4 months now. It is close but I still want to go to emergency care due to the fact it is severely cut up and nothing is helping. I heard Emu oil and Vitamin E oil helps a ton, I just placed an order and hopefully it helps in the mean time. I need clob!!! They could give you clob! It is a possibility but make sure you ask for the ointment and not the cream! And if they do not have clobetasol specifically, make sure the medication is a high potency steroid. That is all that matters. For the itching, try an ice pack! Some women sleep with one there and it helps. But do not scratch. You do not want to cut yourself. \n- Fellow vulvar LS haver.

I had been suffering from tearing and increasingly tight foreskin for 2 years before I finally got circumcised 4 days ago. My urologist said it is highly likely to get rid of the disease..\n\nI did have two small white patches on the tip of the glands prior to surgery about 3mm in diameter that disappeared with steroid application. \n\nMy main concern was I have noticed that my urine stream has decreased over the past year and I. Worried it is spread to the meatus?\n\nI do not know if the restricted urine stream was as a result of tight foreskin of the the disease itself.\n\nWhat should I do and is there a scan to check if the disease has progressed inside the urethra? That Is great to hear that you were able to regain pigment in your white patches.  How long did that take for the 3mm patches?  Do you apply the steroid cream to your urethra/meatus also?\n\nI had issues with my urine stream being anything but straight for a couple of years before most of my other LS symtoms appeared and I got diagnosed.  My urologist brushed off the urine issues as \"normal\" or whatever when I brought it up.  No help from him.  Eventually, my urine stream returned to normal after a few months of treating my LS.  I suspect my urine flow issue was due to some sort of small growth obstructing my meatus.\n\nI hope you are able to resolve your issue as well. Good luck. I only applies the cream for 5 days or so. And stupidly or not I actually used a needle to scrape these from the surface. After this the spots returned on one side but then randomly peeled off on its own and did not return. This was about 1 month ago. And now I just had circumcision with fren removal to Address my right foreskin andnrh biopsy confirmed it was early stage bxo i applied it to the tip,glands  and all around the foreskin. The spots were at both sides of the urethra opening ( Tip) \n\nI stupidly did not tell my urologist about my urine changing flow.\n\n\nDid your urine return to normal after circumcision or after steroid cream application? I kept my foreskin and got stuff under control just with topicals. My body sorta flaked off the damaged old skin before the new healthy stuff appeared also. Oh cool. So you noticbly has a reduction in urine flow till you started using the steroids? Did you suffer from tights forskin and tearing I did so I elected to circumcise.\n\nWhat creams did you use? I kept my foreskin and got stuff under control just with topicals. My body sorta flaked off the damaged old skin before the new healthy stuff appeared also.  I didnt notice a reduction in urine flow.  I had pain during urination/dysurea for a month or so before i began treatment, but the issue with my flow was the fact that it was no longer a concise stream and it would spray erratically to the left even though my penis is straight. I had that as well but my flow as gotten alot thinner but I can still urinate fine it just seems thebdlow volume has reduced by 50 percent. The problem is I do not know if was from the right forskin or bxo progressing inside nside my urethra.\n\nWhat cream did you use and how did you apply it?\n\nSo the flow just went back to normal after you used the cream for a while? Sounds like your meatus or urethra may be affected by your LS, but there are other unrelated things that could be causing your reduced urine flow, so you should talk to your doctor about all that. \n\nThat Is interesting you had erratic urine flow also because I have not seen that mentioned much.  \n\nAs far as my treatment, I cant share much right now. All I can say is that it was not your average treatment, and I hope to be able to share more info soon.\n\nAnd ya, my flow is all normal now Would appreciate if you could mention how you were treated.  But if not that is ok I honesty cant wait to share all the detais about how I have treated my LS, but right now its still too soon. The treatment may need to go through some clinical trials and stuff before I can share info about it. I am still working on all the technical red tape and stuff that I need to sort out before I share my results. I would call your urologist and ask about the urine flow thing. It could be LS related but could be a lot of other things, too. I do not think LS has a lot of \"internal\" effects so it seems unlikely to affect your urine stream if your skin looks normal from the outside. But I do not know for sure. How long did it take you to regain pigment ? Because mine was minor they regained pigment almost instantly. Like a few days Ohh I guess you are very lucky then You need to chill out. I had the illness years ago. Got circumcised, everything was fine, then it started affecting the miatus. Pale tissue and decreased urine stream. Cause unknown. Some application of prescribed Clobetazole fixed the issue completely. I have had no issues for years now. It is as if nothing ever happened. Just chill out, it will go away. Circumcision is the best thing you could have done for this. I think BXO is some type of auto immune disease similar to diabetes or psoriasis. Not being rude just asking. If you no longer have problems, why are you on an LS board? Cause I like to remind myself it could come back every day, and the symptoms will start all over again and make me miserable. Until then I will hope for the best. But to be honest I have no issues at all, as if nothing ever happened.", "Is it possible to have BXO without the itch part?

I still use all my ointments. \nI was diagnosed with LS at 5 years old and I am 21 now so I have been dealing with this disease most of my life. Here are my product/lifestyle suggestions that help me:\n\nSupplements:\n- Daily multivitamin (I take Alive Men\u2019s Energy- I am female but the iron in women\u2019s supplements gives me a bellyache)\n- Vitamin E (be careful with this especially if combining a multivitamin with an additional vitamin e supplement, do not take more than 1,000mg or 1,500 IU per day of vitamin E)\n- Probiotic (helps with regulating vaginal flora; all our ointments can throw us off, causing yeast infections etc. which worsen LS symptoms)\n- Turmeric (anti inflammatory)\n- Apple cider vinegar (ingested orally!!- do not put it on your genitals pls!)- (helps alkalinize the body which can help regulate vaginal pH..and no, you do not need to drink alkaline water)\n\nProducts:\n- For soaps I like cetaphil, dove sensitive skin, Tom\u2019s of Maine sensitive, or vanicream. Do not use anything with fragrance. I use these on my whole body as soap inevitably drips down there in the shower and can burn if it is not the right kind. I use these for shaving too. No shaving creams!\n- I use vitamin e oil on my vulva for moisture and soothing any minor irritation/tears in between \u201cflare ups.\u201d Also helps with scarring!\n- I take baths with fragrance free epsom salt. Best to avoid Epsom salts with essential oils like ones targeted toward \u201cstress relief\u201d and stuff like that. I know a lot of stuff online will tell you how great essential oils are for LS but mostly they are irritating. Nothing with fragrance (essential oils included) should go down there. \n- If you are able to have sex, ALWAYS lube it up.\n- Always always always 100% cotton underwear\n- No underwear in bed/to sleep. Let it breathe. Thank you so much for your post! Which vitamin E oil do you use? I cannot find any with just vitamin E, they all have extra ingredients DERMA E Vitamin E Skin Oil 14,000 IU 2 fl oz \nThis is what I use. It is just vitamin e in safflower seed oil which is a simply carrier oil Thank you! This is so useful, thank you! My bf brought me some vitamins including vitamin E to have daily to help, I am going to look into the other things like ACV and probiotics.\n\nI have been prescribed hydromol to use between steroids to keep the area moist, would vitamin E oil be better than this or should I stick to what is been prescribed? What Is the longest you have been without a flair op? I have gone years at a time without flares! I have never used hydromol. I would stick with that if your doctor prescribed it. You will get the benefits of vitamin e from taking it as a supplement :) Thanks for replying!\nThat makes sense, yeah I will definitely keep taking daily supplements from now on then Thanks, this is a great post. I wish we had a FAQ so we could compile these things in an easy-to-find place. \n\nDo you think it is better to wear cotton underwear or no underwear during the day? Since working from home I have had the option to do the latter, but I am not sure if it is not worse. \n\nThe probiotics make sense to me for vaginal pH, but I admit I am skeptical about apple cider vinegar. Do you have any more info on that one? I see a lot of proponents of it but I have never understood why. Cotton is soft and \u201cbreathable\u201d. You cannot really go wrong with it unless of course you have a cotton allergy. A lot of other underwear materials like polyester, spandex, etc. (like a lot of the no show underwear) actually contain micro-plastics and while they feel soft they can be irritating. I wear loose cotton shorts around the house with no underwear. With jeans or anything tight and/or stretchy like spandex, definitely wear cotton undies.\nVaginas are pretty acidic with a pH of about 4. Infections like yeast prefer a more basic environment and once established will raise the pH more. ACV is acidic so can help keep the vagina acidic, killing yeast and preventing infection. It is definitely not a perfect proven science, but I feel that it helps me.

I am a virgin and I would like to have sex with my boyfriend but I am a little scared it might be uncomfortable and I am also scared to tell him about this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude05 thanks! Keep hydrated, wear cotton underwear, sit in a warm bath when you are having a flare. There are some prescription ointments like pramasone that you can get in the US that can be soothing. Tell your BF what is happening because honestly sex can hurt sometimes and it is less scary when you know that your partner is understanding of what is going on. Use natural lubes and condoms- no flavors or anything because it can burn. I hope that you get some relief with prescriptions/now that you have a diagnosis! I second this! It would also be smart to wear pads that do not have fragrance. My personal preference is U by Kotex. The less you wear underwear the better. Also a change in diet can help a lot. I found that for some reason makes the pain worse and spicy food. Play around with your diet and see if anything make the pain better. Good luck\u2764\ufe0f Hello! \nI was diagnosed around your age as well. Best thing to do is to use your prescription as directed. That will help stop the progression of it. \n\nBiggest trigger  for me is scents. Scent free detergent for my undies and scent free body wash! \n\nI have not change any of the clothes that I wear as they do not cause flair ups. \n\nToilet paper can irritate me, so I bought a snazzy toilet seat bidet from Costco and that helps a lot. \n\nWhen I am not using steroid cream I apply coconut oil or some other non-irritating oil in the morning to help moisturizer and keep my skin happy. \n\nMy go-to lube for sex is coconut oil. It is not condom comparable, so be mindful of that. I also find semen sorta irritates my skin sometimes so another thing to look out for if you are sore after sex. When I have used condoms I found latex a bit irritating so I used non-latex condoms with more success. \n\nHow I explained my to my partner is that I have an autoimmune disease so my skin can get damaged more easily and I have to be careful with it. It is nothing to be ashamed of and it is not a big deal! Totally agree with everyone else. I have found an ice pack helps as does taking an antihistamine at night I explained to my husband that I have a skin issue like eczema that affects me and it can sometimes be sore and make my skin thin and itchy.  I made it 100% clear that he cannot get it, just like you cannot catch eczema from another person.  Ohhh and lookie here\u2014 some new lube for us to try!!!\n\nYou have some great advice here, but definitely use the steroid cream and use lube during sex because it can be really uncomfortable without it.  Make it fun and change up the lube once in a while. :) Yes! I started using a menstrual cup about a year ago and I actually think it makes a huge difference. I always flare up around my period and I think that not having anything- pads, tampon strings etc around to rub helps a ton. I am a guy with LS but it should be similar.\n\nWhat I do to prevent itchyness, burning/chaffing sensation :\n\nEverything you will use must be fragrance-free, that means soap, laundry detergent, moisturizing creams, etc.\n\nWear 100% cotton underwear. Could also be a good idea to sleep without panties.\n\nEven if you use the steroid cream, nothing should stops you to also moisturize your affected area with moisturizing creams. My dermatologist told me I could even mix the steroid and the moisturizing cream together. I use a Vitamin-e enriched First aid cream. Good enough for burns then good enough for a bit of chaffing. I keep my penis moisturized 24h a day 7 days a week and it helped me tremendously over the last 2 years.\n\nGood luck.", "Solutions for Mild Phimosis arising from LS I, 55M, was diagnosed with LS about 18 months ago. I have been fortunate to the extent that the disease was identified very early and I have responded well to topical steroids and the disease is now in remission.\n\nNonetheless the disease has left me with mild phimosis which is causing me some issues. The phimosis itself is due to a very tightly defined scarred area, almost like a piece of wire or narrow finger ring, at the tip of the foreskin. The rest of the foreskin is entirely normal.\n\nI am advised by my dermatologist, who is very well regarded and published, that stretching of this scar tissue is unlikely to yield positive results and may make the situation worse.\n\nI find circumcision deeply challenging on aesthetic grounds, functional grounds - I am a mature gay man in the UK who has also lived for a considerable period of time in the US - and my strong views on infant circumcision. The surgery itself, discomfort, pain etc is not a driver of my position. Accordingly whilst I recognise that circumcision is the traditional remedy for penile LS and would also address the phimosis, I do not wish to pursue this option unless absolutely necessary, ie. unworkable phimosis or penile cancer.\n\nSo, I was wondering if any of your had either successfully resolved phimosis of this type by stretching or had undertaken surgery such as preputioplasty - a good urologist aware of my LS background has confirmed that this is possible - or limited dorsal split or surgery to remove the phimotic ring only, which fell short of circumcision, essentially leaving the foreskin intact but minimally foreshortened?\n\nI would also be interested if any of your contemplated non-circumcision surgery but were advised against due to the tendency of LS to reactivate at wound sites.\n\nAny comments and details of your own experiences would be much appreciated.\n\nMany thanks, Nick Hi Nick, I have no experience of LS but I have stretched my own foreskin and I am an older straight man aged 55. I got phimosis aged 50 and it is fixed such that I only have to do a maintenance stretch every 3 or 45 weeks. I am happy to share my experience of stretching tho I do not know what constraints LS would might put on it. PM me if you want to chat. Thanks for the kind offer but the key driver here is LS, and it is specific restrictions and risks arising, rather than stretching itself. Nonetheless I really appreciate you reaching out. \ud83d\udc4d Hi, can you describe the early symptoms you experienced? How was it diagnosed? Any photos you can share? Hi. I only became aware of this issue when my frenulum broke, bloodlessly and with very little pain. The tissue had become extremely thin. \n\nOn reflection, I realised that this had been going on for a number of years, coupled with very mild phimosis with no functional impact, but gradually not being able to retract completely as in my youth. I put it down to age. \n\nFollowing the frenulum break I had an immediate tightening of the foreskin which gradually released with time, 4months,  and stretching but resulted in a degree of waisting when pulled back flaccid.\n\nWhen I returned to being sexually active I found that the penile skin was very easily made red and a bit sore, some foreskin splitting at the tip, the glans became a deeper almost purple colour and other symptoms I would broadly described as dermatitis. \n\nI did not experience any white discolouration other than the connecting tissue of the frenulum.\n\nI took some pictures for the dermatologist but they are not in anyway helpful. Think dermatitis, some roughening and some dryness of the skin. \n\nDiagnosis was based on case history and examination. It is rare to do a biopsy for penile LS in the UK. I am told the penile biopsy results are rarely conclusive, more complicated in terms of healing and are a generally unnecessary expense. Thanks for your response! It is really hard to find information on male LS, so your experience is much appreciated. I am suffering from similar symptoms and am heading to the dermatologist soon. \n\nIs your foreskin itchy? Do you have any perianal/anal symptoms? Do you have any hard small bumps or lumps (white/red or skin coloured) on/underneath your foreskin? Can you feel a fibrotic ring around the end of your foreskin? \n\nRegarding your original post, I read a study a month ago that minor surgical procedures are becoming more common to manage tight foreksins in men with LS (preputioplasty). Traditionally these were avoided because it was thought they could make the LS worse, but now there is a growing recognition of the importance of keeping foreskin, so other options are being considered. My only issue is this mild but nonetheless very precisely defined band of phimotic tissue.  I never experienced any of the other symptoms you list. \n\nIf by any chance you happen to remember where you saw the article regarding LS and preputioplasty, I would very much appreciate the name or a link. \n\nAll the best for your appointment with the dermatologist.  Thank you very much. I have read this one. It is results are for boys 11 and under however I suspect it is still relevant for adults, although the disease may be more established. This is certainly one of the options I will be exploring at the beginning of next month with the urologist. Many thanks. Good luck. I saw another more informal article discussing options for adults, but I cannot find it. ~25, male, uk\n\n&gt; I would also be interested if any of your contemplated non-circumcision surgery but were advised against due to the tendency of LS to reactivate at wound sites.\n\nIn the relative early days of my diagnosis and treatment I did a lot of research and asked my GP about preputioplasty/dorsal split because that seemed like a nice middle-ground. But I was more or less told that it would not be of benefit to me, probably would not be covered on the NHS, &amp; it may not work anyway. Thank you very much for your input. It is much appreciated. \n\nI have been advised by one senior urologist, who I saw privately, that both of those options were possible for me. There is a risk c.20% in the case of the preputioplasty that it tightens as it heals and also the foreskin may continue to be negatively affected by LS.\n\n I am fortunate in that I am not restricted by the NHS offerings and can also travel - subject to Covid! - to find the right solution.\n\n Unfortunately I am reaching the conclusion that no solution other than a full circumcision or full length dorsal split will guarantee no further phimosis because of the complicating LS factor. \n\nI am seeing my final urologist surgeon on 4/11 and will update afterwards.  After about 4 months use of the steroids my experience is somewhat similar. The foreskin looks completely normal now (it had an extremely pronounced white band before which is totally gone). I responded well to the steroids. However, I still have very mild phimosis and this was not something I would ever had before. In my case there was some skin tearing prior to treatment so its possible it is due to scar tissue etc. All sounds very similar to my own experience. It feels somewhat ironic that we have been able to get the disease into remission but are left with phimosis which rather interferes with sexual activity.", "Newly diagnosed!! So happy. 38F I have had symptoms for 20 years. Spent at least $1 million on yeast infection creams and vagisil which burned the shards of glass in my vulva. Years of waking up from a dead sleep scratching myself raw. Sex only recently began hurting and fortunately I do not have much physical damage. \n\nFound this sub and started crying. Sure we all have absolutely terrible times sometimes but to know after all this time that what I am experiencing is valid and it is not that I am too sensitive and all these little tricks I have acquired over the years, that other people do them, too.  Definitely going to get that spray nozzle for the toilet. I have been using a giant cup for forever.\n\nThank you all for being here. I am psyched suffer along with you.", "Newly diagnosed BXO, help? My close relative has just been diagnosed. I have been on the hunt for information for hours, I feel like I am going in circles.\n\nI am looking for the best diet structure to meal prep in hopes that it can manage some of his symptoms. \n\nHas any particular diet helped you or a loved one with their BXO? Any supplements he should start a regiment of?\n\nThank you so much for your time!! An \"optimal\" diet is the kind of thing that tends to be different for different individuals.  Doing an elimination diet can be a very helpful way to figure out what kind of diet your body likes.  I did a lot of research on \"elimination diets\" and none of them personally seemed good to me until I considered trying a carnivore diet.  \n\nI had doctors suggest eating only oatmeal, or just lamb/chicken and rice, and all kinds of other things, but the carnivore diet was the only thing that eliminated basically all common allergens like grains, nightshades, etc. while still leaving me something I could enjoy eating and get good nourishment from.  What other single ingredient besides meat can our bodies survive on?\n\nIf you were to eat a carnivore or meat only diet for an extended period of time (more than the 1-3 months it would take to see a health improvement)  then you would basically need to be eating whole animals with organs and everything in order to get the diverse  range of nutrients your body would need to be healthy.  I felt pretty great consuming nothing but plain steaks (just filet mignon or ribeye with no salt or pepper or anything) and water for a few months while i was experimenting with my diet..  I dont do it anymore, but it was hepful to see how my body reacted.  \n\nAfter a month or two of getting your body used to a super restricted diet, the idea is to slowly add single ingredient food items into your diet, one at a time, so you can see how your body reacts to each one.\n\nAnother simple thing that lots of people here with LS have found to be helpful is keeping affected skin moisturized with coconut oil.  And also try to keep bodily fluids from staying in contact with skin as much as possible\n\nHope this info helps.  Feel free to keep asking questions. I would be glad to share more about my brief experience with eating the carnivore diet if you want. I will also say that while a diet may help reduce certain symptoms or reduce frequency and intensity of flares, it is very unlikely to eliminate the underlying cause of LS.   \n\nAlthough there is still no officially accepted cause of LS, there is a growing body of recent scientific research which suggests a link between LS and the Borrelia bacteria which causes Lyme disease. Oh my goodness thank you so much for your comments and information! He wanted to start a carnivore diet, but I also read that it can cause more inflammation in the body- there is so much back and forth in the Google hole I have gone down, it is so confusing. I absolutely would love to take you up on hearing more about your experience and what has helped or otherwise, and I greatly appreciate you sharing! I know every body it is different, but all insight/resources/websites/etc. is very welcomed. As far as diet goes, I experimented with that about a year or two prior to developing most of my LS symptoms and getting an LS diagnosis.   I have had idiopathic chronic pain and all kinds of other unexplained heath issues that I have been trying to figure out for a long time, and I did the dietary experiments to see how it would effect my heath overall and see what kind of improvement I could get. \n\nAfter a few weeks of doing the diet, the main thing I noticed was I began to experience a decrease in brain fog, as well as improvement in my mood, and energy levels.  These specific results that I got from the diet ended up having a beneficial effect on my pain levels and my day to day well being.  After a couple weeks of eating carnivore, I also felt like my stomach was happeir, my gut never felt bloated or inflammed after meals anymore, I stayed full from my meals longer  and I did not crave smacks as much.  My wife did the diet with me, even though she does not have chronic pain or anything, and she experienced the same overall benefits.  \n\nUnfortunately, the diet itself didnt directly impact my pain, or any of my other unexplained health issues.  It was however very helpful to see how strong the correlation is between my pain levels, and things like mood, energy level etc.  Being mindful of that helps me a lot with managing my pain.  Sticking with a strict diet didnt seem like it was worth it for the results I got, but it was a very helpful learning experience.   If I had discovered that I had a food allergy, then I would obviously have made long term changes to my diet .  \n\nI spent about 5 or 6 months experimenting with the carnivore diet.  I started out by doing a carnivore diet that was less restrictive.  I had milk, milk products (including things like budder, and cheese with salt, enzymes, and as few other ingredients as possible), eggs, salt, pepper and all kinds of meat.  A few weeks into that and I started feeling a bit better, so I continued a couple more weeks and then took a month long break to see if it was actually the diet causing the results.  \n\nIt did appear to be the diet, so the next time I tried a more restrictive diet without eggs for a month.  That went well, but self controll is really tough and I wanted to be extra sure it was the diet making me feel better so I took another break for about a month (the results werent that amazing, but there was some noticeable improvement).\n\nThe final round of my carnivore diet was the most restrictive.  I ate just plain unseasoned filet mignon steaks, ribeye steaks, and water.  After a few weeks of that I felt great, other than the fact that I had to pee and then drink water every 20 min because I was not consuming any salt.  By week 4 I stared feeling less great and after a couple more weeks of just steak and water it seemed like my body was running low on all the extra nutrients it had saved up and was ready for a more diverse diet again..  I wasnt down to eat entire animals with all the organs and everything like our ancestors did in order to get a healthy balanced diet, so I decided I had learned enough from my experiment and called it quits. Your body will be totally fine(or better than fine) with eating just meat for a while as you figure out what is going on with your body and see if you have any food allergies/sensitivities that did not show up on a test for some reason.  The idea with the elimination diet is to basically start as restrictive as you can, and then add things to your diet one at a time to see how your body reacts.  So you could eat steak and water for a few weeks and then add potatoes, then the week after that carrots.. or however you want to do it.  You can choose which things you want to add in first.   Or  you might end up realizing that your diet was not having as big of an impact on the things you were trying to treat.\n\nOnce I realized that my diet was not the cause of the main issues I was trying to fix, I decided not to bother with adding ingredients one at a time back into my diet.  I decided instead to bail on the restrictive diet and focus my energy on finding and treating the underlying cause of my problems.  \n\nLike I said before, diet may help a bit with LS BUT it almost definitely will not cure the underlying cause.  Based on the research I have read, I think there is a good chance that Lyme disease or Borreliosis will be determined to be the underlying cause of LS or at least recognized as a correlating factor before too long.  \n\nCurrently, LS is incurable, but topical steroid treatments can help relieve symptoms, slow down the progression of the disease, and reduce the small risk of associated genital cancers.  The possible side effects of steroids are not great, but the general consensus within the medical community is that the risk of leaving LS untreated outweighs the risks of side effects from the steroids.  That Is why they prescribe them.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  \n\nI am not trying to say you should not try the diet approach, but I would also highly recommend having your relative get in touch with a good genital dermatologist who can help them figure out the best treatment plan and decide if its appropriate to use topical steroids. That is all so incredibly helpful, thank you. I will definitely look more into the underlying causation as well. Thankfully, he is seeing a dermatologist who has prescribed steroids and is going to get another opinion as well, while also seeking a nutritionist. I had not even heard of LS before today and now I am just focused on being the best support I can be and trying to absorb all of the kinds of information out there. Thank you so much for sharing your experience and knowledge, not only with me, but just in general- LS seems to be one of those \u201cinvisible\u201d things that are so important but does not get enough attention. It is refreshing and comforting to be able to have this sort of dialogue and not feel alone! Even a lot of doctors arent too familiar with LS unfortunatey. Research into the disease seems to be moving somewhat slowly, but there does seem to be progress being made.\n\nThere are a good number of journal articles that describe experiments showing a strong correlation between LS and lyme disease/ Borrelia bacteria.  Its a bit tricky to research anything dealing with Lyme though because the Borrelia bacteria which cause Lyme are very difficult to detect with the methods that are currently being widely used\n\nOne journal article that I read about LS describes a novel diagnostic technique called focus floating microscopy (FFM for short). The authors of the article describe the limitations of the PCR tests that are currently widely used to detect Lyme disease, and then they explain how they overcame those limitations with the FFM technique they developed.  \n\nWith the use of FFM, these authors report being able to detect Borrelia spirochetes in 38 of the 60(63%) archived tissue samples from LS patients which they were analyzing.\u00a0 Unfortunately, they were only able to perform B. burgdorferi specific PCR tests on 11 of their 60 archived LS samples, due to a technical problem with the way the archived materials which they had gathered for the study had been stored..\u00a0 Additionally, 1 of these 11 cases did not have enough material for FFM after PCR.\u00a0 However, they found that none of their 11 LS specimens which they tested for Borreliosis via PCR came back positive, while 6 of 10 of those same LS samples was positive via FFM analysis.\n\nAn earlier study by the same authors found that when compared to standard PCR tests for detecting B. burgdorferi sensu lato in classic cutaneous Borreliosis cases, their FFM technique was not only far more sensitive (45% positive identification for PCR vs. 95% with FFM) but it also proved to be nearly equally specific (100% with PCR vs. 99% with FFM).\u00a0 These results strongly suggest that the PCR methods which are currently widely used to detect Borrelia have significant limitations.\n\nHere is the link to that study \n\n\n\nThere is also this other website I stumbled across that has all kinds of interesting info on Lyme treatments and diet and stuff.. If you want to dive all the way down the rabbit hole..  \n\n\nThis guy cites some things that are maybe not from the most credible scientific sources, but that is how things are with Lyme disease research.  There is lots of controversy around the subject of Lyme.  Always check the validity of anything you see/read.   Some stuff that seems like its from a source that isnt credible may be true, and stuff that seems like its from a credible source may not be true.  Even with peer reviewed literature.\n\nI havent tried any of this dude's protocol or anything, but reading through the info he has collected was absolutely fascinating. I still have not finished reading all the stuff in the sources he linked to yet but I am enjoying working on it.  He has a really impressive amount of scientific research gathered together. If I were you I would rather consider co2 laser therapy and circumcision. I have tried almost every diet, but nothing helped me. Thank you! Have you had any success with those treatments or others? Thank you so much for extensive information!! I am going to go ahead and hop down that rabbit hole now. Lol. It looks like I have a whole lot of research to do! I cannot thank you enough for the info and pointing me in a good direction. You are so awesome! No problem.  I wish there were more people here that were actually willing to read and talk about the scientific research involving LS.  I am always willing to keep the conversation going.  Good luck.", "How often to use clobetasol? I was diagnosed with Lichens like a month ago. My OBGYN suggested i use a pea-size bit of clobetasol 3 times a week. I noticed that everyone on here seems to use it like once or twice a day. Should i use it more often? Im currently doing once every other day. I have it pretty bad, lots of itching, literally impossible to have sex, sometimes I tear when going #2. I can even tear by opening my legs too wide. I dont want to risk fusing or anything but is 3x a week enough? Sorry you are having such a tough time. Sounds like a severe flare but it should settle down soon. Seems like my first time took over a month to feel better.  I recommend calling your OBGYN\u2019s office and speak to the nurse about it all. My doc said to use it once a day, every 4 days, but different for everyone. I have a spot on my labia, a large area on my groin, and from my perineum up my crack. Can be a problem with #2 also. The LS itch is unbearable and clob seems to stop that. Have you tried anything else for maintenance? Moisturizing is most important for me-I use coconut oil, V Magic, or Aquaphor. Cortisone ointment for anal itching (clob is too strong there). Soaking in the tub gives lots of relief and a good chance to slather on coconut oil. Sex works with lots of coconut oil. There are other comments here with tips, like no scented products, cotton underwear and such. Good luck it does suck. My specialist gave me a routine of:\n\n2x day for 2 weeks.\n1x day every other day for 2 weeks.\n2x a week for 2 weeks.\nFinally, 1x a week indefinitely.\n\nIf my symptoms flare, I go back to the beginning of the cycle. \n\nIn addition to the steroid, however, I will use an emollient (Epaderm specifically) every morning and evening. I also take Vitamin E, which appears to have helped. \n\nHope you get control of your LS soon! It is different for everyone. I did 2x a day for almost three months before the flair started to subside. Now I do once a day and I am starting to try skipping days. Good luck! Make sure to use a very small amount! 2-3 times a week is a maintenance regimen, not the regimen for treatment of a flare. \n\nI would go back and clarify or get a new doctor. It should most definitely be at least once a day for 3 months or until you find relief, whatever is first. Can I ask you why the clobetasol is too strong for the anal itching? Is that a personal scenario or in general the clobetasol should not be used there? Not sure-it is too strong for me but I think some are able to tolerate it.", "(Desperate for success stories). Anyone can go months without symptoms? It would be really reassuring to read that you can do that. Title says it yes but that is with continued use of Clobatisol and Estrace. It is unfortunate this disease never really goes away, but I can say with continued use (myself, once a week) of Clobetasol, the condition is in \u201cremission\u201d So you use it only once a week and you no longer have symptoms and that can go on for months? How often you use clob? Estrace? Tell me more. Yes, initially however I was using it three times a week. Remember YMMV and we are all different and with varying levels of the disease. Do not give up hope! Unmedicated. My whole pregnancy I was \ud83d\udcaf fine. I am at a point now where I forget I even have it. I use triamcinolone and after my initial intense course of use I continue to use it once a week (or sometimes twice a week before I get my period). I also use almond oil to keep the area moisturized between uses of the steroid. I apply it right after a shower and it has helped me a ton. The only time I really notice the LS is occasionally right before my period when it sometimes gets a little sore. But that is about it. And that only happens a couple times a year. \n\nA big thing that also helped was doing the AIP elimination diet and avoiding sugar. You eventually add food back in (it does take forever) but it was great for seeing which foods made my LS and my UCTD flare up. yes, I have had long spans of remission of 6 months and more, and that is without clob. managing stress was key for me. I also can go months forgetting I have it. I occasionally use clob for a few days in a row when I feel it starting up. At one point in my life it was pretty spread out, but now it is only in one small area. There is hope for all of you! It does get better! At least three to four times a week. Estrace is horomonal cream. it actually thickens the vaginal tissue. LS thins it. it helps me tremendously- I am in my 50s and past menopause- I do not know what the age parameters are for this treatment. Yep I rarely think about having it and it is been 7-8 years since I found out! I use clobetasol around twice a week to every 10 days normally and estrace at least a few x a week.", "New clitoral pain? I have had lichen symptoms (just itch) for about three or four months. I have been using clobetasol for three weeks which seems to minimize the symptoms but not entirely. My recent symptom is clitoral pain. Is this from the clobe that I apply on it or a symptom of ls? Did you call your doctor and do not put any on it. She said I could apply it on it so I started to. The pain has persisted for three days, about the same time I have been using it. However I had an orgasm three days ago sorry if that is tmi so maybe it is related to that? That is very possible that can happen and do not worry about it. Ive had that happen before I started putting betnovate on my clit as I was worried about atrophy etc, within 2 days my clit was so so painful I could hardly walk. Got better within a few days of not putting it on my clit I use clobe on my clit per OBGYn instructions and it has improved it I cannot tell if my pain is from the LS or the cream and I am scared to stop using it. It is a nightmare isnt it. When did the clit pain start and how long have you had the itching? You could always not put it on your clit for a few days, that isnt long enough to do any harm especially as you have been using it for a few weeks already. If it gets better then you know its that. Also, I cant see your original post at the moment are you using ointment or cream? Creams have lots more ingredients in that can cause reactions. If the pain started the same time as the cream on the clit, its the cream. An orgasm does not cause that.", "Is this LS ? I have been dealing with this rash for about 9 years now I have been dealing with this same rash for about 9 years I have tried every cream, every natural remedy nothing is working.

I am really losing hope.", "Pretty simple question about symptoms Hello all,\n\nSo as  I wait to see a specialist, I am trying to figure out if what I have is indeed LS.\n\nFirst off I am male, I am circumcised; I know there is less of a chance for a cut male to have this, but I suffered from phimosis as a child and got cut at age 5  - so health complications down there ARE a thing for me.\n\nI am really realizing that googling stuff is a waste of time. It is a pretty simple inquiry I have but cannot find the answer on Google:  \n\n\n1) Does urine irritate/ burn LS effected skin? whatever IS wrong with me, it is kind of a constant burning. Sometimes (thank god) there is no pain. sometimes it burns badly. But when urine passes over it, the urine increases the burn sensation/irritates it. Being absolutely meticulous about drying off after peeing has helped a bit.\n\n Yes I see white thin skin, but this part of my penis was also subject to a pretty heavy sex-injury which I never allowed to properly heal. So that leads to my 2nd question.\n\n2) From anyone's experience or knowledge, could LS possibly arise from a previous injury which damaged the genital skin? Autoimmune issues in my case are a distinct possibility as I drank constantly when this started. Only now am i (for once and for all) taking my health seriously.\n\nThanks! And to anyone who is suffering, just stay strong. That does sound like it could be LS, but I dont have a penis, so I do not know what that is like. What I do know is that moisture does irritate the affected skin and contributes to flares. I think trauma to the skin can have an influence, but no one ever seems to be able to say anything for sure. Like they THINK it is autoimmune related, but it does not seem like that has been officially decided.\n\nEdited to add: For example too, my LS worsened in an area where I had scar tissue from a tear from giving birth... Hmmm. First thank you for your reply :)\n\nAlthough our anatomy is different, \"my LS worsened in an area where I had scar tissue from a tear from giving birth...\" This kind of raises a few signals for me. Sex injury on penis skin = scar tissue. Anyway, I am going to start taking the possibility of this being LS a bit more seriously. I was scared of the possibility before, but at this point any correct diagnosis is a good one...\n\nGood luck :) even though I know very little about this condition, I want to contribute by saying I have seen some posts on here about dietary changes helping people. I am sure you know all about that but meh, there you go. I recently recommended to someone else here to try borax soaks. Here is some information about this therapy. (Not sure if there are any men in the thread.) \n\n\n\nAnd, yes, to me, your symptoms sound consistent with lichen sclerosus. Mine specifically came out after receiving 4 vaccinations for some extensive travel I was doing, which I think likely caused changes to my immune system, but I will say that my initial flare did happen in skin that had been previously injured. (Maybe something to do with the fact that this skin was already experiencing some inflammation, and the adjuvants in the vaccines reignited it, so to speak?) \n\nIf you would like a diagnosis, it will likely happen by punch biopsy. You would be looking for a dermatologist, as this is more a condition of the skin, not the genitalia. I would caution the first-line treatment of high-potency corticosteroid. While it initially reduces the inflammation, the rebound is horrific and caused so much trauma for me, mental and physical.\n\nI am a 40 yo female, diagnosed at 26 and I have had remarkable healing from a few things:\n\n- a strict grain-free, sugar-free, dairy-free diet. Lots of grass-fed gelatins, collagens, veg and fruits. \n- Manuka honey for any skin tearing\n- emu oil, Vitamin e oils as inflammation reducers\n- vitamin D supplementation\n- And recently, this borax treatment, which is shockingly returning the white skin to pink and unfusing my labia after years!\n\nGood luck! 36 year old male. \n\nYes, with LS you can experience burning and stinging while urinating. This usually occurs when you have a tear, or a blister. But could also be skin that is highly irritated (red looking instead of white) \n\nAs the other question. I do not know. I thi k that for me it was hereditary. My mother has this, my sister, my grandmother. I do not know of any other family members, but that is a lot for a disease that is as rare as this is, or as we believe it is. Thanks for the response man. You are a gentlemen. I will have to get a proper diagnosis but I am starting to accept the fact that this is/ could be, what I have. originally, the area got injured but maybe that exacerbated the onset of this. And indeed, whatever is going on there, when it is really sore it is red...but usually, yeah, white and thin-skinned. Good times.\n\nSpeaking of hereditary, I was living with my folks again a few years ago and my dad has all sorts of skin creams and the like *scratches chin*. I also share other health issues with him. Wow thanks for all the info and food for thought! I will definitely look into borax soaks/treatments.\n\nI found since this happened, i would go through bouts of very clean eating, and eating bone broth I made from scratch (I loved that) and during those times the irritation was almost non-existant. And thanks for adding more confidence to my \"My previous injury may have caused this\" theory. \n\nOne thing seems 100% clear now - I will ask to be referred to a dermatologist first before worrying about a urologist. Oh and do not worry, I will not use any corticosteroids. I was prescribed one when this first started happening, just a weak cream. I only used it for about 7,8 days. I could tell it was just making everything worse, so I stopped! I am a 72 yr old man and recently dianosed, about 8 months ago. My dermatologist seemed suprised that I didnt know what this was. I probably have had the adhesions pre puberty, and when GP's examined me they just didnt know what caused them, and would try to treat each tear as a single event. so I was sent to a urologist to discuss circumcision by the dermatologist. The input was that this was not recommended. keep on with dermatologist treatment and discuss stronger steroids.\nwell so far see some improvement with betamethasone cream. I have pain from new tear, and its been slow to grow skin. grey and white is reducing and patch of dark red where the skin was attached for years is finally turning more pink. I am interested in the Borax experiment and will follow that. Thankyou for all your input and frank discussions. It is good to know we are not alone.", "Pain! For a year now ive been struggling with bad pain especial during flair ups. Anyone have any suggestions? This past year has been crap Because of the pain! Always try natural ways to soothe along with your steroid ointment being used regularly!\n\nCoconut oil and emu oil daily made a massive difference. Also stopping hormonal birth control and limiting/eliminating dairy. I also recommend dilators daily and not just before sex (keeps you stretched since lichen likes the narrow vaginal openings). And reducing stress is easier said that done, but it does wonders. If you think your hair can turn white due to stress... works the same for lichen. There is hope I promise... you just have to find the right routine for you. All of that seems like so many steps daily to take but once you make them apart of your life, you cannot go back... it really improved things for me! I have no idea why, but chugging water has ALWAYS helped me. If I get a little dehydrated, my symptoms get bad and everything hurts so much worse. I mean like a full 32oz in one sitting. I constantly have to pee, but at least I feel better. Emu oil works amazing for flair ups. \n\nAlso, I do not know if anyone else has experienced this, but I used to get a lot of flair ups after an argument or something emotionally negative. Do you find this to be true in your case? Yes. I know mines triggered by stress and animal products but also the pain from showers is horrible. Im already washing with natural baby soap and i still cant stand getting in the shower. Coconut oil gives instant relief", "Does this sound like your LS diagnosis? This post may be a bit of a long one, but I am hoping someone could share their similar experience.\n\nI started having seasonal vulva itching about 4 years ago. It usually went away after the summer months. I moved to SFlorida, and it started up and never stopped. My symptom is when I wipe, or otherwise touch my urethra or the lower part of my vulva, I get intensely itchy. I scratch, it swells, and then it does not bother me for a day or two. This has been going on for a year straight.\n\nI saw my regular GYN in August, who suspected an external/season yeast infection. Treated with twice daily clotrimazole and betamethasone cream and after the treatment I was fine for about two weeks. I live about 4 hours from that GYN and was working on my masters degree, so I had not been able to go back up. \n\nI then brought it up to my dermatologist, who, while not really being able to do anything, wrote me a script for one dose of an antifungal. That did not do anything. She told me I will likely need a biopsy or culture.\n\nNow during this time, there has never been any discharge outside of a very watery one when it gets itchy. No white, no burning, no pain with sex. Just looks like my regular vulva. \n\nI scheduled an appt with a local women\u2019s health clinic and saw the ARNP. She said it looked normal, but because I have issues with dermatitis, she thinks it might be lichen sclerosus and told me it was fairly common. She said she was not sure, but she is going to try treating for it anyway and if that does not work, we will do a biopsy. She told me to Google the symptoms and maybe I would be surprised at how many match up with me and then wrote me a script for clobetasol cream. \n\nWhen I googled the symptoms, I really only have one: pruritus. The cream alleviates the itching, but so did the betamethasone, so I am wondering if it is just the fact that it is a steroid? \n\nAnyway, I am 25 and I am wondering, has anyone else gone through a similar journey? Does this sound like anyone else\u2019s experience with LS? I have plans to contact my regular GYN and see what she thinks. I have LS and am on betamethasone cream. It is a steroid simular to clobetasol. It works for me.\nI am male and have different issues but since two creams are simular I think that the betamethasone helped when you had it.\nThis is an autoimmune disease and from this forum I have seen comments about it running in families and people that have other autoimmune problems.\nI am type 2 diabetic,  which I just learnt is an autoimmune disorder.\nGood luck, dont panic, read other posts on here. I have heard of a person who had itching and irritation and not much else, and did not get diagnosed until a tiny white patch was finally found. So I think it is possible to have LS and not have any other symptoms or signs besides itching. Still, it is not a lot of evidence, and I think you are smart to see your regular gyn and try to rule out the many other causes of itching.", "Possible LS with psoriasis and no insurance I (23f) have severe psoriasis that effects my whole body including my genital area. The last few months I have had some painful symptoms, glass feeling skin and some swelling. I tried an over the counter yeast infection treatment to no avail. \n\nI have had it in the back of my mind that I may have LS for a couple years, but have read about how it is hard to diagnose. Today I went to planned parenthood, my first time at this location as I recently moved. I was told that my vagina is healthy, it is all the surrounding areas that have the issue. She says that it looks like LS. After hearing all these horror stories of being misdiagnosed and doctors just not being familiar with the condition, I was shocked that she said it so quickly without me bringing it up. \n\nShe said that she first is going to treat me for a yeast infection of the skin. Then in a month I come back and from there we will see if I still have symptoms and will start a steroid cream. \n\nMy question is, if this is LS can it cause bumps? I have some small bumps near my perineum/ closer to my anus. She did not seem to concerned with them and thought they may have to do with the friction from swelling. The bumps them self do not hurt, just the swelling. \n\nMy other question is is this manageable without insurance? I just paid $200 for this visit not including the medicine, and I go back in a month. Will I have to go back often after that? Do the steroid creams work or am I going to have to have a few visits to see what works for me? \n\nI would have insurance if I could, I do not qualify for state insurance and for the dermatology I need im looking at $400-500 a month. I am just not in a place to get that currently. I am honestly not in a place to do much right now because this whole ordeal is really taking a toll on my mental health. I have a lovely long term boyfriend that has been so incredibly patient with me but I do not know how much longer I can make him deal with no sex. It is not fair to him. I wake up every morning with my sheets bloody because of my psoriasis.  The shots I need for the psoriasis are very much out of my reach. Between these 2 issues Im just at a loss of what to do. Sorry for complaining I think I am just a bit overwhelmed. Does your state offer Medicaid? Yes but I do not qualify And your employer does not offer insurance either? :/ They do, but not a very good one and it does not cover dermatology at all. Surely it covers gynecology though? Maybe you could go that route? Sigh. That sucks. I am sorry You are right. I should look into it again now that I have more info. Somethings better then nothing. Do you live in Ohio? Long shot but if ya do I could send you some recommendations  No I am in the pnw. Thank you though First of all, I am sorry you are going through that. I have psoriasis too, although it is mild. I heard LS is more common in people with P. My dad has P and PsA and has done great on a biologic, but the out of pocket cost for it would be astronomical. If there is *any* way you can get on a health insurance that will pay for a biologic, I would recommend trying. Do you have parents with health insurance? If so, you could likely go on theirs since you are under 25. Also, Biden is opening the ACA insurance exchanges for an extra three months, partly due to covid impact, which would give you a chance to enroll in a new plan without a qualifying event. Does your boyfriend have insurance? Sometimes you can get on a partner's insurance if you have evidence of a long term relationship.\n\nI do not really know of LS causing bumps, although the friction thing makes sense to me. There are lots of harmless causes of bumps, so if she was not worried about them, that is reassuring. \n\nSuper-potent steroids work in about 70-90% of people. If they do not work for you, maybe you could call and ask to be switched without having to get an appointment? The usual second-line treatment, tacrolimus/pimecrolimus, is even safer than clobetasol so *maybe* they would write it for you over the phone. But they probably will want to see your progress regardless. I was told to come back in a month after starting treatment.\n\nI got my first clobetasol prescription this week. The bag said it was $223 retail for the 14-day supply. I am very lucky my co-pay was only $5. The good thing is that after a few months, you should need it only a few times per week instead of twice per day, so you will go through it much slower. I think betamethasone is also a popular one that may be cheaper. I do not know how its effectiveness compares to clobetasol. I might be able to find out.\n\nI wish you the best. Sending you good thoughts from the East Coast :) Thank you for all the info and help! I did have health insurance under aca in the last state that I lived in, it did not cover the state I moved to unfortunately. I had humira at that time, and the psoriasis came back strong within 3 months of not taking an injection. If aca opens back up I will for sure see if I qualify. Those shots were $1200 each but $5 with my insurance. \n\nMy mom is unemployed with no insurance, and my boyfriend was a bartender/server so he actually currently does not have a job or insurance either. At planned parenthood I do qualify for the sliding scale so I get 25% off at least! I hope you can find a suitable plan. It sounds like you really need these meds. Supposedly the government is trying to bring down the cost of the premiums as well.\n\nI wanted to update you because I said the clob I got was a 14 day supply. I have used it for a week now and I think I have only used up a quarter, so that may have been quite an underestimate of how long it lasts, even with twice daily application.", "New Diagnosis - Scarring (Male) Hello all.\n\nI am in my lower 30s, male, circumcised from birth. I was diagnosed from a biopsy taken from a white patch on my shoulder. I am 5 days into the usage of clob ointment. I was also prescribed tacrolimus to switch to after one month. I do not have white spots on my penis, but I do have scarring.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had experienced scarring spreading whilst applying clob cream. The past month has been a period of immense stress and my scarring seems to be spreading with some rapidity. I believe it is on my meatus and I am concerned it is moved into my urethra as well. I have had some fusion of foreskin to my glans, centered around my meatus but predominantly to one side of it. (My circumcision makes this situation possible)\n\nNeedless to say, this diagnosis has terrified me. I am at the outset of a new-ish relationship which I believe could be my final one and I worry it will slip away with increasing lack of sexual function. And of course, like any reasonable person, I wish to avoid pain, discomfort, and surgeries to the best of my ability.\n\nI have learned a great deal from searching through this subreddit and have adapted to a regimen with emollient soaps and creams, drying after urination, etc. But, will scarring continue to spread, or should I give it til 2 weeks or more of usage? Cannot ask my dermatologist for another 2 weeks.\n\nThanks and well-wishes.", "I am not flexible enough for this condition? I hope this question is not too invasive, but...Is there a way to apply the medication to certain areas and see where you are applying/where it needs to be applied without becoming a contortionist? I was just diagnosed and started treatment in January of this year so I am brand new and trying to get it under control. I am checking for new spots every day. My doctor said I needed to be as precise with the clob application as possible, and it is easy (with the help of a hand mirror) up to a certain point, if you know what I mean. Lol Please help? I have never looked to apply and I am on the bigger side. Just feel / do my best by touch. I never look. I do an occasional exam to check out any new areas and to see what the previously affected areas look like, but in my experience the steroid gets smeared around afterward when you walk or move anyway, so it ends up on unaffected skin to some degree no matter what you do or how precise you are with application. I am not precise, my doc told me to load it up everywhere! Q tips are useful. Also, I focus where it itches Good point! I was told to apply to whole area including surrounding tissue. I am male but I dont see it makes much difference as it gets everywhere anyway. I do not have any itching, only \"bleaching\" and some discomfort when I am sitting. But I do know which areas are affected because I have spent so much time looking at them! Lol \nSo Q-tips are useful in what way? If you want be able to access your entire effected area or inspect it- sitting on the toilet works really well. just hold a hand mirror between your legs and you can see everything That is what I do, but it still is a bit of a struggle to hold the mirror while medicating. Looks like that is the best option if I need to be precise. I just figured there had to be an easier way. Lol Gives you a little further reach if you are bending over and looking in a mirror, especially if it is near your anus. You can also put it on all the sides on one end of the qtip and cover two areas facing different directions, or try a twirling motion I do not bend easily but what I did was buy a circular mirror (ones that stand on its own with a magnifying side) and air my ass on my bed with that mirror on its side and have my flashlight on and spread the clob. Not sure if that makes sense but let me know! \n\nWas told by my dermatologist to avoid the areas with hair because it can thin the skin. Hence why I used the mirror", "How do I clean?

It could be the clobetasol is making it worse, regardless of whether or not it is flare related so checking to see what your doctor recommends is a good idea. Some follow up questions. So you were on maintenance prior to this and I assume you were in remission. Then you tore, and now you have a fissure and a sore. Every since that, you have been using the clob on the area 2x daily? Is it an ointment form? Are you using anything else down there? And finally, you said you are not getting better, but is it getting worse.

About a month and a half ago me and my girlfriend got intimate and blood blister formed under skin of penis on the top of head where skin is white. Anyway the blood is still there but comes and goes. Sometimes there is just a trace and looks like it is almost healed, then I fall asleep for the night and it comes right back with more blood. I was wondering if the ls affects the healing process  of this spot and will eventually go away or is it another underlining problem?  Thanks you I can only say I have had a crack that had a little blood and it completely recessed with les masturbation...", "21M LS experience Hey 21M here, hoping you all are doing alright. I am an overall healthy person since my diet is whole-food plant based and do exercise regularly. When I was very little I got part of my foreskin removed because of phimosis. Back to april 2019 started having little red spots and some whitening in my glans and foreskin. Went to a urologist and it started off as a yeast infection diagnosis, tried various treatments for a couple of months unsuccessfully. In August I started taking tetraconazole and my penis remained normal for two months until it got back to how it was originally. Saw a dermatologist and diagnosed me with LS by just looking at it, \"the foreskin becomes somewhat a ring that tightens progressively making it hard to roll back, and causing it to strain the glans\". I tried with two different steroid creams: Betamethasone and hydrocortisone 1% -I suggested her to prescribe me Clobetasol but she said it was for more severe cases, that it would rather redden my skin-. However, she sent me to a second consultation with a different urologist just to be certain there is not any successful treatment I am missing, plus that I should go get my foreskin removed. The second urologist that examined me was only sure I should get the foreskin removed, but that it was not that serious, that I should get other perspectives on it. Never been able to reach good results with those two creams, got all the pre-OP of the circumcision done but then a global pandemic happened. Lost all contact with my dermatologist and sticked to the hydrocortisone 1% to at least keep it at bay. This was in March 2020. I got all busy with uni stuff and kind of forgot about it, since I did not experience much discomfort at masturbating (only extra dryness and kind of decrease of sensation) plus I am not a heavy wanker either. Update on the symptoms: my foreskin has thickened, the tip including the meatus area and the foreskin are milder red and get wrinkles on the glans during the day if I do not apply the steroid cream. Also the tip hurts when I wash it with soap, even the traditional one. I strongly recommend getting the Veritas glycerin no fragrance one, helps tons with the washing pain. But I did have trouble at my one time sex experience with this issue: My penis became numb moments into intercourse, also had trouble reaching the orgasm, since I felt almost nothing when I stroked it. I never lost my erection though. In late july I contacted my initial urologist and got sent to get part of the pre-OP done. On wednesday I will be given a date to get the circumcision done. The one thing I am scared of is this awful condition coming back someday in the future, as I read it even happened to some guys who got circumcised. \n\nHope I am still attacking it at an early stage. Just wanted to put this out there and make my story available for any guy who might resonate with this and struggles with the same issue. Im 35F currently still undiagnosed but I think it good for people to talk about their experiences and raise awareness. Thank you for sharing and I hope you find relief. You are welcome, sorry for making the whole thing so lengthy. I thought people who are looking for similar experiences need as much detail as possible. Best wishes for you too. I was sent to a urologist by my dermatologist for circumcision,  but the urologist said it was not recommended in my case. \nI have thick scaring on underside of glans, and bad adhesions thst are slowly resolving, if painfully. \nbefore you get cut please seek a second opinion. I have read articles that say only circumcised at birth do not get this. But I made contact with one man that was circumcised at birth that had LS. circumcision is not a cure. \ngood luck. PS I am 72 yrs old and probably had this pre teen, just not diagnosed till recently. problems with adhesions since 13. Maybe there is a chance you could not heal completely since you got diagnosed too lately? I was diagnosed early this year, so probably it is not too late for me. Besides, my urologist said in medicine nothing is 100% certain, but that my penis will definitely improve, as well as my sexual life. Unlike cancer or eczema, early detection does not seem to have any bearing on gentle LS. The glans are too small to ring-fence, like you would if you have eczema on your leg for example. And unlike cancer, no one has any clue what ever what is going on so they cannot waylay the process. yeah, seems pretty much like you said, but what if I told you that my doctor says the circumcision will make the glans adapt to being unveiled all the time and in this process become less susceptible to infections such as hiv, and it will be cleaner, and since some people recommend keeping the area super dry when not circumcised? I need to make it make sense cause I really want to believe in its improving. Will I still be able to diminish the amount of sensibility lost and maybe it becomes more comfortable in my everyday life since my foreskin will not be sticked to the glans, maybe when I penetrate my partner it will feel a little better? It is well documented you will lose sensitivity. also circumcised men 10% have problems with ejectulation compared to 1% who are not circumcised during PIV sex\n\nThe only issue I have had is fungal infection when taking antibiotics apart from this LS. But I have already lost a lot of sensibility due to the infected LS foreskin, were you circumcised? no. the steroid cream thins the scar tissue and helps un stick the adhesions. Mine is looking a lot better. go to doc in a out a week, will see whst she thinks. Steroid creams helped in the beginning, but my foreskin is just too tight, mine always has been. which one do you use? I had tight fore skin as a reult of fungal infection. for some reason much worse than before. within a week with steroid cream it was much better ie normal for me. \nI was given  Betamethasone Dipropionate ointment 0.05% Also my nephew had a procedure in Netherlands for this, brother said it looked like a castle. from what i gathered a series of cuts allowed it to stretch and then fill in the wounds. \nApparently this resolved the problem. \nAsk about other solutions, do not be in a hurry to get circumcised! well in the beginning I was also prescribed betamethasone, not quite sure if it was propionate, but it did not work at all for me, my dermatologist said it could not be a fungal infection, that it was definitely a lichen. circumcision as an adult is risky as some people do not experience a reduction in sensitivity. It is true that young people (under 5) do, as their bodies are still modelling reality. but adults can be in constant irritation. what is this statement based on? Hey I was prescribed hydrocortisone and I believe it has made the area of my shaft that I applied it to a bit numb and has affected my sexual life. Very frustrating. in my case I applied it for months because I could not go to the derm, and it irritated my skin. Sex felt numb. Good luck with other treatments. Did the numbness ever get better? Did the numbness ever get better? the numbness presented the one time I had sex with this condition. Too soon to tell if it is gone cause I did not try again. Now I am recovering from a circumcision and everything points out things are getting better down there. Ok thanks. I started taking the cream in 2018 and once more in 2019. my sex life has been off and on since then. I have not taken it in over a year. Good luck on your treatment. Keep me posted! maybe try another corticosteroid treatment? Yes, I will keep you posted, you too! I do not have problems with the rash which is originally why I was prescribed cortisone. Have not had a flare up in over a year. I am never taking it again. But I just feel like the effects of when I took it have not worn off but is your sex life ok now? you are lucky if it worked, it did not for me. So I really have not had sex over the past year. My sex life was 50/50 and I met a girl that I really liked and my dick let me down and she ended up leaving me alone and it had me really down. So I have kind of been reframing from sex the past year just to kind of avoid depression. Oh that is sad to hear. I had a similar experience, back then. Have you considered circumcision? It is all good man. It is life. Just rolling with punches and being optimistic as possible. I am already circumcised. Had it done at birth. that is a bit shocking to hear, it generally flares up in urcircumcised guys, do not ever give up, keep trying. Thanks man I appreciate it. have not had insertive sex yet, but I bet it feels much better now since masturbation does. Hope this helps.", "Afraid To Taper The gynecologist wants me to start tapering the steroid. The inflammation is not totally down. The skin in some areas is still pretty inflamed (especially on my butt)... still cracking... still bleeding (though very little albeit).\n\nI know steroids have risks... I really do. I have discussed that concern with both a dermatologist and a rheumatologist in the past, though more concerning systemic absorption and the risk to my adrenals.\n\nThe gynecologist says I absolutely have to taper or it will thin the skin, but the disease causes *scar tissue* and thins the skin *anyways* and if it is still fissuring (I have a pretty decent one at least 1cm on my butt as we speak)... the disease is still pretty active!\n\nI personally feel like I should still be applying it to the worst of the areas and tapering down on the areas that are not inflamed anymore. How is it going to get better if I do not get the inflammation to stop?\n\nI have done maybe too much reading, watched some lectures on the disease... and is not skin thinning oddly not an issue with LS? It seems like LS specialists generally agree about this.\n\nI am tempted to ask the dermatologist concerning this... but I am pretty sure this is me being an obnoxious patient... always wanting to know everything and frankly steering my treatment has not always been great but I feel like being educated about my health issues is important... maybe for specifically this reason?\n\nAnd I just do not know what I should do. I did not apply last night and things are a bit sore today. I think...

Figured someone here might get a laugh from it\n\nSo I sometimes get it on my butthole and will have to apply ointment there. It does not itch but I get fissures and it can get pretty painful. Anyway, I decided to put some steroid gel on it to help clear it up and get through the day best as I can. My typical routine is laying down on my back, spreading my legs and putting a mirror between them so I get a good view of it all LOL. This time, I noticed it looks like I have two buttholes!

Again, I have not started yet.\n\nIs there a chance I could make things even worse using such a potent ointment? And also, she said the goal of doing this is to get my original colour back to that patch, is this really realistic or not? I also have zero symptoms even to this day, just the colour.\n\nThank you Put it this way, if you DONT start treatment or use anything that could potentially heal it, it will look worse anyway in the long run. I feel the same, I have steroid anxiety from where I have had to use it for my eczema. Do not worry, the more you use it the more you get used to it. It will be okay friend The good news is recent studies show that penile cancer risk reduces to normal with steroid treatment .\nIt is on here with publication references.\nI have been on treatment plan for nearly 2 yrs. Betamethasone ointment augmented. \nConsidering I suspect I have had this for 40 or 50 yrs good results so far. There are lots of people on here read some posts ! \nGood luck ! Is it possible to repigment the affected areas with the steroid treatment? It depends on what you mean. I had thick white scar tissue on underside of glans. This has gone as has the frenulum and I have nice pink skin there. It took 18 months.\nI had a white circle on the glans and this has faded. But it is still visible a a circular depression but it is not white it is pink. I do not know if your issue is same as mine. \nThe steroid ointment with make the skin shed the top layers of skin hence the thining concern. This allows new growth. \nLichen Sclerosus means white scaring.\nI hope you do not have adhesions I would not wish that on anyone!  THIS. I am a woman with LS and I have done lots of research on the disease. I cannot stress the importance of steroid ointment enough. Keep in mind, your LS skin down there is not normal skin, so it is safe for long time steroid use. I was instructed to use it Monday &amp; Thursday every week forever to reduce flare ups and cancer risks. It also helps make the skin nice and healthy. You got to rub the ointment in and it helps to apply after a bath. If you cannot bathe that is okay, you can just apply a damp washcloth over the area for 15-20 min and then pat dry. You just want the skin to be softened to absorb the medicine. Dr. Krapf and Dr. Goldstein are the leading specialists in LS and their research shows positive results with this method. is it just discoloration? if it is just discoloration it might be just pigmentation how did they diagnose LS based on what?? because i have like white discoloration on glans and i went to almost 10 dermatologists and no one diagnosed it as LS the most of them told me it is from blood flow. It is literally just a slight discolouration. I am dubious over the diagnosis, as all 5 other doctors I have seen disagree with an LS diagnosis. It has gotten slightly better over time without any treatment at all. I am very ensure what to do. it is from 15 months if it is LS it developes faster and you should see that the atrophy of the patch should change, your case is similar to mine. now i stopped all treatments after I used everything possible and it is still the same from 1 year. Maybe all we have is a pigment issue? I am really not sure anymore. I have had so many different opinions from doctors I do not know who is right or wrong anymore. me too it is so confusing but after doing many researches and asking a lot of doctors i have conclusion that if the skin atrophy didnt change then it is not LS and it is just a pigmentation The only additional comment I would add is I wash with hypoallergenic soap and dry before putting on ointment. \nOnly issue I have had is if the glans gets dry it stuck to foreskin and when retracted removed a piece of skin from glans and bled badly. Dermatologist recommended water based lube to prevent this but my glans skin did not like this and whole thing went white. Vaseline however worked well.  This was on second or third day typically. The new augmented ointment reduced the problem it stays around longer.", "Does this look like LS? Hi, \n\n21F here. I am uninsured currently but I have been having what feels like itchy burning cuts around my clitoral area since having a baby six months ago. I also have vitiligo and some other autoimmune disorders.  Wondering if this is worth trying to figure out a way to get checked out or not. TIA. \n\n Itchy, burning, cuts definitely sound like LS. Is the whiteness flat or more scaly? The white patch at the bottom looks almost flakey but it is hard to tell via picture.\n\nIf you have had symptoms for a while try and make an appointment with your Gyn/dermatologist. The sooner you can start treatments the sooner you stop the progression and symptoms :) It looks and sounds like LS, but obviously you would need to be evaluated by a doctor. Do you have access to a planned parenthood or other free/sliding scale clinics? They may be able to help. In the meantime you may find some relief by using something like aquaphor as a barrier (especially before peeing) or v magic as a moisturizer. Borax soaks (check laundry aisle) (start with 1tbsp and build up; I use about a cup)  can be really soothing as well. Baking soda is also a good choice. OTC hydrocortisone ointment may be of help until you can get a prescription for a stronger steroid. So sorry you are suffering. Hugs \ud83e\udd17 It is flat but it is almost as if the top whitish layer was eaten away to expose a more raw layer underneath! I do not have flakes or anything that I notice but it does seem as if the top layer is kind of missing some spots. It is been going on for 6 months now so as soon as I can get insurance sorted I am definitely going to get it checked out. It helps to have the validation. It feels like a million little paper cuts. Thank you! Planned parenthood is a good idea, I did not know that they handle this type of stuff. It seemed like a lot of people had issues getting diagnosed by their physicians so I did not know if a planned parenthood would be a good choice. I appreciate it. Yesss, I know the million little paper cuts feeling... until you can get seen just keep the area moisturized. I use an Aquaphor ointment and it helps relieve some of the itchiness/dryness. Hopefully it all works out. Good luck :) I have heard of a few people on the fb group being diagnosed there, but you could call and ask about your options, and specifically mention LS. They may also be able to connect you to another place to get better help. I hope you find an option that works for you!", "Just wanted to share my biopsy experience  Hi everyone,\n\nJust wanted to share my honest experience for anyone wondering about a biopsy.\n\nMy suspected LS is located in a small patch around my clitoris. Because of how sensitive the area is, my gyno told me she was going to give me more local anesthetic than usual. \n\n\nShe doused me in antiseptic and injected me three times. The first two times sucked, because she was basically injecting it what felt like right into my clitoris. It was a sharp take-your-breath-away kind of pain. My legs tensed and I let out a few ugly noises but it did not last long. I would probably rather do this than a colposcopy biopsy again. \n\n\nAfter that I could not feel a thing, I did not even know she had done the biopsy until she showed me. She used a very small punch on me (2mm) because of how small and sensitive the area is. \nI bled a little bit but she applied pressure for a few minutes and the bleeding stopped, then applied some silver nitrate. \nMy entire vulva was numb for about 2 hours. \n\n\nIt is worn off now and the area stings a bit and just feels tender and hot. I am in discomfort, but I am fine. The needles sucked the most, I think maybe moreso in my experience because of how close it was to my clitoris.\n\n\nThe best advice I can give is to find a good doctor, whether it is your derm or gyno. My gyno is absolutely lovely and explained the entire process and she was incredibly kind and understand when I did not want to go ahead with it a few weeks ago. \nHaving a good doctor makes the experience alright!\n\nAlso, get yourself some period undies and wear them to your appointment! They are so much more comfy than pads.\n\nETA: Tips - Get yourself some urine alkalizer and peri bottles. I also was not prepared for swelling afterwards, gyno says it is all good.\n\nGood luck, you got this! Thank you, how close exactly was it to your clitoris if you do not mind me asking? Do not mind at all! Do you mean the needle or biopsy? \nI have not looked yet, but the biopsy site would be millimeters away from my clitoris because of how small an area it is, it is around the clitoris and then in the creases where the clitoral hood meets the labia, she explained that she was going to take the biopsy from those little creases.\nShe explained that she would never ever take a biopsy from a clitoris because its function is so important and it is so sensitive! Thank you so much. My anatomy is a little weird, I do not have much of a hood, very minimal tissue and it does not cover my clit but all of my problems are on my clitoris (at the top) and to the sides. I see a specialist next week and every doctor I have seen so far, about 10 of them, told me they were unwilling to biopsy anywhere near my clitoris and I understand why, but I want an answer so bad so I was wondering if it would be a possibility. \n\nWhat kind of symptoms did you have near your clitoris? Best of luck in healing and getting answers\ud83d\udc95 For sure, I understand that too. I hope your specialist is willing to advocate for you because you do deserve a diagnosis, I am an example of it being absolutely possible!\nI am sorry you have had to go through so many doctors. \n\nAll around my clitoris (just a bit smaller than a penny sized area) is white. Some of the skin has hardened and it gets very itchy and sore sometimes. Sometimes it splits and I will have little purple/red spots or scabs. \n\n\nAll the best to you too, you are not alone and I totally understand how frustrating this condition can be, especially if you do not feel heard by medical professionals. Thank you. I have lightening of the skin (not full on white but a lot of color change), the constant splitting of the skin and I get the purple spots too! I have never read someone else having that before. It is actually just one and it is really tiny, idk what it is but it is there haha \n\nThank you again and I hope you heal quickly from the biopsy! \u2764\ufe0f There you go! Sounds like we have a really similar experience.\nAll the best to you :) Thanks so much for this! I have my biopsy on Monday and am freaking out xD for me it is also mainly around the clitoris and I get cuts around there too. Good luck! Tip: get yourself some urine alkalizer, it can be a bit stingy to pee. My gyno told me to try to lie down for the first 12-24 hours after as that will prevent swelling (due to where it is in the body).\n\nMy biopsy was not bad at all (about 0.5cm below the clit), getting a IUD is way worse. I had four stitches that dissolved within two weeks and barely any bleeding afterwards.\n\nAll the best for Monday! Thank you! I am now almost 2 weeks post biopsy and the swelling and bruising has almost gone. I had the stitches out last week but it is still not fully healed and have a follow up appointment next week. Fingers crossed it all heals soon! Luckily it does not hurt too much, just very uncomfortable.", "Vaginal specialist? I asked my OBGYN if I should see a dermatologist and he told me to see a vaginal/vulva specialist, which is a type of OBGYN, but only if I do not respond to the Triamcinolone. Clob (I think) is too strong for me. Anyone been to one of these doctors? Yes I see a vulva OBGYN specialist for my LS. I have been have problems that are becoming more complex. Yes. Honestly, they will not do much more for you than prescribe clob and if that does not work they will try another steroid and in some cases if no steroids are working, they will try protopic ointment. \n\nFinding one of these specialists was very key for me because none of the regular gyns I was seeing had a clue about LS or how to treat it. My vulvar specialist was able to to diagnose me and help me control my symptoms. She just knew the bare minimum about this disease. It seems that your gyn already knows about LS and has you on treatment. Unless you have any doubts about the diagnosis or treatment, I would begin it immediately to find relief. I would also join some support groups on FB, they have lots of great tips on products and borax to help you see results sooner. I think your GYN is correct in saying that you will be fine under her care unless your case becomes more complicated. Good luck \u2764\ufe0f I tried to join the main LS group on Facebook but I have not been added yet. Is there a way you can add me? I can give you my fb name. Private message me on here if you can. Thanks.", "Coyle Institute - Lichen Schlerosus(LS) - TULIP\u2122 Treatment Has anyone looked into or received treatment (TULIP\u2122 Treatment) for Lichen Schlerosus at Coyle Institute? It is not covered by insurance per what I heard on their voicemail, but im trying to figure out if it is BS or actually works.  The founder seems to have a lot of videos on YouTube, but I do not know how creditable his research is as its not covered by insurance. Also, the treatment seems to be directed towards women, so I dont know if it alway works on males as well. If anyone has any other information, that would be greatly appreciated. \n\n( It definitely sounds \"too good to be true.\" \n\n&gt;Patients have reported 100 percent recovery from all lichen sclerosus symptoms following a single procedure.\n\nHow many patients? What percent of patients? Probably not all of them, or they would have said \"all our patients...\" \n\nThe after pictures do not look 'cured' to me.\n\nAnd if it works so well, why is not it mentioned in LS treatment guidelines?\n\nI find it very concerning that even their description of LS itself is inaccurate.\n\n&gt;Lichen sclerosus is a painful skin condition that affects millions of women each year. Until now, the only course of treatment has been to manage the disease and attempt healing with topical steroids. It was a slow, uncertain road to recovery with unpleasant side effects.\n\nLS is not necessarily painful, although it can be. And steroids definitely are not the only course of treatment. Tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, retinoids... hello? And steroids work well for about 90% of women, without major adverse effects. The results can be even better for men.  \n\nIn this TULIP \"therapy\" they *laser off* the affected tissue. If LS is an autoimmune disease, as is widely suspected, I have no idea how that could lead to a lasting recovery. It also sounds like it could be really harmful, both by removing precious tissue and causing pro-inflammatory wounds.\n\nI would not consider this treatment unless steroids *and* tacrolimus/pimecrolimus had failed or were seriously contraindicated, and even then I would do a lot of research and be very leery. Addendum- \n\nthere are some actual studies on laser therapy that seem promising. I will read up on it some more. \n\nI wonder if you could get laser therapy closer to home or covered by your insurance?\n\n( This is great to know. I am so intrigued by these lichenoid conditions. I suffer from Lichen Nitidus/Planus down there. That is how I got to learn about Lichen Sclerosis. It is great to know that LS is extremely manageable if treated correctly with ointments. Thanks for the useful insight. Looked at the pics of before and after and I agree, it does not look cured at all to me To my knowledge there is no cure for the  condition.  I have look  bf has looked s d doc has told me.\n\nThe doc also mention something about possible cancer down there I have had three treatments of laser therapy ( it certainly was not a cure. It reduced some symptoms and gave me some relief but it was not lasting. It made penetration less painful- for a while. I would probably do it again if it were more affordable. The NIH is DC was doing ( but I am sure they are probably suspended right now. The Mona Lisa is a different type of laser treatment and only goes to 200 microns.  What is used in the Tulip can go at least 800 microns.  I just had the Tulip procedure done.  When he biopsied my worst area mine was at 500 microns so if I had the Mona Lisa, it would not have worked.  He said he only had 2 biopsies come back that was 200 microns or less. I had it done 2 days ago after hearing feedback from women in my LS Facebook group getting the treatment.  Some had it over 2 years ago and others more recently.  None have had a reoccurrence and they are not on steroids.  I disagree that LS is not painful.  It can cause tearing, fissures, fusing, itching, etc. Strong steroid treatments should be 12 weeks on and 12 off.  I would not want to be on that regime the rest of my life and having something trigger a flare as the steroid just manages the inflammation.  So I took a shot on the tulip.  My biopsy in the worst spot was around 500 microns deep.  Mona Lisa only goes to 200 so that would not have worked on me.  I am good with trying this as it was not painful (procedure or recovery so far).  I received PRP after the laser and keeping it clean and moisturized.  Dr Coyle sits down with you and explains his history of treating women with LS and using steroids, estrogen and other options that never really worked.  I am glad I had this option and we will see how it goes.  My before and after is day and night by the way and up to three months later you see differences. The before and after on the site may be the immediate after laser. Thank you for explaining that. So I should look into the tulip and not rule this out so quickly? I just found this sub. I am learning so much. No problem.  I explored my options but knew I did not want to be on strong steroids the rest of my life and definitely did not want to try immune suppressant drugs.  This is the only thing available now.  There is a doctor in California trying stem cell but I believe he is only doing a limited trial.  I am on day 2 and I am not in pain and not too swollen.  I am happy so far and I talked to other women who are a year or two out a d they are happy with no symptoms.  You can also call or ask questions to Coyle Institute and they will really help you out. Dr Coyle is passionate when I talked to him when trying to help people out with this condition. Hi I am not sure if your account is active still, but could you provide an update for how you are 1 month out? Thanks! Hello!  I am doing awesome. No pain, no flares and looks all normal.  I have an occasional itch because the skin is still fully regrowing.  I have a check up at 3 months but no issues.  It is great :) Wow that is amazing! Sorry if it is TMI but how severe were your symptoms? If you have intercourse, has it helped with pain related to that as well? \nThank you! \nI am currently trying to decide between TULIP and stem cell lift with dr. Newman I had it for close to 7 years.  I did not have pain with intercourse but my drive tanked.  I had it all over my vulva and a patch near my anus.  My clitoris was also fusing.  My biopsy showed my inflammation was around 500 microns deep which is around average.  Dr Coyle has seen plenty that had intercourse issues.  I did have splits and was always scratching.  It is night and day now. Good to know, thanks so much!!!", "My best friend was diagnosed today. What is the best way I can support her? I have been a mess ever since I got the news from her. At first they thought it was vitiligo but further testing proved otherwise. She is so scared and I just want to be there for her. I have started doing my own research so that I know more about her condition. Other than all of that, what are some other ways I can help support her? I guess like anything, you can tell her that you are happy to talk anytime and help her with anything she needs. \n\nIt is okay to feel however you feel, but you might try to avoid inadvertently reinforcing the idea that this is a huge deal. LS is usually quite treatable, so getting diagnosed is big a step in the right direction, and it definitely does not have to be the end of the world. \n\nSpecifically, I would advise her not to look at scary pictures online; medical journals and so on tend to have pictures of the most extreme cases. If your friend was diagnosed early and responds to treatment (as most people do) there is no reason for her future to look anything like that. Ditto for some of the stories you read online and even in this sub. \n\nAs you may have seen in your research, there are some lifestyle changes that can be helpful, such as wearing cotton underwear or no underwear, avoiding harsh and scented soaps, avoiding tight pants or leggings, and moisturizing after bathing. If you wanted to get her something, maybe some period undies (pads are the worst with sensitive skin), unscented epsom salt, or a moisturizing unscented bath bomb? Seriously just being there to listen is amazing. It is so hard to talk private parts with other people. Add in something embarrassing or diseased and the shape can be overwhelming. I had a friend I was able to talk to. Mine recently went from \u201cfine\u201d to \u201cI do not have a visible clitoris anymore\u201d and \u201cI have not slept in two weeks because It will not stop itching\u201d over the space of two weeks and I was freaking OUT.

Thank you so much for responding this is so helpful \u2764\ufe0f Thanks, this really helps! yep I felt like a slutty leper when first diagnosed This is so kind and super advice. The emotional effect of the dx is difficult and made worse by what ifs. I am lucky I can say \u2018my vulva hurts\u2019 loudly to my partner. Hey!\n\nHopefully you will get them this book!\n\nI found another redditor that has also read the book and cured their LS.

I already have a bit of clitoral adhesion that I would really like to reverse but I do not know how. I have been given Clobetasol and have been using it twice a day for the last two days. I am not even sure how much I am supposed to use!\nI am really distressed about having this condition and managing to have a normal sex life/ preventing fusion. \nAny advice would be welcome! I am not sure if this is 100% the best way to do it, but I will tell you how I have managed. I will take a bath or use a sitz bath for 15-20 mins. (I put a bit of borax in because others have said it helps... I do not think it really does anything for me but may be worth a try). After the skin has softened up from the warm water, I take a q-tip and cover it in vitamin E oil, and use my fingers and the q-tip to gently pull apart areas of fusion and coat them in oil. Thank you for your reply! I shall give it a go! Hello! I was prescribed Clobetasol 4 years ago and my doctor said to use a thin layer just enough to cover the affected area and to not over do it because it could make things worse. Thank you! How often do you use it? When I first started 4 years ago I was told to use it twice a day for 1 month then once a day every other day for another month then once a week for 3 months then eventually once every 2 weeks and that is where I am at right now Does it work well? Have you had any fusion? I never had fusion, my skin was very pale it looked almost grey, very thin and veryyyy dry and itchy, it got to the point where my clitoris had hard patches on it, it felt like reptile skin! And it was starting to go numb almost. Clobetasol made all that go away, but I did not listen to my doctor and I used more than just a thin layer and my labia minora started getting smaller and smaller over the years! So be very careful not to apply too much. As of right now my doctor told me to stop using Clobetasol because my skin looks fine and she said it probably caused my labia minora to shrink. I feel the dryness and itchiness coming back so I might have to go back on Clobetasol again. Thank you so much for your advice! It feels like there is so much to get my head around so I really appreciate you taking the time to write! No problem!

From a few small patches on the foreskin it has spread to the entirety of the foreskin, under the frenulum and on the head. Sex had gotten increasingly painful and I was getting more and more frustrated and depressed. All of the doctors i had went to either just prescribed cortico-steroid cream or tried to push expensive and \"hip\" therapies such as PRP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, i went to see a guy that was recommended to me by a friend. He look at all the things that i was prescribed during the years, did an exam, and proposed to be a 2 month regiment of PROTOPIC which is basically a dermatitis cream that has had positive effect on lichen.  \n\n\nI was absolutely shocked to see how every day it just got better. Now, after 2 months, i have been put on a maintenance therapy of baby cortizol cream for 14 days and daily applications of Atoderm, which is a very neutral moisturizer.  \n\n\nAs of now, I am in 99% full remision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this gives everyone some hope that it can actually get better. How did you find the protopic? I have used it but found the stinging sensation a bit too much but I might give it another go now. The doc said there might be some stinging but i experienced almost none. H told me that that feeling tends to go away after the first week or so. Just be strong and power through, maybe it will also work for you. Can you give more specifics on the maintenance regimen?  I have things under control with weekly steroid use but would like to get away from that. Maintenance right now is cultivate, a child steroid cream once a week and atoderm, the moisturizer, once a day every day. But I will be getting off the steroid cream as well in 2 weeks after having done it for 2 months Very much the same case as you but my doctor just tells me to keep with steroid cream 1x a week even though it does not work or have a circumcision (which does not guarantee a cure according to my research)\n\nWhat do you mean by full remission? Did the white patches go away and the skin went back to normal? Did the skin become less tense? The white patches are 95% gone and those that remain at the same as the healthy skin around them. The skin is almost as it was years before. Definitely less tense. The patches on the head of the penis have gone entirely, so have the ones next to the frenulum. \n\nI am just shocked at how good my quality of life is now.", "Vulvar itching I am looking for a woman suffering from vulvar itching to chat about it. Thank you", "Smelly! I have another question for all you female sufferers out there. Do you notice any odor when you are in an active flare up? I have been feeling so self conscious that everyone can  smell my business but not matter how many times I shower (water only down there) the smell never goes away and I never feel clean and  dry. Anyone else have similar issues? I could believe there is a connection between stress and a flare. And, also a connection between stress and sweat. \n\nSo, probably a correlation. More tense, more sweaty, different body chemicals running around, different smell. I do not think LS causes a particular smell, as far as I know. But our bodies advertise the hell out of our discomforts. \n\nOdds are good that there is no abnormal smell. Long as you have ruled out any kind of STI, you are fine and your smells are normal and there is nothing you need to do about them. Human bodies make smells. They just do. \n\nOdds are very good nobody is smelling anything but you, and you are probably smelling your sweat and maybe it is tweaked because your body is stressed. Nobody else is likely to notice unless they are already in the neighborhood, and in that case you probably either already rinsed off - or they are into it and do not care. \n\nWater is all you need and want. Natural breathable fabrics. That is really it. \n\n\n\nSo funny story time. One summer EVERYTHING hurt so much I just stopped wearing underwear at all. I wore maxi dresses and could not bear to wear anything else. And one day in line at Starbucks ... my little guy, age three or so, picked up my skirt and lifted it waaaaaay over his head. SURPRISE, everybody!!!!! Old man in line behind me about had a heart attack laughing. Old woman was NOT amused. But ...  it did eventually calm down and I am able to fully dress again. A requirement, apparently, when you have kids.... Thanks for sharing that story! Gave me a good laugh! \n\nTo OP: I have noticed more of a smell during a flare up but I also totally agree it comes from sweat/ stress! Yes, the smell can be really strong for me during flare ups. My husband even noticed \ud83d\ude32 As dumb as this sounds, I never really even considered the correlation between sweat, flares ups, and odor. Thanks for that insight! I will have to do some monitoring when I am not in a flare If I notice odor. \n\nSlso, how hilarious/mortifying! I would have sprinted fast as I could out of the store! I have asked my husband so many times if I smell and he says no, but I chalked that up to him always being around me. I swear if I can smell it so clearly they others have to be able to as well! I have not noticed but I think showering too much (even with just water) can cause dryness so make sure you moisturize. THIS ^ I shower as much as I can without it being unhealthy! Hot water too and properly do a good wash \ud83e\uddfc plus do not use ANY soap or cleanser or wet wipes! Those will make it worse!", "Revenge of the cracks Hi everyone I unfortunately have lost a lot of my labia lips to this horrible condition and my skin is so bad I have to start wiping or with water wipes. I went to my OBGYN and I had a deep crack going inside the vagina and it sucks. Anything that rougher then dabbing it cracks. I was put back on my clobestol ointment and given estrogen cream.

The doctor gave me the stronger steroid cream to use 1-2 a week on the front area and then something a lot lighter to use towards the back because the skin is thinner. The lighter stuff she said I can use as often or as much as I need. It helps with itching sometimes. I also find it helps to keep the area moisturized in general on the days I do not use those. \n\nWhen I get out of the shower I use coconut cream just to keep it moisturized and then hold off on putting underwear and pants on until the last minute I have to. Not super helpful but I have not found a way to completely prevent... just maybe limit I guess. I also make sure to run to washroom soon after sex to pee and use a wet wipe, and then apply either the prescribed cream or just a little coconut oil to smooth any irritation. One of the splits got so bad and healed so poorly that the doctor actually took the scar tissue out and stitched it up. Hurt worse than anything I have experienced but doing a hell of a lot better since. \n\nGood luck.  Thank you :) I do not wear any underwear at all. I always make sure I pee before and after. I will definitely try coconut oil. ", "Do your tears come from scratching, sex or just dry skin? Why do you get tears? Where do you get them? I am not sure if mine could be from lichen or something else Yes. Walking, bending, moving too quickly, sex, squatting, wearing clothes, really anything that a regular human would do. wow im so sorry, nothing is fixing that?? No. And I am ready to kill myself. im so very sorry..... i wish i could do anything tohelp you. i hope doctors care Thank you kind stranger. All of the above, but especially after sex. I get my tears between my labia majora and labia minora. It is been soooo much better since getting a diagnosis and steroid cream. any white patches?? I am so sorry. Please let your doctors know how serious this is, both physically and mentally. Medicine will only get better and better as time goes on. I am hopeful you will be able to find a treatment that makes a big difference. Clob did not work for me, but my doctor was able to find a different steroid that does help a lot. I have also found going underwearless a day or two a week to be helpful. And Vaseline. Lots of Vaseline. Apply after every time you go to the bathroom and before bed. It will keep things moisturized and help prevent tears. It also feels soothing, imo. \n\nAlso, here is this. Please use these resources available to us all! They are there for a reason. A good one. \n There is some light discoloration on my vulva. I did not think anything of it until my OB/GYN diagnosed me. From sex only. Any better with treatment? How can you tolerate sex without tearing? Can you tell if your skin is thin? I have read that it is typically tissue thin. I use clobetasol only sometimes when I have a flair up, usually I do not have any symptoms apart from a small tear during sex in the fourchette of the vulva. To make sex less painful I use coconut oil.", "Self care tips? Hey all. I am looking for some self care tips\n\n\nUsually, I only have flare ups if I have a lot of p in v intercourse, masturbate too much, or my stress levels raise. But unfortunately, I do all of those things often. \n\nWhat are some self care tips to help with sex, dryness, itching, all of that good stuff? \n\nRight now I use slippery stuff lube and that is help TONS (as I found out I was allergic to glycerin and most addictives in lube,) but there is still so much pain at my vaginal opening, where one of my lichen sclerosus white spots sit at.\n\nI also have a biopsy scheduled for May to confirm I have Lichen Sclerosus (although, I have seen two obgyn's who are both certain I have it, but I must have a biopsy to get clob apparently, their words not mine). Does the biopsy hurt? What is the recovery like? I have little to no pain tolerance in all honesty. I have do not have pain tolerance either. But they give you some numbing meds injected then you do not feel anything but after it wore off it is was uncomfortable for me for awhile. I could not sit comfortable it felt better to lay down. Take ibuprofen or Tylenol for the pain. I also used an ice pack to help with the pain. Oh trying using Uber lube it is really good it was recommended by my OBGYN. My biopsy was uncomfortable but so worth it for me. They gave me a numbing injection before taking the biopsy. I didnt get a punch biopsy so it might be different if you get that. Afterwards i couldnt stop bleeding for a while so once they got the bleeding to stop i was released. Told to keep an eye on it and drink a lot of water to prevent urine from irritating the  exposed area. Pat after you urinate to prevent irritation also! \n\nI got diagnosed with lichens simplex chronicus. My self care is vitamin e suppositories 1-2x a day,  emu oil 1-2x per day,  epsom salt bath 3x per week,  cerave healing ointment,  cerave itch relief cream. \n\nFor painful sex, lots of lube and maybe try vaginal dilators. Pelvic floor physical therapy might be worth asking the gyn about. One of the best thing I started doing was dabbing on a bit of Vasaline before p in v where there is friction. It is stickier than lube so it stays in place during sex and makes a little protective coating over the skin. I believe there is a coconut based version if you are avoiding petroleum products. I do not get tears on my clit so I do not buy it there, but I have never had a problem with it interfering with oral. \n\nBeyond that, my REQUIRED self care includes:\n- moisturize twice a day\n- wash with warm water only, no hot water in the area\n-trim rather than shave/wax, but trim regularly so the hair does not get too long\n- shower every night and clean the area each morning with a washcloth. \n\n\nHope some of that is helpful! Thank you! I definitely will! I have it written down on my shopping list! Thanks so much! I tried dilators, thankfully it is not insertion that is the problem, it is just all of the friction. Thanks so much! I have noticed that Glycerin containing products can make it worse for me, so I will look into that coconut based version! Coconut oil definitely does help a bit for me, so that coconut thing should be super useful!\n\nI noticed trimming instead of shaving DEFINITELY helps as well!  Hi, was wondering if you ever got your lichen simplex taken care of and if they figured out what caused it, Appreciate any info!", "Recommendations for bathing suits/bikinis that do not irritate vulva... Any suggestions or tips on bathing suits? I feel like bathing suits are just a no-no for me. If I get wet and do not immediately change out of my swimsuit, I am highly prone to getting a flare up. That can also cause a yeast infection. So, changing right after swimming is always a good call. \n\nThongs are a bad idea. \n\nI am older and heavy now but even when I was younger I found swim shorts to be a good way to go. There are some that are intended to go on over a suit - and sometimes I just skip the suit bottoms. Mesh inside, solid outside, cannot tell. Long as the material is not harsh. Freeeeeeeedom!\n\nTankinis make that work. Looks sporty and deliberate. I wear swim shorts! Not men\u2019s board shorts but the ones meant for women are cute with a bikini top I have loose swim shorts as well..short ones meant for women. I also wear bikini bottoms. What I like to do is bring two sets of bottoms with me. I wear the one and once I am done swimming but would like to lay out..I change into the dry pair. It is extra trips the bathroom and more to pack but I have found it keeps me from a flare up and lets me enjoy myself. \n\nLastly if it is a full day at the beach/pool I will bring a maxi dress too. So that when I am all done I can change into the maxi dress with or without bottoms on the drive home.\n\nI have tons of black bikini bottoms. You can get them on sale in the fall/winter and they go with just about anything. I find the ones that tie on the side give you more freedom to keep it from being overly tight since it is customizable. It lets me keep everything covered without sacrificing comfort. I find overly tight bottoms irritating as well. I wear board shorts with a rashgaurd top.  I do not need more skin cancer along with my ls, so I do not do revealing swimsuits. Love this hack! Thanks!! With my healthy, everything is already so high maintenance with having to bring so much stuff with me in case of flare ups so an extra trip to the bathroom for a bottoms change is not an issue at all. Never heard of a rash guard top. I will check it out. Thanks!", "Clobetasol ointment saved my life. My sex life, my marriage, and my mental health. I was diagnosed with lichen after a year of fighting for that diagnosis with my OBGYN in south carolina. The condition started quite literally overnight when I was 25, and I am now 27. My doctors insisted it was vaginosis, a yeast infection, an STD, everything under the sun until I demanded a test.\n\nI was immediately issued an apology and an ongoing prescription of clobetasol ointment. After a year to a year and a half of constant flairups, daily use, a complete destruction of my sex life in my marriage, and enough hot baths that I almost turned into a lobster, I finally have my body back. I only have to use the ointment when needed, which becomes less and less often as the months go on. I can regularly have pleasurable, painless sex. I no longer feel like even ending my own life. \n\nDo not give up hope if you have this condition. Keep pushing, because it can get better. You can get your life back. You can get your body back. You can get your self esteem back. Tips for newly diagnosed people:\n\n- use the ointment GENEROUSLY. morning AND night. Do not be afraid to get it all up in there. Wash your hands before and after, obviously.\n\n- hot baths. Hot enough that your skin will be red. Take them as often and as long as you need them. They are good for the pain and for your stress. Doctor recommended too.\n\n- a vibrator. Do not be modest, just trust me and get one. The vibrations literally helped the pain, the stimulation helped with flare-ups and eventually helped my body lubricate naturally again\n\n- ditch a man who makes you feel bad. Do not deal with them. Luckily I did not have that, and neither should you.\n\n- loose cotton underwear or no underwear. No underwear if you can is best. Staying home during COVID made this a lot easier, and let my body breathe. did you use clob daily for more than a year? i mean it is a strong cortisone which can also really damage your skin? im actually afraid using it too long will have irreversible effects which might also suck. My dose is .05%, and did not at all cause any more damage to my flare up than the disorder was already causing. If anything it helped me heal with minimal, if any scarring. And my disorder is in a sexual area, if my post did not already make that clear. My area opening to my cervix was swollen and pitch white, and now is normal.\n\nYes, I used it daily for a significant amount of time, and still use it if I feel even a hint of a flare-up coming to prevent it. You will risk far more harm by not using it than using it My pharmacist said I am not at risk for thinning skin with my ointment Question \u2014 do you have any irritation still? I am 4 month since I started clobetasol. My symptoms are well controlled but I do still have irritated skin \u2014 I need to use zinc oxide or some type of barrier cream everyday. Also, I am still irritated after sex. Nothing as severe as prior to treatment but it is still annoying. Did this all go away for you? It was not exactly on my vulva, its all interior. \n\nI was getting irritated for awhile, but eventually it stopped happening. If I feel irritation when penetrated we refrain from sex. Lately that has not been happening at all and we have been able to have regular sex. Being consistent with use was important until flare ups stopped happening frequently. I think I have used the ointment twice since the beginning of September. this really gives me hope. i am male and have that irritation also on the meatus. that my main symptom. clob helped a lot to reduce inflammation and now it is not much but it is also kind of annoying after penetration \u201eburns\u201c a bit. would you say that having regular sex actually helped? i am glad to hear that might eventually also be under control how did he come to that conclusion? seems weird to say that without a) seeing your condition and b) without trying it? I have been using it for almost two years and definitely no thinning skin so far. I asked him about a year into treatment since I have read it here. Im assuming he has read studies on it and with years of being a pharmacist. There is another pharmacist in the practice with lots of scar tissue (not sure what she has) and she said she basically uses an entire tub of clob a month. hmm thanks im super anxious about damaging it. but everyone is also reacting differently. especially since the penis is also different skin that vulva i guess Oh gotcha! Cannot help in that department! Lol. But it made a huge difference for me in a few months, now i only has it like once a week. The vulvar skin is more like mucosa rather than the skin on your arm or body. It is resistant to the thinning effect of steroids. If you read any long term studies on lichen sclerosus they usually note that in the studies as well. They do not understand why. I have just started the steroid and most my pain feels like nerve pain in the clitoris.  Is this normal ?", "Does this look like Lichen to you guys?  Talk to a doctor (I am not one), but the paper-thin skin looks a lot like the lichen on my shoulders. Coupled with the white around the outer edge, I would say it is very possible. Thank you", "I have had an itchy vulva for the past few months and in the past week, part of my anus has also been oddly itchy. I am terrified of LS. Hi, I am a healthy female in my early 20s. I have had been experiencing an itchy and irritated vulva for the past few months. It is mostly the area in-between my outer and inner labia. This past week, a part of the area around my anus has also sometimes been itchy.\n\n I have no discoloration, spots, rash, etc. I have been tested many times for yeast (all kinds of yeast, not just albincans), STDs, bacteria, etc. Everything is negative.\n\n I went to my ObGyn a few weeks ago and she prescribed a powerful steroid cream to use for the itch for 2 weeks. I applied it twice a day. It helped with the constant itch, but the itching would come back after about 10 hours and I would reapply it again. \n\nAfter I was done with two weeks, I was still itchy and the steroid seemed to be less effective so I contacted her for a biopsy. I am supposed to have my biopsy in a few days and I am terrified.\n\n In the meantime, although I have not been using the steroid, I have noticed I can keep the itch at bay by rinsing that area with water. I wake up with itch and irritation, wash the area, and it subsides quickly after. It does not feel perfect but it is much better. Also, the more movement I do usually leads to itch. \n\nWhat could I have? I am fucking terrified of lichen sclerosus. Sounds like LS. I did not get white patches or anything. My symptoms were intense vulva itching, burning, anus itching, fissures and sex was painful. I was tested for 3 years for stds and yeast only to come back clear. It was hell. I went to see a dermatologist instead and was diagnosed. I use Clobetasol ointment - steroid. I was applying twice a day for 2 weeks, then 1 time a day for 2 weeks, then 1 time every few days and after about 3 months it \"cleared.\" I now only get flare ups once in a while if the weather is changing (like to winter and my skin dries out faster), if I sweat too much and my underwear is not changed soon enough. \n\nI would avoid using wet wipes, keep using the ointment, and try not to scratch if you have been. Sometimes I will use a pack of ice if the itching and burning is too bad. Thanks for responding. Did you ever get a biopsy done? How was that? Does it get worse over time? Are you able to have a normal sex life? I have LS on my butt also. Clobeatasol on there when needed. Pretty blunt but in summer I find I need to basically give myself a wedgie to keep the skin from getting too damp with sweat. \nAlso find my LS flares with seasons/allergies. I did not need a biopsy. My dermatologist was familiar with LS and once saw the fissures knew what it was. It did not get worse over time, it got better and for me, I would say I am cured even though I get flare ups here and there. 99 percent of the time, I am normal and it is like I never had LS. Sex is fine now. I made sure to stick with the ointment regimen my dermatologist gave me and it all worked out. But I know that is not everyone is case. I think I may have had a more mild form than most. I only use clobetasol if I have a flare up and daily I use CeraVe hydrating cleanser as a feminine wash (as instructed by my derm) it keeps my skin moist down there. I avoid wet wipes also as I was told there is chemicals in it that make LS worse, they can also spread the LS to your anus. Do not be terrified, once you get it under control you will probably forget you even have it. It is not a death sentence! You will most likely be just fine.\n\nInternet gives you the worst of the worst cases. The fact that you are going for help when you caught it is great. I waited a year before I started in real steroids and I am fine. Do not sweat it, really. You have no idea how much hope your comment gave me. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for your feedback. Aw good I am so glad! Try soaking in borax daily, and check out the Sharing is Caring LS group on Facebook:  The borax takes away the itch completely and the steroid helps too. I am 34, diagnosed 3 years ago and finally have it under control. Best of luck! I am so so so happy for you. Thank you for sharing. &lt;3 I hope you continue to feel amazing &lt;3 It does not sound like LS to me. Anything can cause itchiness really. I have LS and my pain symptom was discoloration and superficial \u201cpaper cuts\u201d in the vagina area and gluteal cleft. Of course at times itching. They did perform a biopsy and confirmed my suspicion five years ago. Have you changed any detergents, that can me a possibility? Maybe your having some kind of reaction since you feel better after washing. And since 5tears ago you have been in remission? I have not, but it is true that it could be eczema or psoriasis, etc. that also externally is not showing. I have having a biopsy tomorrow and I am nervous. No, have flares and I use a steroid ointment three times a week for life called clobetesol. I see a specialist every six months to make sure there are no changes. Mind me asking what is the longest you have been without a flare up? And when you get one how long it lasts? Does sex always hurt? Keep us updated on how it goes! I am also going for a biopsy next week and scared as hell! Yours \u2018cleared\u2019 after 3 months? I am finishing up my first month and every day is a new day of burning and discomfort. It is like the clob is not working at all. I am still waiting for my biopsy results. I am just curious to know how long it took for tour clob to fully work for you? It took maybe 2 weeks. I honestly think I had a more mild case than most people- which surprises me bc I had it for 3 years before getting a diagnoses. I applied clob 2x a day for 2 weeks, then 1 time a day for 2 weeks and then 1 time when I got flare ups which was maybe 1 time a month. Now it is like I do not even have it. I only get a flare up every few months when I am sweating too much or a big change in weather Oh wow! Thanks for sharing. I cannot believe it is been 4 weeks and I still have no relief. I know everyone is different, and I have spoken to other docs and a pharmacist and they have all told me that if it is not working, it is probably something else. I guess only time will tell. Glad you have been able to keep it under great control! Good luck! I hope you get some relief soon. I know it is a hard time and it is a sucky diagnosis :( What was your result from the biopsy?", "today's hero: the ice pack I have been having the worst flare in a long time and today I am laid up on the couch with an ice pack on my crotch. do not underestimate the power of the ice pack to provide quick relief.\n\nI am using clob 2x a day as well. hoping this flare settles down soon. I am in absolute agony. I do ice packs too. Just make sure you do use a cloth to protect your skin - frost bite is awful. I have done it to other parts of my body with ice packs and it suuuuucks. \n\nAnother trick is to swap out ice with hot washclothes.  Just not quite hot enough to burn \u2026 it does not last as long as ice, but I find that swapping in heat every so often helps too. \n\nHope you get some relief soon. Go go clobetasol. Hot washcloths are a good tip. Thanks! Amen! When my itch and burn was at its worse I lived and died by my ice packs. Ice packs yes. I use an instant ice pack thing when I travel. Good for road trips as a prevention too.", "Could this be LS? Happens when I wipe after intercourse.  Any other symptoms? Maybe its been like this the whole time and youre just aware now? Yea it hurts all the time. Feels like something is pinching it. Mostly when I move around a lot. Im really not sure but maybe visit a dermatology and have their opinion, could be nothing. \n\nHow long have u had this issue?\nAre you circumcised at birth?\nDoes it hurt to pee? \nDoes it happen without intercourse? If it hurts you should definitely go to the doctor. Maybe a urologist first, if there is not anything abnormal-looking about the skin (I do not see obvious white patches but it is hard to tell from a picture.) I did go, but they gave me a cream for fungus, which is not working. When they look at my penis it looks normal, since it only wrinkles like this after sex. Never did it before 3 months ago. LS is often misdiagnosed as fungal infection. If the cream does not work at all (over the specified period of time that it should take) then it is probably not fungus. Maybe call them back and say the fungal cream did not help and ask for follow-up or referral.", "Treatment with Tacrolimus or other non steroids Has anyone tried treatment with Tacrolimus ointment? It is an immunosuppressant. The gist of it is that LS is an autoimmune issue so our bodies are attacking our healthy cells causing LS symptoms and Tacrolimus is supposed to suppress that reaction. I have had LS since I can remember (~4yrs) and was finally properly diagnosed at age 22. I have been using Clobetasol but I have been having a ton of flare ups over the last few years (particularly after I had to take Doxycycline for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. I swear gut flora affects LS). I want to find a treatment for LS not a treatment for the just symptoms. In the study below, the patient seems to no longer have issues after using the cream. I have also found another few articles that use Pimecrolimus but cannot read the full article. It is an immunosuppressant as well so the premise is the same.  I am just curious to see if anyone has used these before. If not, I am going to take the plunge and ask my doctor to prescribe one of them. I will report back. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I havnt but sounds interesting!!! If you do try it please report back!! Tried tacrolimus for over 12 weeks and strongly relieved the pain/itching, but not completely. Tacrolimus works best for me. Healed all cracked skin and open sores. Does not seem to heal my LS completely, as if I have sex some skin tears again, but it is worked wonders compared to what it was.", "Is this LS? ", "9-year-old bedwetting for the first time in her life after LS diagnosis... Could it be the steroids? She got diagnosed this summer we just finished up like 8 weeks of daily steroid treatment and are going on to every other day. Over the past six weeks she has wet the bed three times. This is a kid who did not even want the bed during potty training.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight? Could the steroids be getting on her urethra and irritating it? Do you think it is the trauma of like four vaginal exams?\n\nWe are acting like it is no big deal, of course. There is no punishment or shame or anything like that. We just clean up together in the morning. But for the first time ever I am worried about her sleeping over at someone is house this weekend and I just do not know how to address it. Vaginal exams would be pretty tough at that age, but kids have so many changes for so many reasons. It may be related or not. \nMaybe school restarted. In a few years you may realize that puberty was beginning. It could be a physical stress like an irritation or infection for a related or unrelated reason.\nI had a child start bed wetting and a year later we realized it stemmed from a different physical condition. \nIt is a tough spot for both of you. On addressing it for the sleepover - She is definitely not the only 9 year old that occasionally wets the bed. We had very plain pull-up, disposable underwear. My child would change into PJs (and overnight underwear) in the privacy of the bathroom. I have LS (diagnosed at age 4) and am also a mom to 2 kids. The stress of the exams could be part of it, and you are doing the right thing by not making a big deal of it.\n\nI mention the mom part because we have hosted sleepovers, and at least half the parents had a similar worry and it is \"mom code\" to just accept that the kids are going to have something (nighttime accidents, food pickiness, special stuffed animals) they are self-conscious about. Mom code means you accept and accommodate! Send a discreet text or something to the hosting parent about what is going on and to the other posters' comment, it is common for the kids to just change into PJs in the bathroom (under the guise of good dental hygiene even!). Is it possible that it hurts when she urinates so she has been trying to hold it in during the daytime, so it accidentally comes out at night? Hey! In Ginny's book - one of the first chapters is dedicated to the story of a child diagnosed with LS. I recommend picking it up, I was able to cure my LS, and I recently found another redditor who read the same book who was able to cure theirs.\n\nhere is my testimony, and here is theirs:\n\n\n\n\n\nBest of luck! I really hope you pick up the book. This is a really great insight. We have recently figured out this year that she has experienced pain for years and we did not know and now her barometer of pain is kind of weird. Like if I ask is there any pain she will say no but then I will hear a whimper in the bathroom and ask her what is wrong and she will say oh nothing it just hurts worse when I pee. Of course I then reply with something like but I thought you said it did not hurt? And she replies with something along the lines of it does not hurt any more than usual.\n\nObviously a bummer to figure out but I do not think it is super unusual. I have heard that kids with chronic ear infections do the same thing. One day they wake up with a burst eardrum and their parents are like what happened? And the kid had just gotten used to the pain so did not know he had another ear infection.\n\nThank you for your insight and I am going to investigate it! Thank you for normalizing it! I bought her a pair of period panties for this slumber party. You know how it is, it is weird, but many young ladies cannot wait to buy the accoutrements of puberty such as bras and period supplies. So it made it kind of more fun. I did not even consider that it could be this stress of back to school after covid or puberty or any of that. So thank you for that info! I do not want to start blaming everything on LS and miss other things. Thank you for this because I was weirdly ashamed to have to tell another mom. I should not be, she already had to treat her LS at this person's house, but I guess in the back of my head the fact that my kid had never been to bedwetter was something I was kind of proud of or something? I know it sounds really stupid and I did not even know it until now. Thank you so much! I am going to dive in now.", "Does this looks like LS or BXO??

Does anyone know the differences and have any experience in reversing the white scarring with any of them. I should say that I dont really get pain or redness and irritation. My LS just seems to be progressive patches. I have been using Clob for a month now. The white patches on the glands seems to be getting healthier as far as the skin goes. Not as crinkly or dry but feels more like normal skin now. I still have discoloration though which has very slightly improved. I am hoping it gets completely reversed but again it is only been 1 month. Doctor told me that white skin cannot be improved because it is scar tissue / atrophied skin. Many people here say that they have reversed this damage. Which is true since it cannot be both. \n\nSo is broader discoloration actually much more severe than white patches and so patches can go away but bigger regions cannot? Ever?\n\nWould appreciate some more insight and I also plan to read more about the basics of how skin works... but if whiteness means that dermis (epidermis?) layer is gone, then it is maybe gone for good as doctor says.. if not what known process helps this layer to regrow?\n\nReally interesting topic .. would love to know if it is possible to reach some broader consensus or objective truth or it is still all messy hearsay.", "a little scared, is this an LS symptom?

As Ginny points out, if you feed yourself well and quit dousing yourself in toxins, you will be well on your way to feeling better. And if you do have Lichen Sclerosis, read the entire book, because Ginny also provides details on how she cured herself using herbs and other therapies. In fact, I am confident that her protocol will help people with many diseases, including other autoimmune issues. This could literally be a textbook in the naturopathic medical curriculum. Its content is vast, deep, and well-researched. Although I have been involved in natural medicine for twenty years, I still benefit from periodic reminders about how to live well. This book is a strong reminder. I improved my diet and cleaning products immediately upon reading it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and read it again from cover-to-cover. It is one of those books every health care practitioner should read, and one that everyone would benefit from reading, and re-reading periodically. Steven Coward, ND Asheville Natural Health &amp; Homeopathy\u201d", "After 3 weeks of treatment with ointment... Hey! I have been diagnosed with LS in mid December. The GP prescribed me dermovate ointment once a day for 4 weeks and then once every 2 days for 2 weeks.\nI am in the third week and I see little changes... It looks much clearer than in the beginning and the skin feels better but it is still there :-( has anybody got rid of it with corticosteroids? How long it took you?\n\nI am also using a emollient instead of regular soap. That seems pretty realistic for 3 weeks tbh. It takes time and usually it does more to prevent further issues than undo issues. Any scar tissue and discoloration is unlikely to go away. But you should see some improvement in inflammation, fusing, tears, redness, pain and itching. My only symptom is white spots, they are not huge but very visible. I was hoping to get rid of them fully or at least to minimise it as possible, and it worries me the time I have left to use the ointment Were you diagnosed with LS? Usually we stay on a 1-3 times weekly maintenance dose for life with Clobetasol or similar. My GP told me that it was LS and that it should get better with Clobetasol after some weeks... But today is week #3 and the changes I have seen are little... I would definitely seek out a specialist. It is not odd for it to not improve much after just 3 weeks  and it will just come back after you stop using Clob, since it is a lifelong autoimmune disorder. I would join one of the Facebook support groups for LS and read the information they have, they have lists of specialists and can help you find one if there is not one in your area. Most GPS do not know much beyond the basics of this disease. I am Male and believe I suffer from this. I have no pain or rash. It is just white spots or scar tissue. I am very reluctant to get a circumcision. Do the white spots go away and come back or are they permanent? What causes this and what is the best course of action? Some of the discoloration will be permanent. If it is LS, you need diagnosis either visually or by biopsy by someone knowledgeable of LS (usually a dermatologist) I would join the men\u2019s group on Facebook. They can assist you in finding a doctor who will then determine treatment (usually Clobetasol) It is an autoimmune disease, though they are not sure exactly what causes it. I have no inflammation. Just the white spots and a scar tissue area. But I am Male so maybe it is different Same for me. Male with only with spots in the tip of penis, circumcision would not do a change for me. With the treatment of clobetasol, they are getting clearer so I hope that it will go away or at least it will not keep spreading. It all started with a small white spot years ago and I never paid any attention... I am terrified of it spreading and causing problems. Good to hear that they can clear up. Has the tightness in the skin improved? I wish I knew what triggers this. I am prone to overactive immune system. I have a skin allergy called cold induced urticaria, hay fever and mild asthma during exercise. I guess this is just our nature Yes, after the first week I felt my skin in the area feeling better and softer. The hardest part is to get the natural skin colour back. I have read some people saying that their cases cleared up completely and others that it improved a lot. But stressing too much about it would only be counterproductive.", "How long does it take for the creams to work? Hi everyone. I have recently been diagnosed with LS. At least my gp thinks it is LS. But have not been able to confirm that with a specialist\u2019s appointment yet. My symptoms do not include white patches or itching. But there is constant pain in labia majora and minora. I had my first episode a few months ago that lasted 2-3 months and eventually went away with steroidal cream use in the last 15 odd days. (Prior to that my gp\u2019s were treating me with various uti medications thinking it was a uti complication). This time it has been already lasted 2 odd months with only intermittent relief. And for the past 10 days, despite me using a cream with higher potency since the last couple of days, it is not going away. Am in constant pain. I do not know when this becomes ok for you once you start using the cream? How many times a day do you apply it? I also am having a UTI with it. Again. And it is just so debilitating. I cannot stand the constant pain. I cannot sit. I am sorry for venting. But I would really appreciate someone sharing optimistic stories of the cream kicking in after a certain number of days, and maybe I just need to wait it out... So I usually would feel a little calming of the symptoms after the first application or two. But you will not see the full improvements your skin will get from the cream for about 3 months. Your skins new layers grow underneath and the cream affects the new skin growing in the most. So it takes awhile for it to surface! But also creams tend to be more irritating! See if they can compound the same medicine into an ointment and then give that a few months try if you do not see improvement in the next few days!! I am so sorry you are experiencing this! Thank you for the detailed reply. Appreciate it. I am trying to line up appointments with specialists to properly diagnose my condition. Since steroids do not seem to helping, it might be something else...", "Study on vulvar lichen sclerosus in pre-menopausal women age 18-50 (link in text) Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus (VLS) is most often diagnosed in postmenopausal women and young girls before puberty. We do not know as much about the experience of pre-menopausal women in their 20s, 30s and 40s who have VLS.  We do not have research on what happens in women with VLS in pregnancy, during childbirth, and postpartum with breastfeeding.  This information is helpful for diagnosis, counseling, and treatment of women in their 20s to 40s with VLS.\n \nIf you are a woman age 18-50, not yet in menopause, with vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) confirmed by/consistent with biopsy, you qualify to participate a research study aimed at characterizing the symptoms, diagnosis, and management of vulvar lichen sclerosus in reproductive age women (adult women not yet in menopause).  \n \nThis is a de-identified online survey that should take less than 10 minutes to complete.  The study has been IRB-approved.  The consent form is on the first page of the questionnaire.\n \nHere is the direct link:\n\n(\n\n\n\nIf you still cannot access the questionnaire, it is available through the link in bio  on Instagram and you can DM me there if needed.  \n\nThere is also information on vulvar LS and vulvodynia on my educational IG page \n\nThank you for lending your voice to help us understand, diagnose and treat VLS! took this yesterday! Great, doing this now! Thank you! I hope we can see the results/conclusion some day. I will post them after they are reviewed and published! Awesome! Thank you!", "It is possible to be lichen sclerosus?? It is itchy and I have this since I was 18 - now I am 20. I really do not know what to do anymore, please help me  Maybe I am not looking in the right place. But I see possible razor burn. \n\nEver let it just grow for six months and see how that feels?  Best bet for me is to just leave it the hell alone. But I am older and nobody cares. \n\nIf that is no good, I always found a trimmer is okay, with a guard. Carefully. But a razor has always ended badly for me. \n\nI do not have LS anywhere there is hair, but hair sure does cushion everything generously. And cushion is needed!\n\nHair growing back itches like hell. Thank you for your reply! I do not shave that much in this area because even if I am shaved or not, the itching does not go away. I see a little bit of whiteness here and there and in that place I do not have hair. Maybe I will try posting another picture? \nRight there in the picture near my finger, on the right. Is it possible to be it? \n \nThe redness is not specific to lichen sclerosus? The redness might be the result of scratching it &amp; the skin becoming irritated. I never really had white patches like most do, but I was able to get a biopsy done and had the condition confirmed. If it is a true concern for you, I would try visiting a dermatologist and asking to have a skin biopsy done. You might also just be sensitive to body wash or other hygiene products. It looks like it could be an allergic rash.\n\nEdit: If you are sexually active, I would suggest having a Pap smear done and get tested for STD\u2019s just in case. A skin biopsy is no joke, especially in such a sensitive and intimate area. Hi! I am a virgin and I went to like 3 dermatologist. Nothing worked. \nI really think about having a biopsy, thanks for your reply.\nI also tried changing my body wash to something for sensitive skin and it did not work, I also changed my underwear. Still nothing... :/\nI will go to a gynecologist as soon as I can Here are some general tips:\n\nTry not washing your vulva with soap at all. Use a mild soap (like unscented plain old Ivory bar soap) for the rest of your body. \n\nUse unscented detergent to wash your underwear. \n\nAvoid tight pants/leggings. Skirts/dresses are your friend here.\n\nYou may want to ask your doctor first, but my doctor told me I could use Vaseline on my vulva when it is feeling irritated and/or after every time I pee. It is not medicated or anything, so I imagine it would be okay for anyone to do, but I am not a doctor. It actually helps me a lot! \n\nBest of luck! I agree with the others - looks a lot like simple irritation. So, another vote for no soap or body wash there - wash with water. (I really like having a shower head on a hose that I can pull down and wash well with - but even a washcloth with just water is fine.)\n\nAlso, definitely, no tight jeans. That would definitely do it. You want cotton granny panties for a few weeks and loose skirts or soft pants and stuff. It is summer, definitely doable. :) \n\nKeep using the sensitive skin unscented detergents, for sure. \n\nHopefully you are just reacting to something in your clothes or soaps and a gentle reset there will have you feeling better soon! \n\nAnd if not, definitely see the doc. Know that not all docs know what lichen sclerosus even is, so they might have to go look it up. Thank you! \nI feel like I really tried everything and I really do not know what to do anymore so yeah... but I will keep being positive, hoping that one day I will find what it is. I cannot believe that my biggest dream is to find the right diagnosis. \nI will try to change my soap as you said. Thank you so much for replying Thank you so much!\nI already tried vaseline and I think that is kind of works for me too. \nI really hope I will find what it is. Thank you, again \ud83c\udf08 You could try oxygenated oil. What is that Try changing to the dye-free/scent-free laundry soap as well. Does not look like LS to me but I am not an expert.", "Infected punch biopsy site Oh man. I had my biopsy on Tuesday morning after waiting 7 months to get in. Spent Friday night in emerg getting checked out. \n\nDid anyone else get an infected biopsy site, and how long did it take to heal after that?\n\nI am on 300 mg clindamycin, 4x a day for 7 days now to help fight the infection. In a lot of pain obviously. But good news is my lower back and side pain has subsided so I am able to stand straight now!\n\nEdit:  To add I did not receive a stitch to close the hole.", "Post biopsy. Was diagnosed a few years back. I had a biopsy done at that time. My Doctor wanted to check things out again so she did 3 biopsies on Wednesday. Initial discomfort but I am fine now. I did poke around today and notice my skin feels different, much tighter. My clitoris definitely feels different, it is quite popped out  and hard. I am too scared at this point to masturbate because it is only been 48 hours but I must admit I did get scared that I have lost sensation. Realistically, I know I have not but the different feel it has makes me wonder. Any thoughts? Thank you!", "Could this be LS? (NSFW) Hey everyone, recently I have been dealing with a yeast infection that is thankfully clearing up, but I notice that some redness still remains. However, I am really concerned about this redness in between my butt cheeks. It is a thin red line and does not really hurt, though sometimes it does get itchy. It does not help that where I live it is really hot and humid so the sweating makes it worse. Any help is appreciated! \n\n( I do not think so. Looks too uniform. I think lichen usually will show \u201cplaque\u201d like white spots. Perhaps you have residual itchiness from yeast ? Thanks for the reply! I hope that is what it is, although the skin is a little shiny(hard to tell from the photo) and kind of leathery? The texture is different from the rest of the skin basically", "Advice Hey guys im not sure if I can post this here but I am sorry in advance for the long post! \nI (f) was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus when I was 6 years old, I am now 21 so I have been dealing with it for awhile now. During my early teens it was horrible just flare ups every so often. Now however, I get flare ups what seems like constantly usually every other week or two weeks. I use creams along with aloe Vera and pain meds and try to do as little as possible to irritate the skin but nothing I do seems to make a huge difference. It is gotten so bad that I had to quit my job because I was constantly having to take days off. I work as a barista so it is a lot of physical activity so I hoped by taking some time off the flare ups would slow down a bit but it does not seem to have made much difference. I was in the doctors office today and she strongly believes I also have endometriosis. She even mentioned that I should consider getting on disability even if I do not have endometriosis. That thought had never crossed my mind before so I did some research and LS does not seem to qualify for disability. I am very concerned how I will ever be able to manage holding a stable job with both that and endometriosis, plus the things that come with it (pain, depression, chronic fatigue, etc) if anyone knows anything about that or has any advice it would be extremely appreciated. I was really caught off guard by all this and I have no idea where to even start. I would go see an obgyn that specializes in endometriosis and lichen sclerosis. I see one and she is awesome with everything it is possible to feel better just have to find the right person. Do not give up yet. What creams are you using? Have you been using topical steroids? I am assuming you have seen a dermatologist since you were diagnosed at 6 but maybe find an obgyn that is specializes in LS and endometriosis. If you are not seeing a dermatologist, I highly recommend that you do since they specialize in skin and can get you on a good medicine routine. You did not mention itching or dry skin but CeraVe hydrating cleansing wash (it is meant for your face- you can buy it in the face wash isle) is what my dermatologist recommended for \"washing\" my lady bits with to keep it hydrated (just the outside, you do not cleanse inside) It is helped with keeping fissures away, the itching and dry flakes away. I use it once a day and you can even apply it on some TP and wipe it on and leave it. If you are wanting to try it out, make sure you get the bottle that says HYDRATING CLEANSER- it is a weird milky color and has a shampoo type texture. Do NOT BUY the facial cleanser as that is foaming and has alcohol in it. i highly recommend joining the facebook group \u201chealing through borax for\nwomen with lichen sclerosis and skin disorders \u201c. borax has helped me and many others manage symptoms and reverse fusing of the skin tissues down there.", "Please do not tell MD this is LS I have had this condition since 2018. I cannot bear it anymore.\nI feel like ripping my skin off. First, I was diagnosed with a fungal infection. When antifungals did not help, I was just put on daktacort.\nThe dermatologist I saw thought it was some STD, which is ironic, since I am not sexually active...\n\n Out of curiosity, what is daktacort? And are you experiencing tearing or itchiness?  Daktacort is miconazole + cortisone. Usually used for treating fungal infections. The itchiness is unbearable! And when I start itching scales start falling off. You can see some of the remnants in the pictures. In my opinion it looks like psoriasis. I have both. This is what I get on my breasts and arms. Hmm. I can see why that might not have been helpful. \n\nYou mention having talked to a doctor, what kind? You definitely need a second opinion it sounds like. \n\n   There is a lot of other skin diseases. It might not be ls, it could be psoriasis, lichen planus, and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nSee a doctor again, seriously. Do not let it progress", "Can someone tell me their first symptoms of LS? For about 2 years now I have had terrible raw and red itchiness around the opening of my vagina and the itching is so bad that I cannot help but scratch because of how good it feels in the moment. It is just that itchy. I have been to the gyro several times but when I go, they do not know what it could be. The test for stds, BV, and yeast all come back negative. I have also had almost the same symptoms but in my butt. It is awful. I do not have any discharge or odor either. It seems to come in flare ups and the last time I went to the gyro (two months ago), I was almost completely asymptomatic so there was nothing for her to look at. She prescribed me cream which I ultimately did not end up using. I do not want to put the wrong thing down there considering how raw I am and I do not want to thin the skin down there either. I have had a gyno tell me about a year ago that she does not think I have LS because I do not have white patches but I have recently read that you do not have to. So thank you for reading and I basically wanted to know what your first symptoms were. I am sad that if it happens to be that, that I will never be able to comfortably have sex again. Also, should I see a gynecologist or a dermatologist? I want someone who is determined to figure out exactly what it is and not play a guessing game. Thank you for reading. My symptoms mainly began by itchiness around my clitoris and labias which caused redness and tearing. I then thought tat always itching etc down there developed the thick white skin. If you are having sex and find it tears a lot no matter how much lubricant was also a sign for me too.\nHope this helps feel free to ask any more questions! x My symptoms started just like yours! Went to the gyno for THREE years and I am pretty sure she thought I was crazy and making stuff up bc my symptoms were not visible every time I had my appt. LS can spread to your anus. You can also get it on the corners of your mouth and around your nipples. I suggest you go see a dermatologist. That is who diagnosed me. Took one look and immediately knew what it was, I did not have to do a biopsy or anything. I got prescribed topical steroids to apply twice a day for 2 weeks, then 1 time a day for two weeks and then 1 time every three days and before I know it, I was pretty much healed. I do get a flare up sometimes but it is mostly gone. It is best you get the right treatment ASAP so it does not progress. Even though my scarring is not visible anymore, sex still hurts sometimes. That is also how my symptoms started. I spent months slathering on \u201cfeminine itch\u201d cream and even douching, thinking I was not getting myself clean. I was diagnosed by my GP, but she admitted that it was the first time she would seen a case and was not totally sure. I now see a gyno dermatologist - I highly recommend trying to find one of these specialists if there is one anywhere near you. If your doc prescribed Clobetosal ointment, that is the current #1 go-to treatment. I also highly recommend getting some pure emu oil to use as a daily moisturizer/barrier - can be used as lube, too. Best luck. Yes, your symptoms sound like LS.  I did not have white until I would suffered (and I do not use that word lightly) for almost 15 years.  I was not diagnosed until I had the tissue-paper-figure-eight, but that is not for liack of trying.  Nurse Practitioners act like gatekeepers to the obgyns around here, and they think their job is to send everyone home telling them it is yeast and to scream at you to GO AWAY YOU ARE WRONG YOU HAVE NOTHING WRONG YOU IDIOT.  (Ten years later, I still want to burn it all down.)\n\nGood for you to keep following up.  Tearing and bleeding at touch ARE NOT NORMAL.\n\nThat said, it is worth trying a yeast treatment, if you have not already.  If it does nothing, beat down the doors of every obgyn around until they can explain why you have pain and tearing.  They HATE hearing you internet-sleuthed, so it may help to give them all the key words without feeding them the suspected cause.\n\nAs far as sex -- when treated, you can absolutely still enjoy sex!!  Took two weeks on clobetasol for everything to clear up very nicely.  Any skin that has withdrawn will not come back, but the tearing and the itching just STOPPED.  Sex is great.  If there is a flare-up then it is time-out, but otherwise, it is all about communication.  Seriously, this does not necessarily mean you can never enjoy sex.  You just need treatment first! Thank you all for replying. I was able to get a gyro appointment early this morning so I went on like 4 hours of sleep. She thinks I should have a biopsy done (thank god) so I will update when I find out. Thank you everyone for replying. It means a lot &lt;3 I have also had thoughts that my BC triggered or at least exasperated the symptoms. I used to have consistent itching and pain but literally a day or two after quitting the pill the symptoms alleviated themselves around 90% and my flair ups decreased in frequency. I bet there is some connection to it. I went off of depo and onto the pill and my symptoms are pretty much gone. I will get a flare up occasionally but I notice it is when I am in salt water, if I have been sweating a lot down there, or if I used a baby wipe(sometimes I need to clean up on my period). Which apparently can cause LS symptoms to flare up, my dermatologist said he tells all of his patients to quit using wipes. mine was low key itchy at the bottom of my outer labia for a few years, then constantly for eight months. i noticed one day while i was washing externally w/ castile soap that my skin was tearing off like if you had a sunburn that peeled. kept getting told yeast, yeast, yeast until i saw my gyno. totally get not being able to resist scratching, but if you do not have clobetasol yet, try taking ibuprofen and i used to put ice on it if it was really bad. if you do not touch it for a few days, the redness should go away and you will probably have white spots/patches if it is LS. my gyno says the patches have a specific \u201csheen\u201d haha. clobetasol is a lifesaver, i know it can be scary thinking about having something like this forever but keep advocating for yourself as you have been and they will get you feeling better!! xoxo For years I thought I was just highly prone to thrush outbreaks and too scared/embarrassed to visit a doctor in case it was something else. After recurrent UTIs, I had an STI exam and everything was clear. A month or so later I had my first smear, mentioned some of my issues but was sent on my way and told I was fine. \nI noticed that things were very dry down there and for the last 4/5 months sex has been unbearably painful. I went to my GP, who told me the wait for a gyno referral (which he urgently recommended) would be 2 years. So I paid for a private gyno who told me it was LS.\nNow I am using the steroid ointment and hoping for the best! Although, two weeks in and I am floored with pain and UTI symptoms so it is not all gravy yet lol I am the same!!! I am so happy I have found this sub! Spent so long back and forth because I did not have the white spots! I am reading a book to do with LS and I think there is a lot of evidence linking LS to hormone changes. Also lots of links to hormone imbalances... I think it is one of those things that is effected by a wide range of imbalances! That would make a lot of sense for me since it happened when I started birth control. I think the depo shot had no estrogen and when I went back on to the pill with estrogen, my symptoms seemed to have mostly cleared!", "wait for biopsy to heal before using steroid cream? my biopsy is still painful and I also think it might be infected\n\nshould I wait to start the steroid cream? You should call your doctor or your pharmacist, especially if you believe the biopsy site is infected. A pharmacist is likely to be available more so than your doctor, and they should be able to tell you if you should use the steroid cream. But only a doctor can help identify and treat an infection, and if you do have an infection it is probably really important to begin treatment as soon as possible.", "Making an appointment I have suspected i have had LS for about 6 months now. I started having symptoms when I started hormonal birth control for the first time. I have been putting off seeing a gyno because I do not currently have one that is covered by my insurance and I am also TERRIFIED of the idea of a biopsy. \n\nI am at my breaking point with it and am calling in the morning to make an appointment. \n\nWhen the receptionist asks, do I tell them I just need an exam or do I try to explain to her that I think I have this specifically? I just do not know exactly what to book this appointment as (hoping I can be diagnosed visually without a biopsy.) \n\nThanks in advance! Be specific about the appointment, and help the dr get straight to the point. It is possible to visibly diagnose. My dr said in my follow up visit, \u201cah, the clobetasol worked, so it was LS\u201d. \n\nIf you have a local planned parenthood, I have also heard of women getting diagnosed there My dermatologist diagnosed by sight while removing a suspicious spot from my bottom. Long story short I have not had a biopsy and treatment is going well. FYI I am 72 yr old man who has had this since pre teen, started treatment just over a year ago. Thanks everyone! was not even thinking about my dermatologist so I got an appointment booked for Wednesday and mentioned LS specifically. Appreciate the input and hopefully they will not need a biopsy\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc How did it go? What are tour symptoms? Hope you are doing well!", "Hi so I am crying please help I do not know if I have LS\n\nI am a 16 year old male and I have had these kind of white hard spots of skin on my foreskin for about 3 years now. It started when I moved to the United States. \n\nThere is 0 itching to my knowledge although I am not 100% sure. There is no problem with peeing. It is just the spots. Like a ring going around my foreskin slowly that I can easily tear off. It is also affected the head of my penis a little bit and my frenulum.\n\nI am shaking and scared cause I just found out about this because I have been trying to get rid of it for so long. My next doctor's checkup is in 3 months but for the past 3 years I have not had the courage to say anything and probably not this time either.\n\nI cannot tell my parents about this. I just cannot. And I am scared because I saw some pictures of it being bad and basically consuming my dick and I threw up. I do not know what to do and os there any cure?\n\nI have never been sexually active have not even held the hand of a girl before and then this happens. I am so mad at the world right now and I do not know why this is happening to me.\n\nI feel like the spots are sometimes white and sometimes kind of see through but I am not sure and it is always a little rough feeling I am a 30 year old female who was diagnosed this year, having had symptoms for about 2 years prior. After being prescribed a steroid ointment, I have noticed a huge improvement in my symptoms and even the appearance. (I also have white/see through-ish spots) \n\nPlease talk to your doctor, dude. It is worth discussing. Hey dude, LS is really rare.  You probably do not have it, simply because it is so rare.  And LS causes the kind of itching that makes you lose your MIND.  Ever had chiggers? Insects that live in tall grass and burrow into your skin?  It is WORSE than chiggers.  \n\nYou have to ask the doctor.  It is embarrassing, it sucks, and you have to do it anyway for your future.  Maybe you can write it down ahead of time? I have done that for some difficult things that I wanted to be sure I communicated clearly, even if I got upset or embarrassed. Bullet points, brief and clear.  You can hand the doctor the paper and then the doctor can decide what to do from there.\n\nThere are possible normal reasons.  Could be smegma. Could be yeast. Could be nothing at all, if they are just spots that are not hurting or itching.  Maybe your growing and changing skin just ... makes spots.  \n\nIt is your doctor's job to take your concerns seriously.  It is your job, as you come of age, to take responsibility for your body.  You will want to have a sexual relationship someday. You MUST get an answer for your concerns now, so that your future someday is secured.  \n\nIt would be nice if you could trust your parents to have your body's health as its primary interest, but it is really hard to be a teenager and talk genitals with parents.  If that is too much - just take it to the doctor.  They will listen.  They will explain.  They will help.  And if for some reason that doc does not, find another one.  You can still walk into a Planned Parenthood for help with something like this.  Without your parents.\n\nStop looking at the internet for answers.  It will just freak you out. LS is super unlikely. You have to suck it up and ask (or pass a note to) your doctor. Thanks. It only started itching down there a few minutes ago when I started to think about it since apparently one of the symptoms was itching but otherwise I have never had itching in my foreskin exept in really rare cases for a few seconds but idk if that has anything to do with it.\n\nThe spots do not come off when I clean myself and I noticed that a small part in the head of my penis has like the similar kind of cloudy white ish part in the head. That and the white spots that take a really long time to spread are the only ones that point to it. Itching does not really happen and I pee fine I think although I may have gotten used to that but I am going to try to not be paranoid about that Self-diagnosing is your worst enemy.  You are making yourself sick with fear over what is ultimately nothing but some white spots at this point.  Skin does all kinds of crazy things and most of those things are completely benign.  You will not know anything until you talk to a doctor and get a proper exam.  So long you are not having symptoms other than spots or even mild occasional itching, you will be fine to wait and bring it up at your next appointment.  But do bring it up at your next appointment.  Doctors have to deal with all kinds of weirdness, so do not be embarrassed.  It is not a big deal to them. Ok thank you. I have felt pretty down about this lately so I lowkey started thinking of some pretty dark things but this made me hopeful it is nothing", "Showering? Hi (22F). I was officially diagnosed yesterday with LS and it is been a rollercoaster of emotions - relieved I have an answer and sad that it is another autoimmune condition. Been getting various steroid/antibacterial/anti fungal creams and ointments for the past 4 years while Drs passed me about without a clue as to what it was. I am fairly clued up on what it is, and treatments and symptoms etc but one thing I am not sure about is showering. I use prescription Dermol 500 soap substitute that my Drs and gynaecologist want me to use and I do not use perfumed things or any scrubby shower stuff.\n\nI have been told how to dry and wash etc but I do not know how frequently. Any advice? Should I wash daily to keep it clean or every second day to avoid irritation? What do you lot do? 36M, I generally shower 1-2 times daily, due to workouts, and reapply the creams after bathing. I dont think the frequency matters too much tbh, it seems to be more about keeping the irritants/urine off the skin and the medication on. Someone with longer term experience may be able to provide better info. Thank you so much for your response, all input is welcome! I may shower twice then on days I go to the gym and see how I get on :) I agree with answer given. It is important the ointment stays put so I only use hypoallergenic soap on days before applying and just rise and pat dry on other days. I am at twice a week with my treatment plan. Since I get sticking and tearing out a piece of glans I keep lubricated with vaseline if it gets too dry and feels like it will stick. Obviously as a woman your issues will be different but I hope this helps. Keep away from water based creams and lubricants. I see, that is also really good input which will help me :) The rinse and pat dry thing might be good too so I will not disturb the skin too much! Thank you! Your washing schedule will be very individual depending on how your skin reacts. I shower every other day unless I have been doing activities that make me sweaty or dirty. I only use water for cleaning the genital area. My LS is relatively mild currently, so I only use topical ointment 2x a week. I pat dry after showering. I use a moisturizer afterward (and daily) to help prevent skin sticking and provide a bit of a barrier. I do a soak in the bath daily, however. Mine is fairly calm at the moment but I am getting started on dermovate so it will be 2 times daily for a month then once a day for a month then twice a week for a month then they are going to see how I get on without it for a month and then I see my gynaecologist again for a review. Thinking I will be having a shower daily even if it is just to rinse down there :) thank you for your recommendations! That is pretty much what my doctor had me doing with clobetasol when I was first diagnosed in 2016..You will find what works best for your situation as far as cleaning. The other support groups I am in also gave me some good ideas for helping with care of my LS. My doctor really does not give much info. Did not answer your question on how frequently to wash ! Once a day when showering either wash or rinse as above. If I miss a day it does not seem to affect me. I try to keep ointment on for as long as possible after application.", "What sport can you practice ? Hi everyone,\n\nI just had the diagnostic , and I want to know what kind of sports I can practice (like running, and cycling). I always did a lot of sport, and I do not want to stop that. What kind of sport do you all practice ? I do not see how it would be a problem in any sport or activity. At it is worst point, before I got treated, it did not hinder me from biking or running . I am mostly a gym rat, and quite a bit older than you. I wonder if the pressure of a bike seat might irritate too much. I also kayak, and have had to issues with that.", "I have not been to the doctor but believe i have bxo So i have been researching as I have noticed over a year almost that the skin at the end started to get smaller. I havent expirienced rash or irritation yet but i am confused on what to do. I havent been to the doctor. Im 19 and my exams start in a few days. Do not know if any cream might help or make it worse I have been using soap and water for a few months. Does any one have tips in lifestyle i should follow and their expirience... im literally any help is helpfull. Mate go see the docs\n\nAs for LS you shouldnt use and soap or cream on it. I think you get soapless cream can use that.\n\nOther than that use water only and see doctor asap Ill go after my exams.. Can emollient worsen it? That might be fine actuslly. Dont use anything which will irritate it! Easiest way is just use water How long will it take? Do not use hot water, as cool as you can handle and if you need something to soothe the irritation before you see the doctor I recommend La Roche Posay Cicaplast B5 balme. Use after washing. I do not know if it is easily accessible where you are but where I am from it is available in most pharmacies. My dermatologist recommended it to me. It is a muscle like any other.  Stretch it lightly morning and night. Just like any other muscle: stretch I til you feel it, not so much it hurts. \n\nWhether it is bxo or something else, stretching can keep it at bay as you get through other stuff Why does it have to be cold? Will do so thanks! Hot water can irritate it", "Prescription question I got prescribed clob, and I am a little confused about something. On the box and phamplet that came with it, it says use it twice daily for 10 days. I contacted my OBGYN and they said I can use it for 7-14 days depending on how I feel. I feel pretty okay, and they said I can go down to once a day until I get back to them in Janurary once I get feeling consistently good.\n\nI usually see people talk about their treatment being 2 weeks long. Is mine unusual or can it vary for different people? I am at about the day 9 mark, and I am feeling pretty good. I am having occasional flares that I really think are triggered by something I am eating (that is a work in progress).", "New diagnosis, am I on the lucky side for now? Hey all, 33/M. Perianal LS with no symptoms, which I understand is very rare in men for some reason. It begins above the anus, goes around on one side and barely onto the perineum about an inch around. Still a good 4 inches plus from the scrotum, no penile involvement. Very occasional slight itching but no sores or cracking, pain etc. Appearance has not changed at all for a couple years that I can tell. (It is only visible to me when turned around with a foot on the counter looking backwards) I just brought it up to the GP out of curiosity.\n\nThe Dermatologist was surprised to see this presentation in an otherwise healthy, relatively young male, but said to use the steroidal ointment and it will most likely lessen in appearance. Said if there is no symptoms it really is not a big deal. \nAny advice on soap? Is Hibiclens a good idea or too strong? I just do not want it to get worse... Is it likely to spread as I age?\nI read some of the experiences you all deal with here and I am humbled. I did not realize what a struggle it is for some.", "Clobetasol frequency To anyone here that used clobetasol, how often?\n\nFew times a week?\n\nFew times a month?\n\nEvery few months? Once it is under control I use it as required. But it was once a week/fortnight previously. Thank you. Do you find that when on a schedule like once a week, by the end of the week, your symptoms start to become noticeable again? I have been diagnosed for close to 10 years now. So at the beginning I did the cycle but now I do it when it flares. I personally decided I would rather let it flare every now and then instead of always applying the cream - some of the time it can be fine for months, usually just need it after sex. I was prescribed a different steroid but told to taper down to 1-2xs per week. I imagine the \"target dose\" for Clobetasol is pretty similar. If that does not do well enough for you, you should talk to your doctor about switching up the schedule it using an add-on (depending on what would work best for you).\n\nUnfortunately, if you have had it for awhile it is likely lifelong treatment but 1-2xs a week sounds doable to me (and my brain is swiss cheese and some topicals I just do not tolerate day in and day out). Generally you start with twice a day for a month, then once a day for a month, then every other day for a month, then once to twice a week indefinitely with more frequency during a flare.\n\nWith a steroid like clobetasol, it is important to taper your usage or you can have withdrawal symptoms that include redness and burning, so you do not want to go from twice a day to once a week right away. Also, with a condition like LS, you can progress \u201csub-clinically\u201d which means that you might have inflammation in lower layers of your skin that do not actually cause symptoms. Maintaining steroid use can prevent this progression and helps prevent cancer.", "Dos and do not during sex? I am a male without LS. However my partner and love of 6 years plus has been diagnosed with LS for some years now, and lately sex has become worse and worse for her. She experiences pain upon entry, usually we try 2-3 times before I can fully penetrate. Also after we finish and I pull out she usually experiences bad pain there as well. I never want to make her feel like she is obligated to have sex with me and I hate hurting her, even if it is unintentional. This has caused our sex life to become almost non existent and it bothers both of us. \n\nShe is very intelligent and educated about what she can do to help her condition. She always uses lube, and I tell her to inform me as soon as it becomes unpleasant. However, I was wondering what I can do on my part. Less foreplay? More foreplay? Certain acts I should avoid all together? I know each individual is completely different and I appreciate any advice at all. I really hate not knowing the kind of pain LS causes and making her feel like she is not enough. Is she using any medication? \n\nA lot of women use emollients and dilators to help stretch the damaged skin and get it used to penetration. \n\nUnfortunately a lot of women also are not able to have enjoyable penetrative sex and couples have had to explore other ways of fulfilling those needs. Usually lots of foreplay, etc without penetration I am in the exact same position. Girlfriend is VERY knowledgeable and has tried basically everything discussed on this site. She has had some long term progress as it has not gotten worse but a stressful week can bring a flare up that will set her back.\n\nWe both want sex but LS causes so much pain that it completely robs the act of any enjoyment. So much so that it is been a year since we have tried. We are very open on the subject, but I am careful not to pressure her into doing something that will set back. Primarily I want to know what I can do to support her, but also curious what others do to make sexual play more enjoyable. I am in the exact same position. Girlfriend is VERY knowledgeable and has tried basically everything discussed on this site.

Primarily I want to know what I can do to support her, but also curious what others do to make sexual play more enjoyable. I have had LS for 16 years, and it is great to see supportive partners. (Mine is as well.) But... our sex life has changed a lot over the years and LS destroys so much. I still miss the fact we cannot be spontaneous like we once were, and honestly it is a grieving process for both of us. \n\nI do not have a lot of advice other than to explore plenty of options sexually, and maybe even take PIV off the table for a while to let that inflammation calm down and just eliminate the pressure she might be feeling ... which breeds stress... and flares the LS. We focus on oral, lots of mutual masterbation, and have increased our toy collection for both of us. It is not exactly the same, but at least we feel like it has not robbed us of all enjoyment. Because (as you say) everyone is body IS different, it is really hard to advise. \n\nIn my case, shorter duration of penetrative sex is better. I know most people are rooting for the opposite. Not me!\n\nOnce pain starts? Stop penetrating. Not multiple tries to be able to handle pain. Pain means penetration is over. It does not get better. \n\nThat does not mean sex is over. Love oral. Hopefully you already do. Hopefully she already does. I suspect it goes a long way in avoiding the shitty feeling of stopping when a beat later you are down on her or if she is not wanting that yet she just switches to very enthusiastic fellatio.  Again speaking for myself, seeing zero trace of resentment or unhappiness that the whole PIV thing did not work out is huge. If you are genuinely thrilled that you got blown instead and feel just as close after, that is the good stuff. That assumes you guys have worked out good head, and I hope she would get the same treatment when not in pain. She does use a ointment daily. I forget the name. Exactly. It is really not enjoyable for either of us if it hurts her. She is cried after sex before and I feel like a horrible person when she does. That is good advice, thank you. I am open to trying anything to please her needs. I just hate the feeling of not satisfying them. I am open to doing anything for her. That is good advice thank you! I thought of another thing. For me personally, there is a lot of food that causes my inflammation to be a lot worse, which obviously leads to more pain, and less sexual comfort/satisfaction. A great thing that me and my husband did together was an elimination diet. \n\nIt is a little difficult because you basically eat none of the known offenders for a month and then there is a lengthy reintroduction period for foods that might be causing problems. We were living together and sharing all meals, but he was really supportive and pushed me through it. I learned a lot of the things that I need to stay away from (eggs, refined sugar or just too much sugars, gluten) and he learned things that trigger his own allergies. Then supporting me as we changed our eating habits was super helpful. I say this because when I eat better, I do go into remission and we are able to do a lot more sexually. But that is definitely the long game... The real needs are in full acceptance and love. It is corny, but in the end, what is better? The orgasm itself? or the being together after, excited and happy and clinging together breathing fast and giggling and being too ticklish and maybe a little sleepy all wrapped up intimately together, and so happy you are?\n\nIf you are both so happy you are, then everybody\u2019s needs are met. I definitely agree the orgasms are a part of it. Resenting or wishing it could be accomplished otherwise is what ruins it. Married 18 years, my wife has probably had LS for all that time, but was only diagnosed in 2014. That was probably 3-4 years after the last time we had PIV, her LS is too far advanced to respond to clob now. Communication is key, you need to ask what is okay *before* you try it. \n\nAnd please keep those communication lines open. Between like 2006 and 2014, I had no idea what was going on. I only knew I could not touch her at all sexually and it made me really sad. I am still sad now but at least I know why. \n\n\n\nBoth amazing resources for LS, how to manage, get the proper care &amp; enjoy sex again. Do not give up! Focus on healing, maybe getting a better medical provider who is more knowledgeable on current LS research!! Wow. Thank you very much! I will share these with my partner for sure. Everyone is help has been really appreciated!", "Heal skin options Hi are the any other options than steroids to maintain but to rebuild/ rejuvenate the skin? Thanks Silver biotech makes a healing cream with colloidal silver.  It helps a lot If you are a woman, you could look into estrogen cream as an option with your doc. Emu oil and coconut oil have some benefits. My doctor also suggested using almond oil (or coconut oil) and estrogen cream. Being a male I do not think I can take estrogen. Thanks for the replies so far but are these just to maintain or to rejuvenate? Right. I was not aware. Good question. I am not sure. How did it help? Reduced white patches and increased elasticity.  I find daily use very helpful", "Pretty sure this is LS.. (20y old guy)  Since about a year I have been getting constant itch, burn and redness over my penis, there've been red rashes and tightness in a ring like manner under my glands after masturbation or sex, red bumps and kind of like \"scratched\" skin. Skins been tighter too. I do not use lube but I never did before either. Recently I started noticing white patches under my glands. Do not know what u guys thing but I am pretty confident its LS.\n\nThe white patches disappear as soon as there is some blood flow down there but I guess that does not mean much if its half whit when flaccid.  \n\n\nEdit: I have been tested for STDs and it was all clear a while ago. From pics it looks normal.\nIf it is LS it wont change with blood flow.\nMind you i am not a dermatologist. Mine looks very similar to this. Have a appt with a derm in December to check if it is LS. I know, I will have dermatologist look at it either way as soon as I can since there is something going on down there either way. But yes, if penis is not flaccid I cannot see white patches, the more blood that goes down there, the less I can see it. Since you said you have a same thing, I checked out your page and on post caught my attention. \" Balanitis at 17y old, nothing helps\"  \nI am not circumcised but for the past 8ish months, I have been suffering exact same symptoms as you are.

Best of luck", "Can a walk in clinic help? I believe I have LS. From what it looks like I believe it might be LS. My question will a walk in clinic be helpful in prescribing me the steorid ointment, or would I have to see my family doctor? Find a doctor who has some understanding of the skin condition. I see a doctor in a sexual health clinic as that whole area is there area of expertise. My gp would not know enough about the condition to give as much advice and to be able to monitor it as well.  Like the other commenter said, find someone that might have a little knowledge about it. I went to my gyno and she ended up telling me to see a dermatologist and they were the ones to prescribe me my steroid cream and yeast infection pill.  I got lucky at my walk in clinic. The doctor there had heard of LS and have me some steroid creams that helped a lot. While the steroids helped at first it is not a permanent fix...eventually he was able to refer me to a fun I for better care (which took months to go through...I am finally getting my appointment in July)", "Coconut oil: am I doing it wrong? Why am I extra itchy? 27F Hi all!\nMy doctor said to start applying coconut oil to my vulva twice a day. It seems to have helped the fissure heal, but last night (day 2 of coconut oil) I got itchy as soon as I applied it before bed. Is it a bad idea to apply it immediately before bed? For those of you who use it, how much do you apply? Maybe the issue is because I only shower every 2 days... idk how often you have to wash it off, like maybe the coconut oil makes extra lint stick to my skin or something. To be honest a LOT of creams make me kind of itchy if I apply them to my vulva, like a compounded estrogen/testosterone cream my doc gave me for sex pain last year and even regular hydrocortisone 2% that I have tried for vaginitis. I do not think coconut oil itself is the problem. I just want to make the coconut oil work so I can get some relief for now. If anyone has tips on how to tolerate oils and creams better I am all ears! FWIW I have coconut oil in a separate container in my bedroom and there is no evidence of food contamination. You can also use A&amp;D ointment I use that and it definitely helps. You could some of that with coconut oil that way it is not directly on your skin. I have to do that for awhile. Just commiserating..because coconut oil works for me sometimes and sometimes it just makes me super itchy..I cannot figure out why. I keep a separate non contaminated jar in the bedroom too. I have experienced similar issues with other creams too. I do not get the connection. It is just picky/temperamental I guess. When it is really bothering me I just wash it off and try again the next night..usually without issues\n\nEdit- I have noticed a connection between using it after my skin is unusually sore from the day and it itching. I wonder if it gets in superficial cuts or something My doctor suggested using coconut oil too and I had  similar results. It itches more and does not seem to work. I use aloe Vera gel now. It works perfectly. It works so well that I only apply it once a day (plus after showers). But be careful to buy pure aloe Vera gel. Mine has like 99% aloe Vera and 1% water. My doctor recommended Vaseline and it works well for me. Perhaps you could try that instead. seconding A&amp;D! that has helped me too Thanks all! I will pick up a couple of those suggestions next time I am at the store! Seconding aloe vera gel - the most natural you can get, the better.  I was using my plants, but twice a day every day was eating them up faster than I could grow them.  Coconut oil just does not do it for me. Which brand of aloe Vera do you use? I am having trouble finding one without additives I am from Germany. The brand is called h\u00fcbner. I am not sure if you can get it elsewhere. :/", "Diagnosed 4 years ago.. labia shrinking. Help? So i was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus on my vulva with a biopsy about 4 years ago. I got clobetisol(?) Steroid ointment which has long since been tossed out (somewhere during 2 moves) because it went dormant. \n\nThen it reappeared a couple months ago when i was having ovarian cyst issues (surely coincidental) and my labia minora have been tearing really easily. \n\nI just found out I am almost 5 weeks pregnant and its seems to have kicked it into overdrive as my labia minora are shrinking so fast! \n\nI do not have insurance until december because i started a new job so I am considering going to the gyno and paying out of pocket for more ointment. \n\nIs there anything i can do to slow or stop the progression besides steroids? \n\nI am really freaking out. I do not have a tonne of suggestions but here are day to day things that help me: \n-Nothing scented that comes in contact with you. Laundry detergent, body wash are both big ones for me\n-probiotics: high doses or probiotics seem to help my symptoms \n-protective barrier cream: use something like coconut oil as a barrier on your skin to protect it. \n\nYou could ask a pharmacist about a steroid cream, I am sure there are some out there! Just for personal comfort I soak in a warm bath with baking soda added then apply aloe Vera or coconut oil afterwards. Only wear breathable cotton undies and no liners or pads. I personally did not have any relief from OTC creams but some women do. \n\nI was recently in the same boat and did not have insurance for 6+ months while my hubby was between jobs. Just this week I was able to see the dr and get more clobesatol. Hang in there and see your doc ASAP! Nothing compares to the comfort of the Rx", "Vegetable shortening vs. organic, unrefined coconut oil vs. vitamin E oil I recently switched from Vaseline to vegetable shortening since my dermatologist advised as it contains no preservatives or additives. I am finding it difficult to apply since it is solidifies at room temp.\n\nIt is hard to figure out what is best with so many different products out there.\n\nWhat moisturizer do you use?", "Confused, emotional, so low Hi all, \n\n(28 female) For many years I have suffered with itching, burning, tears and slight bleeding. I never ever ever knew this was a sign of LS, I always dismissed it for a water infection, , thrush, rough sex etc. \n\nI am HPV positive and have been for 2-3 years now. \n\nMy DR spotted white skin patches and rawness on my vagina. I have had to get 2 biopsy\u2019s and am waiting on results. This is either LS or HPV. When I visited the gyno, she said it looks like I have had HPV for several years, she also said LS is causing my vagina to fuse together. I feel physically sick, I am single, I feel like this is never going to get better. I can barley put a finger inside of me without being in so much pain. \n\nWhat should I expect from the biopsy? \nIs LS linked with HPV? \nMy bloods have also came back with a rise in LH levels, could this be caused due to pre-menopause? \nHow common is LS to people in their 20s? \n\nMy mother went through menopause in her early 30s. \n\nI have so many questions and am so confused I do not even know where to begin writing this!! I just want to start off by saying I am so incredibly sorry you are having to go through all of this but I am glad you came here for some support because we are all very happy to listen and help where we can! \n\nFrom a quick search online I found various medical reports on the possible link between an LS diagnosis and HPV however I am by no means qualified to say anything for certain. \n\nYour symptoms are almost exactly what I have suffered from for the past 4+ years so LS sounds likely but I suppose you will have to wait and see what the biopsy results return. \n\nFrom what my gyno told me, LS is most common in post menopausal women and if it is to appear in young people it is usually around the age of 3-5 years. It is not entirely common for 20+ year olds etc but it is not wholly uncommon either (I am 22F btw). \n\nIf it is LS do not worry too much as there is plenty of treatments your dr can get you to try and I am sure you will find one that works for you. As for the fusing I believe a few people in this group have tried dilators to help open up scarred vaginal openings etc. I personally have been advised to have regular sexual intercourse or if that is not an option (which for me it is not) to regularly use a vibrator/dildo. I recommend consulting your gyno for your best course of action and for assistance on the excessive scarring that is happening. \n\nI hope this response has offered you some comfort and encouragement that LS is manageable and you will not be in pain forever! Any other questions I will try my best to answer them :) Thank you. The most worrying part for me I think is that the vagina can fuse together. Is is true that creams can stop this from happening? And does everyone with LS have the fusing issue? That part came as a shock to me too, but my gyno has told me that if you take preventative measures to keep the shape of the vagina open then you can really help yourself should it decide to start closing. Using potent steroids like Dermovate ointment (clobetasol) is supposed to really make an improvement in the skin and in turn help to prevent the skin from fusing. Fusing does not happen overnight so you will have time to seek help for it before it goes too far. And I read that if it does there is surgeries they can do to fix that issue (albeit it does not sound very pleasant but it is a solution nonetheless!) Try to focus on the here and now and not worry about what could happen or it will drive you crazy. Just take whatever treatment you get given very seriously and work closely with your dr and you should be able to avoid worsening of symptoms :) Today was going to be first positive day and I have cried already \ud83d\ude02 I am the worst person to adapt to change so this is something which is going to take a long time to accept I suppose. Still waiting on my results so could be dealing with way worse in a few weeks. 1 day at a time though. \n\nYou are so positive, I will try to take a leaf out of your book \ud83d\ude4a \n\nThanks so much for your time! That is kind of you to say \ud83d\ude02 I am not as positive as I seem but I do want you to know everything is going to be okay :) Crying does not mean you cannot have a positive day still! Get the sad out and continue on and be gentle with yourself! Here anytime you need! Oh gosh I have just seen you were diagnosed 13 days ago! I never realised sorry! \n\nI believe I have had this for several years also, so possible early 20s but never knew the symptoms could be so severe. \n\nIf you need anything or want to talk feel free to message me \u263a\ufe0f I am also in my 20s (27). I was just diagnosed a few days ago and I am completely at a loss too. I came to this forum because I am freaked out, and to be honest, some of the posts freaked me out even more. But at the same time, it is nice knowing that there are treatment options, and it is nice knowing you are not alone. Yeah they are others out there too who can help and give advice. I am still sore from my biopsy\u2019s and found that hydromel cream works better for me. The water based creams annoy me (as they squish about) I know that sounds horrid, sorry! \n\nI have not registered the LS diagnosis just yet as I am waiting biopsy results which could be cancer \ud83d\ude33   \n\nThey are scary posts but you got to be thankful you have caught this, I would have been none of the wiser as I did not know it existed and dismissed my itch for thrush, dehydration etc Thanks for the recommendation of hydromel! My biopsy site is still sore too, so I am going to have to try that. \n\nI do not think I have fully processed the diagnosis either. Once you find out your diagnosis feel free to reach out by message if you want to chat about coping mechanisms (I am working on focusing on healthy coping mechanisms\u2026), your fears (I have plenty), or anything else! I will do, you can also message if you need to chat etc. \n\nCan i ask, beside your biopsy do you have a lump which may have appeared? No, I do not have any lumps Ok thanks I feel you. I am sorry you are going through this. But there is treatment options available from what I read. The most difficult step is to find a dr who listens/knows about this disease. \n\nI have the same exact symptoms. I am waiting to finally go see a specialist in 3 months. What was your biopsy results if you have got them? I have been suffering this for over 4 years. My husband was in military so we have been outside of the country. So I have seen lots of drs but no one knew what it was. I was diagnosed with eczema, psoriasis, fungal infection \ud83d\ude1eNo one really tested anything. They all just looked at it and gave their opinions. Sent me home with bunch of useless medication. So now I have had further updates. \n\n2 biopsy\u2019s we are getting checked as my skin is placed is very pale. This came back negative to cancer (no confirmation of LS neither)\n\nI am waiting on my letter coming from the hospital but from what the receptionist read out there is no mention of LS. (Unless they can only tell you the food news on the letter and not bad news) \n\nI need to go back in for the camera up my vagina and I have an ultrasound booked for Saturday. \n\nI am assuming the camera is going to check my ovaries and cells internally. \n\nThe ultrasound is to check for poly ovaries (as this is what I initially went to the Drs for) \n\nDo you have pale patches too or just itching and inflammation? \n\nMy vagina is starting to fuse together so I am upset that they have not spoke much about LS, but to be fair I am hoping there is more information on my letter when it arrives this weeek  I had skin flaking for a very short period of time and that resolved on its own. But skin tears, mild bleeding, itching has not resolved for longer than 4 years. I got an iud placed and that is when it started for me. \n\nI got the iud taken out. Then two months later got my hormones checked. Seems like my hormone levels are normal. I was honestly so upset that they were normal because I am not feeling normal. It is hard to explain.", "New Diagnosis Hi everyone, \n\nI was just given a diagnosis of early lichen sclerosus based on a tissue biopsy of a tiny white bump.

It manifests as a white growth on the frenulum, which was written off as yeast for at least a couple of years.\n\nSince I have seen a sexual health specialist, they took a biopsy and confirmed it was LS, and now I am 3 months into treatment with once a day application of a steroid/antifungal ointment, and a twice daily wash using aqueous cream as a soap substitute. \n\nMy LS now looks 10 times better! Avoid soaps/body washes, especially those with fragrances as they can irritate it. Hey, my comment probably will not be much help but you are not alone. I am circumcised as well and relatively young.\n\nAs you likely know, as a circumcised guy, if sex can be a bit too rough, you can get little tears where the shaft skin attaches by the head of the penis. Well a few years back, It tore pretty badly. Never healed properly. I thought, for the last couple years I was just walking around with an un-healed wound. Long story short, that does not make much sense, and I think the damaged area that did not get to heal properly coupled with insurmountable stressed caused this. Waiting for a biopsy to confirm. It stings often, more so when urine passes over it. No sign of a wound, just white, thin, skin that feels like it has no 'stretch' to it. So now, good sir I do have a few questions:  \n\n\n1) Did your LS just develop randomly or do you suspect it is the result of some previous injury? From people i talk to it is 50/50. some people just develop it. some people, it came from scar tissue from pregancy wounds, sex injuries etc.\n\n2) ..what does it feel like? My burns/stings a bit. does not like urine passing over it. VERY occasionally it will itch - my instinct tells me the itch is a 'healing itch' but this is rare. Is yours fragile, white thin skin?\n\nOkay now for some potential solutions for you.\n\nAfter I completely stopped using soap, lotions etc the pain subsided immensely. seems everything irritates it. PLEASE PLEASE use caution using corticosteroids. Others on this sub cautioned me against it, and in my experience a steroid cream made it feel WAY worse, and probably damaged it more.\n\nI'n the last 3 months i have been religious with dabbing every bit of urine off each time I pee. Keeping the penis crisp and dry at all times. This simple change has reduced the pain a surprising amount. I am also quick to dry it immediately after a shower. I use rags I made from old micromodal/cotton underwear. I found tissue can irritate it.\n\nThe best solution to potentially reverse this that my research has showed me is a complete diet overhaul. No wheat, no sugar, no caffeine, no dairy. When I manage to eat clean for a couple months in a row, it (and everything else) does feel better.\n\nSorry for the long comment; bad habit of mine. Good luck; do not let these peculiar cards we are dealt get you down. Do your best to enjoy/appreciate life. Good to know you are feeling better :)  \nHave you considered any dietary changes?\n\nWhat is the sensation? stingy? burny? My diet is already fairly good so no, I am not all that interested at this point while my current treatment is working. If things change, it is something I will definitely look into!\n\nI only ever experienced itchiness, and the occasional burning, especially after urinating (though this burning was rare). Thanks! I have been avoiding soap since the diagnosis since I saw that, and have tried to just wear loose cotton. Aqueous cream? Is their something the specialist recommended? I have only talked to my regular doctor, do not know that he was super familiar with the condition. I first had a little irritation in the area after a bit of a friction injury. There was a spot that almost looked like a cut that would not heal, but it was just like an odd crease in the skin. Anyway, a little tiny white bump appeared, and I actually went to get checked assuming it was a wart. Biopsied it to check, the LS diagnosis caught me and my doc both off guard. I had not heard of it even when googling possible answers. Still not 100% convinced, but I think how it responds to steroids should be a clue. We will see!\n\nAs far as how it feels, I did not feel it most of the time before biopsy - now there is more persistent discomfort but it is hard to tell what is LS/what is the healing wound, you know? It would burn a bit with erections/after sex. Never really felt itchy. Overall things look normal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been doing the dabbing thing, I saw that some researchers think there is a connection there. I doubt there is a connection to my diet but am trying to think if I have started eating anything new/different since entering quarantine. I was doing a loooot of long distance running too, so not sure if that could have contributed. A lot of friction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the reply. Have a look here for some further info. It should be widely available worldwide, I would imagine! \n\nI have also used Sorbelene Cream as a soap substitute with no issues, also. Where I am from, my doctor prescribes it and it ends up being a quarter of the cost via prescription than it is over the counter. Have a look here for some further info.

Where I am from, my doctor prescribes it and it ends up being a quarter of the cost via prescription than it is over the counter. No problem man, and thanks for your reply too. Sorry if mine was a bit long!\n\nWhat you describe in the first few sentences sounds a lot like what went on with me initially...hmmm. I am at a point now that any positive diagnosis is better than the mystery, but yeah, sounds like I might have it.\nI am not sure if something specific in my (or your) diet caused it, but i have heard of a number of success stories of people clearing up all sorts autoimmune issues with strict elimination diets. Something i am strongly considering trying. Tends to feel better when I eat really clean.\n\nThe interesting thing about you saying you were doing long distance runnning...yes friction may be a factor, but what strikes me is although aerobic/cardio exercise is great, long distance running can damper your immune system...hmmm. One woman here linked her onset to getting multiple vaccines while she was travelling. As for me, I was a degenerate alcoholic when the this all happened, which of course just wrecks the immune system.", "Immunology - and first post My first post. \n\nFirstly, Hi all. \n\nSecondly, I would just like to briefly state why I am posting. \n\nI have had lichen sclerosus since I was about 14 years old (I am now 34). \n\nI have it on my penis foreskin and also my anal area. \n\nI have tried so many different creams and ointments over the years but nothing has cured the problem. \n\nInformation online seems to suggest that this is an autoimmune disease but my consultant dermatologist (who I see every 6months for check ups) thinks it is ''just part of me'' and that it would be best if I had a circumcision. \n\nI also have folliculitis decalvans on my scalp which started about 6 years ago, and a history of dermatitis (which rarely shows itself now). Folliculitis is mentioned online as being autoimmune in nature (a form of alopecia). \n\nEver since a young age I have suffered from chronic fatigue and terrible migraines. \n\nFor the longest time I have tried to get doctors to link up all of these health disorders and come up with a reason why it is happening in my body. Like most here I am prescribed steroid creams and ointments, and the offer of a circumcision for my LS. \n\nMy health problems have significantly shaped my life and I would be lying if I said that I have not felt held back or restricted. I have often felt trapped due to these conditions. \n\nGood hygiene helps the most - I have two showers a day (one in the evening, one in the morning). \n\nI do not use harsh soaps or sanitisers (organic soap bars). \n\nMy diet consists of mainly fresh fruit and vegetables and organic meat. \n\nI have been following a good diet for most of my adult life, and have tried just about every elimination diet there is with no obvious improvements. \n\nI have been tested for allergies and found to have allergies to various ingredients in common hygiene products (like sandalwood). \n\nMy conclusion after years of trying to find an answer to my underlying problems is that whatever is going wrong is most likely because of my immune system, and despite seeing so many healthcare professionals I do not think I have ever seen an immunologist. Has anyone here ever seen an immunologist, and how did you find it? This is why I am posting. \n\nI have not ruled out vaccine-induced autoimmunity in my case as I can pinpoint to the year when my body started acting up and it was when I got extremely ill (the same time I was vaccinated). \n\nI would really appreciate some thoughts on this.   \nThank you for reading, \n\nRip have you tried wiping carefully every time you use the bathroom?  i have had several men tell me this was a great help for their penile LS. I have LS and also suffer from chronic migraine and some fatigue. I just recently got blood work done to check my immune system and came back positive for ANA (Anti-nuclear antibody) so basically there is something going on with my immune system. I had a doctor appointment with a Rheumatologist &amp; he thinks my positive ANA labs is likely related to my LS diagnosis, and nothing more serious. That being said, it defiantly is an autoimmune disease &amp; we have a higher chance of developing other autoimmune diseases. As for the migraines, he does not believe they are related. I would have some additional blood work done to eliminate any other autoimmune diseases going on just in case. Hi again. \n\nThank you for your thoughts, both of you. \n\nIn terms of hygiene - the consultant dermatologist mentioned on one of my visits to carefully wipe the excess urine and make sure to properly drain any urine from my penis every time I go, and that is certainly helped a lot. It definitely does help eliminate any itching. It is clear to him that the LS is still very active as he inspects it on every visit. So long as I wash the area twice a day I do not get any itching but the area is still always somewhat red and inflamed. It very seldom bleeds unless I am not looking after my hygiene. \n\nPooaige, that is good information. I am curious to know what lead up to having the ANA test and whether it was something that had to be suggested to the doctor or whether they volunteered the test themselves?  I do have the option of going back to my GP and asking for an ANA test, and to see a rheumatologist. \n\nWhat does a positive ANA test mean long-term? \n\nHas the rheumatologist offered any treatments now that there is a positive ANA test? I was diagnosed with LS by my gyno who did a punch biopsy. On my next yearly check up I had blood work done and she mentioned she would like to test my immune system since I already had a confirmed diagnosis of LS and struggle with migraines. It came back positive so she referred me to the rheumatologist. When he looked at my labs and we went over my symptoms, he did not believe any further testing needed to be done and assumed the positive was directly related to my LS. He did say that I am at greater risk to developing other auto immune diseases and to be caution if I start developing other symptoms. A positive ANA is usually a sign of an autoimmune disease or can also be of something more serious. It means my antibodies are high therefore my body is fighting something. It never hurts to check, you can just let them know you would like to check your immune system with some blood work to make sure you do not have other things going on besides the LS.", "Does the result of the biopsy says exactly what i have? When i receive the results from the clinic it will say exactly what it is? Or i need to go for an interpretation?? they should be able to tell you what it is right away. i was told over the phone that it was positive for LS &amp; then had a video conference to just kind of go over everything, what i should be doing &amp; gave me a chance to ask any questions i might have had.", "Dermovate under foreskin My doctors think I have LS and have prescribed a treatment of a soap substitute with dermovate ointment for 3 months.\n\nI have to use the dermovate once a day, but I was just wondering if it is normal for the ointment to not really completely dissolve or be absorbed by the skin? Ive been applying it under my foreskin after a shower and then pulling my foreskin up to cover the glans - but I find the glans will remain very moist for 24 hours until I shower again.\n\nIs this normal? It worries me I am creating like a warm moist environment for bacteria or anything like that. I have definitely been using the right amount (less than a full fingertip).\n\nAny advice or reassurance would be great. I do not know about the whole under the foreskin or not, as I do not have a penis - but the ointment does stay moist where I apply it, for quite some time/ most of the day if left alone. It does not happen like that with the cream version by the way. I prefer the ointment for this reason, it feels to me like it is staying and \u2018acting\u2019 on the affected skin for longer. That is pretty reassuring then - I am new to all this and I do not like the idea of steroid creams so I was worried about applying too much or too little, thanks! Yep, ointments are greasy like vaseline, whereas creams contain water, so creams will absorb better. Because creams contain water, they also need more preservatives so they can be irritating, hence the preference for ointments in sensitive areas like the genitals. Also, ointments are a little more powerful than creams because they form that lasting, occlusive layer. Thanks, that is a much more succinct and detailed explanation of what my personal experience with this has indeed been. One of my doctors prescribed the cream once, and it definitely absorbs quicker, but it just did not seem to be as effective \u263a\ufe0f You are describing the same approach I was told to use by my dermatologist. It worked for me. Good luck. Ointments are 80% grease base and creams 50% water approx.\nI am male uncircumcised and my LS does not like water. Even K-Y jelly which is water based turned my glans white ! My dermatologist recommended this to stop sticking of foreskin to glans. Now if necessary I use vaseline (reason for KY was cancer concern from vaseline) My betamethasone ointment is applied twice a week. Hence extra vaseline. \nHope this helps.\nBTW I have been on Betamethasone for nearly 2 yrs.", "Ok... can anyone please tell me if this is LS?????  NSFW please!!!", "Steroid ointment So I just got prescribed some clobetasol ointment and was seeing if that helped anyone? The other steroid CREAM did not. In the past year I have completely \u201clost\u201d LOL my lower inner labia and I just want hope. Blessings If it is the ointment (like petroleum jelly consistency) and not the cream, then yes it helped me immensely. It did take a while to start working though so do not be discouraged if you do not see any positive change right away! I was also prescribed a different steroid before clob (completely forget the name) but it did not help. It helped me dramatically. I went from years of awful itching and pain, pain, pain \u2026 to completely fine. In two weeks. Years of awfulness, just - done. Over. \n\nMostly. It still flares up now and then. Couple days of clob and it settles. \n\nHope it works as well for you!! Did you have an atrophy in tissue? If so did you get volume back? Thank you!!! Okay That makes me feel much better! So happy you are feeling better!! Yes it has helped with that but I have also been using estrogen cream to help the skin in that area become elastic and normal again. I would definitely recommend the combo! Ask your doctor about it :) it is fairly popular as an aid to get the skin back to normal. Yes! She said I did not need estrogen cream as well bc I have an iud which was a little confusing. I am crossing my fingers! Maybe get a second opinion! I have the Mirena IUD and my doctor said that did not matter! Thanks love! Hopping on to this comment to ask, my doctor has told me to use it for four weeks straight but I am really scared it will make my skin change drastically! Do you think 4 weeks is too long? I cannot really say! Two weeks at twice a day was enough for me. I have seen other people on here say their docs told them four weeks, once a day. Definitely more for the doc to say. The ointment is potent as heck, so generally you want the least amount that will cure you, but you want fixed!  If you are worried about it being too much, and you are doing great after two weeks, you could always call them and ask if you can back off since it has done such a great job. They might say no (why would you stop a drug when it is working??!) or might say to go for it and go back on if it flares back up. But really should be your doctor helping you with that one.", "Got the biggest tear I have ever had Last night I had intercourse with my boyfriend for the first time in 2-3 weeks. It was pretty rough as it had been some time (reasons other than LS). Close to being done I got that horrible stinging feeling down there and I knew right away I had torn. I stopped to check and there was blood on my fingers so I got up and grabbed my hand mirror and what I saw made me nauseas and gave me an instant hot flash. I have never torn so deep before, I could see my fatty tissue &amp; thought I needed stitches. Thankfully the bleeding stopped quickly and my boyfriend helped calm me down. He kept apologizing and felt super bad like it was his fault, poor guy. Now I am SO sore and sensitive down there with this huge cut. I just wish I could be normal and not have to worry about these things, it really is a mood kill :( Omg that sounds terrifying!!! Did you go to a doctor at all? Sounds like you should I am so sorry you experienced this! I definitely feel so frustrated when this disease gets in the way of having sex. It is so annoying! I hope you heal okay, it definitely sounds like a doctor should at least take a look, but I hope it turns out okay. \u2764\ufe0f sorry to hear this happened to you! This disease is the worst, but it is awesome that you have an understanding partner. Sending you healing vibes. No I figured since the bleeding stopped fairly quickly it would be okay, so far so good just letting it heal Thank you! It is extremely frustrating. Today is day 2 and it looks like it is healing and not bleeding anymore so I think it will be okay, but I will defiantly let my doctor know what happened.", "I am have a huge problem. So after having a big flair up I am using 3 ointments. During that time My sex drive was ok but since April it is like it disappeared over night and I do not know i left a message with my doctor still waiting has anyone else ever experience this issue.", "Does this lighter part beside my labia look like LS? No itching or tearing, some UTI type burning near my urethra occasionally but no UTI. ", "Emmolients and urine ", "Confusing diagnosis - what were your first signs? I am 32, female and a bit unhealthy/overweight at 200 pounds. I have had itching in my labia, clitoris area after a few bouts of BV and yeast. The positive BV and yeast was about 2.5 years ago and took a ton of antibiotics to try to rid the symptoms. They also told me at that time that I tested positive for ureaplasma, but told me that was not what was causing my symptoms. The other symptoms somewhat come and go, but the itching is just insane. I have been to 6 different types of doctors (gyno, specialist, dermatologist, allergist, GI doctor) none could figure out what it was. \n\nI have not dated or had sex much this entire time bc I feel so uncomfortable and lost my sex drive.\n\nThe specialist said it might be LS due to the description of my itching, but she saw no visible signs. What were your first indications? How do I know for sure? The medication they give does not stop the itching at all. Please tell me as much as you can about your experiences!! The 2.5 years of discomfort has been traumatizing enough and I am praying it is not LS. Get a vulvar biopsy whenever you are ready! That is the only way to know for sure and the best way to get started on treatment. I was nervous for the biopsy but it gives you some relief to at least know what is going on with your body. After using steroid cream, the itching has been more manageable for me. That sounds awful! Im sorry you are going through that bc there is nothing worse then those symptoms! When I was diagnosed I was super itchy and was at my urologist and just mentioned it in passing that Monistat was not helping my yeast infections. I was getting a catheter for my interstitial cystitis and while she was down there she instantly said you have LS, no question. She gave me a cream and I had instant relief. I would have flares with sex. I am not currently sexually active. But when I am I have flares. I saw another urologist and went for meds and she wanted to confirm the diagnosis, this was years later. So she did a punch hole biopsy (it was awful) and she confirmed the dx. I have white patches that I do notice sometimes. And there is a cream but I cannot recall the name. I will update when I find it but I do get instant relief. I am surprised you saw all those docs and they did not help!! Nothing more uncomfortable then that. I hope you get some relief soon. 40 M here. My first signs were small white patches that would open (fissure like) during sex. I am wondering if your problem could be lingering yeast infection. Maybe  cut out sugar/carbs and keep the area dry for a while. Apply some lotrimin or a similar type product and see if that helps. That is what I am hoping it is. I am trying to focus on my overall health (sugar,carbs, like you mentioned) in hopes it will get better. \n\nI am just not seeing any visible LS signs and my two gynos seemed to not agree with the \u201cspecialists\u201d diagnosis. I see her again in August and am going to ask for the biopsy to ease my mind! Thank you and I hope you have found relief in your journey! It has been so awful. Not knowing the cause of this is maddening. I do not want to go into all the mental health issues this has caused/played into, but I have to figure this out. \n\nI see the specialist again in August and am going to call ahead and make sure they are prepared to do the Biopsy, I need to know for sure! When you say \u201cflares\u201d is that flare ups of the itching? Or what are people referring to when they mention that. \n\nThank you in advance and it is so nice to have people to talk to about this :( Thank you! I am seeing her again in August and am going to make sure I get the biopsy!! The back and forth on theories is driving me crazy! \n\nHow did you find out? What were your first signs or symptoms? I am glad youve found relief! I can imagine! Before I was diagnosed I was also being misdiagnosed with bladder infections when I really had IC. This caused me to constantly be on antibiotics which lead to yeast infection after yeast infection and this lasted years until I finally found a urologist who took the time to listen to me. I was miserable and this takes a toll on your mental health for sure! Especially your sexual relationships. I was in my early 20s and miserable! \n\nAnd yea by flare I mean itchy. I will get super itchy and know it is a flare up. I try to also keep a thin layer \u201cbarrier\u201d of aquaphor to avoid any issues even when I am not having a flare up just in case! I have found that I rarely have any issues but maybe 1x a year now. Ugh I am so sorry you went through all this in your early 20s. I am in my early 30s so I keep just telling myself this cannot be it and this cannot be my reality. But it seems as it is. I just am scared that I am not doing enough or am causing harm by having this itching constantly. Idk it is hard to explain. Ughhhh I am honestly just so devastated over all of it, I do not know how I am ever going to date or have a relationship again, this has made me feel so uncomfortable and shut off. \n\nAnd yes, mental health wise, I have thought about suicide more times than i would like to admit over all of this. :( That is amazing that you have not had itching in a year!! I have not gotten this to subside much over the last two years and I have tried about 4-5 creams and an insane amount of antibiotics. I am going back to my normal gyno next week and want as much information and questions as I can gather to nail this down. He seemed to not agree with the specialists LS diagnosis so I am just still at a loss. The last two days I have been using mometasone bc I am paranoid things will get worse, but it also does not really help. Thanks for your support, I feel so alone. I am 26, also classified as overweight  (220 lbs). I noticed itching after I had my first child. This was at the beginning of 2015. I thought it was just chaffing, so I tried to be extra diligent in staying clean and dry. But at the time, sex became painful. I chocked it up to fluctuating hormones and powered through. After having my second child in 2017, the itching was worse and I could barely stand to have sex due to the pain. I went in for birth control in 2018 and my Ob/Gyn diagnosed me. Wanted to do the punch biopsy to be sure, but told me the name so I could look it up. I was relieved to finally have answers! The biopsy confirmed things and I started steroid cream stuff. I will admit I hated the initial daily application, but it helped! Went down to once a week, but had back surgery so stopped applying. Finally got back into it this year. Sex can still be painful so we try to use extra lube to ease things. Unfortunately sexual activity and my period make me more itchy. Wow! Thank you for sharing your story! If you do not mind me asking, Did you have any white patches? Or just the itching? Also, how has it affected your relationship with your husband? I have not dated at all going through this and that is been one of the most difficult parts. When you were off the cream did you have terrible itching? People seem to get this under control, and I have not had success with creams yet :( \n\nGoing To get the biopsy next month to be sure. My doctor said there was whitening but I cannot confirm or deny, lol. My husband was frustrated until I got diagnosed. We did not know why I was having pain and my denying sex constantly was making him grumpy. Now if I am having a \"flare up\", I tell him and we work around it.\n\nGoing off the cream did indeed bring back the itching.", "Male LS - Circumcision? I got diagnosed with LS maybe a year and a half go on the NHS.\n\nI was having frequent flare ups and was put on various steroid creams. The final steroid cream I was put on seemed to have stopped the flare ups and for about 9 months now, the only symptoms I experience is mild phismosis (and I have not been moisturising, which I should be!).\n\nDespite this, I recently had a follow up appointment on the NHS and I was advised to get circumcised. I was told that the symptoms are only dormant and they are likely to reappear at some point in the future. I was advised to get the operation sooner rather than later in order to minimise the risk of another flare up, which can occasionally result in permanent scarring.\n\nHowever, another consultant I saw privately advised me not to get circumcised and that if I got flare ups in the future, I could just have the operation then.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation and if you have any advice? Any help would be greatly appreciated!", "Thin Skin / Lichen Sclerosus Question  Hey! One suggestion I would have is to take a pic of your vulva. A few weeks later take another pic and compare. If you notice spreading of white spots, skin splitting, inflammation, then go back and see your dr before the 6 months. I wish I had seen how my LS was progressing but when I first started having it I was uninformed and had very little assistance from my then Dr. Thank you so much for your suggestion. You are worried about fusing but if it is LS, the medication prescribed will most likely help. Once I used clobetasol for 2 months the fusing I had around the clitorus went back to normal. Now I know what to look for and if I feel a flare up I can use my cream. This was incredibly helpful and thank you. I think I have not been able to find much about the fusing so it was likely more anxiety fueling my worries. At this point my gyno recommended a wait and see approach so I am not on any medication but so glad to hear it helped you. I am keeping a close eye on any changes though.", "Has anyone tried protopic and does it work for you? I was diagnosed with LS earlier this year and have been using clobetasol since then but as I cannot use it all the time I have also been prescribed protopic. The thing is I find it irritates my LS and causes a burning and itchy sensation. The pack says this can happen and stops after a few days but it is kind of put me off using it. Has anyone else tried it and does it work well for you? Are you using the clobetasol on a cycle? I use mine fortnightly but use it more often when my skin flares - tends to relate to my other skin issues.  I use it on average 3 times per week. I was using it every day but do not need it as much now. Hoping I will get to the point where I only need it every once in a while.  That is quite regular. Is it what you were instructed to do? My doctor started me weekly and said it is a pea sized amount and to move to fortnightly or every three weeks. When it becomes more irritated then use it more regularly. I have been using the cream close to 7 years now for reference.  Yeah I was initially prescribed once per day for a month, then every two days for a couple of weeks then twice weekly. Since then I have revisited my dermatologist (I have to go now ever six months for check ups) and was prescribed the protopic to use that twice daily for a week, then once ever two days and then a couple of times a week but was told to keep using the clobetasol as I need it. My LS was all over from urethra all the way to the back.

I had a gynecologist perform the biopsy but he is not well educated or familiar with LS. So tomorrow I am going to see a dermatologist for the first time. I know they specialize in all things skin related, and LS is a skin condition, but I am so nervous and feeling like a dermatologist is NOT going to be thrilled to have to look at a vagina.... With gynecologists, it is obviously expected with the nature of their work. But I feel like with dermatologist, seeing vaginas is probably not a super common occurrence... ugh \ud83d\ude29 I am only a month post-diagnosis and I already hate the embarrassing shame that I feel with this condition \ud83d\ude2d I see a dermatologist and there was no weirdness, it is all just skin to them. I work with doctors, they are strangely immune to feeling weird about any body part or function. I have seen both and I feel like the dermatologist was more well versed in the condition I went to a gyno for my initial diagnosis but she was a specialist I believe, not just run of the mill OB. I see a derm for vitiligo and I always mention that I have LS and they know what it is but have never asked further... My gyno seems really uneducated about LS so I see my derm  (who says she sees a bunch of patients with it). I hope that is the case for me tomorrow! Thank you! Thankfully my new family doc has just switched from gyne to family. But my gyne is also specialized in this. Explaining LS at an emergency room was fun - intake nurse had never even heard of it which was frustrating. Oh gosh! I am so sorry! I hope things are better now! The lack of knowledgeable professionals (in more rural areas especially) is frustrating! The gyno who did my biopsy said \u201coh I would bet money it is not lichen sclerosus! You are only 32!!\u201d ... \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude44 I have seen both. I find their knowledge is based on their experience of what they have personally seen, not their specialty. I was originally diagnosed when I was nine so that comment (bet money re: age) really irked me! Has anyone prescribed clobetesol yet? It is the magic ointment for my LS. Yes I have been using clobetasol 2x a day for just shy of two weeks. I do not have ANY itching tho. I never have. So the whole \u201cuse it during a flare up\u201d or \u201cas needed\u201d confuses me I think symptoms vary between people. I do not have a lot of itching. My clit hood just felt kind of stiff, and kind of looked like there was a pimple - which freaked me out and made me assume I was being unhygienic and had hardened smegma or a wart or something. I was actually glad to find out I was over doing the cleaning and there was no smegma or warts. Even that word grosses me out. Smegma. \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22 hey!\n\nI see a gynecologist, I feel that is the way to go. In no way have I ever been embarrassed when I go to see her. I would recommend seeing a gynecologist who is the same gender as you (in your case, a woman), as it helps with comfortability and confidence, at least for me. Please do not be ashamed, and good for you for taking the steps to see someone, whether it be a dermatologist or a gyn. Good luck! I definitely agree that it is nerve wracking to think about a dermatologist looking down there. But I have found that it is been so beneficial to be in care with a dermatologist versus a gynecologist because they have (in my experience) a lot more knowledge about the condition. My PCP initially referred me to a gynecologist, but she did not do much outside of prescribing an ointment that did not do anything for my symptoms. But my dermatologist was helpful from day one! Thank you! Yes, I actually already saw a derm and I 100% agree!!!! I am happy to hear that!", "advice needed hi ladies,\n\ni just needed to vent. im just at a loss right now and im dealing with so much. since january, i have been dealing with intense itching on the folds of my labia majora, that has just been awful, especially when im walking.\n\ni got a biopsy done, and it came up as early epidermal acanthosis and dermal fibrosis. no definitive diagnosis. of course.  recently, the itching has spread to the edges of my inner lips. UGH. i also experience burning sometimes too. it feels like im sitting on something sometimes?\n\n i have tried so many treatments and  last month i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease which has been so incredibly painful. i am recovering from that, and just got another biopsy done. the creams help but do not eliminate the problem.\n\ni guess what im asking is, has anyone experienced this, is this normal for LS? im not sure. thank you. New here. Do you live in a legal state? The only thing that put me in 100% remission was cannabis. I had to do it 3-4x/week and it took a couple months to work.  My Gyn actually noticed that I was in remission.  I had to get off of it and now my LS is back (because I have Kaiser and they do mandatory drug testing for prescriptions, so I am not allowed to use it unless I want to not be treated for my other health problems).  If I was really desperate I would switch insurance because that is how well cannabis worked. You could also try a topical but for me CBD did not work. I neeDED THC as well. I used to scratch so much at night that I would have blood and skin under my nails... it just made the itching worse since the skin was trying to heal. As you describe- sometimes it did feel like I was sitting on something hot. Walking hurt but helped \"scratch\" the itch, using tampons was awful (started using a menstrual cup), sitting was just as painful. But once I started Clobetasol it pretty much went away, almost instantly. I do get flare ups from time to time. I use CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser in the shower and I have noticed that is helped keep my skin from cracking but does not really do anything for the itching. But less cracking/flaking skin means less pain. My dermatologist recommended the CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser and said it was safe to use as a feminine wash. &gt;n 100% remission was cannabis. I had to do it 3-4x/week and it took a couple months to work.  My Gyn actually noticed\n\nWhen you say that you found cannabis was effective, did you mean a THC + CBD cream, or actually smoking THC? I smoked it (water bong) and sometimes took edibles, but I live in a legal state. My hypothesis is that it calms the immune system. My acne also went away completely. Not saying this would work for everyone obviously but it worked for me. I have found that eliminating dairy and a lot of sugar has helped me. I am a pescatarian that does not do dairy now. Also living in a drier climate is helpful. \n\nThanks for the heads up re THC!", "An update on mild LS (33m) So I posted several months ago and I just wanted to let you all know that in my case it has gotten better.\n\nI did not realize it until reading my own post again tonight.\n\nBasically the LS, as in the sclerosis (shrinking) of the skin is still there (although it seems to recess at times and deteriorate at others, but with a generally positive progression towards healing).\n\nIt did not itch for months too! It used to, once a week or so. It did not bleed or hurt for what feels like ages too. Overall extremely positive.\n\nAlso note that I still masturbate as much as I used to (once per day minimum... Dont judge me please ;))\n\nIn my mind, it could be linked to three things:\n\n1. Diet. Did not change what I eat, but eat every day on a restricted feeding window of 12 hours minimum, up to 20 once every other week I would say. I eat slightly less than before, overall.\nI am skinny and have always been, but I have not lost more than 1-2 kg.\nI did not really change what I eat, but have always avoided processed foods. I eat them once a week tops. All the rest is fresh, but can be strictly anything: gluten, lactose, meat (rarely), you name it (although I think it messes with my digestion).\n\n2. Sleep. I have been sleeping slightly better for these last six months. I am a big insomniac, always have been, and I used to sleep 6h on average I would say, at the time when I developped LS three yrs ago. I know sleep 7h on average, which is definitely not enough for me, but still is better.\n\n3. Therapy. I have been on therapy for years. Even before LS appeared. I am really not sure how much this has helped but I am a strong believer of the psychosomatic factor in auto-immune diseases. Also my therapy has indeed been going well these last six months, which has not always been the case, and my general attitude towards life has become slightly more enthousiastic, although I am still alone and sexless, as I have been since a bit breakup 4 yrs ago.\n\nAnyways, just my 2 cents to lift spirits a bit :)", "I noticed that there is ivory patches on the head of glans and same colors as circles on the sides of glans and i feel like they are getting bigger with time, they are not itchy and i often drip after i pee. please help i am so afraid and i want to know what is that and what is the treatment of it.  Bruh mark this nsfw Thank you for marking your photo as NSFW, per the other comment. \n\nThis is a reminder to read the rules of a sub before posting. We only have one rule right now and it looks like you broke it. \n\nI am fine leaving this post up since it now follows the rules, but it is always best to see a medical professional since we cannot diagnose you. Im interested in hearing an answer as well Document the progression and if you feel they are changing it would be a good idea to see a dr. If it is LS then a steroid cream is usually the best option. \nIt is probably a good idea to see a dr regardless if you are concerned. i saw a doctor and he told me it is nothing to worry about but i am still worried about it so much and i want to know if ls is begin like that and progress or it has different symptoms the doctor told me it is lichen planus not ls but i am worried", "Does this look like LS?  What makes you concerned for LS? I have on and off itching and burning and a tendency to tear after sex. Those symptoms sound like LS, but also a lot of other things. \n\nI do not see any of the characteristic white areas, but I am not a doctor and also sometimes there are not any obvious white areas. I would think eczema and lichen planus are also possibilities. The good thing is all three are treatable. Have you seen a gynecologist yet? If they were stumped, I would hope they would refer you to a dermatologist or a vulvar specialist. Thank you so much for your reply! That is really reassuring! I went to my GP who said she reckons it is not. They would not let me see a dermatologist because they thought I was being silly so I have been referred to a gynaecologist but the appointment is not for a month. Are you on birth control? My obgyn suspected LS but turns out it is probably my hormones out of whack. My biopsy confirmed it is not LS. I was on it for one month about three months ago and have not been the same since Wow, I am sorry to hear that about your GP. There is nothing \"silly\" about wanting a solution to itching, burning, and tearing. Sadly, GPs typically cannot handle these kinds of things. Does your insurance require referrals? It is possible it is not a dermatology problem, but hopefully the gynecologist will know whether that is likely enough to see a derm. Vulvar disorders are caught in a weird overlap between gyns and derms anyway. What are you doing in the mean time to soothe the itching/burning? At the moment I am just being careful to wear cotton underwear and use Vaseline. I do not want to put too much on my vulva because I want any evidence to be present when I have my appointment with the gyno I recently went through my underwear drawer and took out the non-cotton ones, which was most of them :( \n\nI have heard sitz baths, potentially with colloidal oatmeal, can be a nice palliative for these kinds of itchy things. And of course washing only with warm or lukewarm water and gentle soap or no soap. I think oral antihistamines can also be a good option for the worst times, especially if itching bothers you at night. It could possibly be the culprit, it takes quite some time to regulate hormones after getting off it. If you are dry, I suggest using Aquaphor. It helped me so much. Could that still be the case if I was only on it for a month? I am not too sure, but if you are saying your symptoms started when you started it then it is quite possible. It still takes over your hormones. If you really want to know for sure, try to have a biopsy. Gp here.  Normal female anatomy. You are a hero! Thank you so much \ud83d\udc96 Had your vagina always had the white on the outside like outer layer. Mine has that and I am worried It always has", "Anyone had clitoral atrophy or fusion but fixed it? I am scared what is happening is irreversible and nobody has diagnosed me yet but my clitoris is changing and losing sensation!! What do I do do you have facebook? i am in a group over there with some great ladies that could rly give you some good advice on this! Can you send me a link!!?  I would also like to know this, since I am pretty sure mine is fused. Wondering if it is possible it could un-fuse with treatment.\n\nIt sucks that you are losing sensation. Is it possible that the stimulation you prefer is just changing? I know I prefer deep stimulation; I cannot get anywhere with shallow stimulation. I sometimes wonder if that is partly due to the way my prepuce is. I used to like any time of penetration but now only feel deep.... Just had the Tulip done and Dr Coyle unfused my clitoris. Mine was partially fused a d I had fusion in other places. So this is a really late response and possibly TMI-\n\n\\- but what I meant by 'deep stimulation' was not deep in the vagina, but deep tissue massage on my clitoris like with a rumbly vibrator with a large head, like the hitachi, or a strong bullet vibrator. Or for fingers, deep massaging rather than rubbing. I cannot tolerate rubbing at all. It is hard to state clearly what I mean by massage vs rubbing. One way of explaining it is if you hold your arm bent at the elbow, the skin at your elbow is tight, and you cannot move it much and just end up applying friction to the skin if you rub it. But if your arm is straight, the skin is loose, and you can move the skin around, and rub your elbow bone, without putting any friction on the skin. The latter is the type of 'deep' stimulation that works for me, where the loose-ish skin is the hood around my clitoris. \n\nAgain, sorry if TMI, but I wanted to post in case it ends up being useful to you.", "Is this lichensclerosus or vitiligo?  I am 26 male who is  circumcised at birth.The glans started to become white a month ago.I do not feel any pain when I touch it. I have health anxiety so if anyone can help me I would be appreciated. I also went to urologist and dermatologist, they said it is vitiligo and stress is the cause of it. It does not look like LS. As a man circumcised at birth, LS is a lower probability diagnosis in any event. I think you should be able to relax but revisit with the dermatologist if anything changes. I wish you all the best. Thank you so much.I will definitely see another dermatologist. Agree. Does not look like my LS.\nGood luck.", "Frustrated at setback (22F) Recently been diagnosed with a suspected case of LS. Going to see my normal OBGYN (saw another one when i was diagnosed). I have probably had it for many years, but recently had my first \"actual\" flare-up. I know I am lucky that I do not have that much scarring/atrophy because I never had a bad flare like this and I got seen and diagnosed very quickly.\n\nBut MAN, I was about a week into my treatment and feeling on the mend, then I had a major stress-casuing event in my life for a few days (completely out of my control) and sent me right back to square one. Today has been the first day I have not felt THAT bad again but the LS has spread to my back end and that does NOT feel good. Passing gas has never felt so threatening before.\n\nI am bummed and frustrated that I was doing so well and then I had the event happen and it trashed my progress. The one thing I am still happy about is that it has \"brought back\" some of my labia minor lips. A small amount, but nice nonetheless - the very top of them under my clit had begun to fuse, but has now become unfused, if that is the right word for it.\n\nI had gone for having one flare a day maybe to having multiple. Trying to keep my hopes up but it is hard when I am miserable :( One day at a time, I guess!", "Best birth control? (22F) Hi everyone! \nAfter 7 horrible months of being on birth control and simultaneously itching from my vulva to my anus like crazy, I was finally diagnosed with lichen sclerosus. My doctor believes the birth control may have disrupted my hormones enough to the point where it triggered the early onset of lichen. I was on the combo bc pill for 4 months then switched to the mini pill. In anyone else\u2019s personal experience, what was the best birth control for them? \nThanks! Looks like \u201cliterally anything else\u201d for you. \n\nBest birth control is a long term monogamous relationship with a man that has had a vasectomy!!\n\nNot practical at age 22, but at least you have something to look forward to. \n\nYour doc will have the best advice, but my next stop would be looking into a copper IUD with no hormones. Haha, definitely looking forward to the days where I do not have to take birth control OR worry about an unwanted pregnancy. Copper IUD does sound practical, I will be sure to bring that up at my next appointment! I switched to an IUD and like it much better than the pill. My gyno recommended Liletta which is similar to Mirena. I have Mirena IUD and it has been amazing for me because I no longer get my period. I found that my period would aggravate my skin every month and keep it from properly healing. Not having my period has made life so much easier I had a copper IUD for 7 years too! Highly recommended. I have the nexplanon implant but have been having super long periods so I was thinking of using a pill to regulate my period. Thoughts?", "NSFW - is this LS? I actually might have found that baby wipes might be causing it. Worth noting I had 3 anal fissures that have almost healed. Further info in comments.  S\u00f3 I have had this for about 3 years now. And it is got gradually worse. Upon reading some info on pruritis ani, I found a section that says about baby wipes being a potential factor. I tried all kinds of creams to no benefit, but this might have been because of the baby wipes. \n\nThe skin around my anus has sometimes been VERY white. \n\nI had a fair amount of mucus coming out of my anus due to the anal fissures. These have subsided somewhat. \n\nI tried to stop the mucus at night by putting a cotton wool pad at the entrance of my anus to absorb this, and it helped somewhat. \n\nAs you can see in the pictures above it has gotten better and worse over time. The last picture was actually taken a few months ago. My butt crack has gotten considerably worse, with open sores causing more mucus. \n\nIt was incredibly itchy at night, where sometimes I would wake up scratching my anus. \n\nAs you can also see there are blue veins that have swollen and are showing. Not sure what this is. Possibly blood stasis?\n\nI have since found that washing after every bowel movement and before bed that this eliminates most itchiness. If you have this issue this is worth trying. This helped to close the cracks and splits in the skin you can see above. \n\nIf you are curious if you have anal fissures, get a check up. \n\nI have only just stopped using the baby wipes, so I will come back to this page with an update and let everyone know. I am sorry you are going through this but please go see a doctor for the love of god if it is been 3 years of this then you need medical intervention Ouch, I am so sorry this is happening to you. Good job on quitting baby wipes, those things are not a good idea. \nI think there is a good possibility that this could be LS, however you did not mention any genital involvement, which I think is rather rare? I too have anal fissures (caused by IBS and LS) and the sort of purple/bulging veins around my anus. The doctor said that was due to thinning of the skin, caused by LS. I think the white ridge on your perineum does look like it could be LS. \nWhat doctors have you seen about this, and has anyone mentioned LS? I agree. I have been thrown around the system for about a year now with no access to a dermatologist. I have had a gastroscopy to rule out any intolerances to gluten and dairy and waiting for the results still (had it in November). \n\nIt got rapidly bad last year and it came and went before that so I was not as worried. \n\nI originally started the colonoscopy route as last year and the year before I had random times where I had excessive blood come in my stool. Which I thought was Crohn\u2019s disease. \n\nI am day two of baby wipe elimination so I will keep  everyone updated. The only reason I am doing this is because I can trace back the issue with my starting to use baby wipes. Funny how my wanting to have better anal hygiene has caused the complete opposite. \n\nI have had health issues my entire life and with this bullshit lockdowns it is making getting help that much more difficult. \n\nI have also started a change in diet to see if that helps. \n\nI spoke to doctors today and they are pushing for me to see a dermatologist. \n\nWill come back here in a month.", "Boxers, ladies For a while, I wore my panties inside-out to avoid the seam rubbing tender spots.  During my recent flare, this was not sufficient and another user recommended loose-fitting underwear, so I ordered some boxers.  These things have made a huge difference when I am at home in my comfy clothes, so I thought I would share.  I am not talking about cutesy \"boy shorts\" but full on men's boxers.  Nice loose boxers can really provide some relief over panties. I agree, mostly I do not wear underwear at home but I will use my husbands sometimes! I have just given up on wearing underwear in general when I am home! This is a great alternative to being butt naked I have four kids who would not appreciate that.

I am struggling with dual flares of interstitial cystitis (IC) and LS. I am wondering if there are any treatments or remedies that can ease the symptoms of both. Oh yes I have them both too look up Ichelp.org Yes, I have both. I normally just have IC problems which I take pain meds for, but this is my second flare with LS and it triggered my IC. It was so bad I went to the dr and got treated for UTI/yeast infection  also, which did not help. So I have been soaking in hot water every night for at least 30 minutes and use Aquaphor for itching. I see the doctor next week again. I have had IC most my life along with osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. Just seems autoimmune syndromes love my body. Yes, I have both. Try \u201cEMDR\u201d therapy for the IC as well as pelvic floor therapy.

Okay so ever since I was a kid I had a little rough patch of skin  about the size of a pencil eraser on my foreskin and I went to the doctor at about 18 years old thinking it was an std, he told me it was just flordyce spots and to not worry.\n\nWell last year I got bit by a dog and went on antibiotics and all of a sudden I get a rash on my penis that is all the way around my foreskin and I am like oookeey, so I go to urologist and he tells me it is LS, I go to dermatologist and they say it is likely LS but cannot diagnose with out a rather large biopsy, which I rightfully declined.\n\nSo now I am stuck with a disease that will never go away and stuck in a relationship with a girl I kind of do not want to be with but I am scared no body will want me with this messed up condition. \n\nI feel scared, angry and alone. I am afraid that I will lose my ability to have sex in the future and could not go on living like that. You are not alone. There are a lot of little things you can do to start feeling better. It seems like the antibiotics destroyed some of your healthy gut bacteria. I personally have been trying to strengthen mine with probiotics and cbd/plant tinctures. I also use a calendula healing salve to help repair any damaged/scarred skin. \n\nIf you want to talk or need any more info I have been dealing with it for about 2 years. I have the female version of this. No one is going to want you less; this is not an STD. You cannot give it to anyone, it is an autoimmune disorder. Is your doctor treating it? Clobetasol should help clear it up or at least keep it from getting worse.  Mine has been clear now for 2 years, and I have a yearly check up to make sure that continues. I am a woman. Yes, I understand the initial shock of thinking no one will want to have sex with you. It is not easy to bring up with a new partner.  But with time I came to realise that it was ok. It is not an STI, I think that most like what is the greater concern to a new partner. \n\nI use clobetasol  5 nights a week with the goal of eventually using it 1or 2 nights a week for maintenance. It is annoying and a pain to have it on all night but I am seeing great improvement and I am far less itchy. \nI wish you the best of luck. ", "Does this look like lichen sclerosus?

Early on it can be cured with circumcision. Also it might be some skin color variation but only a derm can confirm Yeah I guess so! I do have a tight foreskin but I had the tight foreskin before all these issues. I can still pull back easy flaccid though. \n\nAlso yeah that seems to be the safest bet right now, I will see what they say.

Foreskin is completely unaffected and I really do not want to get cut! \nI am afraid I may even need a circumcision, or worse....\n\nI have had very mild BXO for over 10 years which was misdiagnosed. I have been keeping it at bay using ideas from other forums. It is a combination of natural products that cause the BXO skin to peel away, but it gradually returns over time (a couple months - once it was almost a year) and I just keep repeating the process.\n My issue though now, even though my case does not look that bad, I am afraid it may be heading inside my urethra. \n\nI have talked to one urologist so far just by email, and he is automatically resorting to circumcision. I love my foreskin and the sad thing is, it itself is perfectly fine! I realize moisture aggrevates the situation but maybe there is someone out there who has had something else work out well?!?\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated!\nThanks So you never used steroid ointments ? also how do you know its heading into urethera does it burn when you pee? Nope never. \nHoping to see a urologist soon and start something though before going the circumcision route.\n\nNo burning  - the white skin has much less sensation. I actually inserted a pair of tweezers to push it open and can see white a little way inside. well steroid ointments are preferred treatment for this so try and get it diagnosed fast. Thanks - certainly hoping that will help! Working on getting it checked as soon as possible. My dermatologist told me to put medical tape to keep the skin lifted throughout the day. Not the most comfortable thing but maybe it can help. Like to tape my foreskin back behind my glans? To keep it dry? Yes. One part of the tape on the foreskin and the other under your belly so that it pulls back. After some tries you should actually manage to make something bearable. Use medical tape and try different widths or brands. I think it helped a bit for me. I guess I will need to shave more than just my balls  now lol! Thanks for the advice!", "Twice daily use of Clobetasol gave me burning sensation - any tips? Hi there, I wrote a post a few days ago that I thought I had LS based on white patches and pain/ tearing after sex. Burning/ itching was never a problem. My gyno is useless but agreed to give me clobetasol and I took it twice daily for about five days but I feel like it is made me more sensitive and I now have a burning sensation I did not have before. \n\nI made sure to ask for the ointment, so I know it is not that. I also used the recommended pea size amount. I am skipping the ointment tonight because I do not want to make it worse.\n\nI am going to see a dermatologist tomorrow who is hopefully more knowledgeable, and I also have an appointment next month with a new gyno. \n\nMy question is- does everyone usually start out daily, twice a day? Has anyone tried every other day for their initial treatment? I really wanted this to work for me. I want to use the treatment that is known to prevent cancer. Twice daily is the frequency recommended for starting out.  Some people get a burning sensation as a side effect of topical steroid use.  People here that report that stuff usually say they are able to avoid those side effects by switching to a less potent topical steroid.  It sounds like right now you should talk to your dr. about lowering the potency of the treatment, not the frequency.  Lowering the frequency is usualy done much later, after symptoms have gotten somewhat under control. \n\nYou also probably want to keep in mind that when you do stop using steroids (or even when you reduce your frequency of application) you should taper down nice and slowly so you avoid rebound effects.  If you reduce frequency too soon or too quickly your symptoms will probably return, and they may come back worse than before. Thank you! I hope my dermatologist gives me some more insights! I am disheartened that clob did not work for me. I seem to have classic symptoms, so I hope I react well to another less potent steroid. I personally found the ointment better compared to the cream. I personally hath found the ointment better did compare to the cream\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Dont be disheartened yet.  You said you only used clob for 5 days.  That probably was not enough time to get any significant improvement.  Also, keep in mind that some symptoms may only stop getting worse with treatment and other symptoms may actually go away. I have been taking the ointment :/ was hoping it would be more gentle! Thanks so much! I hope I can eventually build up to usage of clob. I am really looking forward to getting help from a competent doctor. I brought up LS three years ago to my doctor and she just said I was too young. It is the same steroid % I believe. I found the ointment could be spread and stayed where I wanted it better. No probem.  I dont think most doctors realize how much damage they can do with their dismissive behavior towards patients.  It can be frustrating beyond belief.  Sometimes you have to just take matters into your own hands and walk your doctors through certain things in order to get the help you need from them.  Knowledge is power.  Good luck. It tingles a little bit for me, but I find the sensation kind of soothing and it goes away after an hour. If it is a bad flare up it burns when I put it on but the burning goes away for me after about 20 minutes Did this improve for you yet?", "White patches Hi all. I am wondering if those of you with confirmed LS can tell me more about your white patches? The pictures I have looked at online just do not look the same as mine that have popped up recently, even with twice weekly (and sometimes more) clob ointment use. \n\nMy gyn suspected lichen simplex or maybe LS back in April, but I did not have white patches or the figure 8 pattern at that time. So she did not do a biopsy. Fast forward to the last month or so, and I have been getting more and more white patches on my labia majora and almost my perineum. What is weird to me is they periodically peel/clump off...sometimes in the shower, or as I am applying the clob, or when I catch myself scratching. At first I thought it was some kind of buildup from the clob and moisturizer I use, but the skin becomes so red and irritated after the white patches come off that I wonder if it is actually pieces of my skin coming off or something. And then the patches are back within 1-3 days. Do yours do this? This seems like way TMI, but is there really such a thing on this thread? \n\nSeeing a derm my gyn recommended on Nov 30, but that seems like ages from now. I have confirmed LS and my white patches have never really appeared to look like the ones you see online but idk if that is to do with all the treatment I have had before my diagnosis. Mine peels off like that, the skin will literally come off in mushy little blobs that are like paste when you squish them, TMI but what are we here for hahah! Ohmygosh yes exactly like that! Is it paste is it skin is exactly what goes through my brain sometimes No such thing as TMI! For me, they look like literal patches of shiny or matte white, I know not very descriptive but they are exactly like that! I get mine near my vaginal opening (\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44) normally and they do not peel off- but you are not the first I have heard that from either Confirmed LS. Mine sloth off in the perianal area and the skin turns red, then the skin seeps fluid. My vaginal white patches are less these days for some reason but they tended to just form and itch, no shedding or fluid. I also get LS under my breasts sometimes but no white patches. My skin is a mess.", "FBook group for LS and LP  \n\nHave any of you considered joining our FBook group? \n\n***Lichen Sclerosis Lichen Planus Skin Disorder Support*** is the name\n\nLook for the \"Crying Vulva\" photo in pink\n\nWe discuss all types of skin conditions but basically LS and some LP. ( I am on a LS (UK) group on FB. Its brilliant. Supportive and informative. Could you post a link please? I will try! I was going to join, then saw it was transphobic. Trans women pre and post op get LS too. I will pass.\n\nEdit: Also, men, sorry! Women only, evidently. Males suffer from LS and LP, too, and of course trans people, too.", "Sex life is dying help Hello everyone! I got diagnosed almost 3 months ago and have been using the clob till now. Sometimes my symptoms go away and come back, it differs day to day. However, my sex life is not in a good situation. My boyfriend is very sensitive and understands me but I cant take this anymore. How can I manage to not be teared or to avoid burning feeling after sex. We try everyting. So that it is impossible for me to have sex twice a week due to pain. Please do not say use lube, cause we do a lot :( I am open to any suggestions. Have you tried lidocaine gel? I have never tried it, but could it help to avoid tearing and burning? It should help the burning. But be aware that since it is numbing you could get a small tear and not really realize until later. Did you use it before? How was the results could you sharw with me :( Hey!\n\nI did a write up about how I cured about 90% of my LS, here is the post - take a look! It talks about my story, my journey, and my eventual healing and freedom from LS.\n\n\n\nI wrote this about a year ago, a couple changes:\n\nDo not need to be heavily lubricated at all anymore! Like at all at all. If I bang 3x in a day then yes I will need some lubrication\n\nSkin looks normal, just lost it is color a bit\n\nRarely use the cream I mention in there, but when I did it helped A LOT.\n\nregularly dosing Omega 3's and staying away from chemical soaps / detergents / etc,. still using bronner's etc.\n\nEdit:\n\nAnother thing - I do not eat gluten free anymore, but when I DO eat gluten, i try to make sure it is organic wheat. So probably 98% of the wheat i eat is organic.\n\nAlso you will be AMAZED out how quickly you notice changes. If I remember correctly, it started to heal up in like a week. It is been a while so kind of hard to remember. I really need to do a longer and more in-depth write up on all of this. Lldocaine has saved me\u2026I do not use it during a flare but when I have no open or very sensitive areas I put it on to numb the pain. It burns a bit when applying but that goes away in a few seconds. There can be small tears that do not hurt until after the lidocaine wears off so putting Aquaphor or Vaseline on is helpful as a barrier to urine flow. Omg thank you so much, what was the name of the book and also did you strictly do the diet and everything or did you do your best? The name of the book is at the bottom of the post that I linked -\n\nI mean no i do not eat it strictly, but I am very mindful now of what I put in and on my body. For instance in the book she will recommend some changes concerning 'olive oil' (once you read it, you will understand) the tech has advanced since she wrote it so I just use Bronner's and Ingredients Matter products. \n\nThe thing is if you make say 80% of her changes, you might see 100% results. If you make 10% changes, you might see 20-30% results.\n\nFor me, I made about 60-70% changes and I see 90% results.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI really think you will get a general gist of what you need to do within the first 25-100 pages or her book.\n\nKeep breathing, go slow, there is a way out of this. Read the book, it is 100% worth it - because you are worth it. After your done with the first 100 pages or so shoot me a message and we can chat more. Thanks you so much for explaining. The reason why I asked it that I am already eating very healthy but not glutenfree. However I will defineatly remove the chemicals and start to take omega and vitamin D.  Did your doc say anything about it? Thank you for letting me know btw It is not just lube right before and during sex because that never stopped my lesions. I have been unable to have sex without those symptoms plus huge bilateral lesions that makes urinating an act of god; However recently I was told to start lubricating with extra virgin coconut oil three times a day on the day I plan to have sex and also pretreat with clob. We use the coconut oil as personal lubricant during intercourse as well and my husband is obsessed with it. For the first time in over a year I was lesion free post sex. I honestly did not think anything would help. I already eat clean and avoid processed foods due to my migraines and IBS, so I cannot tell if that helps LS but it certainly helps my other conditions. Thank you so much! I was at the same situation with you regarding eating habits. I am very frustrated about what can I do more for LS :( I know it is been rough getting the diagnosis and trying to learn what works and what does not.. Oh, I forgot to mention in the previous post that I take ibuprofen 1-2 hours before. I am also between a rock and a hard place between my dermatologist and obgyn over medication my obgyn wants me to stick strictly with clob. my dermatologist wants me to use both clob. and tacrolimus ointment which as I have read helped put people in complete remission for about a year after 6 weeks of therapy. Might be something to bring up to whoever is over your LS treatment. 6 weeks for 1 year of remission sounds good to me but I am waiting for their decision on if I should start treatment with it or not. It is slightly frustrating..  Ooh which of your doctor suggest ibuprofen? I have never heard it before and def will check. I didnt see a dermatologist but plan to do it, now I only follow the treatment from the obgyn. Well they both told me to take it during flare-ups. I figured since it is an inflammatory skin disorder it could not hurt to take an NSAID before sex as a preventative measure. It makes a lot. If it is not personal a lot, do you feel pain as a symptom? I am asking cause I only deal with burning, itchy feeling and tearing problems not pain. Trying to figure out whether ibupfren may be a solution for me Some pain during sex which was fixed by my new regimen and pain from the lesions after but nothing even begins to touch that pain.. my lesions are always extremely large they would go from right above my urethral orifice to my perianal raphe and as wide my pinky on both sides... The skin that always tears during sex is currently being repaired by topical estrogen once a day every night. Currently I am having pain free sex once a week and no lesions afterwards with minimal tearing. We are slowly increasing how long we have intercourse and eventually going to try adding additional days. I am finally on my way to something close to a normal sex life. I am not going to lie it is a lot of work to keep up with but worth it. Thank you so much. I am so happy for you; someting close to a normal sex life, such a concept....... wishing to achieve one day I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you find something that works for you soon! Hi! I was diagnosed about 3 years ago but symptomatic for over a decade. My primary symptoms was pain during sex. This pain with sex got worse and worse til I had to just stop. By the time I finally got diagnosed, my skin lost its color, I had tears, fissures, clitoral phimosis, burning, itching, discomfort, fusing, the list goes on. I did not know what it was like to not be in pain during sex.\n\nThe last three years have been huge for me. I learned about the disease and got involved with Lichen Sclerosus Support Network. I now co host virtual meetups and volunteer for the organization. I have now been in remission for about a year and a half. Remission is when your doctor tells you there are no more clinical signs of LS. Furthermore, for me,  it means for over a year and a half, I have no pain, no tearing, no fissures, no itching, no discomfort, no further architectural changes and my skin has returned to pink. Most importantly, once I got into remission by properly using my steroids and giving my body time to heal (because average remission time is 3 to 6 months with proper steroid use), I now have COMPLETELY PAIN FREE SEX. \n\nThree big things led to my being able to have sex. Sex therapy, steroids, and dilators/pelvic floor physiotherapy. I talk about my journal from painful sex to pleasurable best sex of my life on my blog, The Lost Labia Chronicles. I also talk about dilators, pelvic floor physiotherapy and so much more. If you are interested you can read it at  I am also very active on Instagram  where I chat with tons of folks that have similar issues. On Lichen Sclerosus Podcast, you can listen to my two part interview as well. \n\nEssentially though, if you are having sex but have not gotten your inflammation under control. It will likely continue to be painful. This is because LS is one of the most inflammatory skin diseases, and this inflammation causes the vulvar skin to thicken. Because of the thickening, your vulvar skin looses elasticity, and this is what causes the skin to tear and have fissures and scar. Furthermore, this trauma to the vulva gets learned over time; the body knows historically penetration equals pain, and it therefore encodes any kind of penetration as danger, and, consequently your body's mechanism tenses the vaginal and pelvic floor muscles, causing even more pain. \n\nTo help heal the vulvar skin, steroids (and it is critical to use them properly) and time are key (we all heal at different times places but it can take a few months, especially if you have a lot of fissures that need to heal. To help desensitize the brain and untrain it from encoding penetration as danger, therapy may help (personally I needed it but not everyone does) and pelvic floor physical therapy and dilators are a Godsend. LS specialists like Dr. Krapf from  now routinely tell LS patients to work with a pelvic floor physiotherapist. Personally, I used Dr. Heather Jeffcoats book sex without pain for my dilator protocol which I followed for a few months. with that, I was finally able to have sex again and honestly have not had issues since. I cried my eyes out the first time I did because I do not remember a time when sex was not at the very least a bit uncomfortable. So now, I am actually having the best sex of my life.\n\nI hope this helps. I am not on Reddit as much as IG, but message me or let me know if you have questions.  But now that there is totally hope and you can have an amazing sex life with LS, it just might take a bit of time. If you live somewhere, where medical cannabis is legal there is something called \u201cStoni Yoni\u201d and it is a spray you can spray directly on your genitals and it is is so awesome. Wow have no idea but unfortunately I live in Turkey and it is illegal :( Hi thank you so much for sharing your story and will def check your blog. I have never thought abiut dilators but now it makes sense since they help muscles. Oh man I am so sorry Hey! I use emu oil daily just to keep everything moist. I also started using dilators which really seem to help too. \nAlso, my doctor started me on Intrarosa which is a dhea suppository (since I do not handle hormones well) and it is for painful sex. It is REALLY helped. It is suppose to rebuild the skin and strengthen it to stop tearing. Since using it, about 2 months now, I have not had any tears! My insurance does not cover it since it is brand name and because of my age. Its really meant for women in menopause. But they have a savings card that helps. \nI also of course use my steriod, however, clob did not agree with me so I use triamcinolone.  \nI thought my sex life was over too, but it does get better. It still hurts a little at times if I have not had sex in a couple weeks, but my recovery time has gone from about 4 days to one. I am hopeful that will decrease as well. Wow that is amazing, I also started to use emu oil but not regularly. Hope to see results like you. I was just diagnosed with LS and -really- needed to hear this today. Thank you so much for taking the time to share, found you on IG and will be joining the next group. Aw, I am so happy to hear this. We run these support meetings every second Saturday and have so much informational resources. Cannot wait to meet you. If you want to know a bit more about the support meeting and what to expect, If you go to my iGtv section I do a video on this topic. Yes exactly. Typically pain with sex from LS is due to architectural changes, tears, and fissures on the vulva. However, because this hurts during sex, our brains begin to associate penetration with danger, and, overtime it deploys mechanisms to protect it from the perceived threat. this can look like having muscles contract, spasm, and tense up during sex, so that now you have pain on the vulva and inside the vagina. Dilartors can really help retrain the brain and desensitized it to penetration as dangerous. In fact, many folks with LS also have a tight pelvic floor with trigger points due to chronic tension.", "23, M. Concerned about cancer risk. Hi all. Was diagnosed early in 2020. Seems to be a mild case at the moment. Irregular use of cortisone cream has kept things totally fine. Foreskin is a little tight but still retracts normally. Sex is still pleasurable, urination is normal.\n\nWhat is causing me serious anxiety is the cancer risk. My dermo told me it is a 5% chance. But what signs or symptoms should I be looking for? Most signs of penile cancer seem to match those of LS.\n\nLooking for some thoughts from guys or girls who have been living with this for some time, and how you cope. I forget about it by living. Check in with the doc every year or two or if there is a problem. Otherwise ... it is bullshit, I acknowledge it is bullshit, and then I do the next thing. \n\nAnd once you do that enough, it is the habit. \n\nHello scary thought, you are right, that is scary and unfair and total bullshit, yep. Also I think it might be time to replace this set of pants, and my grandma\u2019s birthday is coming up, I should order flowers. Hello scary thought, I see you there and I agree this thing is shitty, also I think maybe for dinner I would like a white wine and some roasted chicken. \n\nIt is just there. And you live anyway. Cannot force yourself to forget about it. Cannot get mad it pops into your head sometimes. Acknowledge it and move on with your day. \n\nThat is literally it, for me. Hello, i am 41 year old male. Me too have been diagnosed early 2020. Like you, i do not have any severe issues, only some white patches. With steroids it did not get worse.\nBut it is a mental thing as well for me. I 'm also a memver of a facebook group in my country and most of the men there do not worry much about the cancer thing.\nThey say that when treated well, the risk should be down to almost zero. Like the comment said, try not to worry to much ... for that means stay of the internet. Easier said than done :-)\nFor now I go to a dermatologist every 4 months and that will move up to every year. I trust them in recognizing when there is something wrong. Did your derm tell you that with treatment, cancer risk should be a lot lower? I was under the impression that the 5% estimate was for untreated LS.\n\nIf anything starts looking different, just get it checked. If something cancerous does turn up, even though it is far more likely to never happen, you will have caught it early and treatment should be easy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*In patients with lichen sclerosus the risk of developing a squamous cell carcinoma in the genital area is slightly increased and is defined with an estimated lifetime risk of approximately 4 to 5% (2\u20134, e8).* ***This risk seems to be significantly decreased by consistent long-term treatment*** *(2).*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*A total of 150 patients (29.6%) did not carry out the advised treatment and were considered partially compliant.

I never would have imagined finding a sub for this but I am grateful. My issues began roughly six months ago. I had itching, green discharge, no smell, and burning while urinating. I itched and itched until I felt that first lesion. Immediately I panicked. After an uncomfortable conversation with my partner (I thought I had an STD) I made an appointment. I was told I had both a yeast infection and UTI, and to stop itching. I picked up my meds later that day and of course after my course of antibiotics, the yeast infection came right back. I called and got another prescription, but the discharge and itch came back days later. Frustrated, I made an appointment to biopsy the itchy areas and got my results back within a week. \u201cLichen Chronus.\u201d I realize that is a little different from lichen sclerosus, but it is in my genital are. I was given clobetasol and was instructed to use it 2x daily for up to two weeks. After applying it for three days, I felt like the itch got worse. I tried my hardest not to itch at all, but I think I was itching at night. This was in mid December. I quit using the clobetasol and wrongfully assumed that the issue would resolve itself if I just left it alone. For weeks I had strange discharge and thought I was having recurring yeast infections. My doctor did not explain that any lichen issues on the genitals were extremely persistent, or that discharge was associated with the diagnosis. I finally found that information on my own, and started using the clobetasol once daily, at night, to not deal with the itching symptoms. \n\nBut then the bleeding started. I itched it so roughly it opened up and began bleeding. I kept applying the medicine, kept trying to keep my hands off it. The itching went away finally after weeks. But now it is back. \n\nI seriously want to take a scalpel and cut the whole area out. I want the doctor to surgical remove the entire section of my skin. I want to use the medicine prescribed for it and have it help my symptoms, not exacerbate them. One of the main symptoms of using clobetasol is itching and burning. Seriously what the hell. I cannot enjoy sex because the itching sensation. I do not want him to perform oral sex on me because the discharge. Every time I walk or move a certain way, the itching sensation grows. I am freaking miserable. I hate this. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. \n\nPlease if anyone has any other relief recommendations, let me know. I am so sorry you are experiencing this. I am not familiar with Lichen Chronus. But I know Sclerosus does not involve discharge. Have you let your doctor know that the clobetasol seems to not help?\n\nIt sounds like this is making you miserable. I wish I had some suggestions, but all I can say is I understand how frustrating it is to have constant itching. You may find some suggestions from previous posts. I hope things get better for you in the future. Scratching* you are scratching it, not itching it lol. But omg I remember the nights when I used to scratch so hard I had blood under my finger nails. I know how painful and frustrating it is. You lose sleep which makes you feel crazy during the day. Are you using wet wipes? If so, stop. It could be making the itching worse. Do you have dry skin on your pubis mound? If so, try CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser. Yes it is \"facial\" cleanser but it is sensitive enough for your genitals and it was recommended from my dermatologist and it helps keep your skin hydrated so it is not flaking and itching even more. Make sure you get the right one bc one comes in a green and white container and it has like the texture of shampoo and the other has alcohol in it (which would make symptoms worse) and comes in a sea foam green color. I use the cleanser daily in the shower and it was a life saver when I first started treatment. If you are using pantyliners for discharge, I would stop also, it is holding too much moisture in and your vagina needs to breathe. Just applying the ointment and wearing cotton undies should be enough. I really hope you find something that helps.\ud83d\udc9c Most of the symptoms are similar. The white, scaly skin, potential lesions from scratching. The discharge seems to be the only big difference! Thank you so much for your support Oh my gosh, I had blood under my nails and found more blood while wiping about a week ago. It was scary! I have actually decided to get CeraVe wash tomorrow! I have been using scented products and was using wipes until probably two weeks ago. Do you use anything g like squash or or Vaseline? I am hopefully I can get to a dermatologist soon just to see what they have to say, hopefully they can be helpful! Your info is great, thank you so much. I use this stuff called Lucas papaw ointment (you can find it on amazon, comes in a red tube or tub) for basically everything (bee stings, cuts, rashes, dry lips, etc) and if I am out and about and do not have my Clobetasol with me, I will use that and it helps for the time being. I carry it with me everywhere. I get fissures from my LS and the Lucas papaw helps that also. I asked my derm about scented products and he said it should not be an issue. When I first started having symptoms (which was for a full three years before I figured out what I had and got treatment) I swapped to unscented laundry detergent and honestly, I saw no difference except my clothes quit smelling nice. Lol but I do use organic laundry wash over tide, etc. Any type of wet wipe though, will cause LS flare ups. Even the derm tested ones have a chemical in it that makes the LS flare up so I would avoid all of those. When ever I need to freshen up, I just take a paper towel and get it wet and use that. Works just as well. But be careful not to spread the LS to your butthole. You can also get LS around your nipples and mouth so be aware of that too if you feel like you see dry skin in those areas. Have you joined our FBook group?\n\n( I noticed my nipple was itchy a couple days ago. I will have to watch out for the as well! Thanks for the info, I will go buy some of that off Amazon right now!!! I actually do not have Facebook, but if I ever make one, this is a great resource. Thank you There is a FB group   \n\nHave you joined our FBook group?\n\n( Just sent a request to join! Thank you :)", "how did you get rid of the discoloration? hi everyone, i got diagnosed a few months ago but it is been going on for years. i am obviously gutted and this has taken a significant toll on my mental health. i used clob but all it did was get rid of the symptoms, but the discoloration/rash in my perianal area is still the exact same. PLEASE, please how do i get rid of it? lasers? what did you do?", "Treating a yeast infection with LS Hey there fellow miserable people. Does anyone have any advice on how to treat a yeast infection with LS? Is it the same of do you need to do something special? My long term use of clobetasol is giving me yeast infections. Clobetasol has done nothing for any of my symptoms, I use it exactly as I am told but it is useless. It is useless and it gives me yeast infections ontop of the pain my LS already causes. Anyone have any suggestions or tips? How long have you been on Clob? If it is not working and making your symptoms worse speak to your doc. It might be too strong for you. Triamcinolone is a good ointment for LS that is not as strong as Clob. Have you had a biopsy to confirm the LS? Clob works for most people, so it is interesting it has not been for you. \n\nThere is over the counter yeast medications you can use for some relief. But once you figure out your steroid dilemma hopefully that issue subsides with it. :) Check out this product called \"The Killer\" by Love Wellness. Swear by them. My Gyn puts me on prescription Boric Acid suppositories, that go through a compounding pharmacy.  It is a long course of treatment, but it seems to be more effective than fluconazole for long-term, or resistant yeast. Agreed if clob is not working, it may be time to try something else. Tacrolimus is a common choice for the \\~20% of people that do not respond to clob. I refuse to do tacrolimus. My gyn told me I would have to put it on twice a day everyday for the rest of my life and that it burns. I am not doing that. It already burns enough on its own and who the hell has time for that? No. I have been using it since January, before that I was using mometasone for two months but it burned so bad I felt nauseous and shaky when using it. So 6 months of using steroids total, 0 improvement. Everyone talks about flares as if they come and go, but I am just always in a flare, it just goes from horrible to extra horrible and never gets better. The clob does not make it worse, it just does nothing at all. It does not feel like I have done any treatment in the passed 6 months, it just feels awful and the same it has for the passed few years before I was diagnosed. No, no biopsy. My dr. Said it was a textbook case so no need. My grandma and my aunt also have LS, clobetasol does not work for them either and they have not found something that does. \n\nOkay but is it harmful to be using clob and the over the counter stuff at the same time? Thank you. How long is the course of treatment!? Sure thing. They are boric acid suppositories from a woman-owned company. Good luck! Mine has been super resistant and long lasting, so I did one month of every night, one month of 3x a week, then one month of 1x per week. I am on birth control pills which give me chronic yeast infections. Very often, the yeast infections make my LS flare up. Boric acid suppositories about 2x/week have been great at preventing yeast infections for me.\nClobetasol should not be used long term/constantly. It really should only be used during the first 2 weeks of a flare up. Has your doctor prescribed anything else for maintenance? During a flare my doctor has me use clobetasol for two weeks then mometasone for two weeks. If the flare is not too bad I skip the clobetasol and just go right to mometasone and it always does the trick. Applying mometasone is PAINFUL. It burns for the first few minutes but it subsides. Oh Man. Okay, thanks for the info. Your doctor and my doctor have very different opinions, I do not trust either of them lol. I have used both clob and mometasone, neither does anything for me either way. I only keep using the clob because it is prevents the disease progression and reduces your risk of developing cancer. If you watch some of dr. Jill Krapf\u2019s videos on Instagram you will find that apparently using clob for long periods of time is actually okay, so long as you are using it correctly. \nI do not understand what people mean when they say \u201chave a flare\u201d does that mean that all your symptoms go away for awhile and then come back? My symptoms have never gone away, they are just always awful...then sometimes they get extra awful. You are welcome!  \n\nHonestly it is not bad for me.  It does not take that long to get relief and return to feeling normal.  And the base they put the boric acid into is very moisturizing, so it is kind of nice! I did not know tac was 2x per day for life. I assumed it was the same regimen as clob. My derm did not mention that. \n\nIt did sting the first few times I applied it, but not anymore. I also use it for perianal psoriasis and it is been the same; the first few times I apply it, it stings for a few minutes. But after using it for a few times, my skin gets used to it and it does not feel any different than applying vaseline. It is also not super painful for me, just noticeable. For me it feels kind of like the burn you get in your mouth when you eat something spicy; very tingly. I think it varies a lot by person. Some people are not bothered at all, other people find it too painful to use. But I think for most people, their skin \"gets used to it\" and they do not react to it anymore after a few applications.", "Diagnosed with vitiligo due to white patch around all around rectum, think I was misdiagnosed? Over summer I was diagnosed with vitiligo, but since then it is gotten worse (not the white patch) but the itching has now turning into dry skin with bleeding and cracks, making me think it is LS.

At least underneath? I spent a whole year in maxi dresses with nothing under until things got more chilled out. \n\nCannot recommend if you have a curious three year old who might crawl under there in line at Starbucks and then flip your skirt up over his head when you pull him out. Otherwise\u2026 recommend. \n\nThat and budreaux\u2019s butt paste. Maybe. LS for me has spread to my butt. When it flares shower daily, clob at night and it is weird but give yourself a wedgie with your underwear - taking some of the moisture off your skin. Not sure if your steroid is cream or ointment based \u2014 the ointment base is better. It is occlusive and can also function as a barrier to protect the skin underneath. After you apply your steroid you can also use either diaper rash cream (zinc oxide) or simply Vaseline to create a barrier and hydrate the skin.", "Genital piercings Does anyone have genital piercings, and if so, how did your LS react? I am thinking about getting a vertical clitoral hood piercing now that my LS in that area is under control. I do not but that sounds like an awful idea with LS. There will be constant rubbing irritation and you will need to use soap and water on the spot constantly. I really think you should think hard about this.", "I have not tried this and cannot find anything online but has anyone ever tried to treat minor case of LS with Condylox? It is usually for treatment of genital warts. But I am curious if it could work for a small LS site. ", "Confused and pretty scared! Any help appreciated &lt;3 Hi everyone! \n\nI am 29 F and I will spare you the crazy backstory, but about 6 months ago I started experience constant burning pain in my vulva with a few additional symptoms that led me to believe either IC, vulvodynia, or pudendal neuralgia. I have been to a few doctors and am pursuing a couple of different treatments (including pelvic floor therapy) without much success.\n\nToday I saw a normal gynecologist as a second opinion type of situation. I explained everything and she did her exam. She quickly came back up (haha) and said \"Okay I might entertain the possibility of lichen schlerosus.\" (It was on my list of possibilities when we were talking)\n\nShe explained that there was some whitening and thinning of the skin (only slight) around the vagina. However, what I am most concerned about is the fact that she also said my labia minora were smaller than expected (disappearing?) and that the skin was starting to cover my clitoris and there was no defined hood. I had noticed this myself a few weeks ago when applying a cream my specialist had given me. She said it was not completely gone but when I got home and dug around (lol) I could not find my clit!! Unfortunately I do not masturbate so I honestly have no idea if it was always like this. The skin appears to be covering it completely.\n\nShe prescribed me clob and told me it would help. I am not so convinced, as I have read skin changes and scarring is not usually reversible in this manner. I am also confused because I thought these anatomical changes were in the late stage of the disease. Could I have had LS my whole life and not even known it? I have only had any symptoms for 6 months. \n\nBasically, I would love to hear about anyone's experience and what people might think about the fusing and shrinkage. Feeling very scared about my future at this point. :( Thank you for listening! My doctor has told me it is more common in females to notice around their 30s. That said there are some kids who do get it but usually it disappears during/around puberty. I(19F) realised I had many of the symptoms when I was around 8that would flare up for about a month or so on and off. By the time I was 10 it was gone completely because of puberty and did not reemerge until I was 18. It is very likely you could have had it as a child or at a different time had a small flareup as an adult. Thank you for the reply! That is very interesting to hear. Did you notice any anatomical changes? I personally never did but when I began itching recently this year my doctor gave me the diagnosis of lychen sclerosis. I have been using a topical steroid for flare ups but I personally have never been bothered by the scarring which made my doctor look into LS as my diagnosis. Clob probably will not undo changes that have already taken place, but it should help prevent/slow future changes. In theory, at least. For me a lesser strength steroid actually seems to work better than clob. I would talk to your doctor about using one consistently for a number of months and seeing her again so she can track progress and make sure it is working. \n\nI have had similar anatomical changes to you and they started before I had itchiness, and it sucks. But steroids do seem to have slowed them. I use mine three times per week, per my doctor. (First tried \u201cas needed,\u201d then once a week, than twice a week, none of which were cutting it. But every body is different, and there is no simple answer that works for everyone, so just talk to your doctor.) \n\nIt is scary at first, but it will be okay!", "Tiny little dark spots on my clit and outer labia! help! I am 27 yo female, and I was diagnosed on January 28th 2019 with very early stages of lichen sclerosis, and now that I am using clobetasol there is some changes to my skin.  Some skin changes we normal, so I have read. There was always this teeny tiny dark spot on my leg outer hair and it never did anything, I found it about five years ago, but now it is gotten a little bigger, it is turned a dark purple (before it looked like a hair follicle,) now it looks like tiny blood blister but they never crack or bleed or do anything, there is just a now bigger one and he brought a friend! \n\nBy now I noticed hat there is also a dark spot on my clitoral hood got a little more blackish purple, it is not the whole hood just a small spot the size of a pore on face, and I and scared as hell!! I have my follow up with the obgyn on February 27, and im going to ask her about it.... I am just scared that this could be cancer cells. I also had to have three punch biopsies taken to find the LS and it was slightly traumatic for me, I do not want to have one taken again let alone on my clit! I will do it if in have to, but I do not handle pain well and I am scared that anymore biopsies will cause major inflammation and make the LS worse!\n\nAlso, is it normal for my labia to be more than one color? I mean, since I was 12-15 and started exploring my body I noticed that bits seemed to have a freckles pattern to them and that is gotten darker with age, but in then last 8-10 years there is also some spots have gone darker like to a dark brownish color.... Anyone else have that? Or do I have cancer?!?!?!??!?!!!??!??!", "Got diagnosed, have a few questions. Hello! Got diagnosed yesterday (F26). The doctor did not tell me much other than LS is autoimmune and nobody knows what causes it. I was prescribed clobetasol 0.05% and told to put it on twice a day, but not for how long (did not realize this until I came home, I was just in such a shock in the moment, I went in thinking I had jock itch...). I read here some people have to put it on daily for a certain time and then they decrease their application. I know it depends on the severity, but I would like to know how frequently and for how long people have to put it on. I basically have one patch of the size of my pinkie on my left outer labia, one patch of the size of a pea on the right outer labia, and then I have it all around my perianal and anal area. I had realized in the past my butt area would bleed just by wiping with paper but I always just thought I had sensitive skin.\n\nI also read here about scarring, fusing etc. My doctor did not tell me anything about this at all. Is this something I should expect with time? Do patches grow and evolve? Right now it does not seem to be inside my labia but could it get there?\n\nThe last thing I wanted to ask about is detergents and, body wash and hand soaps. I know any fragance free detergent should be fine, but I wanted to know what people actually use. The reason I am asking about hand soap is because I have noticed that since I have to watch my hands way more often now (before applying cream, after applying it.. Etc) my hands are just getting dryer and I was wondering if someone has found something gentle that works for them.\n\nI will be calling my doctor on Monday and asking them the questions as well, but I still would like to know what other people dealing with LS have to say. Thank you all for reading, I am so glad we have this subreddit! I use it twice a week unless I have a flair up (usually around ovulation and my period).. or anytime the itching is present.. In the beginning, I am always told to use it twice daily for like a month. Then once daily for a month, then a couple times a week, then once a week, then as needed. If you have it in that many places, you probably need to hit it harder.\n\nAs for detergent, I just use Tide Free. But you want to make sure to be using cotton, breathable underwear...no thongs, and it is probably good to not even wear undies to bed if you can do so. It is also good to avoid tight clothes like tights and jeans (which I know is hard as a girl). \n\nPlus, when you wash, no loofahs or anything...just like a plain scentless cleaner and your hands. (\ud83e\udd22 I know). I use an Aveeno wash that is scent and soap free. \n\nHaving a period is hard, because pads and pantiliners will irritate it, but I also find that tampons do too. I use a silicone menstrual cup.\n\nEveryone is different. Mine is not patchy, but just itchy. It does get worse if it goes untreated. Mine spread around. Thanks for all the recommendations! I was already using cotton underwear. I ordered some mens cotton boxers and will probably be sleeping in those. Hey, I never thought of boxers! What a great idea! Yeah, I have been borrowing my partner's to wear under my pajamas/sweatpants around the house and it really helped, so now I am getting my own. Got a really good value pack at Amazon. It is probably autoimmune, and may also have a connection to genetics and hormones (estrogen).  There is a really great group on facebook if you are a facebook user, called Lichen Sclerosis / Sclerosus - A Five-Star LS Group.  There are over 8,000 members and they have a lot of information there and it is real active.  All kinds of things play into treating it and getting rid of symptoms, from soap, rinsing, diet, activities, lifestyle, topicals, blah, blah, blah.  Here is a link to that group.  ( I just happened to find it yesterday and I was amazed by the amount of resources they have at the files section. Thanks so much!", "How do you stay positive for the future and how much will it worsen? I am a 19 year old woman, and I was diagnosed with LS when I was 17. When I first went to doctors for the issue when I was 14 they just told me and my mother that it was a rough patch and it would go away, but for years I went through multiple doctors and immense discomfort and pain until I finally knew the problem. But with a disease so rare, there is not many people to talk to about the difficulties and struggles of having to deal with LS in my everyday life. Especially at my age and knowing that it is even more rare in teens, not having an understanding support system I have found this forum. So my question is through the stinging, itching, pain, and discomfort every minute of the day, does it ever calm down or get better? I have been on clobetasol cream for 2 years now and if I go off of it it just comes back just as bad if not worse. Are there any natural remedies that have helped anyone? Any comment is a helpful one in dealing with this, just some hope for the future would be nice..  It is starting to get recognized as an autoimmune disorder, only thing stopping the classification is finding the exact mechanism. Tacrolimus, a cream immunosuppressant, can be prescribed for LS. I am lucky, or unlucky possibly, that I have an autoimmune disorder that requires a biologic immunosuppressant anyway. One of the side benefits was no more papercut tears from LS. A derm can prescribe tacrolimus. They can also prescribe a topical estrogen to strengthen the skin of the vulva which can help as well. I am a forty year old woman. I was diagnosed at 30 but I had problems, unrecognized, since I was 19. Sometimes would have to go to the bathroom and cry in pain for a while after sex. Never knew why. And itching was normal. No yeast or anything, just sometimes needed burning hot water to tamp it down. Did not know why. \n\nDiagnosis meant relief. Clobetasol tamps down any symptoms. I have had two children, one before diagnosis and one after. \n\nI have watched my labia slowly disappear (not entirely, but they are ... less) which is a little scary. And I wish my doc knew more about it. The specter of cancer sucks. \n\nBut I am forty, and since getting treatment, I have had zero problems beyond realizing I am getting itchy and better use the cream for a few days. Or I might tear and bleed if things get a little rough and I did not realize it was getting bad. I should be more proactive with the cream, but it is not that big a deal. \n\nI can do all the things. I do not have pain or burning or itching. The cream *works*. \n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I have got 20 years on you and so far, I am totally fine. It is a stupid pain in the butt. Rage all you like, it is bullshit.  It sucks explaining to partners, but if anybody is too skeeved, they are not people I want to be with anyway.  It is just ... not fucking fair. \n\nBut you can be fine. This is not a death sentence, it is not a no-sex sentence, a no-relationship sentence, a no-kids sentence. Not at all. Hopefully, with treatment, it will be nothing more than an occasional inconvenience. \n\nTake care of yourself. That is the best way to treat it, no joke.  Good luck.  I was diagnosed at age 20 a few months ago and am struggling to stay positive as well, especially hearing how bad it can get. My case is pretty mild at this point but I hear how it worsens with age and it has me really anxious too. So far I just get redness and itchiness and maybe some of the whiteness. My main concern is the atrophy and I cannot tell if it has started yet. How do I keep that from happening? My gyno told me to use cortisone cream to relive the itchiness.  Will that help with the atrophy as well? Thanks for the help. We are in this together! I have probably a similar case to you! I believe keeping hydrated is the best was to avoid atrophy though, I think that it happens more when people do not pay attention to their bodies signs! Who did you go see for treatment? If you have not seen a dermatologist I suggest you do that. They special in skin and can get you the right treatment and on a regimen that will help fix it. I am 25 and I had it for three years before actually going to a dermatologist to get help. I use  clobetasol. Which sounds like it is not helping you but I wonder how often you are using it. When I started I had to apply it twice a day for 2 weeks, then 1 time a day for 2 weeks, then every other day for another 2 weeks before it pretty much cleared up. I now just get it on my butthole and it does not itch but I get the fissures which I cannot decide if it is better or worse because going number 2 hurts lol. \n\nMake sure you are not using wet wipes. You can use CeraVe HYDRATING CLEANSER (not the foaming*** cleanser- that has alcohol in it) as a wash to keep your vag hydrated (think of a feminine wash but those are not healthy for you). My dermatologist said I could just squeeze some on toilet paper and wipe it on my vag and leave it if I am having a really bad flare up. But I just use it in the shower to wash with and that is enough to keep my skin hydrated. \n\nI cannot say if it will worsen but i think you just need a change in your regimen. Good luck!\ud83d\udc9c I am 28 and I was diagnosed at 21 , it had got worse the last 2-3 years and sex is very hard for me but I have got the Mona Lisa treatment which helped I am going back for my 2nd treatment soon  it is a laser treatment. I also use borax in the bath or soak it in cotton wool a lot of woman use it and has helped there labia grow back mine has disappeared but seems to be growing back . I am hoping the 2nd and 3Rd treatment will improve. It has been tough but I am trying to be positive. Do not worry x Feeling hopeless and just read your comment which gives me a spark of hope.  LS is so rare... how do you find a dermatologist that knows how to help?  Thank you My ob-gyn referred me to another ob-gyn that specialized in less common issues. Then I asked my rheumatologist for a derm referral to get a second opinion/extra info from. The clobetasol was awful for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it fried everything. The derm prescribed the tacrolimus but since the Humira seemed to be working I decided to just go with that plus an estrogen cream to strengthen the mucosa.\n\nIf one doctor does not help you, find another. I went through seven doctors of various incompetency before finding a rheumatologist that listened and did the correct tests. My life went from being in so much pain to being functional so quickly it was astounding. I cried inconsolably for a week after one rheumatologist told me nothing was wrong with me because I could touch my toes. I actually ran into another person with an autoimmune disorder that told me the same rheumatologist saved them as well after so many bad doctors.  Try to keep going. \n\nLS is more common in autoimmune patients so be aware of any symptoms in that regard. Thank you so much!  I have an appointment on Friday for an auto immune specialist. Seems to treat the whole body not just the symptoms.  The first visit is $500 so I am not excited about the money it is going to cost but I feel like there is a better answer.  I have suffered with chronic pain for years joint pain muscular pain as well so I will definitely keep that in mind in when speaking with doctors.  Thank you for responding!", "Can a Circumcised male get this. I have been dealing with a red and tender penis head for a couple months now (balanitis) and have been to a doctor multiple times. They have been trying different creams and have not been very helpful. I have noticed that there is a white ring of skin all the way around under the head of my penis. I have also noticed the head is pale a little bit. The skin is also super thin in the white area around the head. Is this possible to be lichen sclerosis? Information from the BAD website states that LS almost never occurs on a circumcised penis. However, it is not saying it is an impossibility. Its definitely worth asking specifically about this. Good luck. I am circumcised and have been diagnosed with LS.  It is possible for have it even being circumcised.  Took me years to finally get the correct doctor to biopsy and diagnose it. everything that they claim circumcision \"cures\" or \"prevents\" can be had by circumcised men, too. But is not it a disease affecting the foreskin it can affect other parts of the penis, including the glans and meatus.  it can also affect the anus. Does it cause red irritation it can cause either red or white irritation. So it could be possible in a 17 year old male who was circumcised at birth it is definitely possible, but there are obviously a bunch of other potential causes too.  you would have to see a doctor for a definitive diagnosis. Ok There are other causes for white thin white skin on penis? HPV is a pretty common one.  that would be my first suspicion, honestly. Well I do not have any warts at all, so I do not know if it is that. only certain strains of HPV cause warts.  some cause irritation and discoloration with no warts.  others cause cancer with no warts.", "Penile Shave Biospy Healing time Does anyone know the healing time for a shave skin biopsy from the penis foreskin? I got a biopsy about 2 weeks ago and have not noticed much progress in regards to healing. I want to make sure this is regular or if this is an issue. Thanks in advance! Curious for an answer on this as well.  I have one in around a week. Not painful at all. They sprayed it with this super cold numbing spray, then injected it. I think they used a scalpel to do the cut and I did not even notice them sawing away at my foreskin. \n\nIm in 2 weeks so far and have not noticed much healing. I talked to the Derm and he said  6-8 week to heal. It seems like a long time, so I thought I would ask others what they observed. The dermatologist is nice guy, but he has not been great with explaining options, progression, and other Lichen Sclerosus (LS) items in detail. It is kind of making me lose faith in him and that is what made me want to ask around. I will shoot you a DM, so we can discuss progress. \n\nI need to look for a doctor that is an expert in LS in my area,  so I can build a relationship with them. Would you guys say that more of a Dermatologist or Urologist? In my experience, it is a Dermatologist you need to see.  The urologist I seen was less than useless.  He even said this was not some to worry about despite it causing me pain and mental anguish and multiple other doctors saying it is something we have to follow up on. Let me know how it goes.  I may or may not be getting a biopsy on the shaft of my penis soon for a lesion that has not healed in the past 3 months.  Not lichensclerosis, but I cannot find any information anywhere.  \n\nI cannot get any clear information regarding penile biopsies which is concerning.   Dermatologist mentioned the possibility of a shave.  The dermatologist's Nurse mentioned the possibility of a punch biopsy which I thought was counter-indicated on the penis??  Urologist said they would wait a while then just excise it if it does not go away (instead of doing a shave).  I do not know what to do and since it is so uncommon I cannot really get any clear direction of what to expect?  \n\nHow do you prevent the wound from re-opening during nocturnal erections and the like?   I am really worried about healing issues especially on the shaft of the penis.  I am a grower and the skin stretches out a lot. It really doest bleed or has not bleed in 15 days. I just put vaseline every couple hours usually after I pee and that is about it. I do not even put a bandaid on as that skin is covered by my hood. Dude get the biopsy so you can figure out what it is and take care of it.  They dont have any idea what the lesion is? Might we worth getting a second opinion or posting a photo on here. I had one around 2 years ago. Mine was healed within 2 weeks. The local anaesthetic is the most painful part. Needle in the penis is not a pleasant experience. What part was biopsied? I had 2 biopsies. The first was a piece of my frenulum, done by a dermatologist, and the second was a part of my foreskin, on the right side about 1cm below the glans. I posted multiple photos in other threads.  It is actually started looking a lot better in the past week.  \n\nAs far as 2nd opinion, I have seen 4 doctors about it.  I have a followup soon.  All of the doctors said penile cancer was extremely unlikely and it did not look cancerous, but none of them came to a consensus on what it is.  One thought it was folliculitis, another thought it was a molluscum, another thought it was an inclusion cyst.  \n\nI have a followup appointment soon. Also, can I ask if they used epinephrine when doing the biopsy?  Some literature that I have read says it is counter-indicated for the penis, others say it is okay. I do not know if they used epinephrine. I just came in for a visit then they told me they needed  biopsy and 5 minute later they were sawing away.", "So much pain I have had LS for years, though for many years it was misdiagnosed as a fungal infection and I did not get proper treatment until last year when by my new gyn identified the condition properly.  At the time, I was not symptomatic and she just passively let me know what I had.  \n\n\n\nWhen a flare hit, it felt like somebody had taken a belt sander to my undercarriage and the gyn prescribed the topical corticosteroid.  Following that treatment, I mostly kept further flares at bay with twice daily applications of aloe.  I had a minor flare around November that cleared up with additional applications of aloe.  \n\n\n\nNow, though...\n\n\n\nI would like to just have my genitals and rear end surgically removed at this point.  I cannot imagine anything worse than this.  My gyn called in another round of the corticosteroid for me.  I am applying aloe throughout the day, as well, and I have an ice pack between my legs.  My vulva and perineum are so swollen that they are being very friendly with each other and my labia are bumping my legs.  I am pretty sure there is an entire colony of fire ants in my clitoral hood.\n\n\n\nMy whole life is on hold.  I cannot walk.  Bathing makes it worse.  The pain and itching are debilitating.  I do not suffer any self-harming condition, but I can tell you that I have seriously considered taking a scalpel to myself to relieve this torment.  \n\n\n\nAnybody have any pain management tips? Advil, steroid cream, loose underpants, and rest! I am so sorry. It will get better! Try using steroids in between flares as well to keep them at bay. Thank you.  I am thinking of investing in some boxers.  Hubby wears tighties, so I cannot just steal some from him. Ibuprofen will help with the swelling.  I am so sorry you are suffering.  I have not put aloe on myself since I am sensitive to some aloes.  Did you happen to switch brands or something? No, I raise my own aloe plants.  I am currently on antibiotics and wonder if they have anything to do with it. So I just had a baby 6 weeks ago but I mentioned unbearable itching to my OB and along with the cream she also suggested sitz baths.  I have not done those yet but maybe that might help? I have found that adding anything but the steroid makes it worse for me. Do not know about pure aloe, but it would make sense to stop using it for a while and see. Certain antibiotics can definitely cause issues with LS and cause flare ups. I was on ciprofloxacin which then gave me thrush which made my LS flare up!", "Pain during Sex Is it possible to get rid of pain during and after sex with the right LS treatment ? No I have an appointment for the biopsy in two weeks. It is just an assumption yet Ohh good luck! \ud83d\udc95", "Possible labia shrinking/fusion Hi, \nI was diagnosed with LS in January 2020, by a doctor who claimed to have seen white pigmentation and labial fusion. I have seen several people since who have said they cannot see any signs of lichen sclerosus and have advised me to dismiss it as a diagnosis. I am kind of worried though - I feel as though my labia minora are getting smaller, and they feel sort of sticky (I think that is the best way of describing it). I am also not sure as to whether they are fusing to the labia majora, or what this would look like. Currently what I am noticing is an absence of the smooth redish type skin of the labia majora - it almost feels like the bottom of the labia minora and the labia majora are coming together, making both smaller in the process either side. But I have not seen any descriptions like this, and like I said I have had the idea that it is lichen sclerosus dismissed several times (getting referred to a dermatologist in the U.K. - especially when they repeatedly say it is not LS - is difficult). Is there anything else that could be causing what I feel is this loss? I also have vulval pain and what feels like \u2018buzzing\u2019 or a pins and needles sensation in the area. I have put on some weight recently, and have been pretty low/down and I wondered whether this might have anything to do with it. \nTLDR - at my wit\u2019s end, doctors unable to diagnose a problem, feel like I have labial fusion/shrinking but unsure whether my description of it is symptomatic of LS \nThanks for reading this!! Any and all replies helpful \u263a\ufe0f", "LS vs BXO management? Is there a big difference? I have joined a lot of groups, mostly for LS since BXO is more rare- and I have seen a lot of discussion about borax helping. I have seen discussion about soaking in borax, lubricating with coconut oil mixed with borax, etc. But I never see this being used as a healing aid for men? \n\nI am also confused about baths and moisturizing? I read that you should keep the area dry, so I feel like moisturizing or soaking would be contradicting? \n\nThank you in advance for helping me understand past my ignorance. I appreciate every comment or snack of information. The whole keeping dry and moisturising thing may seem contradictory at first, but as far as i understand, its not really.  Here is my underatanding of things..\n\nKeeping dry: I believe the objective here is keeping bodily fluids from coming in contact with skin.  Like that last drip that always wants to come out a minute after you finish peeing-&gt; wait so you can wipe it. You dont actually want your skin to dry out though.  \n\nMoisturizing: helps with overall skin health, and certain moisturizers like coconut oil may temporarily  serve as a protectice barrier over skin to keep bodily fluids from coming in contact with your skin.  Plus coconut oil has lots of linoleic acid, which has all kinds of potential health benefits for skin. Great reply. That is exactly how I see it. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nAlso just to add, as far as I understand it, BXO is the same thing as Lichen Sclerosis but is/was used when specifically talking about lichen sclerosis affecting the penis. \nMy urologist told me that they do not tend to call it BXO any more, at least here in the UK, and just cal it lichen sclerosis.

I have been suffering with random itching and irritation on my inner and outter labia for 5 months now. Some days it will be better and somedays it will a be worse. I feel like I have an abrasive sponge rubbing up against my vulva. I will also get random itchy/stinging pain on some spots on my skin, it almost feels like if my skin is cracked. I recently went to the gyno and he said my skin is fine and he does not believe I have lichen sclerosus. I am convinced otherwise. He gave me Lotriderm which is basically Clotrimazole/Betamethasone. Has anyone used this to treat their LS? And should the betamethasone work as well as clobetasol does? Lotriderm is for treating fungal infections.  My LS was misdiagnosed as \"jock itch\" for many years and I went through tubes of the stuff (called Lotrisone in the US).  No, it does not do a thing for it because LS is not a fungal infection.  At most, the cream may help temporarily soothe as any lotion can.  I recommend you get a second opinion.  Perhaps see both a dermatologist and another gynecologist. I definitely plan on getting a second opinion. I figured that since it has betamethasone in it maybe it could help a bit but so far I do not really notice any improvement but it is only been a week. What do you use for LS? I use Clobetasol, which is a prescription topical steroid ointment, and aloe vera gel for in between Clobetasol doses.  I use aloe as pure as possible, I often use my own plants, but I also order it in gel that does not have unnecessary additives. I am going to get my hands on some aloe Vera leaves soon so I can try it out. How long would you say it takes to start feeling relief after starting clobetasol? Everybody has a different experience.  For me, my LS went misdiagnosed for about 15 years following initial symptoms, so it spread and became pernicious before it was ever treated.  I never get complete relief.  I use the aloe every morning and every evening that I do not apply a dose of Clobetasol.  If I miss even a single application of either, I pay for it.\n\n\n\nIirc, over the first week of applying Clobetasol (prescribed as every day for one month, every other day for another month, and then twice weekly in perpetuity), I went from feeling like somebody was taking a belt sander to my undercarriage (my entire ano-genital area is affected) to just a sort of itchy bug bites type feeling.  Another week and I made it to just mildly uncomfortable.  I swing from \"ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch\" to \"well, that is annoying but I can live with it\" pretty regularly.  I now go back to the every other day dosage for the Clobetasol for a month when it gets bad and that helps.\n\n\n\nYou might want to consider switching from panties to boxers if yours is particularly bothersome.  I get men's boxers and am way more comfortable.  Some sufferers prefer to just be naked at home, but I have five teenagers in our home who probably would not appreciate that, so I will stick with the boxers.\n\n\n\nEdited for clarity", "Does anyone know what this can be? I have had these dryish/weak looking, what looks like streaks, on top of my penile shaft. have had them for a few months now. Do not know what it is. Also, the picture with the drawn circle in it, it is a hard bump, not under the skin. I am able to pinch it  Note: the bump in the picture I circled in, it is not I am under the skin, I am able to pinch it, it is like it is in the skin but it is not watt like looking or anything. I would recommend finding a doctor you can do a video call with or send pictures too, since it seems you are not able to see a doctor in person right now. \n\nI am saying this from a loving place: I think you are obsessing over this too much. I am not a doctor, but I see no reason to believe this is life threatening.\n\nSome general advice for genital skin irritation: if you wash with soap, make sure you are using a very mild, unscented bar soap. Also, wash your underwear with unscented detergent only. (That includes not using dryer sheets.) Give it a month or two and see if that helps at all. Got To second this. I do not have a penis but I have looked at a lot of them. Just as an amateur, of course, but nothing there alarms me on sight. Skin\u2019s weird, it gets bumps. If those streaks are not cracking open and bleeding as scarring, they are not at all like what I have going on. \n\nBut all of us here know what it is like to have pain not acknowledged because it is invisible. \n\nSo, your best bet is to ask a professional. The doctor kind, of course. They can help you with whether there is a concern to follow up on, or if you can relax. Based on photos and description, it does not look like LS. If it is not causing you pain or unbearable itching, it probably is not. But always check with a doc if stuff is changing. That is an expensive piece of equipment that it is perfectly okay to take good care of. It does have pain and itching, all the time... :-( best to check with a doc then. All we can do here is tell you it does or does not  look like what we have got, I guess.\n\nWhen the treatment is steroid cream you want that advice coming from a doc too. \n\nMight be silly, but consider what you might be using for masturbation. Creams and lubricants might irritate. Or lack thereof might irritate. That is the thing, doctors will not see me because of this pandemic going in right now... I have been calling my doctor every week about these issues. \n\nAnd for materbation I use lotion. I am a male and I usually cannot even masturbate because of the pain. However I do not use lotion. It irritates my skin, I instead use plain ole vaseline. \n\nAs for the photos, I will say that my penis looks nothing like that. There is a lot of white (my entire glans is white) also cracks, blisters, tears. The best thing that you can do is to try and share this with your PCP or attempt to get an appointment with a urologist or perhaps a dermatologist. This could be many things. Perhaps yeast, contact dermatitis, et cetera. \n\nDo not apply any soap directly to the affected area, soak in warm water for 20 minutes and use the water to clean. Clean your penis after each visit to the bathroom (water only) and ensure that you are dry afterwards. \n\nTry to refrain from masturbation or sex for the time being. Keep the skin hydrated using vaseline. It can also be used as a barrier to help keep urine from touching the skin.", "fear of having ls. how quickly does it progress? fear of having lichen sclerosus. how quickly does it progress?\n\neveryone is telling me it is a yeast infection. i currently have a few white patches down there with some slight itching and burning, but no bleeding or tearing. called the doctor and they said it sound exactly like yeast, so now i am on yeast medication. but my fear is that it isnt yeast and that it is ls. my biggest fear with this is that i will get labial fusion and my clitoris will get buried- that i will never have sex or an orgasm ever again. no one will listen to me because of my hypochondria. i am so scared. (19 y/o, ftm trans man, pre-t. no family history of ls, nor did i deal with it as a child- also not having any other classic autoimmune disorder symptoms). tbh i would rather die than never be able to have an orgasm or sex ever again lmao. i can deal with the patches, but i fear fusion and losing my clitoris. Hii, did you get a positive for yeast infection? I was treated for BV but when I got the test done it was negative and now I have done a biopsy because my dr thinks I have LS (still have not got the results). I suggest you get a biopsy done in case you are really worried about it. I am very scared aswell of everything you said but I know that if it is LS I rather know so I can treat it accordingly. \n\nBest of luck! i have not yet. my grandmother will not let me because she is so dead set on it being yeast...but she said if i do not feel better after the meds, that she will take me to the doctor. cant you take yourself? i wish, but i have a strict family. That is not going to happen if you use the clobetasol and make some healthy life choices- learning what foods possibly make you flare, managing stress, exercise, do not skimp on sleep. Live your best life and do not focus on the LS so much.", "Is this Lichen Sclerosus ? Hi everyone , I am 29 Male and from past two years i am having itchy anus at night .

Please reply how to do it.", "Clobetasol Finally got diagnose after 8 months as a circumcised 28 year old male... they gave me clobetasol but did not give me a ton of information. I have been using tacrolimus daily for months... he said to use it ONLY ON THE AFFECTED AREA. But like... do I just do this every other week for the rest of my life? \n\nI have a really mild case, and I caught it early... do I only use it when I am in pain? My symptoms arent really that crazy, there was a small white patch and a dull achey kind of pain constantly. I know there are mainly women on here and I am going to ask for help from the pharmacist, but what do you do? So when I was first diagnosed I used the clob for 10 days, twice a day (I applied after a shower in the morning and before bed at night.) My symptoms cleared up within the 10 days. I was not itchy and my patches disappeared so I had no reason to apply any longer. Now when I start to have any symptoms at all, I apply the clob and it usually stops a full on flare in a day. So I just use it for maintenance really. you should use the steroid on the affected area once a week for maintence and increase the dosage to 2x a day for a week then 1x a day for a week then back to the maintence once it is cleared. The steroid is important to use as it prevents LS from developing into cancer, so it is important to do the maintenance.", "Can lichen go into remission I have a biopsy tomorow and i fear my symptoms wont show as before 3 days ago i had a white ring around my foreskin it was lichen hard wierd 8,G,A shaped spots like dry paper and today i noticed they are still present but not as bulky they spikeup at somedays they are super white 0.2mm and sometimes they look like dry skin. Im afraid i will have a unaccurate biopsy.  I believe it can go into remission. You still have to do a maintainance regime with steroid cream but I am told it can be very successful in keeping things at bay. The thing i fear is 3 days ago it was present to be that white ring with number shaped white patches but now it looks just like white dry skin fused together. I hope biopsy will still work because i think it went into small remission again. I want to get circumsized asap and hope it wont retrurn. Lichen sclerosus looks different each day. Stuff like warm water or urine can set it off so it looks more white and harder and stuff, and then other days it looks more faded and less bumpy and stuff. It does not mean its going into remission unfortunately, just how the disease works for a lot of people with it on their foreskin So a biopsy will show even if its in remission ?  im in fear that the biopsy will come out negative like 60% of the time for lichen and then it will spread. The scarring is going to stay there from the bxo obliterations and stuff so I would say if you really are going into remission, they might still see it in a biopsy, but like I said, I do not think yours is going into remission, just showing normal changes in your disease that happen, the Sclerosus is still there That is normal changes in BXO. You probably are not in remission especially considering the time frame, this is typical changes well bad luck i didnt sleep for 24h i went to the dermo. to  get a biopsy like my doctor wanted and she didnt do a biopsy she just checked it said i dont know what it is she will transfer me to a Urologist for some reason and prescribed me Advantan and said dont use it 30 days before the urologist. I asked about circumsision asap so this thing dosent spread to my glans and she ignored it. Oh jesus this doctors. You are being too panicky about this. LS is an autoimmune disorder, even a circumcision will not guarantee eliminating the disease even if it is just in your foreskin. It can come back. What you need to do now is calm down, there are worse diseases to have and you cannot do much to fix it. So stop worrying to the point of not sleeping, get yourself together and wait to go to a urologist you do not even have a diagnosis yet Well it looks like it and i have dry skin patches just like this ones before they went wild near the string behind it so i think it would be a difficult circumsision. She prescribed me the cream for it so what else can it be. White patches that look like dry paper forming a ring and making the foreskin tight but yes i  get you there are much much worse things you can get in life. Im on testostorone resplacement therapy for 3 years and i always had this tight foreskin area part i guess the stress and damage to it overtime made LS appear or maybe it was LS from the start just not as strong. Got the results from the dermo not biopsy. They think its Leukoplakia or Lichen but im not sure are this two the same condition ? to me it looks more like lichen anyway going to see a urologist tomorow.", "2 docs say it is dermatitis\u2026.. 6 months still like this ", "How do you maintain/clean between clob applications? (38F) I am in my first five days of clob 2x daily and I was wondering, do you clean the vulva area sometime between applications? Am I putting ointment on top of ointment? Occasionally I have used desitin and it does not always get fully absorbed so I have been rinsing some. I have not been using toilet paper when I pee, just a small amount of water and patting dry. I have showered but I am not sure how to attend to the area, as it were. Thanks guys. I just rinse well with water, it is very difficult because it is such a sore area. In theory you could perhaps you use a gentle baby wipe, however I am not sure if it would cause more irritation from the chemicals. I use vitamin E oil in between to act as a barrier moisturisers and it really helps the itchiness and soreness :) Get a bidet toilet seat, these are great! Washes pee off afterwards, and air dries. Also wash in shower daily, Pat dry. It is important to wash yourself and apply new medicine Cleaning for me has been one of the most important steps! Of course only with water if you are someone with a Vagina, but I noticed my itching has gone down tremendously when I keep myself clean. My best bet for you is every time you reapply ointment make sure your surface is clean. Do not apply on top of previous/old ointment because there is unnecessary bacteria buildup. Warm water and dab with a soft cloth. Never wipe! Or sit in a tub for ten minutes or so.", "Have any of you\u2026. Had your white skin completely reverse? If so how was this done? To my understanding clobetasol is only to prevent further spread. Also if you have tried other creams what were they? Success stories appreciated. I have never been fully diagnosed with LS but was told it probably is. Im 23 circumcised male and been dealing with this since 16. It is really messed with my self esteem. I have the thick white skin and this has been very destructive to my skin. Half of my glans looks like a chunk of skin was completely sliced off. Anyone know if this can be fixed? Doctors are zero help. Seen 2 derms and a urologist. Never been sexually active cause it is so embarrassing. I had a skin sample taken and they found nothing. Seriously do not know what to do anymore. From self esteem issues to anxiety to depression. I just want to be normal in a normal relationship. I am in my prime and have like the most embarrassing problem you can have. I do not know what to do anymore. I would give all my money for my junk to just be normal. Sigh. :( I didnt try It, but some people had good results with prp Am a woman. I never really had much *thick* white skin. I did have very *thin* white skin, dramatic purple white tissue-paper figure eight. And clobetasol returned it to normal-looking skin. It goes back and forth over time - flares up, I start tearing and scarring, clobetasol calms it down. \n\nI cannot imagine half-the-glans-sliced-off look being related to LS, though. Maybe I have a crappy imagination but it sounds like you need to keep shopping doctors - along with a written list of treatments you have tried, and any relevant dates of physical changes - until you find one who can give an actual diagnosis. Somewhere out there is a doc that will help. You have to push through all the bullshit until you find them. \n\nI suspect you will find dating and sex easier as you get a little older. Young women might be uncertain, but once they start hitting their late twenties and have some life experience, they are going to be less likely to care about an unusual-looking penis, as long as they can be assured it is not contagious. They might even hope or assume that you will be more empathetic to their own issues, since you have suffered too.  Does not help you much today, I guess, but I think it will get better for you. Hello man I never been properly diagnose as well but I do have some discolouration in my glans that started three months ago \u2026I have been using clob but does not do anything. I do not have any skin itching or burning sensations it is just that my skin is a little bit of white at some parts but feels like normal skin. I understand your frustration, it is not easy with me as well but I try to not think too much about it when I am having sex or at least I try to do that with the lights toned down lately. But to be completely honest my girlfriend says that she does not really care so maybe it is something that is more on our heads and we should not care too much about it if it is just cosmetics. My skin stays decently pink and healthy looking as long as I am consistent with my maintenence clob. If I feel ok and start forgetting to use it then the tissue fades to that dead gray than goes white eventually. By the time the pain and itching comes back to remind me I have been an idiot, I know the colours have changed.\n\nEdit to add: Female, official diagnoses was 5 or 6 years ago, caught very early during a self check.

What is everyone is thoughts on emu oil for LS?  I have been using it for a few days now and definitely notice it keeps the area more moisturized than nothing. There are varying quality levels of emu oils.  Be aware of inexpensive emu oils as they may have been processed using shortcuts compromising quality and safety. Or they include added fillers to save on cost. Look for American Emu Association seal to be certain you are buying an oil that has been safely processed with the highest standards.  I use Emu oil from Montana Emu oil ranch. It is AEA certified. I use it everyday multiple times a day to keep from drying out. It is the best. ", "25 year old male with just appearance issues Hi all, been following posts on here since my diagnosis roughly a year ago. Likely to be a lengthy post as there is been a few twists and turns in my own personal tale! \n\nBrief history: I suffered with phimosis from birth, until roughly 2 years ago when I was first able to fully retract my foreskin following a stretching regime. 6 months after, some raised white patches appear on my glands, and now cover the majority of the top side (side facing up) . The patches are like the 'wrinkled tissue paper' described in many online and NHS resources, and are quite extensive. Weird thing is I cannot cannot remember if they were there as soon as I could pull more foreskin back, or developed following this.\n\nI initially thought it was a hygiene issue due not being able to wash properly for 20 odd years so went about trying to keep myself clean, cleaning with water in the shower and using coconut oil as I read this does not interfere with natural pH etc. This did not help so I made a drs appointment. They took a swab of the area which came back clear and told me to try Canesten cream for a few weeks - did this and no change. Follow up appointment I was given Betnovate to use every evening for a month - again no effect.\n\nMy GP then sent some photos to a dermatologist and urologist and both said LS, and was put on Clobaderm for a month, applying once every night. I was also advised to keep the area dry (e.g from urine) and the standard advice of washing/moisturising with a gentle emollient.\n\nI saw some improvement after a month (plaques less pronounced and less white) and was told by my gp to continue for another 2 months applying every evening. I have now come to the end of the time and I feel like I am no further than when I started treatment.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else is in the same position - I have no itchiness, no redness, my only issue is the extensive white plaque-style pathology that will not go away. I have to admit, I do have issues urinating and tend to be rather messy sometimes (e.g when foreskin has moved around a bit following sex/masturbation/first thing in the morning). And I would say I have slight incontinence issues, like dribbling a little after finishing urinating. I think a combo of keeping my glands dry from urine and clob did lead to some improvement. I also think that keeping my foreskin retracted does reduce the appearance of the plaques (by keeping it dry etc), but is not a permanent fix.\n\nWould be good to hear from others who have similar, appearance-only issues, and whether you have managed to improve this. \n\nCheers! Hi it sounds like you have quite a bit of LS /Bxo on the glans you should see your dermatologist and urologist for their opinion and advice. In my case I had it mostly on the foreskin frenulum and just some patches on the glans in the end I decided to have a circumcision witch was the best decision so far I am in remission. I only keep an eye out for it now as it could come back. I feel it is important to keep the glans dry when you urinate react you foreskin and dry off completely. is your meatus affected? If so you should see a specialist. LS can be a long term problem and you may need to manage your condition long term but hopefully it will improve for you.  Hey!\n\nI am in the same position as you \u2014 only visible symptoms, but no itchiness, redness, pain etc. Well except for the phimosis which I think I also have since birth (at least I do not have any memory of fully retracting my foreskin before the age of 24, when I actually first started treating my LS with corticoid cream, which made the phimosis much less severe).\n\nI think I also have the same peeing, dribbling-after-urinating issues (only sometimes though, maybe once a month?), probably also because theres a lot of loose foreskin, but it was never really an issue that could not be solved with proper hygiene.\n\nI am currently 30 and did not treat the disease at all for the last 6 to 7 years, but I actually saw a dermatologist today and I want to continue treating it now. I had much success 6-7 years ago, when the urologist prescribed me corticoid/anti-fungal cream (and applying olive oil!) for a couple of weeks. The white patches where gone or barely visible and the phimosis was less severe like I mentioned before. And my plan is currently to try the cream for more than 3 weeks only (since there are so many cases online that report some or complete success doing just conservative therapy), but the dermatologist I saw immediately suggested to do a biopsy and circumcision... :/ Apparently circumcision can(!) be a cure, but there are no long-term studies on the matter and cases of LS re-appearing after circumcision. So I am currently skeptical if that is worth the risk. But maybe that is the permanent solution you are searching for. \n\nOf course everyone reacts differently to treatments and I cannot really report anything new yet, since I did not treat my LS for 7 years or so. But the corticoid + olive oil combo (plus strict genital hygiene, i.e. always remove every drop of urine) was really helpful for me and that is what I will try again now, starting tomorrow!", "Does dilators work with LS? I was diagnosed with LS about 1.5 years ago when I was 24 and for me the mental part has been the hardest. \nHas anyone tried dilators? Would love to hear if that actually works. \nI cannot really have sex anymore because I get so sored afterwards. It feels like a papercut and then It could hurt for either an hour or for a week, No one knows. I would really like to hear your experiences I used dilators for a while! They helped stretch out the skin. I also used coconut oil a few hours before hand to help moisturize it but I would not recommend this if you have an allergy or sensitivity to that. Dilators and a LOT of lubricant did help to the point I could do PIV once again. Now, I do not use the dilators as much because luckily my symptoms improved some, but I ask my partner to go super slow at first to give the skin some time to stretch and adjust, to prevent a tear, and this has been working. And afterward I always take a warm bath to help draw blood to the area so it can heal if it hurt (and usually it does hurt a little in the beginning)!", "Meta : Has time come to talk about sex pics ? Really I have no issues with the idea and I am not blaming whose who post pics of their sex, I understand that this place is about this too.\n\nBut... maybe there should be rules (like posting in a specific way \\)\n\nOr am I the one in the wrong and I should just unsub and only come here when I am prepared ?\n\nI repeat it, I am not blaming anyone. Just wondering what people think and if there is a need for a better way to do this. I am ok with pics of genitalia as long as it is clearly marked \u201cNSFW\u201d so I can choose to open the pic or not. \nI for some people I think it is SO hard to explain what is happening and it feels easier and more straight forward to post a pic m. \nIf you are uncomfortable with that it does not mean you are wrong, just different comfort levels. I agree. I do think that the rule should be it has to be marked NSFW, so it will not be visible until you specifically try to look at it. Do you think that is a fair compromise? \n\nI am one of the new mods and have been thinking of improvements. Keep an eye out for an updated pinned post! I honestly just do not see the point of posting a picture in order to try and get a diagnosis on reddit. If you are wondering if you have LS, you need to contact a doctor and ask for a biopsy. Even the one's of us who have LS cannot tell the person what it is. So it does not bother me but it is just not necessary. \"sex pics\"? I am getting pretty tired of dick pics. \n\nStarting to feel like a dumbass - is it compassionate to look at an earnest dude\u2019s concern, or am I getting tricked into looking at dicks?\n\nWomen do not post as many pictures and they tend to be marked nsfw.  Bothers me less. But there is dicks everywhere now. Yeah non native english speaker. I realize pics of genitalia would have been more appropriated. Yes it would definitely be an improvement. So I looked into it and it looks like we only have one rule and it is that pictures must be marked NSFW. And unless I have missed something, (I do not get notifications about mod things so it is totally possible) I have not seen anyone breaking this rule recently. \n\nDo you think there is anything more specific that should be added?", "I was finally able to have sex again!!!! I have not been able to have any sex at all whatsoever since march, and now that I am on both clobetasol and estradiol, im getting so much better and i was actually able to last night!! Im so happy. For a long while i felt like i was broken and i had very little hope. Clobetasol alone wasnt working for me super well but adding estradiol made it get so much better. So glad you found something that is working so well for you! Thanks for sharing with everybody. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Its good to have encouraging stories to balance things out\u262f\ufe0f Omg I literally so relate to this! My doctor just suggested this to me- Mixing them before applying. How long do you think it took before you started feeling better? I am hopeful! Glad you are feeling better! I am so happy for you! I hope I will be able to be in this camp soon but still healing from the biopsy. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nHow long did it take to work? It really depends on the person. Some people, once put on clobetasol, are back to normal in 2-ish months. For me , I have been on it since June and im still pretty fucked up. I had/have a very bad case though. And it seems that i need both clobetasol and estradiol in order to get better, which i didnt realize until mid October (so that might be the reason its taking me so long to get better?) It still has not fully gone away, and even though i was able to have sex this time I tore pretty bad.  In any case i wish you the best! It can be tough getting diagnosed and prescribed medication but once you get through that, the worst is over. Thanks for sharing! So glad you found a working solution \ud83d\ude0a! And, I super appreciate the tip! \n\nWhen I got my LS dx several months ago, I had asked my doc about visiting estrogen therapy or cream on my follow-up visit due to same issue as you. The c-ointment hugely helps a lot of my  symptoms, but sex is still a minefield for me... I think it is time for me to ask doc about that E2-E3 we talked about back when I could barely put pants on. \ud83d\ude01", "Dermatologist, gynecologist, or even-more-specialist? Does anyone have advice on finding a doctor who is knowledgeable about LS? \n\nLast week I saw a nurse practitioner in gynecology. She agreed I very likely have LS, but referred me to a dermatologist for confirmation of the diagnosis and treatment. I asked her if I should not see a vulval specialist instead, and she said I would probably have to wait too long to get an appointment. So I made an appointment with the derm, but it is not until late January anyway.\n\nI am worried the derm will not know anything about LS, which makes me nervous for two reasons- 1) I read that a biopsy is not needed if the doctor has enough experience to diagnose it from appearance, and I *really* do not want a biopsy and 2) I have a relative with LS who has gotten ineffective treatment and lots of inconclusive biopsies over the years. And I have lots of other personal and family history of people getting the wrong treatment for years for other conditions because their doctor was not a specialist and did not know what they were doing.\n\nThe thing is, I have no idea how to find a doctor near me who actually knows anything about LS. I looked at ob/gyn offices in my area on healthgrades.com, but the specialities listed are super vague. Thanks for any advice on this! I am hoping for some advice in this area as well. At this point, I went through the biopsy a year ago and been \u201ctreated\u201d by my OBGYN but she is been less than helpful.... I think that this condition is so rare, so many doctors will just prescribe clob, because that is kind of the go-to.  There is only 1 vulvar specialist in my area (that I know of) and my insurance does not cover him!  It is so frustrating because I was I could find a doctor who has more answers!  My OB has been helpful, but he told me he does not see this condition very often. My derm was really knowledgeable about LS and was amazing, but I also very specifically chose to go to a female derm because my previous three male derms dismissed it as a yeast infection. Go to a female derm w good reviews, and you should be good! Derms specialize in skin so I think they would be pretty familiar with it. If you are concerned your derm will not know much about LS, you could always call and see if they are familiar with it before potentially wasting your time. That is what I did before going to my appt. I did not need a biopsy or anything. He just took one look and was like \"yup that is LS\" and then after about 2 months, my symptoms went away 99 percent. I would definitely ask for a biopsy, but a dermatologist seems like the better route. My obgyn was 100% sure I had LS, I had a biopsy done and it was eczema instead. I was treated for 3 months with clobetasol and it was not helping me as it does for everyone else with LS. Finally with my result \u2014 I was told stop. It is very easy to get wrongfully diagnosed, and the strong steroid used for LS can do more damage than good if you are treating the wrong thing! I am a gynecologist who specializes in vulvar pain and skin conditions at the Center for Vulvovaginal Disorders (CVVD) in Washington DC.  Many women have difficulty finding a specialist for vulvar lichen schlerosus.  It is a condition caught between two specialties- dermatologist train in it, but do not often look at the vulva; Gyns look at the vulva everyday but do not always have the training to identify, diagnose, and treat effectively. I wish there was a database for VLS providers- I am working with one of the support groups on this.  I have a lot of information on my education-based Instagram if anyone is interested  So many ob guns thought I had a yeast infection for years. So annoying I saw my family doctor, a walk in doctor who was amazing, had a biopsy at a gyne (came back inconclusive) and finally saw a derm. All of them diagnosed me on sight, even though the biopsy could not confirm the diagnosis. \n\nI felt like the derm was the one who really confirmed it though. We have hundreds of doctors that have been tried and recommended to diagnose and treat LS.    \n( Do I have to join the Facebook group to view this list? I do not usually put my health information on Facebook.", "Clobetasol Treatment &amp; Biopsy After Steroids I was clinically diagnosed with Lichen Sclerosis by a Gyno about 15 years ago now (I am now 41). The doctor said she did not need a biopsy because the fusing of my Labia and other symptoms made an obvious diagnosis. So she started me on Clobetasol and I have been taking it on sporadic as needed basis ever since. Back then it was thought that LS caused thinning of the skin so I only used it when I needed it. Fast forward to now, I am learning that LS causes thickening of the skin so it is ok to use Clobetasol more liberally and actually it would be wise for prevention. I am noticing a change again in my labia that I have not noticed changing since my twenties\u2026I had my new gyno (I moved so I needed a new one) check it out but she could not see anything, but I know it is changing, I can feel it. \n\nSo time to rethink my Clobetasol treatment plan in terms of frequency and location of application. My new gyno says apply it all over once per week for maintenance. But I have heard from an expert source (Dr Goldstein) to soak in warm water for 15 minutes to soften the skin for better absorption and then apply Clobetasol (size of a pea) massaging in for 90seconds - do this twice a week. What he does not indicate is do I apply it everywhere? Including the anus? Or just the affected parts. What is your Clobetasol treatment maintenance plans (frequency, amount &amp; location)? I would love to hear from as many people as possible as there seems to be a lot of discrepancies around this. \n\nAlso I am thinking I might need to do this routine daily for 4 weeks if I am noticing new structural changes and then every other day for 4 weeks prior to getting back to maintenance. But this is not my doctor recommending because she did not find any new changes, so I am feeling unsure of what to do and would appreciate any advice.\n\nLastly, I heard again from Dr Goldstein that getting a biopsy after being on steroids would be useless because once you take clobetasol it changes your skin so unlikely it would show anything. Feeling a bit frustrated wishing that my younger self thought to ask for a biopsy first but alas that is not the case. I am fairly certain the LS diagnosis was correct and was confirmed by 3 gyno\u2019s but I would love to be 100% sure if I am to take steroid ointment the rest of my life. Has anyone had a biopsy after using clobetasol? Did it turn anything up?\n\nThank you for your help! I was told to do twice per week for maintenance in kind of a figure 8 shape. I wonder if the perianal portion of the figure 8 should be treated for preventative maintenance or only if the anal area is affected? Everything you are saying is 100% in line with current research.\n\nI have a video on YouTube discussing some of the science behind the skin thickening and skin thinning debate. It is important that health care providers stay on top of science, which is bound to change over time, and not rely on outdated information - this can literally cost lives.\n\nWith respect to the protocol, that is absolutely spot on. With respect to where to apply, you apply it to the affected area. For me, that is the vulva. I do not apply to the anal region because I do not have LS there, however, if you do, then yes, you would apply it to that area as well. When I say vulva, all the parts are OK to apply it to.\n\nThe standard treatment plan that has been corroborated by multiple researchers in Canada, the USA, the UK, and Australia goes as follows: 1 daily for the first month, every other day for month 2, and then month 3 you switch to a maintenance protocol and keep this up for life. I have tons of posts on why it is important to stay on your maintenance protocol (if you are interested, you can subscribe to my blog at ( or follow me on IG  and/or search that name in YouTube, and this, again, is corroborated by current research, including double-blinded trials, Cochrane reviews, etc. Maintenance protocol = 2x a week and you can choose your days. I choose Monday and Thursday split but some choose a Wednesday/Saturday split. Either is OK. Choose what works for you and your schedule.\n\nThe thing about biopsy is also true and very frustrating. I was diagnosed over 3 and a half years ago like you based on clinical examination. I literally had almost all symptoms and had lost a lot of my architecture (hence my The Lost Labia Chronicles because I lost my labia to LS). But now, I have been in remission for over a year and a half. According to my specialist, my LS is so well managed that if it were not for the resorption of my labia, you would never know I had LS. Because I have been on maintenance for so long, it is very likely that if I were to get a biopsy it would come back negative for LS. Dr. Goldstein suggests a minimum of 2 weeks off of the steroid prior to biopsy, but he and others at the CVVD suspect it could mask a positive LS result for even longer. The exact duration is not known.\n\nThis is extremely frustrating and I understand your frustration. Work from the underground, many organizations and doctors are trying to draft a generalized protocol for diagnosing and treating LS such that biopsies are standard care when diagnosing so that patients know for certain if it is LS or not.\n\nIf you have follow up questions, let me know :) Sorry can I piggyback on this post and ask a question since it seems like you know so much! I went from daily for a month to twice per week as per dr\u2019s instructions, but I find that I am now getting pimples and itching (which I never had before). Do you know if there are any withdrawal effects from reducing usage? I cannot decide if I need to be using it more for the sudden itch or less because I think it is maybe giving me pimples! It is hard to say exactly what is causing the pimples and itch. I have never heard of the pimples from everyone I have spoken to, nor have I seen this in the literature as a side effect of steroids. It is possible, at least with the itch, that you may need to stay on daily for another couple of weeks. It is also possible that it is a reaction to something in the base of your steroid, though I think this is less likely if you tolerated it before; allergic reactions to steroids usually occur right away. If it is allergy-based, your doctor can have the steroid compounded into a base without the allergen in question. Or, there could be something else going on in addition to the LS. If possible, I think your best bet would be to get checked by a doctor to rule those things out and possibly change the base of your medicine if it is allergy-based. In the meantime, you could also call your pharmacist. They have more knowledge about side effects and drug interactions than our doctors, so they may be able to provide you with some answers in the interim. This is what I do whenever I wait for my doctor to see me. Do you apply anything else to the area? No just the Clob. I did not find much when googling this either but the medication info sheet does mention pimples! I am wondering if maybe it is just so thick it clogged the pores. I also came off hormonal BC to help with the LS so I guess it could be that + hormones also. I never had itching from the LS before I started treating it which is the annoying part. I will probably try to wait it out a bit longer before following up with the dr since she is pretty useless (thinks I am too young to have LS). Her colleague was the one who diagnosed me but she is out on maternity leave for a while. Ugh, that is so wrong. Infants and toddlers can get LS, you are not too young. Again, that information is outdated. If the pimples is from the Clob, there are other alternative out there like Halobetasol and Betamethasone. And any of these can be compounded if need be. Are you on Instagram? I cannot comment of If the BC is the culprit with the vulvar acne because I have not read anything on this, however, it is a possibility. I think I probably follow your main account on Instagram already! I keep thinking I should try to do one of the virtual meet up sessions but it has not quite come together yet. I am the lost labia chronicles on IG. The meetups are great because there are a bunch of people who can share their perspectives and experiences which can be super helpful and validating. Such a helpful comment, thank you. Thank you! I actually watched your videos on YouTube and then watched Dr Goldstein\u2019s webinar, so thank you for bringing me up to date! I am wondering whether I need to start with the daily application for a while since I have noticed some structural changes this year or if because I have been sporadically taking Clobetasol for 15 years if maintenance will do the trick, do you have any thought around this? Also I do not have LS in my anal area but am concerned that if I do not apply the clobetasol as a preventative it will pop up there? I appreciate your help! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f I would not use the clob on the anal area unless you have LS there. If you do not have LS there, the skin is healthy and the steroids may just irritate you instead. Should you start daily...depends. What have you been doing steroid wise the last month? How is your pain or itch or discomfort level? What are your current symptoms? This will help me get a better understanding of where you are at. Also Dr Gs webinar is fantastic Gotcha, thanks for your opinion! My symptoms are pretty minor, mild itch but most importantly I can feel like the skin is starting to fuse in a new area. I have been using clob once a week for a while now but not religiously- I often miss a week or two, so not great. Fair enough. So I am not a doctor and cannot tell you what is best for your body, but if it were me, I would probably try 2x a week and see if that helps at all first. \n\nIf that does not help, you could always do 1x daily for a couple weeks, then every other day for a couple weeks and then into maintenance mode. Consistent steroid use will be important to prevent further architectural changes as it addresses the inflammation responsible for this.\n\nTrust your body. If you decide to go daily and you notice redness, this is often a sign you need to lower the frequency of application - this information is from Dr  Gayle Fisher. Thanks so much! I really appreciate your advice- you are a wealth of information \ud83d\ude4f", "20F new here and have a few questions Hey guys, I am 20F that just got a biopsy back as Lichen sclerosus and or Lichen Planus. I am having a follow up soon to discuss this more but there does not really seem to be much of an LP community so here I am. \n\nI have read a lot of posts on here but I have a few things that I have not got a clear answer on sorry this is long but I am young and worried! I will be going over these things with my doctor next appointment anyways but it is a few weeks away. \n\n\n1. Can you go swimming? I am thinking of joining a gym that has a salt water pool but im not sure if swimming is irritating or bad for the steroid creams? I am only using hydrocortisone 2.5 right now because clobetasol was irritating and so was Halbatosol. \n\n\n2. Does exercise or weight loss make your symtoms better or worse? I have lost 60 pounds right before being diagnosed and I want to lose another ~ 30ish but I am scared that will make me have a bad flare. \n\n\n3. Sex, I am a virgin so I do not know if it will be painful for me or not but exams are very painful for me. My doctor said I would be able to have sex because I have not fused over and that my length and width are normal but she did not mention anything about pain. Do you use dialators? Where did you get them, how long have you used them and when did you see improvement? What lube and condoms do you use and does the steroid affect your partner? \n\n\n4. For those of you who have lost your labia minora, do partners care? I still have some of mine left but they are discolored and small. I basically have nothing near my vaginal opening only around my clit area. \n\n\n\n5. Pubic hair. Do you find that having hair irritates the skin? I have always been a bush woman and have never shaved but recently I have been trimming pretty short and I think there is been less irritation. I am thinking of getting an electric razor but not sure if that would be good for LS skin. \n\n\n6. Toilet paper and underwear, best brands? Right now I am using MD and Jockey but curious about what other people use. \n\n\n7.  Has anyone here gotten their covid shot? I just got my first dose of Moderna yesterday and I am not having any symtoms but I am worried that the 2nd shot will cause a flare. Has anyone had a flare after the second shot? \n\n\n8. Does anyone here smoke weed? Does it help your symtoms at all? I am curious if anyone sees improvement with thc or cbd. And from what I have heard alcohol is bad? \n\nThanks! Sorry if formating is bad im on mobile", "So do you use clob if you have no visible white patches or other stuff to treat? Do you just put it all over then? Early stage Still confused about what exactly I am supposed to be doing. My gyn did not give me very clear instructions. I am still in my first week of using clob, but I am also still confused about what I am supposed to be doing with it. I guess I am just worried I will use it on areas that do not need it and ruin my skin or something.\n\nI am 28, early stages. I have one white patch and some whitening along the edges of my labia minora, but I am assuming I am doing preventative treatment too? Those are the only places I have visible symptoms of LS. \n\nOtherwise, I itch like I have a yeast infection near the entrance of my vagina, but I was told not to put it inside, and I have burning like little paper cuts between my inner and outer labia. But there is no white skin where I feel that burning and itching. The white areas themselves do not bother me at all, just these places where it looks normal.\n\nThe skin of my clitoral hood was also turning brownish where it used to be pink (before starting clob, so it is not from that) and I do not know if LS does that or if it is just aging?\n\nI feel like my Gynecologist barely gave me any information about what I am dealing with or what to expect, or even how I am meant to be treating this.\n\nI asked for more specific instructions on what I am supposed to do, but they just replied back with \"Apply wherever there is irritation.\" So I guess my entire inner labia and clit hood where I have itching and burning?? Do I need to put it on my outer labia too, even though I have no symptoms there?\n\nIt is aggravating that I have to wait for 2 months to be seen for her to let me know how I am doing with the treatment, which will technically be finished by then, aside for the weekly upkeep.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post and repeating questions, I just need more information than they are giving me. You want to put it wherever you have symptoms, and any symptoms are included, not just the white patches. So definitely use it on the area where you have \"paper cuts\". If you are seeing changes in the color of your clitoral hood, you should probably use it there as well. The possibility of your hood fusing to parts of your clitoris is, in my opinion, a good enough reason to be proactive about using it. It sounds like your outer labia do not have any symptoms, so you do not need to use it there. At your follow up appointment, explain where you have and have not used it so you and your doc can have clearer communication about what is needed going forward. Thank you! This is much more helpful than anything I have been told so far by my doctor!", "Any endurance athletes? I (37F) got confirmed LS results from a biopsy a month or so ago. This is all new to me - 6 weeks ago I had not even heard of LS!\n\nI am what you could call a recreational endurance athlete, primarily running. My longest run so far is 50k/31m. \n\nAny other distance/endurance athletes out there? What is your experience with LS? Would love to hear from you! I just started tennis lessons when I got the diagnosis. I want to still play tennis and wear all the athletic gear. I worry about my skin sweating in the tight leggings. What do I wear instead? How can I still be active during a flare up. I guess I am figuring it out as I go! Blah!", "Stopping Clobetasol Hi everyone, I asked a question a few days ago about my doctor telling me to stop using Clobetasol, I just wanted to know if anyone else has been told to stop using Clobetasol. My doctor told me to just use Lube from now on whenever I feel dry but I found that the lube dries up in like an hour and I have to keep applying it. Has this happened to anyone else and if so what did you use to keep yourself from not drying up? I would seek another opinion. Are you seeing a dermatologist? About that - lube drying up in an hour - my doctor told me to always put a bit in my vagina as well, as it will stop vulva drying up so fast and also I discovered that the only thing which helps me is a lube with lactic acid. Ofcourse - discuss this with your doctor, but if you can find something with similar ( it might be worth trying if your doctor gives you a green light! I had to quit clob because I developed Cushing's syndrome. The best moisturizer BY FAR for me was Aquaphor Healing Ointment. However, now my doc thinks I might be reacting to petrolatum, and suggested coconut oil or... Crisco. Both of them dry out really quickly and have to be reapplied frequently, I have also tried lube and found it to be entirely inadequate. I just have to wait two more weeks to prove that I am not allergic to petrolatum (which is a very rare allergy) and I can finally get back to the good stuff! Very long way to say that I highly recommend Aquaphor Healing Ointment as long as you dont have sensitivity to petrolatum or lanolin. Good luck! i LOVE the honey pot company's coconut-oil based moisturizer! my derm also gave me a different ointment that kind of applies like an ointment (aquafor) to use instead of clob as well, but she said it is just nice to have as an option (and not required). No, I am seeing a gynecologist I will ask her about that, thank you! I will try it out, thank you :) I will look into it, thank you! You might consider a dermatologist since it is considered a skin disease. I will try that out, thank you I will try it out, thank you! Were you just using a topical steroid and developed that? Is that common? Sorry to hear that that is happened to you. I believe it is quite rare. My doc had me on a pretty aggressive treatment regimen because I was not responding. He said he is prescribed vulvar clob to hundreds of people over the past 30 years and he is never seen this happen before. I had some of the symptoms before, but they were quite minor and I did not know they were connected to each other. Clob kicked it all into high gear. It might be a blessing in disguise if this means catching it and starting treatment earlier than I otherwise would have. Seeing an endocrinologist next Monday, fingers crossed!", "Steroid cream (diprosone) staining underwear Just as the title says. I am finding that my white underwear are turning grey in the crotch since having to apply diprosone in the morning and evening. Anyone else having similar issues? Should I just not buy white/light colored underwear from now on? I think it will visibly stain any underwear that is not black or another very dark color. I have a spot on my hip that I put my ointment on as well as my lady bits and the ointment on my hip left a dark blotch on the side of some grey underwear I wore the other day. Sadly I am not sure what can be done about it Black underwear from now on I guess! Thanks for replying \u263a\ufe0f", "LS Progression Can anyone tell me if LS is ALWAYS progressive? Providing appropriate treatment is used, does this disease continue to worsen over time? There seems to be conflicting opinions from different medical websites/journals. \n\nObviously symptoms and the disease itself varies from person to person, but I am curious to hear your experiences. Well I imagine if you are treating it, it is not going to worsen... I have had LS for maybe 4 or 5 years now. I have been using a steroid gel/cream on and off and I use CeraVe hydrating cleanser daily (it is actually a face wash that my derm suggested to use as a feminine wash bc it is gentle and hydrating- total LIFE SAVER- highly recommend) I went from applying ointment every day to maybe once every 2 months? I have not had itching in like 3 years unless I have been dried out by salt water at the beach on vacation. I do not get fissures anymore unless I HAD to use a baby wipe for some reason like on a camping trip and I needed to do a quick wash up. Overall, it has not progressed for me. I read articles that said it is not treatable but my dermatologist said that it is. So I have no idea.\n\nI know at first I tried changing my diet. No gluten or nightshades but I saw no difference with changing it. I know some people say it is helped improve their LS, but in my case it did not. Really the only thing that helped with the steroid gel and the CeraVe cleanser. \n\nI am no doctor but I really recommend those who have a severe case of dried out skin due to LS to purchase a bottle. It is great your case is stable and you can apply the topical treatment so rarely! This was the kind of input I was wanting. I have realized there is no set list of symptoms each person with LS encounters so it is good to know such an outcome is possible. Thanks! Your welcome, hopefully more people will share their experiences and what they do for their LS routine so others can learn what might help them \ud83d\ude0a Depends on the underlying cause. For men the most popular idea is that it is urine that is trapped under the foreskin that is the culprit for the inflammation. When I saw my dermatologist he said that LS can be progressive, but did not say that it always was. I think this will be different for different people. There are many diseases which are progressive for some, stable for others, and remissive in some lucky people. Monitor your symptoms and try and keep them under control. Mine has slowly progressed over the past 5 years. But the symptoms change. I do not itch anymore. But my skin has slowly discolored and changed. When symptoms flare up I control it with clob and use emollients every day. I(m) have had mild LS for 3 years and after two years of worsening it is now recessing. The scars are there but the skin recovers its colors and does not itch anymore. I never treated it medically. Only making sure the skin is not wet (as reccomended by my dermatologist) and maybe cold showers. In my opinion, the thing that helps the most is dry skin and getting enough rest. My doctor has me using Clobetasol 3x week. I have one tiny patch that never clears, but the rest is gone. I am on my 3rd or 4th year of having this. Thanks for your input everyone. It is much appreciated. I have had LS for about a year now, diagnosed at 32.  I also had this strange tissue buildup in my clit, which meant that it swelled up like crazy and was super itchy/painful. I ended up being able to expel the tissue, kind of like a pimple. After that went away, it was just the discomfort of the LS.\n\nI was put on Triamcinolone .1% 2x/day, then went down to 1x/day. That worked for like 8 months but I am having flare ups in the morning where I wake up crazy hot and itchy at 5am. I have gone back to sporadic 2x/day treatment, but the godsend in the last few days has been taking an antihistamine at night (Claritin). Sleeping through the night way better now. \n\n+1 to loving Coconut Oil, it is the best. I am going to try CeraVe now too!", "Vulva biopsy So I just had a biopsy at my appt today and I am wondering if anyone had any helpful tips for healing and comfort?? Yes. Been there, healed that. Warm epsom salt laced baths are great. Keep the wound clean by irrigating it with warm water after peeing. I actually peed in the shower with the water running for several days. If you cannot do that, get some water only baby wipes and clean up afterward. PS good luck! Definitely possible to shower while peeing thank you!! I never would have thought of that. A couple autoimmune issues are hitting me hard rn so I am house ridden for awhile. Glad to help. Same as the other poster. The one piece of advice I can give is to go in the shower or I poured a cup of warm water while I was peeing at the same time for many days. I was not prepared for that experience at all! Good luck! I made myself a pee funnel out of a plastic cup and used that to keep pee from the biopsy site. Also warm wash cloth held up against it in the shower for a few minutes to clean it.", "Guys I am freaked out I was diagnosed with LS. It is not bad, basically just a white mark on the foreskin for now. I am prescribed a steroid cream and a moisturising cream. M20 btw.\n\nThe internet is freaking me tf out. I am reading about people having treatments not working, developing phimosis, having a circumcision (which was also suggested to me) and still have the disease going on, urethral stenosis, etc etc. I. Am. Losing. My. Sleep.\n\nI am terrified. At that point my condition looks like a plain skin discoloration and I am being treated and I am almost convinced I will have it develop into urethral stenosis inevitably even if I decide to get the snip which was suggested as a viable option for me. Guys please be honest with me. Is it that bad? Are treatments a 50/50 solution? What is going on? I am confused and scared, everywhere I look on the internet it is being mentioned as a cancer like disease, and people irl are trying to convince me it is just a skin disease. How serious is it? It can get serious but drs can help you try different things until they find a treatment that might help keep your symptoms from progressing much. Try not to lose too much sleep because that stress will only cause things to worsen more quickly. Stress and immunity are very closely linked and LS is likely immune related for most people. Take a breath, this disease usually develops slowly and you have a lot more life to live. Pay attention to your body and communicate frequently with your drs about any changes you notice or fears you have. It will all be ok. Also, it is usually not so severe in men as it is in women, from my understanding. So what I will have that disease and I will have to put ointments and visit the doctor for the rest of my life? And by \"develops slowly\", you mean all I can do is just make the disease slower? Like some time it will become worse? It *will* keep progressing? Keep in mind that people who have it bad, or whose treatments are not working, are the ones that post the most asking for help. The worst cases are also the ones that show up on health information sites and in papers. It is like if you wanted to see a picture of a cake to learn what a cake looks like, and you got a picture of a celebrity's wedding cake. Sure it is a cake, but it is not a good example of your average cake. My advice is do not look at those pictures unless you are struggling to get a diagnosis or trying to help someone get diagnosed.\n\nLS is very treatable. 70-90% of people do well on strong steroids like clobetasol. If they do not, there are others to try. Circumcision is also usually curative if LS is only affecting the penile foreskin. It is not a disease like cancer in that it cannot kill you or make you sick overall. It is not considered pre-cancerous either. Having it just means that your personal risk of genital cancer is a bit higher than for other people. But evidence has shown that this risk drops a lot when you treat LS. And even if you did get cancer, you would probably notice right away since you were paying attention to your penis in order to manage the LS, and the cancer would get treated at an early stage and not be a big deal. \n\nI think I have had LS all my life. It has caused some problems, but it is mostly mild, which is why I did not even realize it was abnormal until recently. Some people have mild presentation that can barely be seen, but bad symptoms. I have a pretty obvious presentation (now that I know what LS looks like and what *is not* normal for a vulva) but very mild symptoms. No one can tell you for sure what your disease course will be like, but I can tell you there is no reason to assume the worst, especially if things are mild now and you stick to treatment. With the right treatment, you can totally stop LS in its tracks and have no symptoms. Without treatment, it may or may not progress. Maybe it would even get a bit better on its own. But yes, you might need to use ointment a few times a week for the foreseeable future. It is annoying but it is pretty manageable compared to insulin shots, dialysis, and many other long-term treatments. Ok that makes sense and it is actually a sigh of relief. Ok so, if the treatment works you can have no problems for the rest of your life as long as you use ointment a few times a week? For some people, yes! And LS on the penis is even sometimes curable. Vulvar LS on the other hand is almost always for life (except sometimes when preteen girls get it, it goes away during puberty and does not come back.) And you never know what the future of medicine holds. Many chronic diseases have become curable thanks to the collaboration between scientists, clinicians, and patients :) I am a teenage guy and recently turned 17. Was diagnosed maybe 3 weeks ago but I have had it since around 14. It could be worse man, I am younger than you and have a worse situation than you in terms of progressing but I am managing it. Yea, I feel really bad and embarrassed and do not really know how to explain this to a potential partner, especially in High School, but I realize there are more than one option for treatments and that it will be fine as long as I try to not stress, accept this is a shitty situation, and go through with daily care. I would take this and the daily care of this over cancer or another skin disease like eczema. My friend has eczema and it is a lot more painful and affects a lot more than my kind of fucked up white scarring can. Yes it can develop to be worse but if you take care of yourself 90% of the time it will not. The bad cases you see on the internet are the rare ones, and the people complaining about it online as being worse than hell are in the 10% of worst cases. Since you are mild case, go to the gym and better yourself and be yourself and not worry other than with treatment I think this is highly unlikely to be LS then. So everyone that is really freaked out. Yes, LS can cause those things. LS can flare, and it CAN suddenly get worse. Do not listen to the advice about not listening to it. Here are my thoughts: It sucks. But it can suck WAY MORE if you neglect it. So, learn as much as you can and be proactive because you want to avoid having those issues.  I know young people will probably feel so embarassed or shy, etc. I would definitely recommend 1) If at any point you find yourself getting increasing self-conscious, please see a counselor . You do not want shame/embarrassment/low self-esteem being connected to your sex life etc. 2). Find a Dr, and if you can ask for refills of your med to have on hand. 3) Use a very very thin layer of this med. A little goes a long way.  So, hey looks all fine or feels fine and then you stop meds. Okay, try it out. Might be okay? Might have a flare and you find it coming back, then start using the med again. We have a 2x daily for a week, then taper off to 3x week, 2x week, 1 x week....maintenance period. Then just periodically, and then just use it a bit more if you notice any feelings of discomfort lol. It can be helpful to use a barrier cream too on days you do not use it lol  Hello, we are 15 Square, a men's health charity based in the UK\n\nOne of the key areas we work in is providing ( intact men \n\nWe teach about conservative techniques to help avoid unnecessary circumcision\n\nWe always suggest seeking out your own primary care/ GP first, but if like you, you are concerned about the possibility of circumcision and this is something you want to try to avoid where possible you can contact our doctor, who would be happy to go over your issue and provide you with advice where possible.\n\n(", "Conflicting diagnosis Hi you all, I have made a previous post on here describing some symptoms I have been going through and my visits to the gyno. My gyno stated she found a small white patch on my labia (in the clitoral area) and said it could be possible LS, or something that could resolve on its own. She gave me clobetasol, which has not been working. When I went back in, her PA examined me this time. She said that it does not appear to be LS, and mentioned something about \"pudendal nerve entrapment\" and wants me to go on a gabapentin compound ointment. This sounds like a super expensive treatment and I am not sure where she came to this conclusion from. \n\nShe stated because all of the tests they ran came back negative (BV, yeast, STDs, etc), then at this point she wants to treat it as neuropathic pain. I told her that I do not really have the \"pins and needles\" or numbness, so much as a raw \"rug burn\" like feeling, dull to sharp pain, itchiness, and sensitivity to touch. She thinks that could all be a part of those symptoms. When I went on this sub, I was recommended alternatives to clob ointment, but the PA stated once again that she does not think it is LS. The gyno has been too busy to examine me, and I have my annual in December. \n\nThey want me to try the gabapentin ointment and follow up in December to see if it is working, as she said it takes a few weeks to start working. At this point I am so tired of almost daily pain/irritation that I do not want to wait until then. Because I purchase my own insurance (I do contract work), I am not even sure if I can easily get a second opinion without it being a huge ordeal. But I am wondering, have any of you all been misdiagnosed and written off before getting an LS diagnosis? Because I do not have obvious visible signs of it, I am worried they are missing the mark. I read you can test for it with a biopsy, but in my case I am not sure if that would work? Do not trust a nurse practitioner on something like this. They are not a doctor. \n\nI had two gatekeeper NPs keep me from MDs that refused to consider anything but yeast. Malicious torture for an extra year that I should have had treatment. They did not know they were wrong - they were so sure they were right they refused to listen to ANYTHING. \n\nMaybe once you have a proper diagnosis an NP can be competent at treatment. But you cannot let them diagnose something unusual. They absolutely do not have the training and if they have the arrogance to think they do then they are actively hurting people. ugh this sounds super frustrating; i am sorry you are having such a hard time! i find that PAs are not very knowledgeable about LS. I am surprised they did not do a biopsy to confirm or rule out LS. even when i had visible symptoms, it was not until the biopsy that i got the official diagnosis. \n\nyou have a right to advocate for yourself and ask for a biopsy. might be easier to do that than get a second opinion. good luck! Originally the gyno said that it is likely to resolve itself and that I did not need a biopsy because LS is \"rare\" amongst pre-menopausal women (I am 30). At this point it is been going on for long enough to make me think it could potentially be here to stay, whatever it may be. If this gabapentin compound does not help me, I am going to ask them to do a biopsy so I can know for certain. \n\nThe PA instructed me to stop the clobetasol as of yesterday, so obviously if it worsens without it, i will request to go in asap. I found that the clob seemed to mildly help my symptoms, but they told me I should have seen a more significant improvement after three weeks. But thank you! I am sure with enough persistence I will get to the bottom of this. wow that is crazy they were so insistent it was yeast. Did they just think it was a strain that did not show up on tests? My primary care Dr had given me fluconazole without even testing me and when that did not work, I went to my gyno instead and she ruled out yeast. \n\nBut I agree that the NP should not be able to diagnose more unusual conditions. The pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome looks to be incredibly rare and there is no way to really test for it, so you think they would rule everything else out first... Not to discount PAs, I am sure they are super knowledgeable but even for expert gynaecologists vulvar disorders can be difficult to diagnose. I would not trust a PA to make an accurate diagnosis for this. It also took me like 9-12 weeks to notice the clobetasol making a difference. For me it for sure got worse before it got better.\n\nI think your gut instinct is right. Fight for another opinion. Not a doctor but if I was in your position I would probably keep going with the clobetasol tbh lol ( but get medical advice do not listen to me). A biopsy should be a pretty clear-cut way to diagnose... as long as the biopsy is done and read properly.", "Itching Does anyone else notice that itching is worse in the summer? Ya, heat doesnt help the itch. I have. In the beginning when they kept mistaking my LS for yeast infections, it was usually in the summer due to more sweating. I am a bigger girl so my attempts to wear more summer appropriate clothing usually means tighter fitting clothing, which just makes itching worse. I used to use baby powder and gold bond powder on the area before I knew about the health risks, I have.

Hey so I am waiting to see a dermatologist to see if I have LS. I am circumcised and was wondering if anyone here was circumcised and diagnosed with LS. If so please hit me with a direct messege.", "White spots on foreskin and glans Hello, I have a question - with use of clobetasol will the white spots go away? if so then after how long?", "I am sure I have LS (painful sex, tearing, itching) but i cant see a doctor rn.. Can I have someone is opinion because I am really scared about my vaginal opening growing together &amp; also dont have an inner labia? I am 23 and got recently sexually active that is why I have not figured something out earlier.  Sorry to hear you are having all those symptoms. How long will it be until you can see a doctor? \n\nI think that narrowing of the vaginal opening is something that happens slowly over time. Could you see a doctor within a few months? Edit: i also have white patches within my vagina, and im pretty sure my clitoral hood has been stucking onto my clitoris aswell .. :( i also have cuts on my perineal area I am afraid that I have already had it for a long time but ive never really explored untill i got sexually active.. So that is why im concerned it already narrowed alot. And i think maybe 3/4 weeks total before I can see a doctor Yikes! Those splits in the thin white skin there ... oh yes. That is what I have. I am sorry. \n\nI have never had the opening \u201cgrow together\u201d, if that helps. \n\nClobetasol fixed me up in two weeks. You need that ASAP (says internet stranger who is not a doctor). If you cannot see a doc at all I would say get an otc steroid cream and use that ... it might help some. But if you do that, and it does help, it would make it harder to get a diagnosis -  it would not look so bad!!\n\nI had to cry on the phone with the obgyn to get in to see the doctor. Told them I split right open (I had). Being calm and requesting appointments did not get me in. Finally losing my shit and bawling did....\n\nYou need appropriate treatment ASAP. If doc agrees this is LS and prescribes clobetasol you could go from this painful hell to feeling fine possibly in a couple weeks. Any delay in that is cruel. \n\nGood luck to you. I think I had it for many years as well before I realized what it was. Probably since I was a child. \n\n3-4 weeks is obviously not ideal, especially if you are in pain/itchy now, but I doubt it will make a huge difference in your vagina. If you want you could buy some dilators and learn to use them to help keep everything open. As you are only recently sexually active then a visit to the GUM clinic is probably best way forward to rule out anything else", "Recently diagnosed (men) Hey! After some months with a white spot in the tip of glans, I noticed 2 more and a scar in my foreskin with some white lines. I went to the doctor and he said it is lichen sclerosus and prescribed me a clobetasol ointment, which I have been using the last 3 days once a day. He did not say too much about the ointment, he only said that in 4 weeks I should see an improvement and if not, I must come back. \nFortunately, so far my case is not as severe as some I have seen online. But after reading, I am kind of afraid of the ointment, it seems like a very bad thing for the skin in general. \nI wonder if anyone has had good results with this?\nOh, and how much do you apply? besides the visible spots, do you have burning pain/ severe itchiness or painful masturbation/sex? No, it is not painful or itchy. Yet, I feel some sensibility sometimes after sex/masturbation and I believe that is how I got the little scar. Yes, you can have good results on this. I did. Whilst it may thin the skin temporarily, the LS has been thickening it so there is, crudely, a netting effect. I was told to use it twice a day under the foreskin. I was also told to make sure no urine was trapped under the foreskin so pulling back and drying, or rinsing with water, immediately after urinating. I was also told to stop using soap to wash the genital area and to use only an unscented emollient washing like e45. Both of these second steps are important. All the best. Thanks. I am really looking forward to see more normal again. I will try to get that soap. Is it true that cutting sugars could help? \nAnd Any other advice, is always welcome!  \ud83d\ude01 It is an emollient, e45 is just a Uk brand but the key point is that it is not soap, more like cold cream. I have never read anything to link LS to diet nor has my dermatologist who specialises in LS ever mentioned diet. Exposure to urine trapped under the foreskin seems to be the key driver. Really thank you so much for the feedback, it is very useful for me to know the experience of others. I cannot find the brand you mention here in Belgium but I have found one called Dermalex that seems to have the same effect. I will order it and start using it ASAP! Good luck. How is it looking mate ?", "Tacrolimus and hydrocortisone? My doctor recommended I apply tacrolimus ointment on top of the clobetosal, but the tacrolimus causes me sooooo much pain. Almost unbearable itching which I usually do not have. Has anyone used hydrocortisone before or after applying the tacrolimus ointment? Tachrolimus did wonders for me, but that is just my case. However, I was using the 0.1% one, the 0.03% one literally made me cry because of the pain. I currently have the .03% it literally hurt me so much I had to lay and ice myself and was literally rolling in pain..  I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe a lower percentage but I cant imagine any lower lol but thank you for the feedback\u2665\ufe0f Tacrolimus is usually used as a blend with something, like a mosturiser Tacro burned like a mother all day for me, for a week, but once I got through that week it went away! Actually the 0.1% has a higher percentage, maybe that is why it worked for me Hi sorry so do you think the .1% is better? It was better for me", "My experience with Juliet laser procedure I wrote all this out as a comment on ( and decided to make it its own post with more information. When I was trying to decide on whether or not to do this procedure, I could not find any first-person experience shares from anyone with LS who had gone through this, so I am hoping this helps someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some background: I am a 45yo woman and have been dealing with LS for the last few years. I have also been diagnosed with both Graves and Hashimoto's. I have some scar tissue inside and outside my vagina from scratching. About two years ago I went to see a gynecologist and was prescribed clobetasol, and the itching went away as long I remembered to apply it regularly. However, it did not prevent the burning pain after sex, no matter how much lubricant I used. There was a dime-sized area just inside my vagina that I think was scar tissue - I could not see it, but it felt like a stretched balloon, if that makes sense, with no elasticity. That part always hurt the most after sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarly this year my gyno referred me to a dermatologist who was very familiar with LS, who said that she had been successful in treating her LS patients with the Juliet procedure, and that for the best results I should do all 3 of the treatments as recommended by the manufacturer (at $1,000 per treatment), each treatment being one month apart. It is not covered by insurance since it is considered a cosmetic procedure. Initially I decided against it, but after a few more months of burning pain I decided to just try it, and if it did not work for the LS, at least I would get the vaginal rejuvenation benefits! So far I have had 2 of the 3 treatments (the second happened today).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreatment #1:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo prep I needed to completely shave the entire area the day before and buy panty liners and pure aloe (without alcohol in it). The treatment lasted about 45 minutes. She covered the whole area with numbing cream. Then she inserted something that felt cylindrical inside my vagina, and when it started it felt like it was knocking against the vaginal walls all around. It did not hurt as there are not many nerve endings inside the vagina, but when the knocking got near my cervix it was a little uncomfortable. After the first pass, she adjusted the machine, and re-inserted it for a second pass. She said the first pass was more for the surface and the second (which uses a different wavelength) gets deeper into the skin. The knocking felt lighter, but it was hotter and felt a bit \"spicy\" for lack of a better word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, she used a different probe for the outside. I did not see it, but it felt like she was zapping my skin with electricity and it definitely felt pretty spicy. She also did two passes with the outside, the second being more painful since the skin was already tender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it was over she applied aloe and told me to use a panty liner in case of bleeding, which is rare but does happen sometimes. I was fine during the drive home, but as the numbing cream wore off, it started to hurt a lot. The first time I went to pee was extremely painful. But a few hours later when I peed again, it was not so bad, and the next morning the pain was almost all gone. By the evening, the pain was completely gone. Of course, I was slathering on aloe the whole time as well. The doctor had said that during the healing process, in some LS patients the labia wants to fuse together, so that I should also apply Aquaphor to prevent that. She also said that when the pain was gone, I should resume applying clobetasol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreatment #1 Results: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI forgot to apply clobetasol, and on the 3rd or 4th day post treatment, I had a super intense episode of itching. I was really upset thinking the Juliet had not worked at all. But while applying clobetasol, I was feeling around and realized the dime-sized bit of scar tissue was mostly gone! Like if I pressed on it, I could tell it was still sort of there, but it almost felt like the rest of my skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course I had to test it with sex! Almost no burning afterwards. I was thrilled and very hopeful for the next treatment. Then of course there are the non-LS vaginal rejuvenation benefits. I got to say it is a nice bonus. Definitely more lubrication, more sexual desire, etc. However, one of the benefits is supposed to be not having to pee at night, but I still have to get up at least once. Hopefully after all 3 treatments are done I will be able to go through the whole night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreatment #2: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told the doctor that peeing after the last treatment was extremely painful and only then did she think to tell me to apply Aquaphor before peeing as it kind of protects the area. (I did that after treatment 2 and it totally worked.) She also said that it was common to have an LS flare-up during the healing process. She also said that she could see that my skin was getting more pink (but ideally it should be even more pink). She also confirmed that the dime-sized area of skin I mentioned earlier was starting to look more like normal skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreatment 2 was exactly the same, but went faster because she did not have to stop and explain everything she was doing. She did say she could lower the energy if it was too painful, and it would be as effective, but I just powered through it like I did last time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince treatment 2 happened today, I will update in about a week or so what the results are. Did you get this treatment done in the states?\n\nI have heard of something similar called the Mona Lisa treatment and am curious about it.  LS for 2 years but am in sort-of remission on clobetasol, it is just not totally healed. Thank you for sharing this! I have been really curious about the treatment and, like you, have had trouble finding good reviews. Your detail and honesty is incredibly helpful! I am so glad you saw progress and some positive changes. I look forward to your review of the full treatment! Yes, I am in California. I have heard about the Mona Lisa as well. My dermatologist said she selected Juliet for her office because she felt it was better, but it was a while ago when I did the free consultation so I do not remember exactly why. I think it was a combination of effectiveness and healing time and ease of use (for the doctor).\n\nYeah the clobetasol just helps with preventing flare-ups. I am so glad it was helpful! I will definitely update when it is all done. I have never heard of this procedure, but this is giving me hope.\nDo you have any updates? Sorry for the late response. I do, but it is not super encouraging - mainly due to my own negligence, so I am really disappointed and mad at myself...basically, I was not consistent about applying Aquaphor and I think I have  labial fusion. I was going to see if the doctor can confirm and if so, what I can do about it. I will update here after I am done with treatment #3. Hmm that sucks... I hope things get better after the next treatment. Thanks, I hope so too.", "Symptom free (or almost symptom free) after stopping clobetasol? Has anyone here used clobetasol, had good results, then decided to stop the steroid and still did okay? Or did you symptoms come back? I used clobetasol for around 4-6 months, and tapered off; that was 7 years ago. I just got flare up this year. So I would say I have done okay! Wow! So you are saying you were in complete remission of symptoms for 7 years even when on no topical steroids? That is awesome. For the most recent flare, is there anything that you think caused it or did it just come up randomly? Yes, complete remission! My skin returned to my normal color, although the skin is now very thin and wrinkled. For this current flare up, I am chalking it up to my immune system being compromised (battling bronchitis and shingles at the same time) and stressed lol So a huge factor. Wow thanks for this\u2026 what are your LS symptoms? I have had enough remission that I only use it as maintenance (very infrequently and at the advice of my doctor), however I do still have flares more often than the other response here. I have flares maybe once every few months. However, if I slip on my diet, or have a particularly stressful day (I have a high stress job), or it is summer time, or the wind blows the wrong way that day (lol I am joking), I can have a flare and then I need to use it for a couple of weeks to calm things down. I think it is important to find your flare triggers to see if you can wean off of the clobetasol. I think it is important to at least always have a non-expired tube of it on hand, though. Extreme itching, nothing I do satisfies the itch. Then of course comes the bleeding and pain and from me constantly itching and my skin begins to develop a white patch. But once the flare up goes away, I think I am one of the lucky view to not have any symptoms after the facts. But clobetasol works wonders for me Thanks this was really helpful Do you have any other prior medical history relating to thyroid issues or PCOS? Also do we are you using anything else besides Clob, like estrogen creams? Nothing concerning PCOS. Interesting you mentioned thyroid, I have had a few test come back where they my \u201clevels are elevated\u201d and I go back in for a few more test and everything comes out normal. So i am not entirely sure Nope! Just clobetasol I was officially diagnosed with LS yesterday after a painful week and increasing symptoms over the last few months. \n\nLast week I had what I would call an immune system inflammatory response... as in, even my belly button was oozing and my ear piercings swollen and oozing. My joints, while chronically painful, ramped up with swelling on nodules. Then I presented with UTI symptoms that went away with Azo. It was like my body just ran from the room burning in flames.\n\n2 applications of Clobetasol and I feel improvement and better than I have in months. It is amazing what kind of pain the body can get used to or tolerate. \n\nI will follow the treatment plan to the letter but I will definitely follow up regarding the autoimmune response. It is been a wild ride so far...\n\nThanks for sharing your positive story.", "How long did it take for your vulva biopsy to heal? I have done the biopsy almost 4 days ago.. i still see a little red cut over there. I does not hurt at all. I am just worried it may not be stitched well?", "Possible LS - steroid cream Hi. Long story short, I (22f) have been diagnosed with Atrophic Vagnitis and low estrogen. I am taking Imvexxy 4mcg twice a week and that has improved some of my worst symptoms such as dryness and vaginal pain, and the skin of my vagina definately does feel softer - and bodywide improvements, too. I went today to the OBGYN because I am still have some burning and inflamation down there and the doctor told me I may have lichen sclerosus. Looking at the symptoms of LS, I realize that I probably do have it, as I do have some white bumps and skin down there. I would not say it *looks* bad - it definately feels worse than it looks.\n\nI was also tested for all the other nasty stuff such as YI and BV, and I have never been sexually active. For the longest time, I always remember having some white bumps on the inside skin area(?) on the right side of my clit, but I kind of just assumed it was acne that would get aggrvated when I touched it. Now I know that is probably not normal - I also had some white patches of skin near the bottom of my vagina that I also just assumed was typical. I also *very* occasionally get *very* small tears around my anal region sometimes after pooping, but that is usually only with harder stools. Again, I kind of just thought this was normal.\n\nThe OBGYN prescribed me clob to take 2x a day for 10 days, and then to come back in early Janurary for  another evaulation. I have heard a little bit before about LS, and is it possible that it may be connected to my low estrogen? I have never been treated for LS before, so I am kind of thinking that now that I am just starting to get my estrogen where it needs to be, it is just left the LS to be the only preformer on the stage, so to speak.", "Diagnosed today by surprise I went to a regular pap check up today and a she was down there taking a look, she says right away: \"Oh, do you have a problem with itching? \" I said I had had a lot of yeast infections in my 20s and still get them from time to time. She said, did anyone ever tell you you have lichen sclerosis? That sound familiar? I am like....Noooo. She explains how my skin is silky white and my labia minor 'have disappeared'. Explains the condition and it all starts clicking. I did a have couple bad yeast infections, with classic yeast discharge, confirmed by docs and treated. But over the years, all the itching and irritation, my labia skin cracking, has apparently been from this condition. Last year at my post partum I mentioned how I was very itchy and thought I had yeast. That provider said she did see it looked irritated, \"raw\" she said, but she did not see yeast. Today's provider said she is seen a few patients been given exams and doctors note \"vulva appear normal\", and she sees them and says it is definitely not normal. So I will be starting the steroid cream. I am so used to being itchy and raw, it will be great if this is helped. I have a lot of skin issues so I am wondering if I do have an autoimmune issue. Hi\n\nI am very new to this, I was diagnosed last month, so I could be wrong and people can correct me if necessary. But from what I read in scientific studies. Sometimes it can be caused by autoimmune issues, but it can also be genetic, caused by trauma, injury etc. it can also be a hormonal problem. \n\nI wish you the best for managing your symptoms. Good luck !\n\nHere the link to one of the studies. ( This is how I was diagnosed too (minus the yeast infection history). I actually was not itchy at all when I was diagnosed, though I did/do have pain with sex and also skin splitting. My doctor performed a biopsy and it was not positive for lichen sclerosis, but she thinks we just caught it too early and/or biopsied the wrong area. I have been being treated with steroids for LS for about four years now and started having itchiness not long after starting treatment. (Ive always been kind of suspicious about that...) I have gotten a second opinion too, though; second doctor agrees with the LS diagnosis. Wow that is crazy that you just were given that info out of the blue! But I do hope the medicine helps you and gives you some relief! This is exactly how mine was diagnosed as well.  Doctor was like \u201care you ever itchy down there or have pain?  Probably because you have ls.  Here have this cream.\u201d  \n\nI really wish they would have told me not to google it and read everything I could find.  Mine is not that bad yet compared to some pictures.... My experience is completely opposite :D I go to doctors and tell them I am itchy and in pain and they just tell me it all looks \u201cnormal\u201d even if def it not (looks like classic, but mild, LS) :D I have been trying, for over six months, to get biopsy finally done, but that is going to be a big obstacle. \n\nI am glad that there are other stories out there too!!!! Medical care is really a luck of the draw. I had rescheduled this appointment twice due to the pandemic and just took whatever doc or Nurse Midwife was available, and happened to get this one.  I am inclined to believe her because I have always felt like my labia was not right, gotten cracking skin several times, and seemed to get \"yeast infections\" every month, but they varied so much day to day. It seemed one day, I would be unbearably itchy but if I could not get OTC cream right away, it would be better one to two days later anyways. Yeast would not resolve on it is own like that. And a few days later I would get itchy again. I hope you get help asap. If you do not mind me asking, do you live in the US? I am in Northeast Ohio, so if you are at all within driving distance, I can give you the name of this provider as she seems familiar with the condition. She is with Cleveland Clinic. I am glad to hear you found someone you trust! And by chance!!! \n\nI am not from the US, I live in small country in Europe, but I appreaciate the offer :) thank you :) What was your experience with the biopsy, if I may ask? I am having mine done tomorrow and I am nervous about how things will feel afterward. \n\nA few more questions:\n\nHow did they numb the area before the procedure? Did you experience a lot of pain following it? About how long did it take you to heal? I had the same experience. I miss my inner labia. They give you a local anesthetic, which is probably the most painful (initial) part. I felt a little bit during the actual biopsy, but it was not anything too horrible. \n\nThe after care is really important, though. You have got to keep that baby clean. Also, it will hurt the first few days when it is still an open wound. Once it starts to scab, it will itch, but do not scratch! I made the mistake of splitting my biopsy site open during the scabbing stage because it itched. Ibuprofen helps! \n\nI wish you the best!! It sounds bad but I am not even sure I remember what my inner labia was like lol. I have had 3 kids in 6years and had a kid of changes so kind of chalked it up to that. Ah well I wish you luck, then. Mine got found at a IUD check! Thank God she looked. I was in denial but I had every symptom and got a confirmed biopsy.\n\nAlso - mine was not itchy but I had skin bleaching and my skin felt tight down there during sex. I also had rectal bleeding from skin tears. But I hardly ever need the cream now and it is well controlled! I do have a few other autoimmune issues all skin related. They give you a shot in the vulva to numb it, which def sucks. But it is quick. I did not feel anything after that during the biopsy. \n\nThe worst part for me was that every time I peed it was like peeing directly into an open wound and was fairly excruciating. But jumping in the shower and peeing there helped. That lasted a few days I think. \n\nMine was a while ago now, but I *think* my healing was kind of in stages. The first few days sucked (because of the peeing mostly). The next few days were a little better but I was still sensitive. After that first week I would say it was mostly scabbed over and recovering well. And I think it was full recovered in about two weeks. I do not even have a scar as far as I can tell or anything. \n\nThey usually put this stuff on you to seal off the wound that looks silver. It kind of freaked me out at first when I looked, but if you see a weird gray color on the site the first couple days, it is probably not that you have an infection already but just the sealant. It goes away by itself and is harmless. \n\nAll in all I would say it is definitely not fun but totally survivable. Best of luck! Thank you so much for your detailed response! I have a much better idea of what to expect now. Thank you so much for your reply! Did you shower every day after your biopsy? I imagine it hurts keeping the area clean, but I will do what I have to do. I shower once every other day, just because it is good to have natural oils on your skin. However, I had a spray bottle filled with water next to the toilet so I could thoroughly clean after using the bathroom. Although this should be a given, it is important to change your underwear every day to lessen the chance of infection. If the pain hurts and you want to clean the site without actually touching it, fill the bathtub with enough warm water to sit in. No body wash or anything. This can help relieve some pain and effectively clean it without irritating it. Wish u the best&lt;3 Thank you so much! This was all very helpful.", "Vulvar lichen sclerosus - well-controlled except in one small patch area Hi all, \n\nI have a gyno appointment booked for about a months time, but would appreciate any advice/reassurance/suggestions. \n\nI am a 29yo female and was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus about 2 years ago, but suspect I had it for 2 years before that. It is been v well controlled with clobetasol, but there is a particularly annoying small patch on the left side of my vulva which seems to flare up quite often (once every few weeks), even though the rest of the areas that were previously affected have been largely fine since initial treatment after diagnosis. \n\nWhen this happens I use the ointment and then it settles down, but was wondering if there is any particular reason this is happening/whether I should worry/what to do about it? Clob does usually sort it (until it happens again) but I want to get to a point where I do not have to apply clob every few weeks. \n\nThanks in advance. I try not to let it get me down but it still does! And having to apply the ointment every few weeks just reminds me it is still there. My derm told me it is super normal to have to re-apply every couple weeks if it feels like it is coming back, and that it is just a lifelong condition you can control and keep generally suppressed- this has been exactly the case for me. This sounds pretty normal to me, do not be so down! Same, I have a 'regular' spot lol. It is super annoying. It was the first area to appear and it still gives me trouble. \n\nAccording to my doctor, applying clob once a week should help keep chronic irritation and flareups to a minimum. And flareups warrant a return to the more aggressive application regime (for a couple weeks)\n\nYou are not the only one. That is for sure. Thanks! This makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to reply! Good to know it is normal, even if we have to live with this. All in all, I suppose it is not so bad. I too have one spot that has flare ups but the flare ups are further apart as the years pass (diagnosis was over 20 years ago)", "Any chance this cold weather is causing my flare ups? Sounds like a crazy and dumb thing to wonder but ever since winter started, I have been having more flare ups. I was going like 2 or 3 months without one and lately it seems like every week and a half or two I am getting a flare up. \n\nIs this cold weather drying my skin out more and causing flare ups? It could be. Cold weather dries out skin anyway so it makes sense that it would cause LS flare ups.  Ugh. I hate winter \ud83d\ude11 Definitely dryer skin in the winter and also more layers and less air flow. I find that sleeping without underwear and a pillow between my legs while I am on my side helps. Best of luck.  This was helpful thank you! But then I will get discharge all over my pillow :( lol Being a girl sucks Dry air leading to dry skin is not doing me any favors but then in the summer i feel like heat and sweatiness is even more of a trigger. Ready for spring temps! Yesss! Summer time I sweat way too much and I end up feeling like I am chaffed ", "Newly diagnosed (24M) Hi everyone,\n\nI am living in a nightmare for a month now. I am 24(M) and was newly diagnosed with LS (confirmed by two urologists).\n\nIn my case the LS is located exactly in the external urethral opening (meatus) and it caused the closure of 70%\\~ of my meatus after an inflamation a month ago when i go to pee.\n\nI am confused because the two urologists give me to different solution.\n\nthe first doctor wants to do a two phases surgery to remplace the infected skin with a new one from my inside of my mouth, and the second surgery after 3 month to complite the first. (he will basically open half of my penis like a book to do this surgery)\n\nThe second doctor wants to do a surgery to open the meatus and i do not fully understind whant exactly he what to do except opening the meatus (next time i need to take notes of some of his definition) and after the surgery i need to use cream and oil... for the rest of my life + i need to go to him evry 3-6month for meatus opening (without surgery)\n\nPS: The second doctor is totaly disagree with the first one and he told me that surgery for the LS of the urethra.\n\nSorry for my english\n\nAnyone had  LS of the meatus can help me here? I am wondering if you have also joined the men's FB LS group?  They might be able to offer some help too.", "Is LS worse for any females around their period? Around a week before I get severe itching which leads me to think it is hormonal causing my symptoms.  Mine flares up around periods, yes. Not sure if it is hormonal, or the added humidity in the area, or perhaps a combination of the two. In any case, I often have a flare up during period -  but not usually beforehand. It is worse for me before my period, yes. Probably even bit longer than a week before Yes. I always feel some relief when my period comes. I am super super new to this diagnosis but estrogen works along with your immune function and it drops before your period. Also hormones have some relation to the elasticity of your skin I think I experience the same as you op Thanks! I did get some \u201chormone\u201d supplements (before I was officially diagnosed by a gynaecologist) from a naturopath so maybe I will try again. I have had the itching for years but feels as though as time goes on it is getting worse \ud83d\ude14 Yes. 100% Yes!!! It is so annoying!! Sometimes flares up during ovulation too... Like... \ud83d\udd95\ud83d\ude44\nThis disease is infuriatingly awful. I have spoken to women online with vulvar LS, and I have read many posts that indicate a connection between hormones and LS. Stress and hormonal imbalances promote inflammation in the body, which can aggravate LS. Mine is worse around ovulation time so around 10-14 days before my period starts. It sucks.", "I know this looks a little insane but..  Has anyone tried this? I have googled and found a lot but everyone I have told thinks I am nuts for wanting to give it a try. I have tried all of these except for number 3 when I was still fighting for a diagnosis. Some of them provided short term relief or did nothing, and some caused unbearable pain (borax, vinegar). From what I know and what experts in LS are saying is this is an autoimmune disorder, and for many people relief will take lifelong care with extremely strong steroid cream. Also, see a Dr ASAP because if left untreated, or treated incorrectly, your risk of cancer and permanent damage can skyrocket :( \n\nI highly recommend this site and the video on this site if you have not seen it yet, it cleared a lot of stuff up for me.  \n The borax caused pain? Can you tell me more about your experience using it ? Yeah! So I would put it inside once a night but had to keep taking breaks because it hurt so bad. Eventually  I had to stop altogether because it caused spotting, bleeding, and extreme irritation :( I would say to be careful and keep a log of your symptoms if you can. It is the only way I figured out that toilet paper was a huge contributing factor to my irritation!!", "Painful Clitoris and Vagina Ive been researching about painful sex with LS, as I have just been diagnosed. All I find is people talking about P-V intercourse and cannot find info about how it effects the clitoris. My clitoris is red and the lightest touch causes sharp pain. Is this common with LS, and will it go away with treatment? LS can definitely cause clitoral itching and pain. If LS is the cause of your pain, treatment may help. If it does not help, there are other treatments that can specifically treat the pain.  \n\nBut you might want to talk to your doctor now and rule out another cause, especially if you are having a lot of pain. One common cause of sharp stabbing pain there can be the buildup of keratin pearls (hard balls of skin) between the glans clitoris and the clitoral hood. I think this may be even more likely to happen when you have LS, because it promotes clitoral adhesions that block normal drainage. \n\nI hope you start to feel better soon. Either way, I would definitely recommend asking your doctor about the clitoral pain specifically. A lot of doctors are not well versed on the clitoris, so if they do not take it seriously, try to get a second opinion or see a specialist.", "Does anyone have experience with the stem cell treatment? I saw a gynecologist in London who does the treatment, branded Lipogems in the UK (which is an awful name IMO, but I digress). An interesting point is they seem to do only one treatment, and then monitor you over a year. However, my research seems to indicate that at least some of the doctors doing it in the States recommend 2-3 sessions over about 6 weeks to optimise your chances of full remission. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with a single procedure or multiple procedures?\n\nIs this just a case of Americans being more aggressive with treatment? (I am American and have lived in the UK for over a decade and am well aware of the cultural differences in medical treatment).\n\nI asked about this and also about combining it with a laser treatment to heal the affected areas - a protocol I have also seen out of the US. The gynecologist sort of just shrugged me off, saying she did not like the US healthcare system and everyone there was just out to make money. Sigh. Not really an answer.\n\nI would be interested in hearing anyone\u2019s personal experiences with results after a single procedure / multiple procedures and what was recommended or offered. Hi! I just had a Stem Cell Lift by Dr. Newman in Beverly Hills 4/15/2021. Unfortunately, I have not seen any results yet that I can share, but it is still the early days for me, as I am barely 3 weeks post op. It can take up to 3 months for the stem cells to attach, so it can take up to 3 months to get benefits from the procedures. The stem cells can improve the tissues for up to a year, which may be your specialists approach. For me, they told me if by 3 months I am 80% they would do a top off, but if I am only 50% better, they will wait and see for a year or so since the stem cells are probably still working. Sounds counterintuitive, but also shows how promising the stem cells are! The process just takes time, and lots of healing. No doctors to my knowledge are doing 2-3 sessions over 6 weeks, that would be an insane recovery as you are still swollen at 2 weeks from a single procedure, let alone feeling any results! The most frequent I have seen is that Dr. Newman\u2019s done 3 or so in a single year for very severe cases. Your doctor was probably thinking that you will respond really well to just one, and I am hoping to be the same! \nOh and another doctor in the US I consulted with had a very similar plan to yours and told me she would wait a year before contemplating a second treatment. It sounds like you are in good hands!\n\nETA: I did not have laser with my procedure. I have heard of a single doctor who uses laser beforehand, but he does not use the same procedure at all, and uses amniotic fluid. Most do not use it for the stem cell procedure. That is awesome and congrats for having it done! It was an interview with Dr Newman and one with one of his patients where I got the 2-3 figure actually but I just went back and watched it and I had completely misremembered - and it was three within 9 months that the patient had! That does make a lot more sense given recovery times. (Will edit original post for any future readers).\n\nCan I ask did you have PRP or Adipose-Derived Stem Cells? They are recommending Adipose-Derived to me here, which they do under general anesthesia. Doing that (up to) 3x in a year seems a lot. Also interesting that you were told to expect results for one year. I asked how long remission would last if it was successful and I was told they have long been doing it two years so she does not know yet. I believe when Dr. Newman started this procedure, 10 years ago or so, he offered it in a package of 3 sessions in one year, so a lot of people got 3 for that reason. I do not think they currently recommend doing it at that much of a frequency, but if you do not feel better at the 6 month mark I am sure they would be open to discussing a second treatment. I am sure you will be feeling much better though! \n\nAnd I had both adipose-derived stem cells and PRP in my procedure. A trial with PRP alone found that PRP was not effective, so a lot of doctors do not use it. In his experience, Dr. Newman found that stem cells work better with the PRP, so he still uses it. Many others do as well, but I have heard of people getting amazing results without as well! Worth discussing more with the doctor though. \nAnd Dr. Newman\u2019s been doing it for a decade and he definitely has had quite a few with 5+ year remissions, which is just insane! Others have 2+ and significant long term improvement when the LS does return (shorter/less painful flares). I cannot imagine feeling better I am so excited but nervous!\n\nETA: I did not have general anesthesia, I just had localized numbing and was given an oral sedative. I did not feel a thing for the liposuction or the injections. What is the procedure attempting to fix? I have been recommended Lipogems treatment as well, but it is for my knee issues. Have not gone through with it yet, but it is likely soon. I have been doing all i can to read as much as i can find about it - most of the research around it seem to be producing glowing results, but the only red flag i see so far is that all the trials i came across were a small group of patients - there is no large scale randomized trial yet.   \n\n\nAnywho, i hope you have a good experience with it, and let us know how you feel about it if you do go through!", "Anyone else first have LS symptoms postpartum? First of all, I am in the care of a wonderful dermatologist who suspects that my symptoms may be indicative of LS. My OB put me thru the ringer treating me for yeast over and over and over...frustrating to say the least. \n\nMy symptoms started about a month after the birth of my daughter last year. My main symptoms were redness all over the vulva and especially around the clitoris, sometimes itching, sometimes deep internal sharp pains, and most of all irritation and burning with urination. \n\nI am now on clobetasol and it helps a lot but some random days it is still super red and raw down there. \n\nI am curious if anyone has had this experience \u2014 my husband and I had sex last week and did not use any lube. The next day it felt like the skin had literally ripped open around my urethra. When I peed it was like razor blades. No UTI. Gone the next day. The skin on my vulva was bright crayola crayon red. Ugh. I guess I am just wondering if any of this sounds familiar. I know I will need a biopsy to confirm. \n\nThis just really sucks. The past two years have been full of miscarriage, IVF, so many doctors appointments. I was hoping 2021 would be different.  My symptoms started after baby #2. \n\nStarted having sex I am going to say 8 weeks postpartum next morning I wake up and I am sore like never before. Mostly clitoral. \nClobetasol has helped. Also aquaphor during the day/off days of the clobetasol. Thank you. Do my symptoms sound similar? Are urinary symptoms a characteristic? I have experienced the pain urinating but only after sex. Like take your breath away pain\ud83d\ude41\n\nI also first experienced LS symptoms postpartum (roughly after 8 months) with my rainbow baby (now 2m). Now with the addition of a 3 m/o baby, I have been experiencing more discomfort.  \n\nIt really would be nice to learn more about the impact of hormones on LS  and to find out if there are any other treatment options instead of just the topical creams or ointments. (I suppose there is the anti inflammatory diet but I dunno about all that)\n\nGood luck to you OP and happy to hear that you have found a care provider you like and trust Thank you for sharing. I appreciate it. My dermatologist told me that there is reason to believe estrogen therapy would be helpful. She wants to start me on estrogen birth control if my symptoms are still pervasive after a month. Worth a shot for you too! Yes. I had tearing during the delivery of my daughter. Got stitches. A while afterwards, the split kind of \u2018reopened\u2019, not bleeding or a wound as such, but the tearing came back so I have kind of a split in one labia minora up towards my clitoris. That scar tissue is then where all the LS symptoms started from. It became incredibly itchy, then got the white patches etc. \n\nGot diagnosed a few years ago with LS. Recently I have also started having urinary symptoms when I get a flare up. It feels like a severe UTI, but when tested there is no infection at all. Has kept me up a nights sometimes for hours on end with the pain. Using the ointment seems to help, especially if I start treatment at the first hint of any urinary symptoms. Like you, I also find the urinary symptoms can be triggered by sex. \n\nI tried to ask my doctor about it, but he was clueless about LS, let alone urinary symptoms from it, and I have not yet been to see the specialist to discuss this. I have gotten kind of fatigued with discussing this illness with doctors. I have seen multiple dermatologists, multiple gynecologists, and an LS only specialist and researcher, and yet none of them have had any other real treatment options beyond the ointment. And each time there is at least an examination, which is uncomfortable enough, or they want to do another biopsy, which is horrible. So I am just coping for the time being. Right now I am not having flare up, and so things are OK. When flare ups happen, I more or less know how to manage them now. Absolutely and thank you Kind of post miscarriage  x 2 I initially thought they had thrown my internal stuff off whack and caused thrush so self treated too many times before seeing my GP was diagnosed finally with a biopsy just before I conceived baby 2 I think. I do remember it causing Soo much discomfort with the one pregnancy My consultant obstetrician/gyn said hormones slide a huge roll in the cases of LS particularly with drops of oestrogen that occur during the menopause. My oestrogen is not a great hormone i have PCOS  \n\nI chose not to use oral BC after my family was complete I do have an iud though as I did find my periods and subsequent sanitary products were a massive cause of my triggers I did query about allergy to products\n\nI will say with hard work and perseverance  my skin remains relative flare free I do not moisturise my face every day but that skin does.\ud83e\udd23 Never had the urinary symptoms. Lol, get keep up that skin care routine\u2014 regardless of where you need it. Thanks for the perspective and info", "Sex and LS I am a 19 year old female. I think I have LS since my childhood bcz I remember my mom applying cream to my private area. She has no idea what wrong happened to me back then. I googled my symptoms and got to know about this disease.\n\nSince my teenage years, I knew my vulva is bit different. I do not have clitoris and labia minora. Looks like they got atrophied.\n\nCurrently, I am not feeling any pain or itchiness in my vulva. \n\nI am dating a guy since 4 months but I have not clearly told him about me not having some parts. Once he tried to go down on me but I stopped him bcz I did not want to freak him out. When he tried to penetrate me, I got scared that I might get tear in my posterior fourchette, so I asked him to stop.\n\nNow I am worried about his reaction and the rear bcz of which my sex life is getting affected.\nIdk what should I do? You should see a doctor!  It is uncomfortable at first, but see an obgyn (aka gynecologist).  They see all kinds of vulvas.   They can advise on whether you have any conditions that need treatment.  Probably you do not, but if you are concerned about tears, you might.  It is not normally that delicate a spot.  It is designed for lots of work.\n\nIs it safe to assume that you were not the subject of FGM?  In some parts of the world, some people deliberately remove the clitoris and labia of little girls.  Can you be certain that this was not done to you?  \n\nYou should get a mirror and a bright light and get a good look at yourself, in a room with a locked door. Take your time. Pop open some websites on anatomy and identify all the parts and pieces. You have SOMETHING of a clitoris in there somewhere, though maybe it has been scarred over. The root of it should still work. See if you can figure out where it SHOULD be.  See if you can get a reaction rubbing in that neighborhood.  (If it hurts, stop.  But it should feel uniquely good, if you can find it.  It might just be buried.)    \n\nThere is a TON of variety out there, so if you have maybe caught a glimpse of some pornographic stuff, do not expect you look exactly the same.  Everybody's vulva is different. \n\nCan you obtain toys?  A simple vibrator will tell you a lot about what works for you and what does not.  Many women like a particular toy that is said to mimic cunnilingus (like \"The Womanizer\") -- I have one and I do not actually care for it, but apparently I am the odd one out there.  You should find out if you can bring yourself to orgasm, if you have not already.   This is something you would ideally be trying before being sexually active with someone.  (Does not hurt to fantasize about the person you are thinking about being sexual with!)\n\nIf you are ready to be sexually active, you have to be ready to talk about it first with your partner.  That means being able to say \"labia\" without anybody running away - you OR him.  IF you are ready, just start slow.  Oral stuff is usually fine.  You should clearly explain (ahead of time!) that you have an issue with something that altered your vulva in childhood, so it might look different than usual.  It is natural to be shy at first.  If you are so shy it is terrifying, then you are not ready, and that is **fine**.  Wait until you are - a month, a year, five years. It is fine.\n\nIf you are ready and you WANT to be sexual for your own sake, though, and he understands your concern and is ready to see who you are under there, just let him get a good look.  If he freaks out, fuck that guy.  Actually no, in that case, do not fuck that guy.  Dump his butt.\n\nMaybe he is been with other women; maybe he can say \"damn, yeah, that is different - can I touch here, or maybe here? Does that feel OK?\" or maybe he will say \"looks like pussy to me, please can I have it?\".  My money is on the latter.  \n\nHe should start gently, he should try things with his tongue, and you will know pretty quick whether this is for you.  If him going down on you hurts, do not proceed to sex.  Personally, if I am uncomfortable with penetration but I WAS into sex before it started hurting, I will switch to using my hands and/or my mouth on him.  He will not complain.  It is fun and you can watch just exactly how much he likes it, without worrying about whether you hurt.\n\nI am all for getting started with oral sex (both ways -- how do you feel about fellatio?  Men LOOOOOOVE a woman who gives good head!).  If he goes down on you, this should give you a lot of lubrication, if you are relaxed and enjoying it.  That makes eventual penetrative sex a lot easier.\n\nHe is likely to be excited to have this conversation, so you do not have to dread it.  Any conversation that leads to removing roadblocks to sex is 100% a conversation a guy wants to have.\n\n\"Hey Boyfriend, I really like you and how things are going.  I have been hinting about something that worries me but I am not sure I have been clear.  I have been too embarrassed, but I need to make sure you are hearing me here.  OK?  ... So I had a condition when I was a kid that changed the way my vulva looks.  I am worried you are going to freak out if you go down on me and you were not expecting that.  Since I have never actually had sex before, I do not know what to expect.\"\n\nBoyfriend is going to say \"Lemme see!  I love you just the way you are!  Lemme kiss the booboo!\"\n\nAnd if boyfriend does not say that, you keep your pants on until he grows up a little.\n\nLong story short:\n\n - A woman's doctor is your best source of facts here.  They will know whether you need to take any precautions or obtain any treatment.\n\n - A mirror and a bright light is your friend. Get to know what you see for sure.  Under lights.  \n\n - Masturbating (with or without a toy) is your friend.  If you are not masturbating already, you should give it a try before you become sexually active. How can you tell him what you like if you do not have any idea?  See if masturbating and fantasizing about kissing or sex gets some lubrication going for you.  \n\n - Conversations are your friend.  If you cannot talk to your boyfriend about a physical condition, you guys are not ready to proceed to naked times.  And that is fine.  You have your WHOLE LIFE.  Do not dive in with a guy that you do not trust to be be careful with your body and your emotions.\n\n - If you are ready and give it a try and it does not work out - because he reacts poorly or because you hurt - be ready to accept that outcome.  If that feels impossible to you, then it is not time to try yet. Wait until you feel like you will be fine whether it works out or it does not, because you are physically and emotionally cared for completely.\n\n - Get some condoms.  Just in case. Just have them on hand.  Do not have unprotected penetrative sex.\n\n\nGood luck to you and take your time and take care of yourself and your body and your emotions.  You are super young still.  It is fine to take your time and learn more about yourself before you are intimate with a man.  And if boyfriend does not agree... it is fine to wait for another boyfriend.  There are more where that one came from.\n\nGood luck to you! I somehow ended up here from the vulvodynia forum and I am just blown away by this amazing post. Bravo I am 100% sure that I was not subjected to FGM.\n\nI have checked my vulva several times. Those parts are not there but I have a small hole around that area where labia minora are supposed to meet. Whenever I am sexually aroused, that area gets wet quickly. I have tried rubbing that area, i do not feel anything and it does not hurt at all.\n\nI do masturbate but it is so different than usual. I put my thigh and butt of one side on a hard area like a table and then grind the two thighs against each other. I do not get orgasm but i feel good.", "Help! Hi Guys,\n\nI am a 21F and this summer I started having pain during sex.. finally went to a doctor about two months ago and they said I had a tear that was normal and had just been reopening every time I had sex. So I did the treatment and two weeks later had sex and it tore again but it seemed to be worse. This is the first two times I have had tears like this. The second time it tore I used lubrication but I was probably nervous. I also think I have had vaginal dryness for a while maybe because of my birth control. Anyways I went to the gyno after the second tear and she said she could not diagnose me with LS because of the tear but that I should come back for a biopsy which is next week. also I am terrified about that. I have never seen any tearing before these two times and do not have itching or white patches and have never experienced pain with sex prior to this summer which the doctor said was due to the tear.  My boyfriend is also pretty big and I am very petite. I started doing some dilation and it does not hurt at all. Is this something anyone else has experienced with a positive diagnosis? No symptoms other than a couple tears in the posterior fourchette area? I have been really nervous about this for months and its affecting my relationship. My gyno gave me estrogen cream to use and I stopped my birth control (Yasmin) about a month ago to see if my dryness was the reason. Please let me know, and also any tips for pre and post biopsy cause I am freaking out! will I be able to go to work as a waitress after? Big dick problems are only problems if there is insufficient lubrication. Even small women have babies, and there is no full term baby smaller than the biggest dick. Girth-wise, you can take him. IF you are super wet. \n\nAnd that is the big if. No tearing or problems for you, and suddenly tearing and re-tearing SOUNDS to me (from out here in internet land) like you are dry and injured and need to recover. \n\nStopping the hormonal birth control is completely reasonable to do here. Assuming you have actual birth control taken care of in some other way, of course. It will take a few months for things to swing back to your normal. \n\nSome condoms can also rub you the wrong way. If you are using them now, maybe try switching brands. Same goes for lube.  You could try messing with either of those solo and see if they irritate your skin at all, just in case. Back when they first put spermicidal gel in condoms, I had some horrible burning surprises. Ugh.  It was not the sex. It was the condoms. Switching brands fixed it. \n\nBut, all this sounds to me like:\n\n1: Wait. Heal. Stay off the pill for a bit. Get super good at blowjobs or something. (He will return the favor next time, right?). But you have to let that tear HEAL. You should be able to go to town on your toys solo with lube without any pain before you let him at you again.  Patience. Blowjobs. Leave your vulva alone while it heals. \n\n2: It is FAR more likely you just have an enthusiastic lover plus dry skin from the pill/nerves, than it is that you have LS. I mean, you can join the club if you do, but it is really not likely.  You are likely to be fine again quite soon. \n\n3: Boyfriend maybe needs to grow up a little. He needs to slow down and let you run the show for a while. Needs to make SURE you are CRAZY wet before he puts his monster dong near you. That means a change of pace. That means letting you say how much and when and you being sure you do not just try to get it over with faster to make him happy. If he needs that kind of babying, he needs to... grow up.  First priority for everybody should be no-pain. Slow and gentle is also good, especially until you have your confidence back. \n\nI am making a TON of internet assumptions here. Apologies to him if he is already a doctor of cunnilingus and the patron saint of patience. That would just be highly unusual in someone near your age. \n\nAlso, as somebody who has always gritted through pain because \u201cI am pretty sure he is almost there\u201d - do not do that. When you feel pain, stop. What worked for me there was always being willing to switch to oral, so I always recommend that, but maybe something else works for you. Still, Goddess of blowjobs is still an excellent sex partner, even if the tears are making you hold off on the penetrative stuff for a while. \n\nI cannot answer on the biopsy and going to work after, but my guess would be that you would rather be resting with a drink at home that night, and go back to work the next day, if possible. \n\nGood luck! Thank you so much. This is really helpful... I am going to show this to my boyfriend (who is very supportive but just gets excited lol) I will update when I get the results back! Might need some more advice after Seconded! Great advice, very thorough answer. How do I upvote this twice. Insightful for more than just LS\u2019ers and written in a way I could read and read again!! Top notch! I wish I had something helpful to offer other than solidarity. I have had the same issue since I started having sex. I have only ever been with my current boyfriend, and he is large and I am petite, just like as you describe. Regardless of lubrication (I have tried everything, from all different kinds of lube to stopping every few...thrusts... to reapply, and I have always ended up with a tear. I have tried clobetasol and estrogen, to no avail. I am starting to have reason to believe LS is not my only problem down there. I reached a point recently when I stopped caring. I wanted to feel close to my boyfriend through penetrative sex, but by this point, he was in a better mindset about LS than I was. He made the more mature decision to hold off for a long time and allow myself to heal, see more doctors, etc. so that we would have a better chance of healthy sex later in life. Since then, I have been doing better about it mentally, and my privates have never been happier. I wish you luck in your journey through the diagnosis! have you tried dilation? that could possible help with the anatomy differences... im not sure I do not know too much about it. thank you for your post I appreciate you taking time to respond and Im sorry youre having a hard time with it but its VERY awesome that your boyfriend is understanding and values your health and wellbeing over sex!", "Biopsy Aftercare F 24, I just got my biopsy done on Wednesday so technically 3 days ago. Procedure itself was not terrible but I was not prepared for the pain I would feel afterward. I am really concerned that my healing is not going the way it should and wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience as I. The area is still very swollen, the cut itself where they took the biopsy has not gone down in size, it is still the same size and still very swollen. It might be scabbing, but I am not too sure, it is black which I believe the doctor told me said would happen. She said it would take 7 days to be fully healed but going on 4 days now, lots of pain, swelling and irritation, I am concerned. How is this supposed to go away in just a week?? I keep putting aquaphor on it, not wiping when I go to the restroom just patting dry. I have been icing too and taking ibuprofen, drinking lots of water and eating a healthy diet. What is anyones experience with their biopsy and aftercare? Is this similar to what you have experienced? Thank you in advance. It took me about 2 weeks to heal. One site healed more quickly than the other. I think it depends on location, honestly. I only got one biopsy and it was on the perineum mine took a few days to heal &amp; i kind of felt the same way &amp; then one day it felt better. just keep taking care of it &amp; it will heal! It was my understanding that as long as they were not appearing to get worse it was ok. No new bleeding, etc. No sites of infection. I will admit it was pretty gnarly looking for a while. Hang in there, it will get better. I totally felt the same way! Day 5 I was convinced it was infected because of how swollen it was. I started making sure I let the area breathe at night and that helped a ton. Mine ended up healing in about 1.5 weeks. I hate that you experienced that but it is nice to know that I am not going crazy. I am deff sleeping naked to let it breathe but I am thinking I should maybe go easy on the aquaphor. Day 5 is tomorrow and I am hoping for some sort of relief, fingers crossed. And thank you for sharing! I felt the same. Mine seemed to feel okay for a couple days, then really bad, then got better. Use a peri bottle when peeing or try to pee in the tub (then take a shower obviously). Do whatever you need to help the pain for now! I had one on my perineum and it took at least 2 weeks to heal. Pain was bad and I worried 24/7 about whether it was healing properly. Sounds like you are caring for it right so hang in there. Yeah! I did not use any barrier creams during healing, but it may help! It is a little gross, but I actually got my period during the 2nd week and I think the extra moisture took the scab off and it had healed!", "Not sure if is LS  It is been more 2 month since I have notice this red patch ...spot on the tip of my penis.,  sometimes I can barrely see it. \nThere is no itch or smell or anything.  \n\nI have done tests from home for HIV HPV and it is not and STD or such of sort.\n\nFor the past week I have been using Pevaryl, which causes the exfoliation you see in one of the pics.\nAlso it kind of looks different now after using it, more white/normal skin then the redish spots. I wish I had more info but I have only seen what it looks like on female genitalia. I would probably check with a doctor to be sure. My doctor suspected it long before she biopsied it and it got much more serious in that time. Good luck to you. Have you been tested for herpes? It can sometimes cause raw-looking rashy skin. Not yet, will do this monday.\nbut there are no symphtoms for herpes Yes. I have seen a doctor, finally. He said there is nothing to worry. And is going away on its own, very slow but it is. I also stopped using any creams. That is great! So it is not LS? So happy you are healing! good new yep. Thx", "I found a great website for information on LS ", "White / translucent patches on foreskin Have not gotten it checked out yet but have had it for over 2 years now just kind of ignored it and thought it was vitiligo\nAlso had phimosis so could do much\n\nDid some stretching and can now pull the foreskin back now to reveal some purple/red spots around the edge of glans and some red spots on the glans.\n\nSome occasional itching under the foreskin\n\nBut the main concern is the white patches, about 40% of the foreskin covering my glans while flaccid is white, but like translucent white, i can see red veins  in the white, seems like it is thinner skin.\n\nWhen erect and with the skin pulled back, some white is still visible on the foreskin covering my shaft.\n\nI have brown skin so it is super apparent.\n\nPretty much, what are the options to get rid of white patches?

I cannot say that mine disappeared completely, but it definitely is not the shiny white that was so obvious when it was really bad. \n\nI would definitely go see a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and then they can better advise what your course of treatment will be and expected outcomes.", "Does this look like LS to you? Here are some pictures (NSFW):\n\n(\n\n**TLDR:** Does this look like LS to you?\n\n  \nLong story:\n\nI made these pictures about 9 months ago after I went to a dermatologist and he said it is likely to be Lichen Sclerosus, but I did not get a biopsy. He also recommended me to consider circumcision, but also prescribed me two creams - tacrolimus as well as mometasone, which I could use as I saw fit.\n\nMy symptoms were itchiness, also pain after intercourse which in the past I did not have. I do think that frenulum is less stretchy and that with an erection I cannot pull my foreskin as far back as I used to, but this could also just be in my mind. Some time ago my meatus also started itching which scared me a little as I do not want my urethra to get affected.\n\nThe creams and pulling my foreskin back and keeping it dry helped a lot with the immediate symptoms, however, my foreskin still seems a bit tighter than it used to and after intercourse it can hurt a bit. I am not fully pleased with the situation.\n\nWhile initially I was against circumcision, I now think it could be a good choice for me. I went to four different urologists which routinely circumcisions and two of them did not see sufficient evidence of LS, two others did. The creams did make the appearance somewhat better than it is on the pictures I posted, so that might be the reason. Still it made me a bit insecure about the circumcision I booked in about two months. If I indeed have LS I would rather get a circumcision and likely be done with it rather than having to worry about some pain or itchiness and using creams for the next decades.\n\nDoes it look like LS to you? Yes it very much does. Please go to doctor/urologist asap since there is a good chance it can still be fixed without circumcision. Given the symptoms you mentioned and that white banding, I would definitely make an appointment Hi yes it does look like LS I am afraid you should consult with your doctor they can refer you to a dermatologist or urologist. You will need treatment with at least some steroid cream. I think there is a very strong likelihood that you have early stage LS. Please see a dermatologist as soon as you can for steroid treatment. Yup looks like whitebanding so it is BXO. Go to a doctor and get a biopsy. Try steroid creams first, if that does not work you can consider circumcision Yes, seems likely. For me it was more prevalent on the underside, especially as it progressed/thickened. I would suggest trying to get the clobetasol ointment as soon as possible.\n\nOriginally my condition looked similar to the image above and was only vaguely noticable when erect. This caused me some concern/confusion about how to present this condition to a doctor. It did eventually progress to the point where it was easily visible while not erect, but this took several months and it was significantly worse by then. In retrospect, I would suggest visiting a doctor early and just describing the symptoms even if nothing is visible upon a brief inspection. The ointment seems to be well tolerated and there isnt much risk in trying it out. Any update? I am in a very similar situation.", "If LS affects an area around the anus, does hair usually lose color as well or do I have vitiligo? Hello about a year ago I noticed a white spot on the shaft of my penis. I am circumcised and I went to see a doctor and they said it was nothing to worry about. It has been about a year since then and the spot on my penis has spread. I went to see a doctor and she told me to stop masturbating without lube (lol), but seem to think that the white patches were from irritation because there was also some red irritation from masturbating, that is only been occurring recently sort of like friction Burns. Secondly today I noticed another white patch above my anus almost by accident. And there certainly is not any friction there.  I have made an appointment with my doctor to tell them of this new development but I noticed that the hair in the patch above my anus has gone completely White. I cannot seem to find any information online but in anyone's experience with LS have they also experienced hair colour loss in affected areas or am I possibly dealing with vitiligo? Thank you. I have suspected LS and, yes, pubic hair lost color for me too I am a man with LS, have not had hair color loss in my case. LS only affects the skin imho. LS is often misdiagnosed so if you go see a doctor and suspect you have LS you should really insist or go see a specialized dermatologist. In my case they also told me that it is nothing to worry about which caused treatment to be delayed Definitely see another doc! I have both vit and LS \ud83d\ude05  the whiteness from LS was very different from vitiligo though - but I do not have any depigmentation on my genitals to know of it is the same/same. LS is itchy like fire ants, vit does not bother me at all. Good luck!!! This is actually very helpful as mine is not itchy at all. Was it itchy from the moment it appeared or did it take some time? Not to throw a wrench into things but I have been diagnosed with LS and it is been confirmed by a biopsy. I am apparently one of the few who has zero symptoms. No itching at all, no pain, nothing. BUT because of no symptoms, my LS went undiagnosed for who knows how long and I lost my entire labia minora... so do not discount LS but definitely see a specialized derm, and if necessary an LS diagnosis should be confirmed by a biopsy I have not had hair color loss, and I have LS in that area.", "Could this be LS? 2 imgur pics: (\n\nI developed red inflammation on the glans penis and a red scrotal rash after some antibiotics.  Doctor has treated it as a fungal infection.  I have used every antifungal known to man as well as oral fluconozole and terbinafine for 45 days.\n\nNothing has worked.\n\nThe red inflammation is pretty much gone but this is what I am left with. I have a few white spots on my glans. They are not bumps, raised, or indented. They do not burn or itch. The glans penis does get quite irritated sometimes if there is a some rubbing on the head.  I have never had this before.\n\nI have tried 1% hydrocortisone and alclometasone propionate with no results (the inflammation returned actually).\n\n* White spots on glans for 2 months now\n* Discoloration around corona of glans (corona is lighter colored)\n* glans skin seems thin and tissue papery\n* Slight red scrotal rash\n* Meatus/urethral opening slightly inflamed\n\n**Question 1:** Does this seem like mild LS? I am thinking it is LS because all STDs and fungal infections have been ruled out with testing. But I am having a hard time finding a derm or doctor that even knows what LS is.\n\n**Question 2:** I have halobetasol propionate for eczema. Would that work in place of clobetasol? Cannot find a doctor that knows what LS is to prescribe clob. Hard to tell.  I use Betamethasone ointment not clob and are seeing good results.\nMaybe just ask gp to let you try it.? Penile LS is often confused with vitiligo, or similar depigmented patches, which would not respond to any of the treatments you described . You are also, I think, circumcised which does reduced the likelihood of it being LS quite significantly. However, your description of thin and papery skin is consistent with LS. I think that ideally you should pursue trying to find a dermatologist to help you. You should be able to order Clobetasol/dermovate from a prescribing online pharmacy for eczema or psoriasis however this is not a recommend approach as Clobetasol is very strong stuff! Mark NSFW I have the exact same thing.....a couple of white blotches and meatus irritation. I also have some CPPS symptoms, so I just assumed these symptoms were due to CPPS. My urologist put me on cipro for six weeks and it did not help anything. He said it must be due to inflammation since he never found bacteria and antibiotics did not work. I may look into LS. Same discoloration i have from 1 year and i didnt find what is it, can you please update us what is this? I have no real updates. My doc is putting me on 30 days of oral terbinafine still operating under the assumption that it is fungal. The meatal inflammation is slowly going away but I am developing larger white splotchy areas in the glans. He thinks the white patches are scar tissue or hypopigmentation from inflammation. \nAlclometasone propionate seemed to make things worse. Redness, irritation. I will ask for clob next followup. He got irritated at me \u201cgoogling symptoms\u201d so I was too afraid to ask about LS. But ill ask next time. It is dumb that doctors get annoyed when you have questions. Have the exact same issue here. A few cpps symptoms, red meatus that extends onto the top side of the glans. The redness seems to flare with stress/heat, almost as if my dick is \u201cflushing\u201d. No itching or burning. No pain on urination unless I am dehydrated which is typical I believe. I know I did have a rough swab test the last time I got tested, well, a few urine samples since then but I refuse the swab since my last experience with it. It seems to have left a little red spot on the edge of my urethra as well that refuses to heal, and occasionally get some discomfort stemming from that spot. I do not necessarily think it could be a stricture, possibly leftovers from an infection but who knows. I did take 14 days of doxycycline and a couple months later 5 days of azithromycin. Best of luck guys I do believe this will end eventually. Out of curiosity, anyone here had covid? Thanks for the comment. My junk is slowly getting better. The redness and irritation is gone. The white spot is slowly fading but still there.\nNow I have developed a bunch of white dots in my head. Like 30 or more. I made a post in IsThisHPV and some replies say normal. But I dunno man. It sure seems like HPV to me. You can see the pics on my post history.\nNo COVID for me. I am vaccinated and have had a recent negative test.\nI did have a cystoscopy for a different issue and no stricture noted for me.\nYour symptoms sound almost identical to mine. I hope you get better like me. Not 100% yet but slowly\u2026 very slowly\u2026 getting there. So a little more background on my end. I have actually had hpv for about 2 years now, but I do get legit warts every now and then (4 total in the two years) but this redness and white spots started at the beginning of this year. Around New Years I had unprotected sex with a relative stranger, and actually got strep from her I believe. Now me being a hypochondriac and having had chlamydia 5 years ago (also turned into epididymitis), I immediately assumed that it was an std in the back of my throat instead of strep (duh). I went and got tested for stds first, which is where I had that rough swab I mentioned. That immediately caused penile symptoms but I figured it was from the swab, until it did not go away, and actually got worse. So still to this point I have not once tested positive for an std, but I was given doxy for 2 weeks which cleared my *std symptoms. It was after the doxy that I developed the skin issues, but no pain or anything. I am still pretty much clueless at this point, and I am not ready to believe it is some sort of lichen as there is no associated pain, and it can look quite normal if I perhaps do not do anything for a couple days. But as soon as I go to work or get stressed my dick gets red and the white spots become more prominent. At this point it really just bothers my confidence, which is unfortunate bc I am 23 and fairly good looking. I like to atleast think it is just inflammation from whatever possible infection I had or the swab that is just going to take a long time to heal. The redness has not gotten any worse or better, but the white spots have seemed to become more prominent over the months. Any infections or anything of the sort for you? Sorry for the long post I also just reread your post, I realized you developed this after antibiotics like me. What antibiotics did you take? I took 10 days of amoxicillin as well as the 14 days of doxycycline Doxy and azithromycin. Thrush is fairly common after doxy. I would have your doc check that out. If it is a yeast infection you can take fluconozle or terbinafine. Hmm definitely interesting. My derm does not think it is yeast bc I am cut but I actually have another appointment with him in 2 hours so I will give an update. Did you test positive for any sti\u2019s? Given that you took doxy+azithromycin. I am still in confusion since I never tested positive for anything I am cut as well. Negative for all STIs. I even paid out of pocket for a microgendx test for mycoplasma genitalia. Negative for UTI, bacteria, etc.\nBTW I am not entirely convinced it was yeast myself but the fluconozole and terbinafine (oral) did help a decent amount. So it was most probably fungal.\nMy symptoms are not all gone granted. But it helped a lot. My doc says the remaining hypopigmentation is scar tissue from the inflammation from the fungal infection.\nI dunno. Nothing really \u201ccured\u201d anything 100%. It was a ton of things that all helped a little bit. Eventually those little bits resulted in me being mostly better. I hope you get well soon. Thanks for kind words sir. I was actually a day off on my appointment so I just left the office. I have a possible fungal rash on my finger currently (presumably from wearing gloves working in a restaurant) so they prescribed me fluconazole for 10 days, as well as ketoconazole cream. Hoping for the best but glad to hear you are doing much better following a similar treatment. I think we can all deal with a little redness as long as it is not terribly obvious (confidence) and not painful. I will definitely update in the near future for anyone that goes through a similar experience. Hello any updates? \n\nI have been suffering from all the same symptoms for 7 weeks. It started going away the flared up again. STI tests came back negative. Blood test for kidney, diabetes etc tested great! Apparently I am in great health. \n\nI am circumcised and do not know what is causing this. I have appt with GP this week. My friend is a dermatologist and said there is no clear infection and does not have a clue what is going on with me. \n\nShould I ask the GP to prescribe me Doxycycline? \n\nI am at a loss\u2026.life sucks right now. With being circumcised I think lichen sclerosus is highly unlikely. I have seen the band of white that goes around the foreskin in that case and I definitely do not have that. Mine is just redness on the glans that waxes and wanes throughout the day, and some white patches are appearing. My derm prescribed fluconazole and that has not worked, so I am pretty sure at this point that it must be lichen planus, which is nothing to really worry about, it is really just cosmetic. I am using triamcinoline .1 right now and a week in I have noticed some slight improvement. But it does seem like a long term benign condition that atleast in my case I need to come to terms with and use the creams when it flares. How would you describe your case and any known triggers? I have a lot of triggers I can point to so it helps me to believe if I can get my life back in order, it will eventually fade. Best of luck to you man", "Does this look like it could be lichen sclerosus? I am at my wit\u2019s end. I posted the picture in the comments. Hi, guys. I am a 31-year-old female and my vagina has been really dry and and burning the past few months. I went to the OBGYN and explained my situation and he told me it could be due to my birth control and kind of dismissed me. I have no itching or white patches and the burning is not terrible, but it is enough to annoy me on a daily basis. I just feel really dry and tight down there. The skin is only peeling on the inside of my labia minora and when I took this picture, it was at its worst. I have used Aquaphor and Vaseline to no avail - the dry skin always returns. I have not changed laundry detergent and I do not use soap in that area. I also used to have a lot of discharge- this was normal for me. The last few months, my discharge has all but disappeared. When I googled my symptoms, lichen sclerosus did pop up as one of the diseases. Can you guys let me know what you think? I posted the picture below in the comments. Thank you!  Obviously I am not a doctor but I do not think it is L.S. I have it and my first indicators were white patches and itching that was so severe I would itch until the skin started bleeding. I am sorry you are suffering!! Thank you for responding. I was unsure, so that is why I decided to post here. I just have no idea what is causing the peeling skin/burning of my inner labia. I have a virtual visit with a different doctor today, so I am hoping to get some answers. I just wanted to see what people here thought. Thank you! :) Try using A&amp;D that will work better. I would go find a OBGYN that is a specialist. It possible something is irritating you. Or maybe eczema I have that down below. I do not think that LS. Im a diognosed female and you have to have white patches. A formal diognoses requires a biopsy. Definitely see your ob as none of us can diognose. I am going to dissent from the crowd, but this to me looks like it could be LS. Typically it presents for me as white perianal patches, but sometimes it can be similar to this - which looks a little like inflamed, but crinkly-looking skin? Is that how it looks to you in person? It is also hard to tell because of normal variation between people. I would suggest trying Emu oil which is both an emollient and natural anti-inflammatory. Other things that might be helpful are sitz baths in hot water and Manuka honey, especially if the skin is torn or open. Hope you get some answers and relief! I kind of have bigger labia, so it is always been a little crinkly/wrinkly down there. :( I took that picture a few weeks ago when it was at its worst. It definitely looks better today (no redness right now), but I still do have a few dry skin patches and it does burn after I pee. I will definitely try out your suggestions. Thank you! Well, that is good actually, if that is your normal, then there is no problem there! I think I would go for emu oil (Laid in Montana is my favorite brand) over Manuka, because it is better for \u2018suppleness\u2019. And should help with dryness, tightness, and maybe even the burning. Might be useful to rinse with water after peeing because urine can be a skin irritant as is. You can use like those barbecue ketchup bottles for easy access if you do not have a bidet (assuming you are stateside). Manuka is better for wounds. Good luck! Thanks, I appreciate it so much. You have been more helped than my gyno. Haha I think emu oil will also be very helpful even if it is not LS. There is a doctor list available in this group: \n\nI would recommend seeing if you can find a doctor in your area that is on that list that might be more familiar with LS. Your OBGYN maybe is not as informed on it. It does not look like LS to me, but I think it is worth a second opinion Just as a side note, are you by chance a diabetic or anything? My sister is and she had a very similar problem. As it turns out, it can be common with women that (I think) have high blood sugar. No, I am not! But I should maybe get that checked out just in case! My skin has exact same issue. I peel at my hair follicles non stop. I was diagnosed with LS by 2 doctors and hyperkerstosis by another, surprised by the result he sent me to a specialist and then I got the biopsy there and was indeed told it is LS. The doctor I go to now says it is all part of the condition. I do not ever itch, so it is not uncommon to have it and not itch.

Looks like LS. Bit scared. Could it possibly be anything else? As the title suggests I noticed these white patches on my penis head yesterday.  I had never heard of Lichen Sclerosus before but after a few hours of research I cannot even find any other explanation for this. Could it be anything else?\n\nI occasionally get a stinging pain when I pee (probably like once every 30 pees) but apart from that I have not noticed anything else awry.\n\nMany thanks for your help. Hi, book an appointment with your local sexual health clinic to exclude some of the more common options for the issues you have described. LS is a relatively slow moving disease so for the white patches to develop overnight is unusual. After excluding those options, book to see a dermatologist for further testing. I wish you all the best. Thanks. I have been wondering whether to go to a normal GP who could take a look and refer me to a dermatologist or go to a sexual health clinic. My problem with the latter is I am struggling to find anything else that resembles this except LS. Also have not had sex in over 2 years (probably more like 3 years, fml) so an STD is unlikely. Ok. That probably rules out a sexual transmitted disease. Best then to GP with a view to seeing a dermatologist. I wish you all the best. In my experience GP's know little about LS and its better to go straight to a dermatologist if you can. I am in the UK and it is expensive to see a derma straight up. I should be able to get a free referral if I go to the doctor first. I am worried that I am going to be fobbed off though. Without wanting to self-diagnose I think I am going to bring up Lichen Sclerosus by name and see if they have heard of it. I have encountered some dogshit doctors over the years. I am originally from the UK so I understand. As I suggested ask for the steroid cream to try.\nI also had problems In USA with doctors being unfamiliar with LS. My urologist does not have another male LS patient. My dermatologist diagnosed me without a biopsy. Cheers, will do. There is an article about the condition on the NHS website atleast which suggests steroid cream as the treatment. Although I am still holding out slight hope that this is not LS and rather something less permanent that I have not figured out yet. Howabout printing it out and take to your gp. Ask to try to see if it helps. Good idea cheers. You seem to be something of a savant in this area, so can I ask you for a brutally honest take on how likely it is that that white patches on the glans will go away with steroid treatment? The more I read the more grim the prognosis seems in this department. I am starting to think that it is extremely unlikely that the colouration will return to normal.\n\nIt just cosmetically looks awful and as a young single guy I am struggling a bit to conceptualise how I can have a sex life going forward when my penis head is glowing neon white. I would like to know if it probably will not go away so at least I can start dealing with it mentally. Thanks! I can only say mine is not visible most of the time. But mine does not like water based lubricant or urine. I keep it dry and use vaseline if skin becomes dry and sticky. I have had the foreskin stick to the glans and pull a lump out of glans when retracting the foreskin. Bleeds badly and hurts. \nSo I think you will show improvement even if it takes longer than you would like.\nGood luck. I have LS. Under treatment with dermatologist. I had sticking of foreskin to glans on day 3 or 4 after applying my ointment. \nShe suggested K-Y as lubricant to stop this. It bled badly on retraction. \nWell K-Y is water based and I woke up to a completely white glans ! So I disagree with you. It can turn white quickly. Fortunately next application of the steroid ointment removed all the overnight white leaving the previous problem areas.", "Any transmasc people with LS? Hey, so I was diagnosed with LS a couple years back, have had it confirmed with a biopsy from my thigh and a biopsy on my labia majora.\n\nAfter the diagnosis I was told to use Dermovate (clobetasol) steroid ointment as an when necessary.\n\nFrom what I can tell I have had minimal fusing of labia minora to majora, and some silvering/whitening but that tends to go away after using the ointment for a while.\n\nI have been on Nebido for a little over a week and I do not know if it is just coincidence but I am having a flare up and it is particularly sore around my clit/clitoral hood and where the outer labia meet at the top.\nI have had a bit of bottom growth (being on T can make your clitoris grow bigger) from what I can tell, but it does not just feel like \"growing pains\". \n\nFrom what I have gathered T can cause atrophy down there but I am unsure if that is only internally?\n\nSo I guess my question is, does anyone else have LS and if so how has being on T affected you?\n\nIf the flare up has not calmed down in a week I will try and get an appointment with my derm/gyno. It might be a dip in estrogen too?  Mine was worse while I was breastfeeding which I believe surpresses estrogen.  Edit:  I know this is not exactly the feedback you asked for so please disregard if it is not helpful. I had wondered if that might be a contributing factor.\n\nAnother transguy I would spoken to a while back mentioned topical estrogen cream might be an option, I will ask my gyno about it. I am not sure if that would stop bottom growth, which is something I obviously do not want to hinder haha. That is rough.

Please tag NSFW Maybe the title should have clued you in, but ok It is really hard to tell if this looks like LS. Mine looks perfectly normal and my gyno said it looks like LS. (No white patches, just inflamed irritated skin.) if you are really concerned, get a biopsy. I am currently waiting on my biopsy results. It is hard to tell, but i could be lichen since genital eczema and lichen are linked (i am a male and also have lichen and atopic dermatits on genitals).

And how is your prognosis/symptoms now?", "20 Male tight foreskin (phimosis) is this LS? Been trying to stretch for a long time but I can never get past this point here ( could it be due to LS? I cant open your pictures.\nI would first say I have had this issue due to infection, probably a fungal. \nSo I was treated by a dermatologist and the betamethasone cream made huge difference in 3 days.\nAlso my nephew in Holland had a surgical treatment for this. \nYes I have LS but this did not cause the phimosis, It came over a period of a week or so.\n\nMy LS caused extensive foreskin adhesions and scarring on underside of glans. This was from pre-teen and undiagnosed for a long long time.\n\nI hope this helps. hmm. interesting. I have that beta cream but It does not seem too do much, I believe there is something more. Here is a new ( NSFW!!!! I can fit index finger in under that is all. No retraction when flaccid or erect so I do not think adhesions are a problem here. Any itchiness or pain/burning? 0, nothing like that at all. I agree, dosen't look like LS to me.\nI think a urologist is your next stop.\nThe surgery my nephew had done put cuts in foreskin. His brother said it looked like the casterlations on a castle. This avoids circumcision,  which I would recommend as a last resort.\nGood luck. Did you apply inside and outside, 2x day for 14 days.\nAt one point before this I had tears in foreskin when retracting during erections. I commented to dermatologist that the scars dissapeared after a while, and it was amazing. She said the foreskin skin cells are different and recover very well or words to that effect.\nso try hard, my advice is to avoid being circumcised.\nIf you are curious look up how infant foreskin is expanded to a square ft and used for burn victims! So should I apply beta cream 2x a day for 14 with 0 stretching on the inside and out? then after 14 days start stretching? To be honest with you the dermatologist did not say but she knows I have been pulling down on adhesions for many years, previous doctor that just tried to detach the adhesions with no diagnosis.\nMy personal opinion is to try stretching against your erections from beginning, it will take time. If you are worried about this discuss with doctor that prescribed the betamethasone. If you get tears do not worry, they will heal fast and as I said the scars fade away.\nThis is of course my personal opinion based on my experience. \nTry to be direct with your doctor. I have found they will not  say much unless you ask and or use the words. \nWhen it uncovers the glans do not be suprised if its tight and difficult to push back to it is original position even when you return to being flaccid. If you can do this you should be able to avoid circumcision. These doctors in USA, that is first thing they say, get circumcised! great advice, may I ask if your phimosis is bad. As in the image I added I can''t pull it back AT ALL :( When I had an infection, a fungal of some sort, I could not pull it back, it was tight and painfull. you dont say if it is adhered, can you retract it more when flacid ?\nyes it was as bad as you show, several times.\nAll I can tell you is to get help. if it is adhered it is extremely painfull even with the cream. I had pain with first erection, first sex was so painfull I withdrew almost immediately,  she wasnt pleased.\ngood luck. Ok will do. I guess my position as of now is I have 0 adhesions which seems goood. I cant retract anymore when flaccid Is it stuck to the glans ?", "Period advice? Trying to apply clob, but I have just started my period this morning and I am already seeing it is going to be difficult. Even if I clear awya all the blood beforehand, once I started rubbing it in/stimulating my vaginal areas, I just start bleeding again. Plus, I can bleed pretty heavily, so I am worried about it coming off and not being properly effective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice?", "I am so happy to have found this community! I always feel so alone with my LS. I am so glad to have found a community of people who get it! \n\nFirst thought: does anyone else\u2019s pharmacist give them the (I am assuming mandatory) warning whenever they pick up their steroid ointment that using steroids too often will thin the skin? \n\nShe says it every time I get it. Sis, you have no idea about my thin skin!! Oh dear! I used to hear it from docs who said they did not think I had LS (before it destroyed half my labia minor and I was finally diagnosed), but I have not heard it from a pharmacist yet. Well with long term usage, it might \nSo use it as it is prescribed, not much, not less. \nYou should be good. It is not just abt thinning the skin but it can cause it to rebound (steroid induced) to, so as long as it is under docs supervision, it is fine Hey just so you know facebook has a lot of very active support groups", "NSFW Do I have LS? 39M \n\nHi, I was wondering if you guys could help me. I have uploaded some photos (let me know if they are not good enough I can take more) I believe I had an misdiagnosed yeast or candida infection for a few years and the skin on my penis now is very weak. \n\nAfter intercourse it all gets inflammed. \n\nAnother dermatologist just keeps giving me fungal and antibiotic cream. \n\nAny help would be great. I would definitely say that you should speak to a Dr. about it. Even if it is not LS, a good rule of thumb is anytime something causes enough discomfort that it keeps you from doing normal daily activities like sleeping, eating, working, or having sex- it is doctor time! Well I was recently diagnosed with it 51M, and I would say that I have the same look to my penis.  The skin tears during sex or masturbation  correct? Hi it does not tear just becalmed very inflammed Has anything helped yours? Thanks", "I am sure I have LS (painful sex, tearing, itching) but i cant see a doctor rn.. Can I have someone is opinion because I am really scared about my vaginal opening growing together &amp; also dont have an inner labia? I am 23 and got recently sexually active that is why I have not figured something out earlier.  Also... how do i let these cuts heal the fastest? I am really lost \ud83d\ude14 Honestly this does not look like LS. LS causes large white patches. This looks like a really bad infection. You need to go to the doctor ASAP. If you are in the us you should be able to go to planned parenthood or something. No matter what something is going on and you need to get it looked at.", "Fertility &amp; LS Hello all!  \nI (24F) am new to this community but was diagnosed at 22. I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis and vitiligo - autoimmune diseases run in packs! I am almost through with grad school and I am thinking about longterm family planning. I am torn about whether I want to go down the path of having biological children while dealing with LS. My LS is moderately controlled, but all over my vulva, near my clitoris, perineum, and anus. I do have pretty bad flare ups that are waking me up in the night. My partner is extremely supportive and has said many times he will support me in whatever choice I make. Would anyone share their fertility / birthing stories below? Is there a reason you would consider not having biological kids because of LS? No judgment, just curious. I was diagnosed 3 years ago, i think it started because I have been extended breastfeeding and/or pregnant for the last 8 years. My estrogen is probably nonexistent by this point, although I am not sure how it works lol. But i notice less flare ups while pregnant. I use clob to keep everything under control. I am pregnant with baby #5, so I have never had an issue with fertility. This will be c section #5, completely unrelated to the LS. Thank you for sharing! I am mostly concerned with the changes that occur during pregnancy and the healing post vaginal birth. I do not heal well (from anything) and a c-section gives me a lot of anxiety. I guess I am afraid of hormonal/skin changes just from being pregnant and possible trauma from giving birth. I totally get that. I wish i was more help there. Just thinking about it is giving me anxiety now that I am considering it. \ud83d\ude02 do you use clob? That really helped my flare ups &amp; stopped waking me in the night. I let it go for years cause i did not know what it was &amp; was scared &amp; the night waking was the worst. Seems like the itching was worse at night. Your dr could probably give you good advice if you did choose to have a bio baby later. Yes I use clobetasol 2x daily and tacrolimus alternating weeks with moisturizers in between. Honestly a lot of my doctors have shrugged off my fertility questions like \"well you can still *get* pregnant\". Thank you for your advice! It is so upsetting hearing how little drs seem to listen to us about this. I am sorry. My understanding is that LS symptoms can be lessened during pregnancy because of the shift in hormones. That is not to say you will not tear, but tearing is a natural part of birth for many women. A gyno will probably have some really useful info for you on u see standing what healing would look like. I am not sure if i can post a link here, but I am going to try. There is an old forum of moms talking their experiences with LS &amp; pregnancy. ( Thank you! This really helped. I have had rheumatoid arthritis as long as I can remember and there is an overwhelming amount of information on well... everything! But I am new to the rare disease world and it is such a challenge to find good, evidence based info. My LS symptoms first appeared when I was 9 months in to breast feeding my first born. I believe I have a mild to moderate case and it stayed that way until I became pregnant a month after I stopped breastfeeding (when my son was 13 m/o). I got pregnant about a month later (planned and thankfully very easy after a long year trying to get pregnant the first time). I was told at the 8 week check up to stop the clobe and did not have too much discomfort throughout the pregnancy. \n\nI used sweet almond oil for daily perineal massage starting at 34 weeks and had an unmedicated birth with no tearing. (I am still wondering how the f that happened, but am so grateful). \n\nNow I have a beautiful 4 month old girl, but I believe, due to the breastfeeding, am experiencing more severe LS flare ups. That being said, I would not change a thing. \n\nIf having children is important to you, I hope they come to you easily. Whether they come to you biologically, through foster care, or adoption I really do wish you the best. But no rush, girl you got lots of at time at 24 years old! I have nothing helpful to add other than I am the same age with the same symptom situation and wondering the same exact thing as you. You are not alone \u2764\ufe0f", "I  finally had a biopsy done today after a year of issues. Hello everyone. I have been reading up on this sub for quite some time now, and it is finally time for me to join in.\n\nI have been dealing with perineal tears EVERY time I have sex for the last 13 months now, itching all around my vulva, redness and inflammation, and white patches that come and go. My symptoms began last August after a sexual injury that caused a deep 1-inch perineal tear. I went to a gynecologist in March and expressed concern that I could be suffering from lichen sclerosus, and she told me that I was \u201ctoo young,\u201d but prescribed me clob to treat \u201cwhatever was going on.\u201d\n\nFast forward to last month. I stopped using the clob back in July because the only symptom I was still having was the tearing from sex, and I did not want to worsen things by continually using clob since I did not even have any sort of diagnosis. Then I had sex on back to back days in August and ended up with a tear nearly as bad as the initial one that started this all.\n\nWent to a new gynecologist. She tested my discharge and prescribed antibiotics for a bacterial infection. I went in today and she was not happy to hear that my issues have persisted (and, in fact, have worsened due to a suspected contact dermatitis rash from using Neosporin). She did a double biopsy (anus and perineum) and promised me that we will get to the bottom of things. She said that she feels that it very well could be lichen sclerosus. (Side note - I am worried that my contact dermatitis rash may cause the biopsy results to be faulty).\n\nSo now I am in PAIN (not looking forward to next time I have to use the bathroom\u2026), and I am just so mentally exhausted. I am terrified to get a chronic diagnosis when I am only 24 years old. I feel like I will never be able to have a fulfilling sex/love life. I would appreciate any positive vibes that you all want to send my way.\n\n\nAlso - as others have said, the numbing was the worst part of the biopsy. My biopsy itself hurt quite a bit, but the doctor said that she thinks stopped the lidocaine a little too early since it was hurting me so bad. I know healing will not be fun, but it is definitely worth the process if it means I will get some answers. Oh, I am so sorry to hear what you are going through! Perineal tears are no fun - I have had those as well. For context I (47F) was diagnosed as a young kid and went into remission at puberty, some mild untreated symptoms in my 20s and 30s and then LS came roaring back in perimenopause. I have had 2 kids and a normal sex life in that time despite some minor flareups.\n\nIf you can get the symptoms under control, you can have an active, fulfilling sex life despite this condition. Stress can cause flares in symptoms, and I know me saying \"just try not to stress\" is not helpful but I will offer some practical tips:\n\nWith the tear you will be afraid to poop. That will only make the shit sitch worse, so get some stool softener (not fiber!) and drink extra water. When you feel the urge to poop, try to practice the sort of breathing women in labor do: short intense panting breaths while letting your body do the work and not push. Sounds ridiculous but over-oxigenating the blood is a pain management technique.\n\nA warm water sitz bath may be helpful and soothing to the old undercarriage. You can also do a regular bath but I find myself clammy quickly in those.\n\nGetting a perianal bottle to rinse your bits after going to the bathroom can reduce the amount you need to wipe and avoid further aggravating the area.\n\nHang in there! This condition is manageable with the right doctor and treatment. The biopsy is a good start, as horrible as it was. That infuriated me. LS is better treated when it is caught prepubescently and you are definitely never too young to have it. My daughter likely has it too but I have taken her in to be looked at enough times for it to be traumatic and the doctor just tells me she is too young and that it is just contact dermatitis. So fkn frustrating. So now she will have lifelong issues like myself. The research shows that it can be fully eradicated if treated before puberty. If she gets a diagnosis later in life I fully intend to sue the doctors that have shrugged her off. Excellent advice. I agree, this is infuriating. The earlier you can get diagnosed the better. And the statement that this does not happen to younger folks is just false. Like you mention, young folks get this too.. babies, toddlers, teens, and young adults can all get it. I talk to sonmany folks between the ages of 18 and 30 and also many individuals who have children with LS. It is really frustrating to hear doctors spew oudated research that has been proven false. I am so sorry to hear of your experience. I was diagnosed 3 and a half years ago, though I did not have a biopsy. Prior to that diagnosis, I was in the doctor's office for over 10 years like you, my main symptom being tearing and pain during sex. In fact, there is growing evidence suggesting that different age groups present with different symptoms. In children and people with vulvas over the age of 50, the main symptom is itching. In folks aged 18 to 49, the main symptom is more often than not pain and tearing during sex.\n\nI have never had a biopsy but spoken to many that have and it does not sound fun. I am assuming both biopsies were punch and not shave biopsies. The rash should not mess up the reading in pathology. What is more important is to be off steroids 2 to 3 weeks before biopsy as steroids can mask LS in pathology as they are quite effective at targeting inflammation. But it sounds like you have been off steroids for a while so this is good. Other posters have given great advice with respect to biopsy aftercare - many swear by peri bottles instead of toilet paper after you use the bathroom.\n\nI hope your results are informative. Know that if it is LS, with consistent use of steroids you can go into remission. I have been in remission over a year and a half now. For me, thT means my gynecologist noted no more active disease on the vulva. Furthermore, I have no more itching, burning, fissures, tears, or discomfort. I have no further architectural changes and the pale while color of my vulvar skin turned pink again. Most importantly, I am now having the best sex of my life because finally I have no more pain during sex. I honestly never thought this would be possible because sex was always painful or uncomfortable. So if it is LS, there is hope.\n\nSending you good vibes as u heal up post biopsy and hope the biopsy results come quickly ...waiting for these things is so anxiety provoking. I got diagnosed in July, im 20. I have been completely unable to have any sex at all since March. However ive been using clobetasol consistently once a day and it has been getting a lot better, so i have hope. It is rough getting diagnosed so young, its hard not to feel \"broken\". But things will get better, even if they take time :) Hey! I got diagnosed back in June. You can read all my old posts for more info.\n\nI was devastated for a super long time and I never thought I would return to normal. I want to say I am like 90% back to normal. I use to have excruciating pain, tearing and I could not even wear pants. \n\nMy symptoms now are super mild \u2014 I do not really notice them anymore. My sex life is the same as before \u2014 I might just be a little irritated the day after but it is not a big deal at all.\n\nThings WILL get better. I did not believe it was possible, but here I am. It is been about 4 months since starting treatment. \n\nMy rough time line of improvement:\n6 weeks in - I got A LOT WORSE. Super painful. Awful.\n\n2 months in - 50% better\n\n3 months - 80% better\n\n4 months - 90% better \n\nEveryone is different, some people take longer, some people are quicker. But you WILL improve!!\n\nEdit: I will add \u2014 I think my butthole looks gross now \u2014 I developed anal tags from the fissures, but I have not tore from shitting for over a month now. I use to tear everytime anything passed through there. No vaginal tears for like 2 months. Hey!\n\nHopefully you will read this book!\n\nI finally found another redditor that has also read the book and cured their LS. I realize that is incredibly hard to comprehend for some reason.\n\nAnyways, here is another sufferers' testimony:\n\n\n\nand here is mine:\n\n Please tell me what you were treated with to get better. My docs cannot figure my case out and I am so miserable Hi there, I was treated with clobetasol", "Child diagnosed with LS Hi all, my daughter was just diagnosed with LS.  She is started on clobestrol, but I am worried about the side effects.  We are only using a grain of rice size once a day for a month and then checking in with the doctor.  For those of you who have used this drug, how long was it until you saw results?  \n\nI am curious whether anyone here was diagnosed as a girl and how your symptoms progressed as you got older.  The literature I have seen is mixed on whether girls grow out of it.  Her dermatologist, who seems very knowledgeable, said there is a good chance she will.  I am hoping that she will.  I am so worried that she will have this as a lifelong condition and how much harder that will make her life.   \n\n\nShe is young, so it is hard for her to describe everything she is experiencing.  We are doing epsom salt baths every night.    \n\n\nI would appreciate any advice you can offer for me to help make her more comfortable.    \n\n\nThank you Hi. I am so sorry your little one has been diagnosed with this. I am a 40 yo woman, diagnosed at 26.\n\nI think you have many valid concerns. High-potency steroids are the first line of defense (and the only treatment option recognized by allopathic medicine) but in my experience, they do more damage than good. I would caution their use entirely. At the initial onset, I used clob 1x daily, and tapered to 1x every 7 days. This worked to suppress symptoms for 3 years, until I broke out into a full body petechial rash that was caused by steroid induced vascular insufficiency and was advised to NEVER use steroids again. After that my vulva skin rebounded, becoming extremely fused, prone to tearing, and very painful.\n\nI am using a borax solution and it is the first thing in a long time that is both unfusing my labia and returning the skin to pink. But, I am not sure I would start here with a child, as it has some risks. It is something you can consider though.\n\nI am the mother of 2 young daughters myself, and we eat a very clean grain-free, low-sugar, dairy- free diet for gut health. This has helped with my symptoms, and is likely helping healing (it is hard to tell with advanced disease.) I would use food as my first line of defense.\n\nI was for a period of time doing acupuncture 1x per week, and after 3 years, you could not even tell I had it. I happened to go to an acupuncturist who specialized in fertility support and he was an amazing resource for me.\n\nI also think a functional medicine specialist would be a good resource or that PRP treatment could be a good option if you have the means to access it. (I have considered it many times, but it is financially cost prohibitive.)\n\nOtherwise, I manage all other symptoms with natural things.\n\nManuka honey - for tearing\nPure emu oil, vitamin E oil and aloe Vera from the plant - inflammation reduction\nCastor oil - breaks down scar tissue\n\nI have no idea if she will grow out of it, but rather than worry about the future, focus on healing today. I likely have a lot of resources that could help if anything looks interesting to try, so please feel free to ask me any questions. Thank you so much for this thoughtful and helpful reply.  I really appreciate it.  \n\nI am going to ask her doctor about the borax.  This is the one thing I keep reading everywhere that people have found relief with.  I found a group to support parents with kids who have the condition, and it is highly recommended over there.  I will ask her doctor.  \n\nWe are 3 days in.  I am going to keep a close eye.  I am hoping that maybe the steroids will help get her somewhat back to normal and then explore other therapies to maintain.  \n\nI am going to  look into all of these oils.  Thank you again for your advice. I am on the same steroid medication, but was not diagnosed until she 29. I noticed I had irritated skin and was scratching in my sleep. My mother recently had a portion of her vulva removed due to cancer, so I went in immediately for biopsy to rule that out. \n\nI wish I could say I have noticed a bit difference with the steroid ointment, but I have not. I have noticed that too many sweets, not staying well hydrated and eating red meat seem to cause flare ups for me, as well as stress. \n\nI hope you are able to find something that works well for your daughter!! Hi, I was diagnosed with LS when I was between 11-13 with a very thick patch on my groin area. I was given steroid medication to use too and used just under a pea sized amount every other night and moisturized it the night off. It become much less scaly/thick and now there is discolouration there but that is all. As a teenager it would sometimes be itchy but I am nearly 24 now and have no problems with LS except sometimes feeling a bit self conscious about the discolouration on my groin if I am in swimwear. My doctors (UK) always told me that as a pre pubescent girl it was highly likely I would grow out of it. Hope that is helpful x I do think the steroid can be helpful in calming inflammation, but it is not a long-term fix and it absolutely does have downsides. \n\nJust wanted to caution, I asked 3 doctors about the Borax before trying it myself, and absolutely all of them were dead set against it. In fact, they scared me immensely about the risks (but I had already had a very serious reaction to the only medication they have ever suggested as a treatment, and never mentioned my reaction as a possibility.) After calming my anxiety, I sought help from people self-treating, got my questions answered, and eased myself into it. I still only apply 1x daily, and it has been a game changer. Even the nay-saying doctors cannot deny that my long-fused skin is gaining architecture again and my white patches are returning to pink. A group of experienced parents may, in the end, be a much more valuable resource than the doctors, and I unfortunately ask myself all the time, what if I had started this before so much damage happened?\n\nI did not do searching to find the best price, but if it helps any, these are my absolute favorite brands, and I have tried many (not affiliate links)\n\nManuka honey -  ( \n\nEmu oil -  ( \n\nI am not particular about the vitamin E or castor oils. I try to buy organic, but I have used both throughout the years. Good luck! I was diagnosed around age 5, my mother took me to the doctor after observing me itching my general groin area and complaining that I was sore after riding my bike. Luckily my doctor was able to quickly diagnose the condition and I was treated with a topical steroid until symptoms had subsided (note: areas affected where the vaginal opening and labia) - I cannot remember what type of steroid or the length of time I was seen / treated but I always think that it is kind of great the I do not remember. At the age I would have thought it might have had lasting mental consequences but my parents were great at making me feel like the situation was normal and that there was nothing wrong with me. \n\nAs I got older my mum continued to check the area in case symptoms returned, again it never felt like something was odd about me and when I got a old enough to understand, she taught me more about the condition and how to check for it myself. She explained that it was just something to look out for and that if we noticed it early it would be able to be treated quickly and would not have lasting consequences. And then when I got to the point where sexual activity was apparent, she reiterated the importance to check and that if I experienced discomfort to see a doctor. \n\nWhile I have not grown out of the condition, I have only had the odd flare up (mainly near the vaginal opening) and it has been very manageable with steroid cream required for a few days to a week tops. Most recently dermol 0.05%. \n\nI have experienced discomfort during sex but being well educated on the condition and unashamed, I have found sexual partners to be very open and considerate and are ready to stop if I am in pain. \n\nThe thing I have struggled with the most is moving to a new city and struggling to find a new doctor who understood the condition. The first few doctors made me feel like a bit of a freak since it is so rare to have it as a young girl! \n\nJust wanted to note down my experience but if you have any specific questions on the above let me know. Sounds like you are doing a great job being there for your daughter! I have had it since I was a child, for sure, but was not diagnosed until my 20's. I honestly do not know what the negative effects could be, but I can tell you I would have given anything to not be so itchy I scratched myself raw and bloody as a child and teenager. I scratched to the point of blood *in my sleep* multiple times. Had no idea what was wrong with me. I would have taken the steroid cream risks for any level of relief. I was not diagnosed young, so I have no experience with that. I think that the steroid medication is the only thing that will help in the beginning. Once it has gotten rid of symptoms, it is time for maintenance. At this point, you do not need the steroid cream anymore. \n\nFor maintenance, my obgyn suggested a fat based cream. I put it on mornings and evenings, so that my skin does not get irritated by sweat and urine. Without this cream, my skin gets very itchy. Downside is that it leaves traces on clothes and furniture if you are wearing thin clothes. Therefore I wear only black underwear and pants, it is not visible then. This is not so great for a little girl :( I was advised to always continue using this fat based cream,  since there are no side effects and the skin is always protected. Even when you go swimming, for example, still leave it on. \n\nAlso, only cotton underwear and pants. Small percentage of elasthane is probably okay, but certainly no polyester. \n\nAs to diet, I do not think there is anything special to consider unless she has other health problems. Lichen sclerosus increases the likelihood of develop ulcerative colitis. So if you want to be super safe, avoid foods that cause inflammation.\n\nI hope this helps :) Thank you so much for sharing your experience.  My daughter is not really aware that anything is wrong or different.  She is very comfortable with her body and we are hoping to make it an experience like your parents did...it is just part of her body maintenance and something she will have to be thoughtful about.   \n\n\nHer main issue right now is being afraid to move her bowels (due to pain).   \n\n\nThank you again for sharing your experience. Thank you! This is helpful.  When doing research you mostly come across the bad stuff, so it is reassuring to hear stories where people have managed it and it is under control as they age. I am so sorry to hear about your experience.  I had never heard of this condition before.  We brought her to her pediatrician multiple times suspecting UTI or something more common.  We were told over and over it was a hygiene issue.  Then the white marks appeared, so I did some googling.  Fortunately, found a pediatric dermatologist who immediately recognized it. Wow.  My husband has UC.  I wonder if that could be related. Do you have any more information the link? This makes me nervous.  \n\n\nWhat kind of fat based cream do you use?  I have seen coconut oil recommended. I did some googling and found some papers on the link.  Thank you for the heads up.  We are going to keep an eye on this. This is very helpful.  Thank you for taking the time to share all of this information. Unfortunately, I cannot give you a link, because I read it in my native language. But I am sure you can ask your doctor about that. I know that my primary doctor said that too, when I told her that my obgyn diagnosed me with ulcerative colitis. I understand that both conditions come from the fact that the body attacks itself, which is why they often do not come alone. However, although I have certain bowel issues, I do not have Uc.\n\nThe fat based cream is by the brand bepanthen. The important ingredient is Dexpanthenol. I hope this is sold where you live, because it is the thing that prevents itchiness so well. Thank you for advocating for her! My mom and her grandma had it as well, and while my mom suspected that I might also be struggling, it is definitely an unusual conversation to have. It was because I eventually confessed about my unending frustration as a 20-something that she brought up that being a possibility, especiallysince it can be genetic. It was such a huge relief to have answers. Thank you very much for the information. Wow, I cannot even imagine what a relief it must be to suddenly have answers to something like this.  Thank you again for your help!", "Directions on how and where to apply clob? This probably seems obvious to most people, but i over think and need very specific directions. I am in early stages with very few symptoms so far, and only a small white patch on my right inner labia, and some whitening along the edges on both sides. I have very very very mild itching and burning, the burning particularly around my urethra.\n\nPrescribed the usual twice a day every day (or maybe once? I think it is twice) and I am just wondering if I put it EVERYWHERE or only on affected areas? \n\nAnd if I do put it everywhere, do I put it on my urethra opening?? Is it okay if it gets inside there?\n\n Do I put it on the hood of my clit? Do i pull the hood back and put it ON the clit?? \n\nDo I put it on my bikini line, on my rectum? I need answers lmao. I am afraid to do it wrong and end up suffering the consequences at a later point in time. \n\nI know it says a thin amount, but how thin? \n\nThank you so much for the help, I am not the sharpest tool in the shed, alas. While I am no doctor, I suffer from LS as well. Simply apply to the affected area, no need to apply everywhere, as I was told by my Dr. These are good questions and might be worth a follow-up call to your doctor. You are not being dumb.\n\nMy derm said to avoid getting it in my urethra but I do not think she knew what she was talking about. Is clob dangerous at all? Are there serious potential side effects, and if I forget to apply it for a day, is that dangerous too?\n\nThank you guys so much  When I first started with it, I was told use it sparingly as it thins the skin, only use to treat a flare up. But my doctor now says do not be afraid to use it regularly. There is potential for problems with overuse. I am a very rare case but I appear to have developed Cushing's disease related to clob (waiting on tests). My doc had me using it 2x a day for 3 months, and I have a family history of lots of hormonal problems. You will almost certainly be fine, but it is worth keeping in mind if you have to use it in the long term or if you develop any side effects. \n\nI would definitely recommend asking your doc for more specific info if possible. But in general if you have symptoms somewhere (clit and butthole included) you should get some ointment on it. \n\nGood luck! Oh and no danger with missing a dose occassionally. The schedule you are on will change as things improve, and you want to try to keep up with it to prevent it from worsening. But it is not like birth control or something where it does not work if you do not take it regularly enough.", "20 years of LS (21-41 yrs old) - Male I have two decades of experience of LS and I would like to share my experiences and thoughts with this subreddit.\n\nI am happy to discuss your experiences if you want to bounce your thoughts off somebody ... Hopefully the thread will not be closed.\n\nThe main concerns for me have been: Diagnosis &amp; Conceptualisation, Relationships, Technicalities of Sex, Sensation, Treatments &amp; Therapies, and, more generally, \"what I think is going on\".  I will write a brief par on each. I will try to keep it short!\n\n***Diagnosis***\n\nIn my experience, remember this was 2001, visiting the Consultant Dermatologist at St Mary's and being told I had 'Lichen Sclerosis et Atrophicus' was not good.  The name of this condition is ludicrous, long and inaccurate. It means nothing to a 21 yr old man.  'Lichen' sounds like you have got something growing on you. And the term et Atrophicus should be dropped.  Personally, I think it should be diagnosed \"Sclerosis\" aka scarring.  And then clarified as 'auto-immune sclerosis'. The consultant offered me no information about the condition or how I might try to conceptualise it or what I should do in the future - she just packed me off with a steroid prescription and told me there was no cure. Not the best customer service.\n\n***Relationships***\n\nWhatever is said about relationships in regards LS must be set in the context of sexual relationships of men and women in general. Relationships in one's 20's can be rather liquid; figures show less people are marrying in their twenties and having more than one sexual partner. In my experience it is better to be philosophical about relationships, and not ladle everything onto LS. Early-20s relationships are a complete shit-show for many people without LS, not all, but for many!  Do not forget all the stuff that is great about relationships apart from sex: walks on the beach, romantic kisses, and so on. The prevalence of porn has got everyone thinking that sex is all about having beautiful genitals - and while I am sad that I never had a fulfilling porn career - and while that might have been slightly disappointing for my two beautiful partners as well in that decade - we were still able to enjoy sex and all that comes with it.\n\n***Technicalities of Sex*** \n\nThe biggest problem for me personally has been that I have wanted less sex than my partner. I enjoy sex when it comes - and sometimes the sensation is a bit like itching a mosquito bite (ecstatic pleasure and pain combo) - but after sex I have wanted a few days or a week or more off to let my skin recover. Personally, I try and see LS in context. It is not as bad as castration. Not as good as perfect skin. Somewhere in between. I have had a lot of good sex focusing more on the thrusting meaty and bally aspects - as opposed to the tickley or close-up-porn aspects. If your partner is into you they will get on board with your \"quirks\" and you will find a way to have fun.\n\n***Sensation***\n\nLS is an ongoing / chronic, incurable skin condition, and therefore the job is one of management and making the best of a bad situation. In my experience I have enjoyed normal orgasms and erections, but at the same time I have had to deal with sclerotic legions on my glans and foreskin, which have been painful.\n\n*How my LS progressed, my experience with treatments &amp; therapies*\n\nIn my case, the LS started as a small polyp on the top of my glans, like an alien space ship arriving. From there it sent out thin striations under the skin to new sites where it subsumed the tissue with trauma and sclerosis. Over the decades, and very slowly, those sites became so scarred and the tissue so \"otherized\" that the sclerosis did not seem to be able to occur any longer. As those sites were finished off new striations were sent to other areas of the glans, which in turn scarred and otherized the surrounding skin.\n\nCircumcision: In my case the LS was so focused on the glans I never wanted to risk circumcision. Penises circumcised at birth naturally remodel themselves during puberty to accept an uncovered state (much how babies remodel all sort of bone breaks and misplacements that adults cannot).  ...It cannot be guaranteed that adults will \"get used\" to the constant rubbing of a circumcised penis. So in my case, I decided I would be happy to tuck my glans away under the foreskin where it would not be rubbed, if I so wished.\n\nSteroid Cream: Meh, I am glad I have got them as an option - but generally they have been overly pushed by Dermatologists as something useful- when they are not a cure (in my experience) and barely do anything to the underlying LS. I think they are best described as a holding pattern. They ameliorate the effects of the scarring in the short term, but do not address the underlying processes.\n\nImmune Suppressant Cream: Again meh, ok for tinkering in the short term, and better than nothing(!) but nothing to get particularly excited about. I am glad these creams are available as they can help keep sexual function on the table, but after two decades of LS I am realistic about what they can do.\n\nPRP: I have had three blasts of PRP, and I have been quite pleased by the modulatory effect it has had. Again, it has not cured the problem, but it has significantly modulated the problem skin. It seems to have subsumed the sclerotic regions with nicer tissue, and also generally plumped the shaft and meatus which is reassuring. It seems to have energised the tissue in general, and hastened the progress of the sclerosis.\n\n*Finally, \"what I think is going on\"*\n\nI think something like a foreign bacteria arrived on my penis and my immune system overreacted and as well as targeting the bacteria, went on to target the entire penis long after the bacteria was neutralised. But this is total guesswork.\n\nI feel my best bet at the moment is to work with the \\* process \\* of sclerosis that is happening. I am not trying to way lay the sclerosis, but hasten it forward and subsume it with healthy tissue. The scarring is leaving behind perfectly useable 'otherized' tissue which has sensation, albeit it looks a bit white. In my experience dermatologists have placed far too much importance on the blanching effect of the LS, which is nether here nor there in my opinion, and I have found this unhelpful.\n\nI really do not care about the aesthetics of LS, genitals are weird at the best of times. My problem has been with the scarring; the speed at which the sclerotic process occurs (it is too slow); and the pain associated.\n\nI really think the best bet for LS, and an area ripe for research, is how we can accelerate the process of scarring and otherization that is occurring (as opposed to trying to weigh-lay the disease with various creams). Additionally, try to boost the surrounding tissue. I have found PRP shows promise for these aspects - although this is a kind of therapy - not a cure - and it needs to be done regularly - say once every 6 months. Which would be prohibitively expensive for most (at time of writing circa \u00a31200).  PRP with occasional steroid use seems to be beneficial. Additionally, the usual lifestyle alterations; less sugar, better sleep etc. And not overly washing the area, and keeping soap away and allowing the skins natural oils.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwell that is just some thoughts - hope any of this is useful food for though.\n\nBW\n\nS Scarring in the female form means loss of architecture which further means narrowing of openings. this causes UTIs, constipation, and painful sexual encounters. While you may have not seen help with steroid ointments and immunosuppressives they ARE the scientific standard of care and they DO help females maintain function. How painful is the PRP process? Thanks for pointing this out, but I am not talking about the female form. I am tired of the prevailing attitude that LS is only a female problem. It is also a male problem, requiring a solution suitable for MEN. I state the price of PRP in my post above. Pain wise - who cares about transitory pain, really? Do you want help with your LS or not? You do not have to be an asshat. dude ur the one calling humanity feces - I really do not think i am being an asshat - I am just trying to put things in the proper proportion. no offence intended Thank you for sharing your experience! Has the disease gotten progressively worse over years ? Also has there been other infections you had to deal with like yeast or UTI ? And lastly what does life look like 10 more years down the line? I am a 21year old diagnosed with LS I empathize with you.  I had a similar problem with a lesion that I discover in my 20's. I got a surgery, then the ls kept growing.  Nobody told me what was going on until years later. I consulted dermato, uro...  I do not know why it took so many years to put a name on my condition. \n\nWhen I learn about it it was too late as the LS had attack many tissues.  I did a lot of researches. Tried different things.  As you said, it is not a curable problem but I learn to take care of me and try to maintain an ok condition. \n\nIf I can share my experience:\n\nTo manage the LS I use different (  That is my best tools I found until now.  The Blend one is tricky to use, very stains on clothes, bed sheet.  I use it on night, most of the time with cellophane.  I used it for a couple of months and get quiet good results quickly.  Urologists was very surprised but did not beleive the treatment work.  I kept going, then I alternated with the Nutra Cream.  (Personally I do not use the Complete cream, it dry my skins too much)\n\nThis is when I realised that the honey in the Nutra was helping alot to get a better tissue. To control the ls you dry the skin. Cortisone cream do that too. But after weeks of treatment hydrating the tissues help a lot.  So I started to use hydratation mask, hydrating cream/serum, the best I could find and afford.  Manuka honey is one of my daily chose one. For now I switch between Manuka honey and the Nutra Perrin cream.  Sometime I do a blend treatment  or an hydrating mask.\n\nI tried many treatments but I beleive that was the one that have helped me a lot. That and tea tree oil.   Careful to use a medical grade.  One drop or two at the beginning because it is strong and it can burn. Careful too to not spoiled some on the scrotum.  Just the vape and I can feel it.  To helped the tea tree oil to go in the deep tissue, I mixed it with some DMSO liquid.  I did use it with the Blend cream, but it is not so easy. Make your reasearch how to use this product before using DMSO. \n\nSo I Mix all these treatments depending how I feel which one would be the best for the day.  Another thing I also do is using hydrogen peroxide to clean my parts after peeing.  Urine is very bad for LS and it is better to try to keep the area dry as much possible.  \n\n\n Cannot say I have a porn model one, but it is better than before.  Do I have rejects in relationships,  yes I do. This is the most difficult to deal with. I think it has shaped my personality;  shy, not too confident, isolated,  INFJ, melancholic... \n\nI recommend everyone to try the Perrin cream or the tea tree oil.  If I could, I would have try that before the surgery years ago. Sometimes I beleive I would not have need a surgery.  I think it would be good for phimosis treatment too.\n\nWith patience, we can learn how to manage our condition and respect our body.  \n\nI would like to experiment more with PRP and stem cell but there is not many ressources around me. Plus as OP said, it is costly.  So if anyone had some experiences to share, any goid recommendations I would be happy to hear it.\n\nCourage to everyone who has to live with this condition.  I know how difficult it is to find support as it is not something you share so easily and the ones you choose do not realy understand.  How many times I was told: at least it is not a cancer...\n\nTake care of yourself, mind and body.\n(Sorry English is not my main language) Really appreciate you taking the time to write this.  Couple quick and to the point questions. \n\n1) Saying PRP plumped the shaft and meatus\u2026are you saying LS shrunk them?\n\n2) Does a condom help with irritation?\n\n3) Would love to hear an update, even if not much has changed, since there are so few posts from men in here and half of those are 20 year olds who are not even sure if they have it.", "Is this LS? 21 F (gross picture inside)  Hi! 21 F. Since becoming sexually active, ive experienced a lot of issues. Only been with one partner. Since being with him have gotten all STD tests (including herpes) and came back negative. Ive experienced an issue with tearing at the bottom entrance of my vagina before, but it eventually went away. Now it is back. Everytime i have sex the tear reopens and it hurts. Also for the past two weeks ive had really bad itching. I thought it was a yeast infection so treated with 3 day Monistat, itching gone, had sex today owww tear. Boyfriend expected and this is what we found. LS or yeast or? I made a doctor appointment but I go to student health and i cant get in till first of the new year rip. My LS does not look this way. It is more white/ashy looking like dry skin. But I did get a lot of fissures and it was red and raw from me scratching a ridiculous amount. Usually with yeast infections, you have discharge and it smells. Are you experiencing that? If not, maybe you should see a dermatologist for LS. It is possible that you have it since you are experiencing itching and fissures but if it is only happening bc of sex, the fissures could be itching bc they are trying to heal? Not gross, just a photo.\n\nI do not think (in my sample size of one) this looks like LS either.\n\nCan you try a longer course of a different antifungal? They used to make 7 and 10-day courses.\n\nI kind of just want to put an ice pack on that until it feels better. (Properly so as to prevent ice burns, of course.) That is the hard thing, these kind of things can present in different ways, although im sure the basis of the symptoms is similar. The only thing that makes me hesitant to say it is 100% yeast is I dont have any abnormal discharge or odor. But after the 3 day monistat, the itching totally disappeared (placebo potentially?) and the only reason im having an issue now is I had sex with my bf today and my tear is still there and painful. Also might be why it looks swollen. I dunno the symptoms of LS match for me but how i look physically does not necessarily match. Thank you so much for responding!! I appreciate you replying!! See the only thing that concerns me is in the bottom of the entrance to my vagina the skin looks all dry and like it is peeling. I will try the ice/cool washcloth for the pain thank you! It does look dry and peely. LS patches actually do not, in my experience. They look more ghostly, waxy. Like somebody took a bruise waaaaaaaaay too far. The skin eventually becomes comparable to tissue paper - easily torn.  But I do not ever see dry or peeling like that. Yours looks surface. LS white patches are deeper and not as superficial. \n\nYou look dry and peeling like you need some moisturizer. Not that I recommend that. :-)\n\nI cannot speak to the swelling much, but I do not associate that with LS. I associate it with itching maybe, and enthusiastic sex. And childbirth. But not with a flare unless it got insanely itchy. Like, impossible to sleep, drive you insane itchy. I used to put the hottest water I could bear on it to drown out the itch. Then I might get it to swell a little. But I bet you it is just the sex. Bet it was fun up until the tear!\n\nI do not know what would cause dryness and peeling skin. Reaction to antifungal? To a condom? Hormonal stuff? Laundry detergent?  Strep? You actually can put an otc steroid ointment on it for a few days if it persists. Just like you would the same issue if it was on your arm.  But only for a few days. \n\nSo I see the patch, it just does not look like my personal anecdotal experience of LS at all. I hope you do find out what irritated you and get it healed. Tears there hurt like crazy! But I think you will heal ok and be back to banging the boyfriend without pain in the early new year. \n\nInappropriate advice:\n\nTell him he better check and make sure you are not still dry first next time. Like really check. With his tongue. Would hate to interrupt sex with a tear, after all, he better give it a thorough check for sufficient wetness before commencing with the sex. \nObviously, I am not a doctor. Go to a doctor and get them to swab it for yeast and bv. If it comes back negative, then ask the doctor for a prescription for oestrogen vaginal cream. Rub the area morning and night. After a few weeks try sex again and see if it fissures or not. The oestrogen vagina looks cream will heal those fissures really quickly (with the absence of an infection). It will also thicken the skin so it hopefully will not fissure again. First of all, not gross at all I can assure you!! \n\nHope I am not too late on commenting but hope you were able to find help. It does not look like LS to me from my experience. My LS looks like a lot of dry, white patchiness instead of red swollen inflammation which is what yours looks like. \n\nIt could be LS because I know it can cause intense burning or itching as well as redness but like the other comments have been saying, it does not seem as consistent to most of our symptoms. It also does not look like you have much fusing because your labia are still there which is a good sign! Hope you were able to see a health professional and get treated appropriately.", "Diet suggestions Hi! Super new to this diagnosis and will receive a biopsy in a month. My derm said that I could change my diet to deuce the inflammation. Any suggestions? I am a bread-loving, cheese eating, French Fry guzzling girl and I do not know where to start. Thanks! Start with easy swaps. Bread-&gt; sourdough only, cheese -&gt; low lactose (parm and feta), canola/vegetable oil -&gt; olive or coconut oil, increase soluable fibre (melon, cucumber, squash, oats), decrease alcohol and sugars. I would do some research on anti-inflammatory diets and just pick a couple of recipes to use a week. You do not have to do a 180 in a day. I followed the AIP diet for a while and it reallllllly helped but it is so hard to keep up over time. I definitely notice that gluten free is beneficial. Overhauling diets can be very overwhelming, speaking from personal experience! I would start with one change per month. Choose one- stop dairy, or, eat only whole grains in place of white flower products ( I can help with tips for this one).  \n\nThere is also a thought that you need to go low Oxalate, to reduce inflammation. That is cutting our certain fruit or veggies.\n\nBut start slow so you can stick with it! Second exactly this. Related recommendation, make sure you track your foods and symptoms so you can figure out what works best for you! \n\nPersonally I use the Bearable app for all my health tracking needs, but there is lots of options :) Best of luck! Nope, will not work. But whatever makes you feel like you are doing something/in control might help. Agreed with the last comment. As for now there is absolutely no data that supports diet change claims in treating this condition. The very last research that I am aware of suggests that it is possibly an autoimmune condition that results in overproduction of collagen in anogenital region. So highly unlikely that switching to sourdough bread  or anything else of that kind will help.\n I feel your pain, it can be such a frustrating diagnosis. I hope you will feel better and you are not alone. There  are a few accounts on Instagram with lots of helpful info and just general moral support.", "Circumcision after Urethral LS Can circumsion still be considered a viable treatment for LS if the urethral becomes infected? Hi sorry I do not have an answer to this but would you mind updating me if you do find out? I would be really interested to know!! Will do! Hey I have both. It helps. I got cut and it stopped 90% of my ls for good except for some parts of the urethra. I am currently on steroid creams 2 times a day to get rid of that or stop it. Glad to hear that, thanks for the input.. May i ask how long you will be using the steroid cream? \nCurrently have hydrocortisone cream myself, 1% I believe and I to am using it twice daily. Got prescribed 14 days so far although it does seem to be getting better already. (On day 11) I am using a light cream (betamethasone 0.05%) for about 3 weeks", "Is there anyone who had success in lessening the white discolouration? Hey, \nMy doctor told me that I might have penile LS, and I think so too even tough the biopsy gave me a negative result. I think the negative result is because the doctor made the biopsy on the glans and not the foreskin which is way more affected. He also did not do a stamp biopsy, but directly cut the skin. I also have a white circle right around the meatus. \nMy doctor gave me a immunosuppressive ointment (Protopic 0.1%). My question now is if it is even possible to get rid of the white discolouration, because for me it looks like it is almost a scar. Are here any successful story\u2019s where your white patches disappeared or at least lessened after you started treatment with clob or a different cream? \nThank you so much\u2764\ufe0f Well I was able to completely regain all my pigment that disappeared.  Does your depigmentation go around the head of the penis in one band and around the foreskin with another band which connects to the first? Do you have pain and crazy itch/burning or the issue is mainly an appearance/cosmetic problem?\n\nTo answer you i have read about people reducing the discoloration greatly and even fully reversing it with the steroids and with the protopic. They key is to be consistent and patient and avoid urine entrapment and keep being regular with your follow ups. \n\n\nAlso read that circumcision is curative but you need to discuss with your doctor. Its both. The first 3 years where I noticed changes it was only cosmetic. But now it is also a mix between itchy and burning especially after sex/masturbation. \nThanks for the tips! Yes I know that trapped urine plays a role with this disease, especially with my disease because I think I am constantly in contact with urine. I try to minimize it by pulling back my foreskin a few minutes after I urinated to keep the skin dry and get rid of the last droplets. \n\nThanks for your reply! You helped me a lot I myself have not had any white patches, but many people say that with clob treatment their skin got back to normal! Oh that is nice to hear thank you How did you get it back? Yes, Borax baths. Put 1/4 C in bath daily for about 6 months all fusing reversed and colored returned to normal. I am about 3 year better and still put Boarx in the bath anytime I bathe, but do not bathe daily. Also he is your gut with probiotics and some other vitamins.", "Biopsy I been having so much trouble even with my creams and ointments as prescribed. I had to get a biopsy today 3 different places I am so sore and I hope this finally tells me what I can finally do to fix the issue. Do you take fish oil? I hope you can get some answers. Iv had to get biopsy\u2019s many times for my LS and it sucks. \n\nFor me the thing that seems to help me the most is Dapsone. I have been on it for years. It takes a few months to really see the redeploys but it really helps. I still have some flare ups but not anywhere close to as bad as they were before. Then I use ointment for individual flare ups and on my lips. I also take probiotics every day and diflucan (sp?)  once a week. If I were you I would also see a labia specialist. My biopsy came back negative for lichen but the labia specialist I saw afterwards immediately diagnosed me with lichen after one examination. I have not taken any in a long time The first time I was diagnosed by my plastic surgeon", "Please help! I need your advice So basically I have been diagnosed with lichen since last summer and despite putting steroid cream on a very regular basis it is now starting to really hurt me after I have sex multiple times in a short period of time\u2026\nAnd now it is also tearing my lips it feels like paper cut any time I go to the toilet and clean myself\u2026 \n\nI have read in the past similar issues I would love to get all the advice you have please\u2026 is there any other treatment for that? \nThis illness makes me really depressed and frustrated, I do not want to be limited on the amount of sex I have\u2026 and be in pain anytime I need to pee.. \n\nplease please please help me!!", "If your doctor was pretty sure you had LS, gave you a biopsy that came up negative for it, what happened next?  My gyno diagnosed me with LS (no biopsy) but my derm called it lichen simplex chronicus so maybe it is that? I am getting a biopsy tomorrow, what was it like? I have not gotten a biopsy yet. I am dreading it. Mines probably in October. :(. I have not heard of the lichen simplex chronicus before. Is it different? Yeah I guess there is a difference. The derm was confident we could treat it with steroid creams. Sometimes early LS does not show all of the diagnostic features under the microscope. Listen to whatever your doc says, but do not be afraid to move forward with treatment and see if it helps, even if your test was inconclusive. Your doc may also want to test for other conditions.", "Applying hydrocortisone How do you apply hydrocortisone? I am currently applying a \"thin layer\" but I am unsure what that actually means. It is mostly all rubbed/soaked in when I am done.\n\nCan it go onto the glans? What about under the foreskin?\n\nThanks!", "New to the disease and subreddit. Hello, I am a 27 year old female currently in the process of ruling out everything else but LS. I have had every test possible but a biopsy and have been treated for every thing from yeast to herpes (which I do not have). All tests came back negative/normal, including hormone levels. I am using triamcinolone (? Spelling) and it is kind of working I think. I was not convinced I had it until I found a spot near the anus, which explains the rectal tearing... I thought I was too young for this disease until I read more about it. It has been about 2 months since the itching started. I have no one to talk to about this. I really need to talk to someone that understands. Thanks for reading my atory so far. Hey friend! Welcome to the community. I am sorry that you have this, but you do not have to do it alone. If you have not checked out Dr. Goldstein yet, I recommend visiting his site.  It really helped me come to terms with my LS and helped me figure out what the heck was going on. This site also helped me, although not everything they said here rang true for me:  \n\nRemember to look for possible irritants in regular things that may be making the situation worse, like: toilet paper, laundry detergent, condoms, lubes, lotions, period products, and soaps. Even drinking alcohol or birth control can be a trigger for some people. Some people say that allergy pills help, others do not.\n\nLichen sclerosus is a lifelong thing for many people, and the treatment and management of it can take a while to control. I had to really think and keep a diary in order to fully control my symptoms, and even now over a year later, I still make mistakes. Additionally, people are still kind of trying to figure out what exactly it is. \n\nSo good luck, if you are looking for a place to talk, you have found it!  Hi! I am 39 and was diagnosed almost ten years ago now. I itched and burned and tore for ten years before that. I sat down one day and thought the tear from childbirth (healed months before) has burst open - THAT finally got me in the door to the obgyn who would actually look at me rather than saying yeast and sending me away (and yelling at me when I say that is not it). Was crazy obvious under a light. \n\nI have used the clobetasol on and off for this time. I was effectively cured of symptoms in two weeks. I use it as little as possible, and I have frequent rectal bleeds (SO MUCH FUN), but honestly it is livable. I worry I do not do enough - I use the cream every so often for a few days when it flares up and gets bad, or when I notice hey, that labia used to be there and now it kind of is not ... freaks me out, but steroid creams are freaky too. \n\nBut it is controlled decently. I had no problems with a second child, natural childbirth and big baby, no real problems. \n\nWhen a flare gets out of hand I have to be very gentle for a few days while using the cream, but other than that it has not had a huge impact in my life. I wonder about the future, and I am concerned that no docs seem to know anything about anything, but getting the steroid going made life 100% better almost immediately. \n\nIt is a bum bum bum bum deal and it is total bullsh*t, but it should not ruin your life. Sorry you are getting welcomed to the club. I hope the cream works for you! Thank you so much for all this information. Sorry for the late reply. I did what you said and have been keeping notes on what makes it work. I just got the biopsy to see if that what it really is but my doctor is pretty confident it is. I noticed shaving and manual stimulation makes it worse... Which SERIOUSLY sucks. The cream has been helping most days. Now I am just dealing with the 3 biopsy sites. This has not been a fun discovery process.  It sucks that it took them so long to diagnose you. I think that it is becoming something the drs are learning more about now. The cream I have definitely helps with the symptoms. I got the biopsy so I find out in 2 weeks if this is actually what I have but the doctor is very confident it is. Thank you for sharing your story and it good to know what to expect in the rectal area. Not what I want to hear but good to know.  I am glad to hear that you are getting treatment, and sorry to hear that manual stimulation makes it worse. For a lot of people, with proper treatment sex and stimulation are possible. You just have to heal first and be really strict with treatment and your triggers. There are lots of recommendations for lubes and things to reduce irritation during and after sex. It is kind of bonkers that they had to biopsy you 3 times! I hope those heal okay.\n\n Make sure for like 30 min after applying the cream, you do not have sex or mess with the area because it can break down condoms and sink into other parts of your skin, making them permanently thinner.\n\nI hope you feel better and continue to journal your progress and really research what can make you feel better, beyond the cream! There should really be a sidebar for all of this lol.  Are you telling me that 3 sites is unnecessary?! \ud83d\ude29 and I have immediately get up from sex and take a shower. It kind of makes it better. I will keep treating and see how it goes. And I tend to shower before sex to wash the cream away or if it is at night I wait to put the cream on until we are done.  In order for the cream to sink into your skin and be effective, doctors usually recommend letting it sit for 30 min, and to put it on after a warm bath/shower where you have been in warm water for like 20 min, and to rub it in for 90 seconds. This is because those white spots  are thickened and hardened skin, and the medicine has to reach deep below  those.\n\nAnd maybe the first two punch sites were not great so they had to do a third. It only took me one, but they are supposed to biopsy the worst damaged areas to make sure 1) they are not cancer yet and 2) it is in fact LS. Im sure if 3 were done, 3 were necessary. They usually heal up okay.

It is a shame that you had to go so many years being so self conscious about it but now that you know what it is, it makes it easier to treat. I was scared too that it was some kind of STD and was terrified that I would pass it to my partner. I hope everything works out for you.  Late reply, but shaving/trimming and manual stimulation make it worse for me too!  Now I just need to be creative...", "Self medicating with Clobetasol. Good or Bad Idea? So I have the classic LS symptoms. Shiny white patches on the glans, white patches on the foreskin, tightening foreskin and uncomfortable urination. My doctor originally theorised it was thrush and gave me cream to treat thrush, which did nothing and it has only got worse in the intervening period.\n\nI saw the doctor again today and he is referred me to a dermatologist. He was unprepared to prescribe me with anything else as he is not confident enough to diagnose the issue. The problem is that the derm waiting list is 4 months and I cannot spare the mounds of cash it costs to go private. I really do not want to wait 4 months to be seen, especially at the rapid rate that this appears to be spreading.\n\nI have however been looking at some online pharmacies here in the UK and I have found that can buy Clobetasol online, you just need to complete an 'online consultation' which seems to be nothing more than a box ticking exercise. So I am strongly thinking about buying some and seeing if if helps. I would not normally use prescriptive medication without direction but I am pretty desperate here. Is there any obvious downsides to this? Say on the off chance I did not have LS, could using clob cause me problems?\n\nAdvice very much appreciated. Never a good idea to elf medicate. But that is what I am doing with beta. It is not a great idea to self medicate but as you know it is possible to buy Dermovate in the UK - and if your describe it as being for eczema breakout for back of knees etc and that you have previously had it prescribed, there should be no problem. \n\nA dermatologist is likely to prescribed an initial 1 month, 2 x day, course of 30g of Dermovate applied to both glans and outer foreskin. You would expect some bleaching of the skin, thinning of the foreskin tissue, which may well be slightly thickened due to the LS, possible peeling of the glans mucosal \u201cskin\u201d and possibly some burning sensations initially. \n\nYour issue is that you do not know if you actually have LS at this stage. I am not a doctor however I suspect that you are unlikely to do yourself any harm by a 1 month course but no longer. \n\nAlternatives would be the somewhat weaker Betanovate or Trimovate which contains a weaker steroid, an anti fungal and an antibiotic which you should be able to use for the full period safely. \n\nPersonally, given the uncertainty and anxiety you are experiencing due to the wait, I would consider doing a month with Dermovate, but avoid rough sex, and then switch to Trimovate. This is actually what my dermatologist prescribed for me and it was very successful, but I was under medical supervision and I had a check up at the end of the 1 month of Dermovate. \n\nFinally, if you do go down the self medicating route, tell the dermatologist so he can evaluate the changes from the photos which you should take before you start the Dermovate. Yes, the dermatologist will be a bit pissy but tough. \n\nI wish you all the best with whatever your decide. Definately better if you can get it through a doctor (maybe a different doctor in this case?) There is probably more risk of harm in waiting 4 months than trying the ointment though. Personally, I have found the ointment quite safe to use/handle, it is extremely slow acting.\n\nDid you contact your doctor and explain the wait time? That is what I did and the doctor was happy to prescribe the ointment. (Similar situation here in Canada, due to the pandemic they cancelled all sorts or routine procedures and now there are massive backlogs for routine procedures and \"elective\" surgeries.)\n\nEuropean deromotology forum recommendations from 2015, which gives you an idea of the likely treatment plans:\n Thanks man this was really helpful, appreciate it. I think I will do this. I am super afraid of irreversible scarring here, just a month ago my junk looked fine and now it looks very unwell, it is bizarre. There is no risk of me having rough sex as a perennial single so I am just going to try and take care. Ok. Good luck. A couple of other things. The main current theory about the development of LS is that exposure to urine is causal. Whilst you are waiting to see the dermatologist: wipe/wash your glans and foreskin after urinating. Use a barrier moisturiser such as Epaderm or e45 on your glans and inner foreskin to stop contact from any leaks post urination and stop using soap on your penis and replace it with a emollient wash such as E45. Do not use scented products. All need to be neutral and bland. All the best.", "Lichen Sclerosis male help ", "O shot / PRT I saw something on Oprah (I think) a couple of years ago. A woman was trying to raise awareness and the only known cure for LS; the o shot. The O stands for orgasm but I think is referred to as PRT (platelet rich therapy). They draw your own blood and spin it a million miles a second and then inject it back into you. I have seen nothing on here about it. Does anyone know if it is still being touted as a cure?? According to my doctor it is only a temporary fix and you would still need steroids in the long term. Apparently it can cause a 1-2 year remission, but sometimes not even that. Steroids do not even work for me so I am considering doing it....but then I would have to continue doing it throughout my life every 1-2 years and it is thousands of dollars every time. Essentially, it is not a cure but it could give you an extended break from the misery. And of course because it is women's health; none of that wld be covered by insurance I am guessing. I do think the prices have decreased considerably (800 in the San Antonio area - and sometimes less with a Groupon \ud83d\ude02). But let us say it worked for 18 months and it cost 1,200; that comes out to an avg of about 65 a month. Wldnt you pay that much for remission? I so wish you and everyone who suffers with this the best of luck. The more I think about this, the more I think you should do this and then report back to everyone. Find out how much it is. Do some research in your area and find the best deal and then we will get enough ppl to donate the money. I will give you 100. I know it is not  enough but if 10 ppl did, you would get close. Set up a GoFundMe page or hell just give me your PayPal or cashapp info and I will send it. You all cannot wait for dumbass politicians to do the right thing. All you have to do is use the money for that and report back (I have heard the side effects wld be incentive enough \ud83d\ude09). I will for sure try it at some point since I really have no other option. It is just hard cuz I have 4 chronic illnesses and I cannot work right now, so the money thing really is quite an issue. That is a very good idea and a very kind offer. I only checked one place so far and they said it was $3000 (CAD) for the shot....so I kind of just gave up after that and out the idea to rest until I could have a way to make money again. I will start looking at other places again and see what I can find, then when I find the most reasonable one I will come back and set up the go fund me. Thank you for this idea, you have a kind heart and a brilliant mind. I think the prices are much much higher in Canada....I have not seen anywhere with prices under $3000 in my area, but I will keep looking. LMAO I wish I could share this with certain people \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I do not have either. Let us just say I used to have a vested interest (full disclosure - I am a male). BUT we can do this!! There is enough ppl on this subreddit page that wld LOVE to donate and for you to test it and report back and that way get some real attention on this dreadful condition. There is over 1.3k ppl on here. We just need a few hundred to donate a cpl of bucks! I did O-shot/PRP 3 times and got temp relief. However, Borax baths &amp; healing my leaky gut we are far more effective and have restored my skin to normal for several years now. Have you worked with anyone doing those two things?", "Vitamin serums/oils to counteract effects of steroid use Hey everyone! I am trying to get to the bottom of this. I keep having flares here and there where I will go from months of using my clobetasol once or twice a week to everyday for a week or even 3 weeks to get my flare under control. Moisturizing with coconut oil and using dilators helps. I am considering Mona Lisa touch as well. But to counteract the skin thinning effect of clob (as I feel I probably have over done it by attempting to manage my flares for the past two or so years), I am looking into vitamin serums or vitamin ointments I could use to help protect my skin where it is now. I read that vitamin d is really great for post menopausal women (I am 25) because it helps aid in vaginal dryness, atrophy, and has been proposed to help retain the skin when using topical steroids. Does anyone else know about using vitamin d ointments down there? Did it mess with the steroid? Cause a flare up for anyone or make things worse? Just trying to get the ball rolling and a discussion going! Turmeric seems to help me a lot! I am very newly diagnosed, so please do not take my information as necessarily correct. \n\n*BUT* my dermatologist, who specializes in vulvar LS, said it is an incorrect myth that clobetasol will thin the skin further. Active LS disease thins the skin. The clobetasol stops the disease and can actually help re-thicken/plump the skin. Also, she said it is not actually just \u201cskin\u201d that you are applying the clobetasol to. With most cases of vulvar LS, the mucosa is what is affected, not regular skin. She said that using clobetasol on the mucosa, even for months at a time, does not cause thinning of the mucosa skin. She said because of this false belief many patients do not use the clobetasol long enough to actually clear up the active disease and so it is actually the active LS that continues to thin the mucosa, and not the steroid cream. \n\nJust maybe something to think about or look into. Good luck!! That is very interesting... I will definitely look into it!! It would at very least calm any stress I have around my constant flares. Thank you so much!! You are welcome!! Good luck!! I actually just read an article that hypothesized that similar theory: mucosa skin reacts less to the steroid cream than regular skin. I will try to find it again and post the link \ud83d\ude43 \n\n\u201cThe present study confirmed the efficacy of treatment with 0.05% clobetasol ointment and its good tolerance even with long-term application. The absence of an atrophic effect of the medication is surprising, but could be explained by the rapid decrease in application regimen with VLS improvement (to 3 times per week), and by the fact that most treated lesions were on the mucosa rather than the skin. A different susceptibility to long-term topical corticosteroid therapy between mucosa and skin could explain the differences in induced atrophy, but further studies are needed.\u201d\n\nThis study was from 2004 and maybe why my derm was fairly confident with her statements I have been using steroid ointment for 15 years now, and when I last asked a derm this she said essentially the same to me - using clob or betaderm is more important to get flare under control and skin in good condition, rather than worry about steroid side effects. When I was 18 and diagnosed (after a number of years uncontrolled while I was seeking a diagnosis), I had extensive scarring and was told I would never be able to have a vaginal childbirth. Over a decade later my skin had healed enough and was healthy to have a tear-free birth. So that was a big victory for me! That gives me so much encouragement and hope thank you for your story!! Turmeric is something I try to squeeze in my diet as much as possible too!!!  I cannot speak to your specific situation. Are you make or female? And by \u201call over\u201d what does that mean? All over your body? Or genital area?. Also, you need to find a more qualified doc. They should show you exactly where to apply it. Clobetasol is a very potent steroid. You should only apply it to exactly where the doc recommends. Mine literally had me hold a mirror so I could see my vag and vulva and she showed me with a q-tip where to apply, how much, and how often That is amazing!! Glad your doc said the same! Makes me feel even more confident in my dermatologist choice \ud83d\ude0a  Thank you! Love this", "Just got diagnosis, any tips on how to manage? I have had this condition for probably one year before a doctor agreed to perform a biopsy and now I have my diagnosis. I was prescribed clobetasol and will start using immediately. I already use non scented detergent and cotton underwear but am wondering what else has helped others? Also, I am suspecting stress worsens my symptoms. Is this true for anyone else? And how often should I use the steroid? I was not given instructions by the doctor. The treatment takes time. I believe my biggest issue was urine giving me the immune reaction. Keep your self dry. I found it helps. After 2 yrs on a steroid my dermatologist switched me to tacrolimus ointment. \nAvoid any water based lubricant or creams. Good luck !\n\nThe typical steroid treatment is something like twice a day for a week. Once a day for week or two. Then once a day going to twice a week. \nCall you doctors office and ask for instructions. Well let me start off by saying I am incredibly sorry for your diagnosis but on a more positive note, at least you know for sure what it is and can join the rest of us on our treatment journey! \n\nGlad to hear you have already made some changes to things like detergent and clothing material etc. That will definitely be helpful for allowing your skin to heal better. \n\nI have mentioned a few times on previous posts about avoiding toilet paper as much as possible and alternatively using water or cotton wool with olive oil to prevent tugging at the skin (also avoiding the harmful chemicals in toilet paper). Keep the area clean, and after you have washed dont dry with a towel, allow the area to air dry and make sure you keep the area moisturised with a non perfumed emollient when you are not using Clobetasol. Avoid soaps and try get a soap substitute if possible or just use water but sometimes the soap substitute is nice to feel clean lol. \n\nStress definitely worsens my LS so we are on the same page with that. I am no doctor but I was personally told to do three months intensive treatment. Month 1: clob morning and night on the affected area. Month 2: once a day. Month three: Twice a week. You might want to give your dr a call and check though as I really am not qualified to instruct your treatment. Apply it liberally!! Full finger tip (first section of finger) not a small amount and rub it in for 90seconds so the skin can absorb it properly.\n\nAny other questions just let me know! I was told to not use the steroid ointment for more than 3 weeks at a time. It thins the skin out and can cause more tearing with constant use so be careful. I use it occasionally- my condition is ailing but not severe. I will use it for 2 or 3 days in a row in a week's time. Hope this helps! \n\nI am also looking into a nautropathic dr who says her condition has been in remission for years.\n\nI also will be seeing a rheumatologist for immunological testing sense it is/can be indicative of an autoimmune disease. \n\nI have lichen sclerosus down there and few lichen planus symptoms/ patches on my legs. I was told conflicting information to this - steroids do thin the skin but Lichen sclerosus thickens the skin so they essentially balance each other out. I was told I do not want my body to build up a tolerance for the steroids so that they eventually become ineffective. And also that the steroids are the only thing that will help the LS This is what my dr told me. And there are other ways other than what big pharma provides.  I found out I had it in August. It was bad because it had taken two years to figure out what it is. When I found out what it was I followed this exact pattern. Two times a day for a week, one time a day for two weeks. Every other day for a few days to gradually slow the meds down. Now I am at two times a week. All of the white/itchy/scales and cuts are completely gone and I am back to normal. Good luck. I used clobetasol until the white spots went away. Now I only use it if I feel an itch coming on. \n\nAlso look into baths with borax added, gives instant relief The doctors instructions were to apply twice daily for a month, then once a day for two months. But when I look at the product it says not to use it for more than two weeks consecutively so I am confused. Is it dangerous to use it that much? I think urine irritates me too, might start rinsing after and see if that helps soothe irritation. Well I think some of us have had conflicting information from our doctors in this thread. For me, I trust my gyno because I am in the UK and we are not prone to large pharmaceutical companies pushing their products so my gyno had prescribed me Clobetasol because she knows it will help. \n\nI have been prescribed it with the aim of reducing use after 3 months to using it only when I need it and she wants to get me to maximum 4 flare ups a year this way. \n\nClobetasol is used for multiple skin conditions but LS is a special case I believe. LS thickens the skin so the steroid actually helps to stop it thickening so much and preventing cuts and scarring. \n\nSo for general  use I would assume it is viewed as any other steroid that thins the skin, but your doctor will just want to be able to get control of the condition to begin with by getting you to use it that frequently. My dr and gyno told me it takes years for steroid creams to thin the skin to beyond repair but with Clobetasol and LS it is about managing the condition because if you do not it could have sinister consequences (not to scare you lol). \n\nI would definitely follow the drs advice rather than the leaflet as many of us have been told to do the same thing as you - myself included and it is working like a charm! I have had skin issues in the past and used an old tube of triamcinalone  before I could get the diagnosis and it seemed to help. I think this is a more mild steroid than the clobetasol that I got. Hopefully the new prescription is not too intense for me. I am sure you will be absolutely fine! I was using a combination steroid cream called trimovate before for over a year and it is not had any adverse affects on my skin! Trimovate is a mild steroid too but apparently packs a punch! The Clobetasol is supposed to be super strong but that is exactly what your skin needs right now! You have got this, you will do absolutely fine and you can always come back for help or support at anytime x Borax baths.", "Hair removal tips? Curious what people use for pubic hair maintenance. Have not waxed in a long time and I am not starting now that there is a pandemic. I am considering Nair but the chemicals are so harsh it concerns me. Has anyone had success or horror stories from it? Wondering if I just need to stick to shaving or if Nair or something else is worth a shot? \n\n\\*Not related, but I currently use pimecrolimus cream nightly. If I am having a flare up or if i recently had sex I will use a low steroid cream Desonide or Clobetasol if it is bad instead. These 3 creams are very helpful in my LS management. Just in case that is helpful to anyone. I also try to moisturize with Moon Juice's Yoni oil or any type of oil in the morning. I got laser hair removal and it is been amazing! Good to know. Thank you! Please, for the love of God, do not use Nair on your hoo ha. Do not ask me how I know. I will take your word for it, no questions asked! I do not have any suggestions other than shaving which is what I do. \n\nI did want to say that my cream regimen sounds similar to yours! Been on pimecrolimus for about a year now and at first twice a week was fine but that is starting to not be ebough. Going into the gyno next month for regular check up and to discuss. I may have to ask for a clobetasol prescription too because when the flare up is really bad I will use both and that is just from the leftover I had, but so useful to have.\n\nGood luck with your hair removal goals! Waxing caused the most painful flare up of my life when I had a Brazilian prior to my LS diagnosis.\n\nMy husband uses an electric shaver to remove all my pubic hair for me. I do not use razors down there because it is too rough.\n\nGood luck! Well I thought of waxing my pubic area, so a good way to test it out was use on my arms first, I got a massive rash. I had to take antihistamines that day, I do not think it is a great idea to wax it when you have LS especially. All I can say only a trimmer works without any kind of irritation", "Just diagnosed... what is the timeline of improvements I should expect with clob? Hi there. I just got officially diagnosed. My family doctor looked and said, yep, textbook lichen sclerosus. They are referring me to a specialist but in the meantime they want me to start on the clobetasol even though I am not biopsied. Due to covid and long wait list for specialists in my country they said they do not want my disease to progress unmedicated and to start the clobetasol right away. \n\nI have been using 1% hydrocortisone twice daily for the past 4 weeks or so which has been helping a bit. My skin has been turning pale recently and the itching and burning persists. I started the clobetasol ointment today, to be used twice daily. When did you start experiencing relief or positive skin changes? I am using vaseline for dryness and moisturizing on top of this.\n\nOf course I am devastated by the diagnosis but I am hoping for the best. Thanks for your support. I was dramatically improved within two weeks. From utter misery and hell to \u201cno big deal\u201d, that fast.\n\nI only use it occasionally now for a few days at a time, a few times a year. \n\nHope you get that relief soon! Thanks that makes me feel a lot better. How quickly did you notice you had the disease? What are you symptoms like now? I was put off for years with asshats telling me to quit whining about my so-called yeast infection. I had it from my late teens at least, but did not know what was causing the pain. It came and went. By my early 30s it was unbearable and I split open one day just sitting down. I called the obgyn and AGAIN they tried to book me with the gatekeeping, cruel, ignorant nurse practitioners who had been so awful about it all along, and I lost it crying and started trying to book a flight out of state to an actual doctor that would see me. Suddenly, they managed to get me an appointment with a real doc, who diagnosed it in seconds and yelled at me for not coming sooner.  I would been trying for years!!!  No biopsy - I had the huge classic white figure eight, everything super obvious and awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. \n\nThat was a really bad day. I had known something was wrong but not what.  I thought it was going to be this bad and worse forever. \n\nNope! Clobetasol fixed it right up. I had another baby. No problems there. It is been 13 years since diagnosis and it is pretty stable. Just have to keep the damn stress manageable, physical and emotional. \n\nIt was a devastating diagnosis to be sure. But the absolute hell that had me putting scalding hot water on my vulva to drown out the horrible itch that would not let me sleep?  The day I was diagnosed was the day it started getting better. The treatment freaking WORKED. \n\n*Years* of torment just over, in two weeks. \n\nEvery once in a while, I will flare. I might get a split in the skin and when it heals, the labia are shorter yet. They are pretty tiny little flaps now \u2026 I am pretty sure they were larger twenty years ago, but I did not exactly takes photos. LS definitely WANTS to consume the externals. Sometimes I will notice the itch start up and it might take me a day or two to be sure it is not yeast or not something random. If it keeps up being weird, I start the clob-bombing for a few days, and that generally kicks the problem back to the curb. I sometimes have a bad day or two, if I do not notice before I tear, and then I am very uncomfortable and it is hard to explain why. (\u201cNo, I will stand, thanks, I have a giant rip in my labia and it is burning like crazy right now and every movement is exquisite torture\u201d is not something you can drop on everyone.)  I can wear pants again almost all the time (I spent a year and a half in dresses, that was strange). I have to remember to pack the clob if I am traveling for more than a night or two, just in case, but that is the only adjustment I need to make. That, and to be gentle if I do flare, usually a few times a year and usually stomped out within three days. \n\nI do not use any other kinds of soaps or oils or Vaseline or anything like that. I have a bidet and a shower hose sprayer, so I clean with water and nothing else. Lots of moving water. Everything else seems to irritate - soaps, lubes, everything. Laundry detergent too - I use all free and clear or other unscented gentle detergents. \n\nLong story short, been there, done that, skipped on the tee shirt. But for me, it was two weeks to FINE and I got my life back. Thirteen years later I still cry thinking about how dramatic that was for me - how awful it was and how quickly it improved. And what life would be like if I had not gotten help!  I hope your turnaround is as quick. \n\nI have noticed my orgasms kind of suck now. Ho-hum. I think everything is still functional and it might just be part of being in my forties. It is bullshit. But I do not think I can blame LS for that. I am so sorry what you went through. I really appreciate you typing this all out to me. I mentally feel a lot better since I was able to get my hands on some clobetasol. Physically I know it will take me some time. I am feeling really optimistic about treatment now. Thanks for all of your help. Hi! I read a post by someone else weeks ago and they suggested this podcast and it completely changed my perspective and knowledge regarding LS. I left a comment on another persons post about this same thing and I just want to spread the word and also give hope to fellow LS patients.  Thanks I really appreciate it \u2764\ufe0f", "How has lichen sclerosus affected your sex life? I (22F) was just diagnosed today. I am pretty indifferent since I have a long family history lichen sclerosus and nearly every woman in my family has it. I have known I would get this eventually since I was little and my doc and I were looking out for it (although stupidly once I got really itchy on and off, I assumed I was getting yeast infections for a few months despite my family history \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). We still caught it fairly early and I am using clob.\n\n Right now flare ups are affecting the clitoris area, which, y'know. Is not ideal.\n\nMy family is a great resource when it comes to talking about treatment and flare ups, but not so much about sex. My main concern right now is how my sex life will/will not change, and I am not totally sure what to expect. \n\nCan any of you all give me any advice on what I might be looking at? I think it depends on the person. When I am not having a flare up I can have sex without any noticeable symptoms (besides may be a small tear) Just use a lot of lube.\n\nWhen I am having a flare up..there are other ways to spice up my sex life. \n\nTake care of yourself! Use plenty of lube that does always help and take your time. Afterwards I always clean myself immediately and apply lotion to moisturize the area.\n\nGenerelly I apply lotion regularly because it tends to get really dry around there.\n\n\nSorry if there are any mistakes - English is not my first language ^^; Lube and no condoms. I just realized a few weeks ago that condoms were causing very painful sex, so I started having relations without them and it was such an improvement. I have a subdermal birth control implant and stable partner tho. Also, communication is key. Flare ups are definitely worsened by mental conditions, such as stress and anxiety. Talking to your partner about your condition would seriously improve everything. Unfortunately any sort of hormonal birth control can send me to the hospital and I did not have luck with the copper ER, so condoms are my only option for the time being. Nice to know they can do that though. Thank you! I have had better luck with lamb skin condoms. (If you find latex irritating) I am allergic to latex so when I used them I needed to branch out...I want to add you still would want a stable partner with those as I believe they do not protect from all stds So it can be very good and sometimes very bad. I am 24(F) My partner is a cis male on the larger size of things and I am smaller. So we must be very patient and use a lot of foreplay. Toys help, especially smaller ones and vibrating ones. I do not self lubricate very well, so LOTS of water based lube for sensitive skin. I am on birth control, but before then we used latex-free condoms marketed for sensitive skin. Sometimes penetration just is not possible and we are learning to be okay with that! I have not \u201cfailed,\u201d my body just is not cooperating that day. Lol We get creative and I normally take the lead to avoid feeling anxious about what might go wrong. My clitoris has fused a bit and lost sensitivity which sucks, but I can still orgasm, it just takes certain methods and time. I hope that helps! \n\nAlso, my suggestion for clean up is to use a very soft, warm wet washcloth immediately after. And then use the bathroom and rinse off a bit. It helps! I have a stable partner, so I will definitely look into it. Tysm! What doctor should you seek for this? I suspect I may have LS. My dermatologist is a male so I so I personally am not comfortable bringing it up to how. How do they diagnose it as well?", "New to all of this LONG POST WARNING\nHi!  I am a 20 year old female, and I got diagnosed last week with LS.  I joined some Facebook support groups, but they are generally all post-menopausal women, and they do not really talk about what I want to know about.  My mother suggested here because it is more young-people-oriented.\nFirst off, a little bit about my situation.  When I was diagnosed, it was at a specialty vulvar clinic, the best place in the state to go.  I had been having double yeast/BV infections for over a year, getting tested, taking the Flagyl and Diflucan, never getting relief, going back and doing it all over.  I waited three months for my appointment, and the doctor took one look, and said \u201cYikes!  You poor thing, I know exactly what you have.\u201d  She gave me a list of instructions to follow down to the letter, and honestly it has ruined my confidence and self-image.  \nMy boyfriend broke up with me in January because when we started dating, we were constantly having sex, and it was amazing, but then one day it felt like he was literally ripping me open, and since then I have not had successful penetrative intercourse.  He could not wait for me to get better, I guess.  Now I am ready to start dating again, but the rules I have to follow are crushing my hope that anyone will see me as a partner.  I have narcolepsy as well, so I have a lot of baggage.  On top of that, I can only wear white, 100% cotton underwear, can only use All Free &amp; Clear detergent, and I cannot use the same machine as someone who uses any other detergent.  I can only use Dove Sensitive skin soap, and anyone who wants to be with me has to use it, too.  If that was not enough to kill my sexuality, my labia minora are completely gone, and my clitoris is about 80% sealed over by fusing and scar tissue.  I am terrified of dating.  I do not think anyone will ever find me sexy in my white cotton underwear, and it kills the mood to make a date shower before they get with me.  The \u201cyikes\u201d from my doctor was the worst, because what if my partner says that?!?!  I am not sure I will ever have pain-free sex, or even have the opportunity to have sex at all.  I am just, so broken down by this.  It feels like a death sentence, considering the hookup culture of people my age.  It is not like I ever wanted to do that before, I was always one to wait until the relationship was official, but now I doubt anyone will understand enough to want to be with me.  I am sorry for the long post, I just do not have anyone to talk to. I am super new to this - awaiting diagnosis bc my sexual medicine doctor is not seeing patients IRL yet - but I just wanted to say that you are not alone and let you know that your health issues are eerily similar to mine. I have narcolepsy too! Type 2/non-cataplectic narcolepsy. And like you, all my problems started after I had alternating/sometimes simultaneous BV and yeast for a solid 6 months. I went on antibiotics for acne and everything went wrong. It is like the rounds of BV antibiotics and boric acid wiped out my whole microbiome and it would not regenerate properly. I developed vaginismus from the stress, but even after getting treated for that I still felt itchy and sex still hurt sometimes and my specialists could not figure out why. I just realized that my sex pain has come from actual tiny fissures, so my doc wants to biopsy me soon. WRT sex, things will be so much better when you can start from scratch with a new person. They will not have an expectation based on how your body used to work. You can build your sexual relationship from the ground up and only include the pieces that feel good for you. I find it super helpful to stick to gentle non-intercourse types of sex if I am in a painful phase. I recently told my bf that he has to use latex gloves every time he uses his hands internally. He was whiny at first but now he is fully on board. It has helped IMMENSELY. Before gloves it felt like everything was scratchy no matter what he did but now it is great. You can also use dental dams or cling wrap for oral, though I have not incorporated that yet. I might start soon.\nYou are in the thick of it right now. You have all the bad things at once and your treatment, if you are using any, has not had time to work yet. It WILL get better. Your body will feel better and you will feel sexually liberated now that you are not with somebody who makes you think you are not good enough. As far as feeling self conscious about how you look, if your other doctors did not even catch your LS based on your vulvar features then I guarantee that no amateur sex partner will realize that it used to look different. They will think you were just born like that. I forgot to include, I am not allowed to shave or wax my pubic hair, and I am an esthetician!  They said laser hair removal is an option but it is so expensive.  But wow, you could be my twin haha, I have type 2 as well!  My current treatment is Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate cream morning and night for two weeks, then just at night.  Thank you for your support.  I am scared to tell a new partner about this, I was already hard to handle with my narcolepsy and the medications I have to take for it.  I am just fearful that my personality cannot make up for all the things I cannot do. First of all, I am sorry. I got diagnosed after I was married..still in my 20s. I just turned 30 this year. \n\nWe follow a similar protocol..washing before sex..free and clear soap..When it comes to underwear..I go without  when possible to be honest..it is just easier for me. LS has disrupted our sex life, but so have my pregnancies and kids.\n\nIt is a lot at first, but it gets easier. The medication should help restore some normalcy. Through trial and error you will find what works for you. Give yourself space to work through it.\n\nSounds like your ex was a jerk. The right person will not care. When it comes to what it looks like...to be honest I do not think most guys even care. If he does..does he deserve to be with you anyways? \n\nIf he will not wash himself with soap or adjust his lifestyle to make you comfortable is he worthy of you? Most guys I know want to do whatever possible to make the experience great for their partners.\n\nIs this something you need to share on a first date..no way..share when you feel comfortable..\nThere are times when I cannot be sexually active..but I can still do sexual things for him or other things..if you get my drift. Be creative. \n\nWhen it comes to underwear..they come off. There is also a lot of cute white cotton panties out there, I have got some really cute organic cotton ones..that are more skimpy then my reg ones.\n\nYour sexuality is not defined by your ability to have sex. It is not defined by your underwear. It is not defined by what you look like. \n\nYou are beautiful. Sure things may not look like they did...and they may not work the way they did right this second..but you are human. Things will improve! \n\nLife sucks sometimes and it is not fair. But you can still be happy, you will still find love, you are still just as worthy as you were before LS. Take care of yourself first and foremost. The right person will love you regardless. Also check out mint green living...on YouTube.. she talks about her trial and errors with Lichen Sclerosis..and she talks about dilators..ways to make sex more comfortable. She is straight forward and has been a lifesaver for me The good news is that you are doing a lot of things that are already helpful: cotton underwear, products for sensitive skin, etc. The fusing is awful, I know. I do not think people can understand unless they experience it themselves. But, I can tell you as a 38-year-old woman, that I have not had a single partner freak out or complain or mention anything, really. Pain free sex is possible. I would first focus on getting the right medication regimen and then exploring some other natural remedies like emu oil. \n\nI had a doctor do the \"yikes\" to me too. Said it was the worst case she had ever seen in her career. But it is because they know how painful it is, not because you are a monster. Pain free sex is possible!!! Get dilators (magnetic ones preferably) and use the size your comfy with (then move up when you are ready) every day. This keeps spontaneous sex possible - almost like a stretching exercise. I reccommed  with coconut oil.\n\nMoisturizing is so important! use coconut oil or emu oil as a moisturizer day and night (and when you apply steroid ointment, wait an hour after you have applied to use the moisturizers). I am not sure if it strengthens the skin or just soothes, but overall I feel moisturizing has kept my skin from progressing too much.\n\nAlso have you thought about messing around with your diet? See if there are certain triggers like dairy or even meds like hormonal birth control. I stopped taking birth control and after that flare passed, I was in so much relief!\n\n^on top of that, I started taking collagen supplements, eating more turmeric, and every now and then I go through phases of drinking apple cider vinegar water in the mornings (with lemon juice and LOTS of water through a straw... no need to ruin your teeth with ACV wearing down your enamel).\n\nFor lube during sex, consider knob polish or any other water based CBD lube. The first time I used it, I will not lie it burned a little (I think I was not stretched out enough from not having sex in a WHILE). But with regular use, it has become the most soothing product to use during sex. Another sex tip is that if you feel too irritated, red, a lot of burning, etc. after sex, do not be afraid to reach for an ice pack wrapped in a thin rag. This will be a lifesaver, I promise!!\n\nSpeaking of partners...  a supportive one is key. \n\nWhen I told my friends I was dealing with this (before I started exploring natural remedies and was at my lowest depression-wise), one of them told me I should be ok with my partner cheating on me because I could not satisfy them.  Let me tell you, as a 22 year old, that made dating nonexistent and stressful. \n\nMy boyfriend now has been more than willing to make sure I am comfortable and even cuddles while I ice my vulva after sex sometimes. It makes the biggest difference. There IS a supportive partner out there for you, I promise!\n\nYou are valuable regardless of this physical setback. You will have painless sex and be sexually satisfied as well as romantically supported. Life is not over with this diagnosis.\nGood luck!! It took me so long to figure out what made me comfy, so please try these tips out! I think it could really help! Seconding the you are not a monster thing, doctors see a lot of examples of vulvas and yours was just obvious to them! Hey. I got the same diagnosis as you at 21. I am 25 in a month and a bit, I have been with my boyfriend the entire time. We were having great sex at the beginning, then 6 months in we were on vacation and went to have sex and exact same situation as you... I felt like I was being ripped open. Have not had or even attempted sex in the last 3 years now. I too wear cotton underwear, and honestly I do not even keep up with my steroid regiment. My boyfriend is very loving and supportive, he never makes me feel weird about dilating etc. I also have vaginismus so it is just been A great pain  cocktail of things for me. I am sorry you are struggling, I truly have faith that their are good guys out there. My boyfriend and I have totally redefined what intimacy means to us. Sex does not even seem that important anymore. I still wish I could have it to feel \u201cnormal\u201d by my own standards but just know I have read several success stories... I am hoping that is the case for us both! I really want to try this next month to dilate every day, put my steroid on every night and see where that takes me. It is difficult being young and having this, I cannot relate to my friends at all when they talk about sex, I honestly do not even remember what it feels like lol. My labia minora is also gone, I do not actually know when that happened, the gynaecologist noticed it at my first appt. same with the clitoris.", "Please join this group if you want relief Hey, so I occasionally scroll thru this group and I notice there are a lot of people here who have absolutely no idea what to do for LS. I was one of those people. For your sanity, health, and knowledge please consider joining the fb group \u201cLichen Sclerosis/ Sclerosus a five star LS support group.\u201d It is for women only. It completely changed my treatment. If you do not have fb then get it for this group. Seriously. Good luck out there\u270c\ud83c\udffb Hey, just out of curiosity, why is this group for women only? It is a disease that effects men too Not sure! I follow Lichen Sclerosis &amp; Lichen Planus Skin Disorder Support on FB and it has been vv helpful. This group allows (but does not advocate) discussion of soaking in borax while others do not allow it. I think it is to enable women to have a safe space to talk about their vulvas and the yuck of LS. I also recommend the Lichen Sclerosus Support Network! Yes that makes sense. I think they said they used to allow men but there were issues so they changed the rules to be women only.", "LS and Thrush So I recently started a course of antibiotics which always gives me thrush and I am almost completed my first month of intense treatment where I apply Clob twice a day. \n\nI definitely have thrush again and I am wondering if anyone has any tips for me so as to not reset my healing progress because my skin was doing so well before the thrush outbreak. \n\nI have taken a fluconazole capsule so hoping that is going to make a difference soon but I also want to know if anyone knows if I can use thrush cream at the same time as the clob (not applying them together just like maybe when the first lot of clob has soaked in/rubbed off. \n\nAny input would be appreciated! My gynecologist told me that using clobetasol in the intensive phase twice a day can lead to yeast infections, so she prescribed fluconazole for me to take preventatively once a week for I think six weeks. Check with your doctor to see if they can do the same if they recommend that. Not sure about creams though. Hi there. So, if this is a one off thrush infection due to the antibiotics, use your anti yeast medication as prescribed, but I would use one in the morning and one at night to space it out.\n\nOn the topic of yeast, it is important to note, a study by Dr. Fisher does flag there is a small subset of folks who will be more prone to thrush due to the use of topical corticosteroids. This is not super common, but when it does occur frequently, talk to your doctor about reducing the potency or frequency of the steroid and or talk to them about preventative anti fungal medications. I know at least 4 women in the LS group I am a part of that have recurring yeast that has been easily controlled by oral nystatin taken once a month.\n\nAlso, on the topic of yeast, there is a classic yeast infection with discharge, but you can also get something g referred to as a baby yeast infection /vulvar yeast infection which has similar symptoms but will not have any discharge. Vulvar yeast infections are treated similarly, but it is important to know they are a thing. Thanks, ive contacted my dr today to see if they will give me a course of anti fungal medication. I am also a type one diabetic so if I have high blood sugar too that will give me thrush. With an infection like I have it is difficult to control my blood sugar so it is high most of the time right now and there is the steroids and the antibiotics so it is all going fabulously in favour of the thrush just now hahah. I have never had any problems with topical corticosteroids before and I have been using them for years now so hopefully it is not that. \n\nThank you for your response! Thanks for replying! I am waiting on my dr giving me a call back for some anti fungal medication hehe Gotcha, yeah, the type 1 diabetes will add to that for sure. Honestly, you are probably just fine with the steroids. I have  been using my steroids for about 3 years and a half and never once had any issues. Those developing vulvar yeast infections from the steroids are in the minority; the literature shows it to be rare, but I thought I would mention it for the sake of transparency and in case anyone else ready found it important. I have spoken to hundreds of folks with LS and only a couple had recurrent yeast in addition to LS and both solved it by taking an anti fungal as a preventative once a month. Good luck with your doctors apt and hope it clears up soon. Having LS is annoying enough, having to deal with other things sucks. Haha yeah, the dr decided to give me thrush cream to mix in with the dermovate so I will be starting that too today, only a couple more days of antibiotics and hopefully it clears up! I am sure I will be fine, I just do not want this to have reset my progress as my skin was clearing up hella nicely!! That sounds like a great plan. I do not think it will hinder your progress much tbh. Very glad to hear that your LS has been responding so well to treatment.", "New to this New to reddit and new to voicing my experience. I do not know what I am looking for in reddit. Wondering if this is an active page to post on? There is frequent posts, but not a ton of comments, unfortunately. I encourage you to post your concerns and questions. There are people here that can help you. \nThe problem is this skin condition is rare, many doctors dont diagnose it correctly.", "Post-biopsy update. My biopsy was over two weeks ago. A bunch of you have checked in with me to see how I am healing and that means so much to me. I read so many horror stories about people suffering from so much pain and getting infections, so I am pleased to report that I have had none of that. The healing process has been a mostly painless one and I am so grateful. I go in for my follow-up this week to have the site checked and I am sure they will be pleased with how it has healed.\n\nIn diagnosis news... It is not lichen sclerosus. It is chronic dermatitis. Should be easily treatable with a steroid cream/ointment. Hoping that will do the trick. I was shocked to learn it was not LS, as my sister was just diagnosed with it a month and a half ago and I know there is a genetic component. \n\nHas anyone here been diagnosed with chronic dermatitis? If so, how did the treatment work for you?\n\nI am grateful to all of you in this sub who were so kind to answer my many questions pre-biopsy and who have checked on me since my procedure. What an awesomely supportive community. Thank you for everything! Glad to hear you are all healed up! so glad to hear the recovery went well. unfortunately I dont know anything about chronic dermatitis, however I hope your treatment is painless and stress free! This goes without saying, but you are always welcome in this sub. Yes I agree this community helps me feel less alone with a chronic skin condition. Hope your skin clears up with the medication. Can I ask what symptoms you had/have? Also, my husband has chronic dermatitis on his scalp, it flares up when he has lactose or processed foods. He is able to keep it completely under control with his diet now after 10 years of trying every treatment going!", "Pregnancy or birth experience with LS? My husband and I are trying for a baby right now and I am wondering if anyone has experienced being pregnant or giving birth with this condition.  I am imagining horrible things happening.  Experiences? I did not get diagnosed until after giving birth. You will be fine. I was thinking it would be more tearing because of it... I mean that is possible. I am pretty fucked up down stairs. I just blamed childbirth in general but I suppose it might have been milder without having LS. I guess it is hard to say. I am six weeks post-partum. I stopped using clobetasol during the early part of my pregnancy on the advice of my doctor - it got a little bit worse and I started to freak out about things getting really bad, but then I talked to a nurse who effectively gave me permission to use it if I needed, and I think that is all I needed psychologically to not freak out, and I did not end up using it.\n\nI was really concerned about the effect it would have during delivery, and unfortunately very few of the providers I spoke with knew anything about lichen sclerosus. I asked consistently throughout my pregnancy and got zero answers until the week before, when I was advised that it probably would result in more tearing, and potentially be difficult to stitch up since my skin is really thin and inelastic on the perineum. Based on those discussions, I had a scheduled c-section. I was very happy with that - I would regularly tear and have major discomfort during vaginal ultrasounds, so I think I probably would have had tearing just from things like cervical checks before I even got to the actual delivery. But I think people's experiences differ, and there is not a lot of data out there, so it is a bit of an unknown - talk to your doctor, have them check you as you approach delivery date, and make the call that feels right for you. I was diagnosed between pregnancies. I was very worried about it with #2, but LS was not a problem for delivery. \n\nI used a lower-potency steroid every so often if it felt like a flare might be coming on - triamcinolone, I think - rather than clobetasol. LS was not aggressive when I was pregnant. \n\nI tore worse with my first kiddo (7lbs11oz) than I did with my second (9lbs1oz). I do not even remember stitches with the second. Had some, but it was not a big deal. Healed really quickly. \n\nI went the all-natural route and had a doula support me in labor. Did not need any interventions, and labored until everything was ready to go before ejecting a baby. I suspect that helped. I spent a lot of time in the hospital bathroom tub, with the doula pouring water over me and keeping me warm. It does not work out that way for everyone, but it did for me. My understanding is that forcing a faster delivery can cause a lot more difficulty pushing, and that can lead to bigger traumas. No thanks .... \n\nYou never know what labor will bring, but I absolutely recommend checking into whether the support of a doula might help you out. They will learn about LS, understand your concerns, oil and massage you up or add warm compresses or do whatever you ask them to do ahead of time, and not forget it in the moment like husbands do. And they will make sure you get that care when medical staff will not understand about LS and will not know why they should care. Even if you do prefer drugs, a doula is there to do one job: support you and advocate for you while you are busy having a baby. \n\nBut seriously, pregnancy kicked my LS into a low gear that was easily controlled with a less potent steroid. Was not an issue in delivery or recovery. \n\nBest of luck to you!! I am so glad to hear that you had a positive experience, but just to be a counter example, I had a doula and she did not know anything about LS and did not research it after I said my number one concern was how it might affect delivery and what I could do to minimize risks of tearing. If you interview a doula, ask not just if they are familiar, but if they are willing to learn more to support you in labor. Thanks for asking this OP its been on my mind alot recently. Maybe look into perineal stretching from around 33 weeks too. Hey, traveltravel30, just a quick heads-up:  \n**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. My LS also improved greatly while I was pregnant. I actually ended up going nearly a year and a half with no symptoms. You never know how your body will handle it OP, but I would not lose too much sleep over it. It will be ok. Thank you so much for your honesty and sharing of your experiences.  I feel really embarrassed, alone, and ashamed now when I go to appointments.  I know I should not but it is the truth.  You bring up some really good points to ask my provider.  Will I have enough skin to stitch up?  Will those stitches tear more easily causing more complications now or down the road? Will the clobetasol affect the baby? Thank you so much for sharing.  I am hoping to go as natural as I can for as long as I can, but I am also for some intervention for pain as long as it does not speed things up.  I really like the idea of having a doula.  They are not covered by my insurance so we would have to play the numbers game to see if we could afford one.  I will definitely be asking my doctor about an alternative cream or steroids though.  I did not know there were other choices. That is a good point.  Maybe I will be one of the lucky ones! Thanks for the idea.  I have not looked into this at all yet, but it will definitely be on my radar now.  I did not know that was a thing. I do not yet have any experience with pregnancy and LS, but it is something I have discussed with my gynaecologist. She specializes in dermatology and gynaecology, and she said that while each case is different, so long as you have a doctor knowledgeable about and aware of your LS (which is not the easiest thing to find), it should not be assumed that you absolutely must have a c section. She advised to follow up with her when/if I do plan to get pregnant, but also recommended a pelvic physiotherapist. She said that (in her experience) a lot of women do not even realize they have LS until the birth has started and that she has helped women successfully deliver children vaginally with their LS properly dealt with up until that point. I do not have much more for specifics because I have not gone through it and done all the research yet. One thing I found interesting that she mentioned, was that it is typically after childbirth, if you choose to breastfeed, that is when LS can get particularly bad due to the change in Estrogen. She said even still breastfeeding does not need to be ruled out as an option and that estrogen cream may just need to be included in your post pregnancy treatment. I was another lucky one who did not have any flare ups during pregnancy. Only minimal tearing during birth and now that she is almost two I am just now starting to have flare ups again and just found this sub today! Best of luck to you! Hey all! I am a soon to be sitting for the ibclc boards, breastfeeding knowledgable doula. Estrogen creams can tank a breastmilk supply.", "Women: has your LS spread to your mons pubis? Is it possible for LS To spread to mons pubis or is it mainly in vulva/anal area?? I have not heard of it there before, but anything is possible. It wouldnt surprise me too much for it to occur there. LS can affect the skin anywhere, not just the genitals. The good thing is that extra-genital LS is usually less severe from what I understand I think it mainly occurs in the vulvar and anal regions \u2014 but some people get rashes elsewhere on their body Mine has spread there and it goes right up onto the bottom of my tummy", "Periods. Sex. Treatment. Symptoms. Hi guys, I have been newly diagnosed with LS and I am looking for a ton of advice on this. Super thankful there is a subreddit for us! I had some questions if you all did not mind helping a girl out.\nPeriods- I have noticed for a while now that I cannot use tampons anymore. They itch WAY too bad. I have switched to period undies and reusable pads which has helped a lot. Is there anything else I could try to make periods with this stuff more tolerable?\nAs far as sex, do you still have it? Are you discouraged when you have a flare up and cannot get freaky with your man? \nCan you guys tell me any more about your symptoms and treatments (day to day too, clothing etc).\n\nI know this is a loaded question, I have read a ton of posts already as well. Just want to hear it from people whom actually live with this! Tysm \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb If you are looking for period alternatives I definitely recommend a menstrual cup. They can be left in for longer and have caused no issues for me! I would say the hardest part is learning how to use them, taking them in and out but with a little bit of practice it is not very difficult at all for me now. i would recommend a menstrual disc or cup. not only did it help with itching but my period cramps are not as bad.\n\nwhen I am flaring, the last thing on my mind is sex. \n\nmy symptoms start with itching, then turn into severe redness, inflammation, tearing, and bleeding. things that help me are sitz baths, ice (this helps with pain and itching), THC. i use fragrance and dye free detergent (all free and clear) and soap (eucerin or aquaphor baby wash). no panties! and i sleep nude. \n\nclobetasol is the best prescription option, and if you are prescribed it, make sure it is the ointment not the cream. apply it after bathing and rub it in for at least 60 seconds. taper off as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\nnon prescription therapeutics are other emollients like emu oil or coconut oil. i like something called emily's hot skin soother. Hi, I hope you will find the help you need in here like I did. I stopped using detergents and shpwer gels with so much chemicals. Apart from the treatment itself it is very essential to keep mostruize the skin in order to avoid symptoms. Another thing helped me to stop wearing panties as much as I could lol What would you say the best moisturizer is?!\nI already ditched scented everything. Now as far as after your shower, do you allow things to air dry? I was letting things air dry and sleeping with no underwear but I think the sweating at night was making it flare up  I use coconot oil mostly and other products that my doctor suggested. You can always ask your doctor what would be best for you. I also use coconot oil as lube for sex which I highly recommended. I use towels after shower and allow things to air dry Okay awesome. Thanks for the info! I have recently been debating trying coconut oil for everything down there, just trying to figure out the best way to apply it atm lol Periods:\nStill navigating. My symptoms are always the worst during the time of the month. Once I save some more money I will be investing in period panties because tampons are super irritating unless I shove the string up my cooch and pads are out of the question. \n\nTips:\nOnce you get down to your maintenance of clobetasol (twice weekly application) you also need to maintain moisture on your problem areas. For me, a once daily Vaseline application on my problem area is REQUIRED. A couple days of no Vaseline and it flares. Vaseline acts as a barrier and prevents friction or my bodily fluids from irritating my skin. \n\nSex:\nPretty much back to normal. So far though, I have to cap sex at twice daily because any more and I get irritated. I make sure I have a thin layer of Vaseline on and then use lube. A lot of lubes are irritating to me no matter the brand and again, Vaseline helps my problem areas. Do not use Vaseline as lube tho \u2014 it should not get up in there, at least in large quantities.\n\nClothing:\nI have to avoid tight fitting pants. Or at least, limit tight pants to &lt;5 hours or else it WILL flare me. I still wear leggings, jeans, and etc. but not going to lie, I am not the most comfortable. I get by, but I try to limit it.\n\nEveryday routine:\nMonday/Thursday night time application of clobetasol. Every other day I will use a thin layer of Vaseline around my opening (where I have my bothersome symptoms) and that is it. Other than that, my LS does not impact my day to day routine much. Obviously when I was first diagnosed it was all I thought about and I was in excruciating pain\u2026 but it WILL get better.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to DM me, absolutely NO question is off limits. You are a godsend. Thank you! I am 27, diagnosed a couple months ago. \n\nI have an IUD and do not get a period, which is really nice, but that is definitely something I worry about.\n\nClobetasol helps a lot, as well as moisture! You can use Vaseline and lube during sex. The biggest thing that helps is communication. Tell your partner if something hurts. For me, I never have pain during, but I have a lot of issues after sex with burning. I hold a cold cloth against myself afterwards until I cool down, then put some vaseline on (or clobetasol if it is a day I use clobetasol anyway). \n\nFor moisture, a lot of people use coconut oil, but I cannot use it. I use vaseline. A lot of people also recommend Aquaphor. Anything gentle and fragrance free. And no soap.\n\nThere are a few really great private Facebook groups that you can join, and they are so helpful. When I was first diagnosed I spiraled really badly reading all the info out there. The mental aspect of the diagnosis was really challenging for me. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! Can I ask the reason you cannot use coconut oil? I have considered it heavily but I also have struggled with yeast infections in the past and that is the word of caution I have seen with coconut oil. And I have not brought myself to trying that out as a moisturizer/lube just yet! The smell of coconut oil honestly just makes me want to throw up, and I cannot get past that.\n\nAs for yeast infections, the steroid cream can predispose you to yeast, but I have not heard that about coconut oil. When you are using clob in the intensive phase (twice a day or once a day) you need to be on the lookout for yeast, and some doctors will give you preventative medication to use once a week. Once you are in the maintenance phase (twice a week) for clob, the concern of yeast infection goes down, but can still be more common than without steroid use. No problem. Believe me I cried everyday for months because how bad my symptoms were. It really ruined my life for a while. The only reason I stay on this subreddit is because I remember feeling like this and feeling hopeless. I want to give hope to you who are first diagnosed that it does get better. \u2764\ufe0f I really appreciate the fact that you stuck around to help people like me! Reading the stuff on Google had me in tears and I even worried that my husband would leave me over this. It had me all worked up. But judging by everyone is responses, it sounds like I can manage this and live a normal life.", "29yr old- Undiagnosed but completely certain I noticed the large white patches today. I am 29 years old and have had the itching at night sensation for about 10 years. I was new to being sexually active at 19 so a little bit of pain I thought was normal too. I would let my gyn know every year but they said everything looked normal/tests normal maybe some scarring from itching. And I have had 3 or so gyns take a look as well as a dermatologist and endocrinologist because my pediatrician told me when I was young I had a larger thyroid. Every test I took came up \u201cnormal\u201d. I stopped the pill, I stopped having sex, I tried everything to stop the pain. Only recently have I noticed more hair falling out more to the point I have started putting cbd oil on my scalp\u2026 has anyone had more than 2 combinations with this condition? (Autoimmune and alopecia?) Has any particular diet helped with your Lichen Sclerosus?\n\nI have never been more sure of what it is that has been wrong with my body.\n\nNow 10 years later I feel almost relief knowing what it is and yet frustration and sadness wondering if it could have been caught earlier for all kinds of reasons\u2026 I feel so upset right now\u2026 I am scared for my future and yet I know nothing should surprise me\u2026 I think I had childhood symptoms of LS (age 6) but was not formally diagnosed until age 46 this year as I did not have symptoms again until age 45. At age 32 I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer (well, an undiagnosable lump that the docs agreed was a good thing to take out altogether) so now I am on synthroid forever after having the whole thyroid removed.\n\nAutoimmune conditions tend to run in packs- rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid issues, psoriasis, LS, etc - so it would not be uncommon to have a pile up of conditions. That said, my life and health is relatively normal with both conditions. I was able to have kids with no issue, have good energy levels, and generally am okay. Do not be discouraged about long term prospects - the right treatment makes the world of difference!  Hang in there! Thank you so much, I needed to hear a more positive experiences with dealing with this condition.. I feel alone and embarrassed to talk to anyone about this. I have also developed what I think is eczema in the past 5 years.. I am scared to find out there are more health conditions I need to look out for, but I am really glad this subreddit exists!! Welcome, your pain and experience are valid. I completely understand your feelings - I felt quite the same way when I was trying to get a diagnosis at 22. I am 24 now and have a much better handle on my disease. Your life is not over and your sex life is not either.\n\nYour best route right now is to see an \\*expert\\* in LS, not just any gyno or dermatologist. You can call offices and ask if anyone is an expert/regularly see patients. Say you are looking for an aggressive treatment approach. I have had very sweet dermatologists who knew nothing about LS and very dismissive \"specialists\" who did not believe me at all. Try to get a biopsy to confirm.\n\nThere are amazing new treatments other than just clobetasol ointment: steroid shots, laser treatment - there is hope if you can find a knowledgeable provider.\n\nBest of luck to you! You are not alone. I have an appointment with a gyn who owns their own practice with a bunch of supporting gyns so I hope he will be able to help- definitely will ask for him to point me to an LS specialist if not thank you for the suggestion! Because LS comes with other autoimmune issues do you think it is a good idea to schedule an appointment with an endocrinologist again? Explore all of your options, but honestly, there is not a ton of research for treating LS as autoimmune so they may not provide you with many treatment options. I would look into steroid shots or the laser treatment if you want to be more aggressive. More research and amazing results.", "diagnosed with eczema... bladder pressure? (23F) I have been dealing with itchiness/dryness/general irritation for over a year. Usually there is always general discomfort i would rate a \n3 /10 but experience flares that feel like a 7/10. There is has never been any abnormal discharge or smell. I am only sexual active with one partner (in a wlw relationship) and masturbation:sex is almost always uncomfortable painful and leaves little tears near my clitoris. I have been to the gynecologist three times now. My first two visits were awful, i was just told that i had a yeast infection and was giving anti fungal and steroid cream. In those two visits i was only given pabst smears (ik they do not test for yeast:( )that came back negative, but upon my third visit, the doctor confirmed with me that it is not a yeast infection and that it is eczema. \n\nmost things that cause an eczema flare i have already been mindful of in terms of hygiene, cotton underwear, moisturizing, sleeping w out underwear etc.\n\n\ni think i might have ls. i have whitish/pale patches/streaks lining my innerlabia. i did not bring the discoloration to my gynecologist just because i have had a bad experience with my first one, but she made a quick comment saying there is discoloration. i was unsure if it was because of the redness from irritation or what i think is the white patches. \n\nalso experiencing pressure in my bladder area :/  and the urge to pee, but nothing happens, especially at night. i do drink a lot of water, usually more than 80 ounces but it is becoming very noticeable and annoying. i am constantly feeling weird down there so i wonder if it is more psychological idk:( basically i just feel the need to use the bathroom and try to go multiple times in the night sometimes . HOWEVWR these issues do not feel as pressing as my suspicion with ls\n\nso i guess my question has anyone been misdiagnosed with eczema? any issues with urge to pee? i made a post on this sub on my main account but i deleted it... i reposted my original text on this accounts page. thanks everyone. i have a dermatologist appt on tuesday. i have a irrational fear that like i am being dramatic and idk weird for going to the dermatologist if it is not an serious skin issue( even though i am so uncomfortable :( ! ).... i know this i just wrong but i guess it is a weird result of anxiety ... also been trying to talk to my partner and mom and sister that this kind of affect my mental health :( having to deal with the itching and then having to open up to doctors and the anxiety about my issue being undiagnosed bc i feel like if it is eczema will i have to deal with it forever it does not seem togo away:( You are not being dramatic, anyone who tells you that is gaslighting you. When you go to the derm, be very clear about what treatments you have gotten, everything you have experienced, the duration, the treatment and its effectiveness etc etc. And if they come to an inconclusive result, or you feel like its a possible misdiagnosis, you have every right to ask for a biopsy.\n\nGood luck- LS is also a lifetime deal, but with a prescription it is been easily manageable and a derm really pointed me in the right direction!", "Will I be able to have a normal sex life? I have just been diagnosed and I am absolutely gutted. I am only 19 and I feel like my sex life is over before it is truly been able to begin. Does anyone manage to have a normal sex life with this? I think it would depend whether treatment helps you and what your main symptoms are, how much scarring you have Apparently I caught it early Do your symptoms prevent you from having sex? It depends on where the scarring is. Does it prevent penetration? Does it affect sexual pleasure (my scarring is over my clitoris). I have a bit of scarring over my clitoris that I am going to try and get fixed next time I speak to my gyno. I have only just been diagnosed and prior to this I was not having regular sex. I did tear badly the last time I had sex though but I do not think there was any scarring. I am just scared that going forward, sex is going to get worse. I would not worry about it just yet \u2014 see if you can talk to a specialist! It took me a while to find one. Will do! My doctor recommended vaginal dilators for painful sex I caught mine early and I had the classic white plus some tearing/pain upon insert. It is been a year since I got diagnosed and I am much more controlled now! It was devastating when I learned about it but with clob I know I can manage it. Yes! I know it is so scary and seems like the end of the world at the start when you Google it and things are sore etc.. But now you have got a diagnosis you will have the right stuff to be able to stop flares. You will learn to see the signs and get the cream on before it gets bad. I have told multiple partners about it and they have all understood - learn to state your needs if you are struggling with it, and there is other ways to have fun when the flares maybe put a particular area out of action. \nJust before I was diagnosed I was finding sex too painful to have, and I just never felt totally comfortable. I felt like my sex life was over at 20 and that I would never be able to have a good sex life again. Since then I have had many many many fun great sexy times and been in long term relationships and most of the time I forget I even have it. Massively improved with the steroid creams. It will be OK! Thanks for letting me know! I will look into them! You absolutely will. It is early days now and the management of it will enable you to have days where you are on a good day and days where perhaps it is not so good. But the point here is those good days will be a green light and it should hopefully allow you to enjoy sex and not worry. You will probably have a before and after routine that will help and honestly I absolutely promise you, this stuff will become second nature to you and you will be so programmed to it you will not contemplate it. It gets better. I promise you.\n\nHang in there, you have got your whole life to enjoy intimacy with a partner, right now it is about learning to adapt. All the best to you! Thank you! I really appreciate it! My doc recommended me to have a active sexlife and I do not have any problems with that! \u2014&gt; Silicone lubrifiant Thank you so much, hearing things like this really helps! That is reassuring to hear! Fantastic! Will definitely be purchasing some! Good, I am glad! I did not have reddit when I found out, felt like the only person in the world to have this thing and I know how dire your internal thought process can get when left to its own catastrophising devices.\nIt is good to have a community of people who understand, but also be mindful that a lot of people who post in places like this will be on the worse end of the spectrum if they are posting about it. It might give you a fright and assume that the really hard times people are having is the norm. I think that is maybe not the case, but rather the people who have milder symptoms just have little reason to post.\nOne last thing, I am trying to reassure you that this is not the end, but one thing I want to warn you about is less the LS itself but more just getting medical practitioners to take you seriously. It is not just with LS, but women with health complaints are frequently taken less seriously than men. ESPECIALLY things that affect sex life. If you feel something needs looked at, and you feel something is important, you stick to your guns and insist they take you seriously. I had a health professional tell me if I could orgasm it was fine that my clitoral hood was slightly fused. I was younger and did not push back but now I really feel like I was palmed off there. You know your body best and your wants and needs are as important as any man's. I doubt the same Dr would have told a man it was fine if his foreskin was fused.\nAsides from that, it is an auto immune condition and so it would not do any harm to start learning about ways to boost your immune system. Idk if there is science to back it up, but anecdotally, I found that if I drank kefir and cut down on sugar and ate more nutritious varied foods that were good for gut health that I had less flares. Covid has messed that up haha my diet is pretty sugary again but I am planning to get back on that horse soon.\n\nHope you are going to feel less panicked about it soon. You are not alone! It does feel not so scary in time :) Hi, I am not OP, but your comment was really comforting to read! I am 22 and was just diagnosed with LS, and I have never been more overwhelmed. Right now, I have been on and off clobetasol for less than 3 months (initial doctor did not prescribe it correctly) and my current doctor has me doing it once a day for 3 more months. I have not had significant symptom reduction, and I guess my main question is, do the symptoms ever go away? Like will I be fully comfortable ever again or will that slight itch always persist? How long did it take you to have your condition under control? Ty", "Does this look like LS?  It is too hard to tell, but I would recommend seeing a doctor about it if you are worried. Any discomfort/horrible itchiness? My LS is primarily on the vulva so mine does not look like this at all. This could just be a rash or allergic reaction to the detergent you use to wash your underwear. I was also diagnosed visually with LS on my vulva \u2014 but i do not have any white patches. I changed my detergent 3 weeks ago and still no luck! I am curious to know if you wear underwear when you sleep with ointment? I feel like this started when I started using CLOBETASOL and wearing underwear to sleep. (I did not prior to treatment and I think it was fine then? Hard to remember.) Thanks for your comment! \ud83d\ude0a I do not wear underwear while sleeping unless I am on my period. Make sure your underwear is cotton or a natural fibre like bamboo as well because I used to wear only lacy underwear and found almost all my symptoms went away when I stopped wearing them It might be the ointment that is irritating you as well. Good luck \u263a\ufe0f Thank you for sharing! I only wear cotton.", "M29, medication for LS not working Hi all,\n\nA year ago i noted a small white line on the shaft. After it did not change (not bigger, not smaller) for half a year i went to my GP. Het noted it was LS. At this point i didn 'thave any pain. I started with a clobetasol treatment. But when i used the clobetasol for lesser days (3-4 a week) there was a small itch. He referred me to a derm.\n\nI started again with a longer clobetasol scheme (4 week 6 days, 4 weeks 4 days, 4 weeks 3 days). The spot did not change but also did not got bigger. When i got to the 3 days the surroundings began getting red. I went back and was prescribed protopic.\n\nAt the moment i am using the protopic (every day) with clobetasol (twice a week) for two months. It felt good at the beginning. I also tried to pull the foreskin back daily for some hours, this seems to reduce the LS spot. But at the moment the LS scar is slightly getting bigger and is see a small light white spot on the glans. I hope this is no LS but i am afraid it can be.\n\nDoes it happen that LS appears on the glans without a physical connection to the LS spot already on the penis?\n\nAnd does anyone have had the same situation that both protopic and clobetasol did not really work? Hoe do you managed the LS from getting larger.\n\nTo be honest. I am young and single and the LS is mentally kind of hard for me, so i am scared that i will end up with one big LS thing hanging down there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance ! Yea I did not have any creams that worked (17M) and it is been mentally hard for me also. I got circumcised about 3 weeks ago to alleviate the effects of LS and it seemed to have worked very well since the itching/occasional pain is no longer present. It is very upsetting but also a little relieving considering I look close to normal now down there compared to before. My confidence is a little better. I lost about 90% of my affected area but some is left on the head, but hopefully it will not spread since creams are not very helpful.\n\nHope this helps. Thanks you for your message.\n\nI am sorry it happens to you at such a young age. It sounds hopefull. Tomorrow i will call my derm te replace teh appointment to an earlier day. I am still scared, mainly because i also noted some big white patches on the knees and a gray/whitis region around my asshole. Both were not present at my last check 2 months back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will  suggest a circ at the derm, hopse she thinks it'l help ! Hi there! I am similar age, female. I was diagnosed 3 years ago when I experienced a bad flare. After a year of treatment things were looking so good it seemed to be in remission and I got to go  down to clobetasol 1x per week. However, these past six months it is been back with a vengeance. I have had rapid changes with fusing over my clit and loss of labia minora, with a seemingly constant irritation. At this point I do feel like the clobetasol is not working and I am going to tell that to my doc at my next appt. \n\nI do not have any great advice but wanted to let you know you are not alone. When I get upset I remind myself that I will have this for life, and I will probably have ups and downs forever. It reminds me that this rough patch should not last forever and makes me look forward to someday hopefully feeling as good as I did a year ago.", "PRP Theres been a lot of work around PRP for LS and remember seeing a study that this was done pretty successfully (if you google it you can see it)\n\nWhat do you guys think of this?\n\nAnnoyingly ive seen so many studies being done and some saying there are cures, e.g the co2 laser study said cure percentage was very high, and nothing has happenef since that.\n\nI even asked the top genital dermatologist in the UK (bunker) about these other methods (co2, stem cell and PRP) and his answer is that there is a lot of rubbish out there It is frustrating. So many options but out of reach from where I live in Georgia, US. The internist I see said no new treatment is reliable yet and to wait. \n\nMore importantly, we know your frustration, but we can all get through this.

I had lesions that color when I was biopsied and diagnosed. (I have also had the white vitiligo looking lesions) Nice pussy If you have a small dick, evidenced by the subreddits you are active in, why would you comment on someone else\u2019s genitals when they clearly do not want you to? Surely you can understand that. Are you trying to upset people because you feel so worthless due to your own genitals? Your comment history is depressing as fuck and I feel like I need a shower now.", "Is salt water going to irritate me? I am going on vacation in July and I am worried the ocean water is going to make me flare up. I have been using a cream for a month now and I have not had any symptoms which is AMAZING and I am freaking out that the ocean water, food, and humidity is going to make me flare up. Does anyone have experience with this or can tell me what I should do to help prevent it?  I have not been to the beach in ages, but I go swimming in a chlorinated pool. Here is what I do: make sure you have put the medicine on recently and let it soak in. Then put a barrier cream on like epaderm. Try not to stay in a wet swimsuit too long, use your meds after everything, and you should be okay :)  What is epaderm? Is that something I can buy over the counter? The swim suit is going to be an issue, were staying on isla mujeres and will be on the beach practically all day every day, do you think sitting in the sun would help dry my bikini faster and it will be okay? Or should I try to get out of my bikini asap, shower, and just try to avoid the water for the rest of the day.  Epaderm is a barrier cream that you can get online or otc. As long as it dries quickly I think it should be okay. You just dont want wet, uncomfy fabric near your lady bits, that is all. Good luck! I just spent a week on the beach, myself. Yay vacations!\n\nI have never had a problem with salt water. Honestly, I think it might do more good than harm. My kids\u2019 eczema always clears up on ocean trips too.  It is never caused me problems. \n\nLike others said, do not sit around in a wet suit. Do not throw clothes on over damp bottoms for convenience. Ventilate. I went commando under maxi dresses for more than a year while things were settling down. (Nobody knew (AFAIK) til my three year old went under my dress at Starbucks ... and then pulled it up over his head. Surprise, everybody!)  \n\nI also travel with two suits for beach trips now. If one is still damp and we are not going straight into the water, but instead grabbing breakfast or driving to find a beach or whatever ... I put on the dry suit and a dress over top.  It took me ten years to realize that, by god, I could afford a second swimsuit and I was worth it. That second suit and always having one dry has made a huge difference. \n\nJust bring the steroid and hit it if you have any sign of a problem.  Otherwise no reason to worry. Have a great trip! Thank you so much! I am definitely taking several bottoms with me so I always have a dry pair and I think I am just taking beach cover ups so that will help prevent friction (I am going to Mexico and it is terribly hot and humid so I am trying to avoid underwear and shorts) and my suitcase will be a lot lighter haha. This is also random, but have you ever had your period on a beach vacation? If so how did you handle that? Mexico has bathrooms but you have to pay to use public ones and 99 percent of the time, they do not have trashcans and I do not know how I am going to dispose of my used tampon other than (i know this is totally gross) to take a ziplock bag with me and dispose it into that and hide it in the bottom of my bag until I am back at the resort.  I do not know if it will make you flare up, but I tend to feel better when going in really salty water (like even 7% salt). It does not itch while in there and I find it is beneficial, but not very. Humidity is a different thing though, summers are the worst for me. I did not have a flare up luckily but I have it worse during winter months because I am wearing extra layers and I seem to sweat more from pants than summer time with shorts. Yeah winter sweat is the worst :( I\u2018m kind of thankful there is a reddit for this mess, I just got the diagnosis today... Aw! I am sorry! :( how are you feeling about it?  Well it is good to have a diagnosis obviously, but the possible outcomes scare me. It seems that I have had it for the past 6 years, but my tissue still seems to be fine, it is mostly the bad skin I got. My doctor told me to use the creams she prescribed religiously. Thankfully that is not a problem, I am religious about my skincare anyway - every evening I shower, peel, moisturize etc. - now I have one more area to take care of, so that will fit nicely into the beauty routine. Trying to take it with humor :) - pm me if you want, I do not want to hijack the thread for personal discussions:)", "Tired and annoyed I am so frustrated from these doctors... I really am no one knows what they are doing honestly I should become a doctor it is the biggest scam in the world Well if you think you have LS please see a dermatologist , this is a autoimmune skin disorder so call and ask if they have a dermatologist with LS patients. What have they treated you with? What is and is not working? We cannot help without information.", "HELP! Is this a flare up??? Hi it is me again! Sorry for a second post but I am not sure who else to ask... it is a bit TMI \n\nI started clob about two weeks ago and last week I may or may not have had my clitoris rubbed too hard during sex and it was just downhill from there. It was  definitely peeling and raw and I put clob on it but it was not helping.\n\nIt is definitely it raw but it is itchy, just red and I can pinpoint the problem. Clob is not working because I am still itchy... and the bottom area near the vagina looks like skin is maybe growing back but not itchy there and same with the clitoris. Is this considered a flare up or should I just contact my gyno or dermatologist? It was my dermatologist who told me it could be LS but it is also a vagina/clitoris issue... \n\nIs it normal to have my clitoris be so red and \u201cswollen\u201d and so damn itchy??? The folds of labia majora and minora up top near the clitoris is also slightly itchy and slightly red. Also the clitoral hood under side is just peeling or has white stuff and it are not cause I am not clean. I had this issue back in 2020 one time and I was not sure and it was assumed I had a yeast infection or BV. The PA prescribed me some BV gel to put on the clitoris. \n\nSorry I went on a tangent but can someone give me some advice? Has this happened to you? Do I keep putting clob on it? I would give your clit a break/breather and stop the clob for a couple days so your skin can heal.", "Will I ever enjoy sex again? Guys I am so depressed. My marriage is really being affected by this curse. Not to mention my self esteem and overall mental health. It is been 6 months since I have had pleasurable sex. Even when I am not in a flare up and it does not hurt, I just do not have sensation. So it sucks for me that I may never orgasm again, but subjecting my husband to sexual deprivation is not going to end well. When I do have sex with him it always ends in tears. Please tell me this will not be the rest of my life. I am a 31 yo female and I have not had a biopsy yet so no official diagnosis but my doctor and I are fairly certain it is LS. I cannot say for sure, but I know that having medicine should help these symptoms. Having lube should also help. \n\nLet me see if I got that right. You mainly orgasm through penetrative sex? And you have not been giving each other orgasms in any other way? If nothing else, hand jobs and blow jobs are your best friends right now until you can see about getting medication.  \n\nI am really sorry you got to this point of being so frustrated. I really hope that you will be able to find things to help you enjoy your sex life again! I think a diagnosis could help more than you think. I am a man with LS so i am not sure if it applies to women but my situation has greatly improved over the course of 3 years. \n\n1st year. No sex at all. Erections are painful as fuck\n\n2nd year. A bit lil bit of sex but still painful and that ''chaffing/burning'' sensation makes it unpleasant\n\n3rd year. Chaffing/burning sensation is almost 100% gone. Sex is pleasurable again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have used very little cortisone. Only a month here and there between 2017 and 2018. But my dermatologist told me to hydrate my penis often. Let me tell you that i am keeping it hydrated H24. I am applying a first aid cream constantly, all the time 4-5 times a day. Even when I go out I carry my tube of cream. I think it is starting to pay off...\n\ngood luck! Hey that is awesome to hear you have had positive results! Hey. I am so sorry to hear this. I have had LS for 7 years. Has your doctor given you any medication? It is best to try and see an LS specialist. They can give you a clear diagnosis and medication to help. I am on a topical corticoid steroid that I only have to use when I have a flare-up now. It gets better. It is also important that you communicate with your husband. Worse case if the steroids do not work there are laser and stem cell treatments that have gotten results.\n\nIf you listen to podcasts I just dropped an episode discussing this very subject. I hope this helps. Glad to see people talking about LS more recently. I have had a hard time finding timely updates/comments/blogs. Sorry this is so long but here is what I have learned over the years:\n\nLS is believed to be an autoimmune disorder. I have it along with scalp psoriasis and (dormant) vitiligo. I was diagnosed at maybe 22 or 23, but probably had it since 20 or 21. I am now a 29yo (female).\n\nKnowing the diagnosis was relieving in itself knowing that I was not crazy or making it up. I had all the symptoms... What felt like constant, intense itching, peeling &amp; white skin, burning (and I mean it felt like my labias were on fire) sensation during sex, tearing, sometimes bleeding by the clitoris. I was terrified. I was in a relationship and sex did not feel good. I was scared it could be an STD or something. Since getting the diagnosis, I do not think there has been a single day that I do not think about it. It was another contributor for my severe depression (who could love someone with a fucked up vagina?). \n\nBut it got better. Especially after I left my toxic ex lol I thought dryness was a symptom of LS (and may be for some), but come to find out everything is working well down there with my current man that I am in love with! (Again, this is not the case for everyone, but it was a HUGE relief for me. Open communication is everything.)\n\nMy treatment (doctor prescribed): clobetasol steroid cream - rubbing small amt on affected area twice daily during a bad flare up for 2 weeks, then once daily for a week, then every other day, then just maintenance dosages. My Gyno just gave me another cream to try in place of the steroid to give my skin a break - Tacrolimus ointment (used most commonly for eczma, which is also an autoimmune disorder fyi). It burned (as the doc said it would) the first few days, but now it does help relieve and I like that it is more of a thick wax. I also use an estrogen cream every so often (topically). They say it is supposed to help the skin keep its plump and flexibility. It is also used if the vaginal opening is narrowing (from what I have read). My vagina is no longer narrowing so I have discontinued using estrogen in fears it will disfigure my vagina (do not want the hole getting too big now lol). Finally, I overly use coconut oil. Like daily. All over. You can use any other natural oil, like olive or vegetable, as well, but since I cook with those that freaks me out a little haha I have read that keeping it moisturized is really important, so I am trying to use it even more than before. I have read recently about ppl using vaseline and aloe, and I am thinking about giving that a try.\n\nSex help: LUBE. Lube is your friend. Do NOT buy the stuff in the store. Chemicals are not your friend. Use the coconut oil. It feels amazing and does not dry up like most lubes. My Gyno actually told me when my vagina was narrowing (at the very beginning of my diagnosis) to increase sex to help keep it open. Again, just like with anal, use the lube! Also, foreplay is so important with us LS people so things are enjoyable for us. It is better when your body is ready to go. But not too much since we cannot have as long of sessions (too much friction is bad).\n\nOther things: \nGo see an internist. Get your hormones and thyroid tested. If you are on birth control, take one with estrogen. I am currently trying out various vitamins that say they help with inflammation &amp; CBD oil \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f worth a try?\n\nDiet. I fully believe diet is a huge factor in contributing to autoimmune disorders (or at least the flare ups/maintaining symptoms). There is a lot of research on the positive correlation btwn autoimmune being caused by constant bodily inflammation (which is caused by a leaky gut), which is caused by bad diet. When I cut out added sugars (it is in EVRYTHING, check your labels and look for hidden sugar ingredients, unless it is honey or fruit) and processed foods (anything that comes from the middle of the grocery store or is packaged), I feel SO much better in every way. I also notice when I start eating like shit again all my symptoms flair up (including psoriasis). I also have been eating plain Greek yogurt (and add my own fruit &amp; local honey) every day to help with yeast infections (maybe the coconut oil or I might just be especially prone to them ).Ps... They also link inflammation with depression!\n\nRandom tips: cotton undies are your friend. I still wear jeans and leggings but try to be more free when home ( I also like wearing underwear to bed bc I feel it helps keep things moist down there). Do not use any sort of soap. Just water and your hand is plenty to clean down there (and never douche. Ever. You are getting rid of all the good bacteria when you do that). Occasionally I use Cetaphil gentle cleanser on my face and will use it down there during my period. Beware of what you use on your head as it will go down your body to your genitals. Use non-scented laundry detergent (at the very least use it for your undies). I just read to not use a dryer sheet (even unscented) for your underwear loads, so I am going to try that next. I prefer Charmin ultrastrong or the really cheap toilet paper. The less powdery residue that comes off the TP the better. I also just pat dry my front and do not wipe except the bottom anymore.\n\nLS has severely affected my mental health, which is why I have scoured the internet trying to find anything and everything I can do to help improve my condition. There is hope! It does take effort, however! Hope this helps! What kind of \"first aid cream\"? Like a triple antibiotic? I use this one. It is just a hydrating cream with vitamin E. (\n\nI have been comfortable for more than a year using that 3-4 times a day.", "Informational Series on LS  Hey everyone,\n\nIn addition to my blog, I have started a YouTube Channel for The Lost Labia Chronicles. I focus on disseminating\u00a0evidence-based information and also touch heavily on mental health and LS and sexual health and LS. If that sounds like something that would be helpful for you, please check out my YouTube and subscribe here:\u00a0 (\n\nIf you want more details on what I will discuss on my channel, check out my welcome video here:\u00a0\n\nIf you want to also check out my blog, check out  and subscribe to the blog at  This series is great. Thank you so much for doing this! I have listened to a few episodes and learned a lot. Can you please do an episode on male LS? It is really hard to find information on male LS. Thank you so much for watching. I will do content on male LS in the future, however, I will need to ask that you be patient as I would need to really deep dive into the literature and that will take some time as I have a full time job, plus volunteer for a nonprofit, do my blog, The channel, etc. but I will absolutely research this and put together some content down the line! Male LS is definitely something that needs more attention. Thank you!!! Much appreciated :)", "Flare up Hey everyone I was diagnosed 2 years ago with LS at 29 years F. I have had the worst flare up ever these last 2 months that will not go away. My ointment is not working this time does anyone have any suggestions thanks Any chance it is a yeast infection? Might try a course of antifungal creams. \n\nSometimes I think it can be hard to tell the difference between a yeast infection and a flare right up until my skin rips in half - that is a flare. If you are not tearing open or bright white and blue colored, might be yeast. Thank you I actually just got off the phone with the Dr and she is going to treat me for yeast infection as we as increase dose of creams Emuaid cream helps, Hyaluronic acid topical helps and a new treatment called the Mona Lisa laser I have tried emuaid its not working this time round Try the other suggestions. Helped me Thank you I definitely will Hey! I am not at my PC right now, but I have got a write up in my post history about how I eliminated about 90% of my LS. Now it only flares up if I have sex 3x a day.\n\nYou are welcome to dig thru my post history or I can look later... If you want to comment on this post in like 4 hours then I can remember to dig it up for you\n\n\nEdit:\n\nFound it!\n\n i am having one too. just started a few days ago. do baths bother you? i soak in borax from time to time", "Biopsy Question - Thank you I have had 1 doctor and 1 dermatologist tell me I have lichen sclerosis as I have major itching and silvery shiny skin in my vaginal/anal area. My family doctor wants me to ask the dermatologist for a biopsy as I was also recently diagnosed with colitis (ah yes auto immune is so fun). ANYWAYS. My question is - do I have to be having an active flare up to show a positive biopsy result??\n\nI go to the dermatologist tomorrow \ud83d\udc4c Nope, you do not have to have an active flare to have a biopsy. Many folks are actually asymptomatic when they get biopsied. The only caveat is IF you are already treating with steroids, you should stop at least 2 weeks prior to the biopsy, as they can mask a positive LS reading in pathology. Good luck tomorrow. The more active the disease is in the tissue the easier it will be to diagnose.  Using topical steroids prior to the biopsy can sometimes mask the symptoms of the disease and make the biopsy tissue more difficult to diagnose.  That being said, if you have ruled out fulgal and bacterial factors, then whatever you are left with will probably be treated the same way. Topical steroids like clobetasol are used for lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, vitiligo, poison oak, and a pretty long list of things, so doing a biopsy just to try and determine whether its lichen sclerosus or lichen planus or vitilogo is a bit pointless since they are all treated basically the same way. Definitely. I think my doctor wants the biopsy confirmation as it can increase risk of cancers, which run in the family and with colitis my chances increase as well. I think she is just trying to be on too and have clear cut answers.\n\nIt is frustrating too that the steroids can cause their own set of issues. Feels like you cannot win.\n\nThank you for the reply. Appreciate finding this community. Okay that is really good to know. Thank you so much!  Ya, who wants to use a topical steroid with side effects that are the same as some of the symptoms you already have - like thinning of skin, irritation to skin, decreased sex drive, etc.. I decided to try a simple salve that I made from some medicinal plants at home before getting into using steroids and my home made treatment worked great for me. Never touched the steroids and All my symptoms are completely resolved.  Its as if I never even had the disease now.", "Eczema or lichen sclerosus? So I had a biopsy done a few months ago. I just got a call back from the nurse saying the results are in, but they need to be discussed with the colposcopy doctor. She said it did not look like LS, but more like eczema. Has anyone else had this result? Could eczema as a result be early stage LS? As I do have itching if the Vulva, perineum, anus and a line between my buttcrack. \n\nI am a little confused and scared to be misdiagnosed, even if it is by a biopsy. I am scared of progression. I do not have any white patches, and I know lots of people do not. I got a biopsy done one side was eczema and the other side was LS Interesting. I had 2 spots done. One by my opening and one higher up on the vulvar skin. Do you have white patches? Yes I did and my skin was really thin like tissue paper when I was diagnosed over 12 years ago by my plastic surgeon. Thanks for sharing! Your very welcome", "Thyroid problems and LS I am going in for a biopsy in about a week for what my gynocologist \u201chighly suspects\u201d is LS. I have had a somewhat crazy few months all kicked off by a random bout of hyperthyroidism. I have multiple autoimmune diseases\u2014lupus, RA, and hashimotos\u2014 I have obviously done my googling on LS and I have read some articles positing the link between thyroid antibodies and LS. I am curious if anyone else has Hashi\u2019s or any other thyroid issues and have found their LS to flare in conjunction? IDK for me. Many many women in another online group I follow do. Hugs! I also have hashimoto hypothyroidism. I was diagnosed at 22 and had LS at 28. To me there is a link between the 2 since it is all autoimmune disease. There is a connexion between these diseases: the immune system fights the wrong cells and fight it is owns cells... I had thyroid cancer at age 32 (fixed by removing the thyroid), and diagnosed with LS at age 5. So, yup. I have suspected adrenal issues, which seems to me to be adjacent? Getting tested soon, along with tests for low estrogen, so should hopefully get a clearer picture. Hyperthyroiditis @ 26 to Hyperthyroid to Remission and Hashimotos\u2026..recently diagnosed with LS at 35 but suspect I have had it since I was a child. I was always complaining about burning and discomfort since about age 5. I think if you are susceptible to autoimmune diseases, you are just susceptible to all of them. I had Graves\u2019 disease flare 4 years ago, been in remission from Graves for 2 years and i just developed LS 6 months ago. So idk, \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it sucks Yes!! And this appeared 4-5 months before i was diagnosed with Hashimoto and hypothyroidism. I have hypothyroidism and was diagnosed with LS 1.5 years ago!", "Covid &amp; LS Has anyone been diagnosed with LS after having Covid? Do not know of any connection just wondering. Mine started two weeks after the Pfizer 1st shot. But I have history, I was circumcised when I was 10 years old probably because of LS (I am not sure because I do not have any documents from that time and my mom is deceased, so I cannot ask her)  I dont think there is much hope of answering this question without a proper scientific study. Many people are unlikely to even know whether they had Covid (if they were asymptomatic, had a mild case, or didnt get tested). It is an interesting question but you are more likely to get misled by individual responses rather than get an accurate answer. If it were related in some way the first indication would be an overall increase in diagnoses since the onset of the pandemic (and even that data may be delayed by backlogs). True, thanks Mine started a couple of weeks after I got the moderna vaccine Mine started about a month after I got the 2nd Pfizer dose. However, I was also going through a lot of stress with work at the time, so I think it may just be a coincidence.", "3 unexpected things I learned from compulsive checking  Hi folks!\n\nI have a new YouTube video up today for those that are interested. In this video, I discuss 3 key lessons I learned from my experience with compulsive checking. Briefly, those are:\n\n1. Your experience in the medical system will impact your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\n2. Health anxiety is real.\n\n3. Your vulva will never look exactly the same &amp; why this is important.\n\nI elaborate on each of these and I think there are some important pieces in there, so let me know what you think!\n\nCheck it out here: (", "Does this sound like lichen I have had bad itching around my vulva for years, docs said it is eczema, I was given hydrocortisone and it relieved it for a bit but never got rid of it. \n\nI do not have any white patches, I do have red patches though and you can tell my skin is irritated, it is like 2 symmetrical red patches on both sides of my vulva. Itching gets worse when I am walking or sitting down in jeans or tight clothes, also when I am stressed out It gets worse \n\nAt this point it is really getting me down, I guess I just need to go back to the docs but I would be grateful for any thoughts Poor thing. That is so frustrating. \nYes, go back to the doctor for a biopsy. You do not always have white plaques when you have LS. This was my case Thanks for the reply, good to keep reminding myself I am not alone in this ! (: You are not alone I had only severe itching, no white patches. Tell them you want a biopsy, and good luck. That is what mine was like for four years before the white showed up and when it did it was unmistakable. I did actually have a biopsy years ago but it was inconclusive. When the white came they decided not to do another cause it was pretty clear just by looking. Finally got my diagnosis confirmed. \n\nSorry you are suffering. The steroid creams help control, but if it keeps coming back and you have tested negative for everything else, then lichen of some sort could be the only explanation. It is important to keep treating LS indefinitely to prevent tissue damage. Talk to your doc about diagnosis, what a  safe level of steroid cream maintenance is to prevent systemic absorption and cancer screening. I have my followup next week and will be asking the same things even though we already talked about some of them last time. Yeah I am going to ASAP, thanks so much Thanks for your detailed reply, I have actually noticed a little scaly light patch which looks different to the redness so it is looking that way", "My 9 year old daughter was diagnosed today + question at the end *TLDR at the bottom*\n\nHi you kind people in the LS forum, I am back with an update about my child and like the last time, I apologize for any grammar since English is my second language. \n\nAbout a month ago I wrote a post in here about my 9 year old daughter who I suspected had LS even though our family doctors had repeatedly diagnosed it as nothing but yeast (ofc). \n\nAfter having pushed several times because I was not accepting the yeast- answer, one of our family doctors referred my daughter to the pediatric department of surgery at the biggest hospital in our country (we live in Scandinavia).\n\nAt the pediatric department of surgery my daughter was not examined properly, so instead I wanted a LS specialist to take a look.\n\nThe plan for my daughter was then to get referred to a vulvar clinic where she was supposed to be examined by a gyno specializing in LS, but I ended up accepting the doctor\u2019s recommendations for the dermatology department at another hospital and today was the day of my daughter\u2019s appointment and we finally got an answer. \n\nThe dermatologist examined my daughter and almost instantly diagnosed her with lichen sclerosus, there was no doubt she said. \n\nShe then said that she would always recommend a biopsy for the the child\u2019s journal since \u201cno one would believe my daughter in 20 years when she says that she had LS as a child\u201d (I do not know what she meant by that?), but said it was not necessary since she could diagnose her on sight.\n\nIn contrary to the other doctor who just wanted to do a biopsy without giving her a proper examination first, I could tell that the dermatologist knew exactly what she was looking at. \n\nI must admit though that as soon as I heard the diagnosis I felt like I was going to faint, even though I had done all the research and pushed for my daughter to get a diagnosis (especially after having read all of your stories of getting misdiagnosed, delayed diagnosis etc\ud83d\udc94\u2764\ufe0f), because in an instant my daughter went from being a little girl to suddenly being a little girl with an autoimmune disease. \n\nThe dermatologist on the other hand told me to take it easy and said that they have great results when treating children for LS and yes it can be a lifelong condition but it is very manageable she said, we just need to start the treatment. \n\nI have cried a lot today but now I am determined to push through because my baby needs normalcy now that we finally have a diagnosis. \n\nShe is the most amazing little sensitive smart girl and she is a trooper (bought her a huge LEGO set and she is already playing with it and telling jokes as if nothing had happened\u2764\ufe0f), and we will learn new ways and go through the flare ups together. \n\nTLDR: My 9 year old daughter was diagnosed with LS today. \n\nNow for the treatment: \nThe dermatologist wrote this plan for her and I am going to the pharmacy tomorrow to get the medication. \n\nI asked the doctor about clob (dermovat in Europe) but the doctor said that she would never give a grade 4 steroid cream to a child, so she prescribed Synalar (fluocinolone acetonide) cream which is a grade 3 and with this regimen: \n_________________________________________\n\nWeek 1 + 2: once a day \nWeek 3 + 4: three times a week (MWF)\nWeek 5 + 6: twice a week \nWeek 7 and for maintenance onwards: once a week\n_________________________________________\n\n*I completely trust the doctor but since you all amazing people live with LS, does this regimen look okay?*\n\nBecause when I google Synalar for Lichen Sclerosus nothing shows up except it being used for oral Lichen Planus, so does anyone have any experience with this steroid for LS? \n\nI know adults are given a grade 4 but just wanted to ask, maybe some of you use this for maintenance? I hope it is strong enough to heal my baby!\n\nThank you so much in advance and thank you again for the amazing people who answered me on my last post, you truly helped me with my anxiety\u2764\ufe0f\n\nAnxious mama I am glad you got an answer, I remember your last post. The doctor is right as far as this being manageable! It is VERY manageable, especially when you are educated. I cannot comment on the Rx bc I have personally never heard of it, but the regimen looks appropriate and like most adults\u2019 clobetasol regimen. I am not familiar with the medication but this sounds like a good schedule for a steroid (and I am happy they did not jump straight to clob at such a young age). If I were you, I would go ahead and start on this regimen and see how things go. \n\nYou should probably find a way to track her symptoms. This will be the best way to know if the treatment is working or causing any side effects.  Make sure she has the language to talk accurately about her anatomy and pain or itching (you sound like a very attentive parent so this is probably already the case). Personally I track my symptoms and treatments in an app called Bearable, but find whatever works best for you. \n\nIf you do not yet know about Cushing's Syndrome, you should look it up online and learn about the symptoms. Although it is quite rare, it is possible for topical steroids to cause Cushing's Syndrome, so you will want to be able to recognize it and call your doctor if it happens. There are non-steroid treatment options if this does occur.\n\nMake sure that you have a moisturizer for her to apply when she is not using the medication. Aquaphor healing ointment and coconut oil are both good options. Only cotton underwear, no scented laundry detergent, no bubble baths, etc. Hopefully your doctor gave you good info about home management, and you have also got the community here to ask questions if you need to. \n\nYou are awesome and should be so proud of yourself for advocating for your daughter in the face of an ignorant medical system. You are giving her the best possible chance to heal and live a normal healthy life. I wish my mother had shown half the care and tenacity that you are showing. Best of luck. I am so sorry to hear about your child. \nI believe I have had this pre teen and have been diagnosed and using betamethasone for last 18 months or so. I dont know the grade but it is weaker than clobetasol.\nIt is worked well, removing the thick white scar tissue and adhesions. I hope this helps.\nI know my experience may not directly relate, I am 72 yr old man. I know part of my issue was urine trapped under my foreskin. \nWell done pushing for the right diagnosis and treatment for her. &gt;She then said that she would always recommend a biopsy for the the child\u2019s journal since \u201cno one would believe my daughter in 20 years when she says that she had LS as a child\u201d (I do not know what she meant by that?), but said it was not necessary since she could diagnose her on sight.\n\n\n\nYou have a good doctor there.  She understands that others in her field can be dismissive of unusual diagnoses, particularly when there is no definitive test (such as the biopsy) to confirm it.  The doctor is saying that when your daughter is older, other doctors are not likely to believe she was correctly diagnosed with LS as a child because it is a very unusual diagnosis for a child, so recommends the biopsy to confirm her diagnosis so that her future health care practitioners will not dismiss her unusual diagnosis as having been faulty.\n\n\n\nI am experiencing something similar right now.  I have a doctor who dismisses much of my experience, telling me it is \"not possible\" and that my previous diagnoses were just wrong.  This is, unfortunately, common for those of us with unusual diagnoses so whenever we can get a definitive test, it is a good idea to have that proof.", "Breastfeeding and birth Hi everyone. I am half way through my pregnancy and it has been the best thing for my lichen sclerosis, completely in remission !  My ob thinks that I can have a normal vaginal delivery, and I want to trust him but I am also very frightened of causing any trauma to that area. Also, I have read that symptoms can get worse once breastfeeding due to low estrogen levels. Does anyone have any suggestions to prevent bad flare ups during breastfeeding ? Did your doctor prescribe estrogen creams ? I plan to see my gyno and discuss with him options for after birth, but would like to have as much info as possible. Any advice is appreciated So happy for you!\n\nI had a normal vaginal delivery and did not have extra problems while breastfeeding. I did not need an estrogen. I used a less-potent steroid a couple of times throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding, and that nipped anything in the bud. \n\nAnecdotal, of course, but it seems like as long as your tissue is all healthy and happy at the time, delivery is not specifically a problem. Breastfeeding and hormones ... that will all be individual and you have to wait and see. \n\nCannot recommend a warm water bidet enough. They will give you a water bottle to rinse with, but that is cold unless you fill it with warm water each time you go to the bathroom. If you can get electrical into the bathroom ... a bidet is just the absolute best. I did not breastfeed and had a c section but i feel like my symptoms have not returned to what they were and I stayed in full remission for awhile. My twins are 18 mo and just in the past couple months have symptoms crept back and i finally had to reach for the clob again this week actually. Guess it is time to get pregnant again \ud83e\udd2a Hey! Just wanted to share me experience, hopefully it will be of some reassurance \ud83d\ude00\nI was super nervous with my first pregnancy but everything went fine. I gave birth vaginally and did not need any stitches( had super tiny tear that healed on it is own). Post delivery I was swollen a bit more than usual but that probably due to the fact that my baby was in posterior position and my midwife had to do a lot of manual work to turn the baby.  I healed nicely, it is just fascinating what our bodies are capable of. I breasted for 3,5 years and did not notice my LS symptoms got worse, if anything it is gotten better. I am pregnant now with our second one and hoping for the best. \nGood luck to you with all my heart \u2764\ufe0f", "Is this LS? (F25, white patch) more info in comments  A few weeks ago I (think) I had a yeast infection, it started (typical) a few days after last having sex. Discharge, itching ect, I treated it with the pessary and the external cream.\nTwo weeks later things still felt off, another round of treatment didnt change anything. Since then my vagina just felt irritated, I can only wear cotton undies, everything else suddenly feels super uncomfortable, the skin on the vulva outside looks reddend, thick white/yellow discharge.\nAll my tests for yeast infection, BV, STIs came back negative. Now I discovered this white patch in inner labia minora and freakin out!\nI also noticed my labia minora \u201asticking\u2018 more to my labia majora. Will see a private gyn soon but want some opinions!  It is possible. Definitely worth asking your gyno about, not a silly question.  \u201e!delete\u201c It looks like how mine did before I took Thymosin Alpha tbh. Go get it checked out. If it is LS ask your Dr about a 10 day treatment of Thymosin. I have heard that some places are not doing Thymosin anymore though. It is a peptide for Auto Immune function. I took it for a reset not for LS and it cured my LD. Certainly get a qualified derm to look at this", "You Have to Participate in Your Own Rescue. reversing LS Hi everyone. I posted about this once, and I will continue to try and post about it every so often because it completely reversed my lichen sclerosis. Im ganna keep it short, but I am a 23 year old male. I got lichen sclerosis when I was 22. At first it was not bad, but then all of a sudden it got terrible. So terrible that I spent every second of every day in pain for 8 months. I locked myself in my room all day everyday just so I did not have to move. I tried everything. The cream, all diets, etc. It was to the point I did not want to live. However I was determined to find a cure. I found the book \n\n\u201cLichen sclerosis, Beating the disease\u201d by Ginny Chandoha\u201d\n\nThe book is about a women who was on an mission to rid herself of this disease, and figured it out. It is incredible. It saved my life. It was a big leap of faith, but I had no other choice. I now have been in remission for a almost a year and literally feel like I never had it. I know that sounds too good to be true, and unfortunately most of you will think it is. Think of this, Modern medicine gains nothing from curing you.

You have to participate in your own rescue.", "Need Advice About Being Pregnant with LS Hi all,\n\nI recently learned that I am pregnant, which is very exciting, but I have some concerns around LS. Was the tearing during birth awful? Did your doctor suggest a c-section? Do you see signs of it on your child? \n\nAny advice is welcome! I am following because I am in the same boat. \n\nI asked my doctor before, and she said it is totally fine to give birth vaginally. I am a bit skeptical though.\n\nIs this your first?  Both of my babies were born pre-LS diagnosis, but I believe I had LS when I had my 2nd child. I tore with them. Not a minor amount, but not where I needed surgery either. I think stage 2? I had a good deal of stitches. I learned about my LS because of childbirth. I got him all the way almost out but I could not stretch to get him all the way out. I know something was a bit off because he was literally like there, but no matter how hard I pushed he would not go past that point. I ended up with a third degree episiotomy after a long time of him being unable to pop through. I did tear in additional ways beyond the episiotomy as well. Now this experience is what brought my diagnosis so I went into this without having ever received treatment for the condition. My doctor did mention post partum if I have a second she does recommend a cesarean. I have not had a second pregnancy so we have not had a further discussion on the subject. \n\nI do not want to worry you but that was my experience. As I mentioned I had not received treatment so maybe with proper treatment things would have progressed differently. I have read online about women with LS having normal vaginal deliveries. Best of luck with everything! Had a baby last March. My symptoms basically went away while I was pregnant ( itching and tears). I did not tear at all during delivery of an 8 pounder. Everyone is different but that is my story. Do not worry worrying makes it worse. I should say that I am not and have never received treatment. I had one before and one after my diagnosis, though I believe I was affected long before. \n\nLS did not really affect labor or delivery for me. I had a healthy tear the first time - took them a good while to fix it up, but in the delivery room. Kind of a blur for me. I was up and walking around and getting a shower a few minutes later.  (No drugs save for the local anesthetic they used for the stitchup).  I remember asking the doc if it was a second degree tear, and he grimly said \u201cat least\u201d and kept working. It was uncomfortable for a few days, but healed fine. I remember my neighbors shouting at me in horror when I took him for a walk in the neighborhood two days later. Apparently I should have been resting, but I did not feel like resting, I felt like a walk. \n\nMy second, post-diagnosis, I lightly treated with a less-intense steroid when needed, which was pretty infrequent. I had a small tear with him too, but less so. First or second degree. Healed faster. Again, up and around fine after. \n\nI had a doula in both births. The second was more proactive - lots of hot, wet towels down there was a good thing. Spent a lot of time in the tub with the second, too, up until time to deliver. \n\nI went in wanting the doula and natural childbirth because the intervention-path concerned me. I have had abdominal surgery before and was hoping to avoid that outcome, and the best way to do that is to have as few interventions as possible. For me, it worked out fine. Being able to walk around and control everything as designed was helpful to me. \n\nFor me, knowing the LS was there was really helpful. Hot cloths leading up to delivery, a doula on my side helping through it - made a huge difference. It does not always work out that way, of course, but it did for me. \n\nTearing is not as bad as it seems like it must be. Horrible to imagine, but in my case much faster healing than abdominal surgery. My LS was not actively out of control during either delivery, so it really was not much of a factor. I was told for years that I could not have vag birth because of years of scarring. I went into pregnancy mentally preparing for c-section then when I was probably 6 months pregnant I got a referral to a specialist gyno to check skin specifically for that. He said he had no concerns about my skin being overly delicate to require c-section. I ended up going into labour early and having very sudden birth with my midwife at hospital. Despite going to full dialation in ~40m (so my pelvis did not properly have time to expand, I am told) I had very minimal tearing and more \"skid marks.\" But I fully attribute my successful birth to my midwife, who was amazing and was stretching me out the whole time for the 2.5 hours I was in stalled hard labour. Hey! From what I spoke with an OB about with my pregnancy was that LS is not an issue as it affects the outer skin, not the underlying musculature. I ended up with  Caesarian for unrelated reasons, but was told LS should not affect a vaginas delivery. I was told that they would do a planned episiotomy to make extra room for baby and help prevent unplanned tearing. Hi, everyone! I have had LS since I was a child, but was diagnosed in my 20's. Had my kiddos (vaginal delivery) at 27 &amp; 30. I had tearing with both, but that can honestly happen to anyone, LS or not. I was very good about using my peri bottle and Tucks afterward, and resuming my Clobetasol use once my stitches healed up. Also, fun fact: I felt like my LS calmed down during pregnancy! It was a welcomed break.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that it can be passed down, although that is not guaranteed. My great grandma had it, as does my mother. My sister, however, does not have it. My mom noticed that I was constantly itchy as a child, and I scratched myself til the point of bleeding for YEARS. I waited far too long to go to my doctor about it. If I notice ether ofy children exhibiting symptoms, I am going to have it addressed as early as possible. Did you heal well after that happened? I have a big line of scar tissue, everything else seems normal. I have no idea if my scar tissue is any different than anyone else\u2019s would be. Does that scar tissue tear easily? Sorry for all the questions! I am due in April and just trying to decide if a c-section is best for me. Oh no worries, it is a very unique thing and it sucks no having people who understand. For me it only tears due to sex, which was the case before too though so not a new issue. It does not particularly bother me day to day but if you feel around you notice it. I am pregnant again have to have some long talks with my OB about it. I really do not want a cesarean and I am not sure what the best course is at this point. Good luck!", "Feel good stories after diagnosis, please! I was just officially diagnosed today with LS after waiting a few months for an appointment. I am feeling a bit down after the diagnosis, but the dermatologist let me know that many women have had success getting it under control and some people even stop it completely! \n\nIt turns out I have actually completely lost one of my inner lips which is upsetting but surprisingly I am not feeling too down about that, just more scared about what the future holds! I am a 30 year old woman who is otherwise pretty healthy. \n\nThe purpose for my post is really just to hear from you women who have had success with treating your LS and if it has gotten better or disappeared at all?\n\nThank you so much! I am 30 too and was just diagnosed a couple of months ago. Knock wood, but after a month on clob I felt totally normal. (I am still really nervous to do certain things though, like I only wear cotton grannie undies and I do not wear disposable pads, which seemed to irritate me). My derm assures me each visit that fusing is really seen on untreated individuals, who have been glaring for a long period- I always find that reassuring. \n\nSince I was just diagnosed I cannot really speak to a long period of remission, but in my experience with my other autoimmune disease (ulcerative colitis) the first flare is the hardest because it is gone on for so long without having a reason for your symptoms and you have not figured out what meds work best for you. So it should all be on the up and up now! I am 42 now but was diagnosed at 30.\n\nIt sucks but it has not been that big a deal.\n\nThe worst was years of being told it is a yeast infection, being ignored.  Then finally getting to a doctor that recognized it, provided clobestasol, and f*ing magically, in two weeks, YEARS of sometimes-agony just - ENDED.  Done.  Fixed. Fine.\n\nSeriously, in two weeks, I had no more pain, no more horrific itching, no more bleeding.  No more splitting open unexpectedly when I sat down.  I was just ... fine!\n\nI have had minor flares over the year when I am not paying attention to my body.  And the occasional ACTUAL yeast infection that I assumed was LS and treated inappropriately, oops.\n\nBut I have had a second child since.  Everything is fine.  Sometimes it is less fine, sometimes I still crack or bleed, and it corresponds to times I am already stressed, not taking care of things, and not noticing a flare building. Couple days of steroid and it is back to fine again.  I spend a couple of days a year pissed off cursing this bullshit, because the flares suck and it is hard to talk to people about it, but that is really it.\n\nI think the shape of things is still slowly determined to change, which is disconcerting, but it is not been bad.\n\nFor me, it is the occasional annoyance, but not at all life-changing. I would rather not have it.  Sometimes I wonder if it will cause future problems.  But for the twelve years I have had a diagnosis, it is not been that big a deal.  Thank goodness for clobetasol.\n\nWelcome to the club? mine is doing a lot better ever since i started using clobetasol!", "New to lichen sclerosus Hello, first time poster here.  24 female. I just got diagnosed with lichen sclerosus a few days ago. Basically the area that is irritated for me if my clitoral hood, but I think I caught this quite early because I thought I had thrush but I kept going back to the doctor because no treatment was helping. So, I do not have any tearing or anything, just itchy all the time.\n\nI am struggling to come to terms with this. I just need some support. I understand this is a long term thing, but I was already struggling with anxiety and depression so this has just hit like a ton of bricks.\n\nI am going away with my boyfriend soon (a staycation to a nearby city) and I was just wondering since it is just my clitoral hood that is affected does anyone have any advice for sex? I have also only been on a steroid cream for 2 days so it is obviously not helped yet For sex, use lube. If your irritation is only on the clitoral hood than sex will be fine especially with lubrication. You are not alone in this, I am a 26 female. I was in remission for over 12 years (I was diagnosed when I was 6) and then this past year my area became super irritated and I have been constantly having flare ups. I went a while untreated not knowing what it could be which is why I think I am struggling with my flare ups. It is great you caught it early. It is so discouraging having irritation in the most delicate area of your body\u2026. No woman wants there to be anything wrong down there so I completely relate to your anxiety and depression towards this. Hopefully once you are healed, you will go into a remission and forget all about it. It is also frustrating because NO ONE you talk to (friends, family, boyfriend) will ever be able to understand what you are feeling but this is a great forum. I check it all the time. Thank you, I really appreciate your advice Hi I just got diagnosed 4 weeks ago. I completely understand where your head is at. It is going to take minimum 2 weeks for you to notice a difference. I am at 4 weeks now and I have had a 70% improvement in my symptoms. Best of luck happy to talk in DMs if you want :) Thank you, that gives me hope! All I have read so far are like horror stories so it is hard to feel hopeful 100% I know. Believe me I felt the same way as you. But most people that post online are the ones who have severe symptoms. You do not hear of the people who are not suffering. It gets better!! Keep up the clobetasol and it will improve! Genuinely so thankful you commented. I cannot remember the name of the medication I am on haha but I know it begins with a D. I know it is a steroid cream though Dermovate! (Clobetasol) same thing I am on Perfect! If I need a chat in the future about it I may message you privately if that is okay? Please do! I would love to help anyway I can :) I am 28, a month ago I was literally suicidal over this. I had just been diagnosed, on top of that I have chronic pain from two hip surgeries, and also have celiac disease. This felt like a last straw for me. I am happy to say a month later I am 90% symptom free and feel like I have a new lease on life. My regimen has been this: clobetasol twice daily for about 3 weeks, I then cut down to every other day for a week, and am now doing twice weekly. In the first few weeks I used emuaid max multiple times a day, this seemed to help even more than the clobetasol,  I cannot recommend it enough. I bought two extra containers of it in case it is ever discontinued haha. I also started really sticking to my gluten free diet. I feel better than I have in years. This will not last forever, you will get better. I have done so much research over the last month, if you have any questions I will be happy to talk in DMs. I am glad you are still alive! Hang in there. I am so happy you are feeling better. I have also felt suicidal on and off throughout my life so I completely understand what you mean. Thank you for commenting, and I will be sure to message you if I do have any questions Hi!! I have had this for years and years and years! I am 31 now. Married! Have two kids too! It is not the end of the world. Flare ups are awful, but just keep on top of the steroid cream. I use it once a week (sometimes twice), and once a day for two weeks if I am having really bad symptoms. Do exactly what the dr tells you. I also highly recommend seeing a gynecologist, vs. a regular dr. Make sure you have it checked at least once a year to make sure nothing crazy is going on. \n\nI also have Morphea (a rare type of scleroderma). I have often wondered if theyre related - so far nothing I have read has been conclusive. Super frustrating dealing with two types of autoimmune skin diseases. \n\nI think the lichen sclerosis started when I was a young child, but it was not diagnosed until my early 20s! It kind of laid dormant for a few years, then came back with a vengeance. So happy that you were able to catch it early. \n\nIt can be painful, and scary - I absolutely have moments where I am so frustrated and upset by it... But you do learn to live with it. I think i have this.  I kept thinking it was yeast infections but i have a bit white patch by my vaginal opening.  I thought it was allergies.  At one point i even thought i was allergic to my husband.  Any little thing causes an itching flare up.   I have gone to gyn done all test and everything has come back back good.  I recently just made an appointment with a gyn who specializes in this but appointment isnt until october 3 months from now.  Is there anything i can do in the meantime to hold me down until my appointment?  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!!!! Put petroleum jelly on as a barrier when showering then gently wipe it off after, I use cotton and warm water. Do not take baths. Do not use any scented product where its sore, or soaps. You can get moisturusrs that can be use as a soap substitute, I use dermol 500. Only wear cotton underwear. Sleep without anything on your bottom half. Do NOT scratch, no matter what it will get worse. That is all the practical advice off the top of my head\n\nI would say if it spreads keep phoning up and seeing if you can get an earlier appointment. But just remember, everything will be okay. Now that I am on steroid cream for it, I have only used it for a week, I am already getting better. I am not itchy all day now it comes and goes 22 female here :) I have a less extreme case (mostly itching) but it still took 3-5 months of consistent steroid use to feel as though my symptoms really settled down. After a couple months I began to feel comfortable but I was still flaring around my period every month. I am about half a year into treatment and still have weird dry itchy days but it is less and less frequent as time goes on. Trust the process. It is exhausting but you will get there. Soak your skin in warm water before applying ointment, and gently rub in for 60-90 seconds. It makes a difference", "Is a negative biopsy conclusive? Hi all. I have found this subreddit to be such a helpful tool in going through this diagnosis process over the last few months. I returned to my doctor yesterday who had the results of my biopsy, and they were negative. Apparently the white tissue observable is just scar tissue (I did have an injury in that area before). I am male, but I am interested in hearing about other biopsy experiences. Is this result conclusive enough? I have not been using steroids before or after the biopsy at all. Negative biopsies are pretty conclusive, but of course, like anything there is a small margin for error. To be clear, it read negative and not inconclusive, right? Many people get inconclusive and the pathology report will state lots of inflammation, atrophy, hyperkeratosis, etc., so those cases are a bit more Grey, but typically a negative is a negative unless they biopsied the completely wrong area and the case is very mild. It is great that you were not on steroids before as this can mask a positive result, therefore it is even more likely that it is negative.", "Does this look like LS? I do not remember if it is always looked light in the creases like this. No itching or tearing. ", "Is clobetasol the best option for a 9yr old? My 9 yr old daughter was just diagnosed with LS, but her symptoms are just pain around the vulva and anus that lasts for a few minutes. It is debilitating when it happens, but then she is fine.\n\nA pediatric gynecologist prescribed clobetasol, but we read the insert and it sounds terrifying. It says not to use on the groin area, and not on children under age 12.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s accent makes it hard to understand her. She did not warn me about how dangerous the medication could be. The pharmacist was very concerned about having a child use it.\n\nSince she is not exhibiting white patches, would this be considered a harsh response, and should we first explore other steroids? Or is hitting it hard up front considered better?\n\nThanks for the help.  I am feeling so sad for my kiddo. She already has enough other issues.", "Discovering flare ups in sensitive areas I recently discovered what I believe to be LS in my genital area, something that I have sort of dreaded and anticipated since I got my diagnosis. I am going to schedule something with my dermatologist soon, can anyone fill me in on what I might expect as far as treatment?", "Clobetasol burning/ scared of potential new diagnosis In August I had a kidney infection that landed me in the hospital, followed by two more UTI's back to back. The antibiotics seemed to clear some symptoms, but I just kept having lingering burning pain in my labia area. A week ago I started experiencing symptoms of what I thought was another UTI coming on.  When I went to the gyno this Tuesday, she told me that my urinary test was negative, and after inspection, found a white patch on my labia. She told me that it could be a complication from my UTI infection/taking antibiotics, and that it may just clear up on its own. \n\nShe also stated that it could possibly be lichen sclerosus, and gave me clobetasol to apply 2x daily for four weeks, then one application every three days. Last night was my first application and it burned like hell. I did not really sleep.  This morning I woke up and my symptoms were more mild. Then, I applied the clobetasol, and once again I am getting itching and burning that wont go away. She told me I can experience discomfort from it and to give it a few days. Has anyone had this sort of experience when first starting clobetasol? I am at wits end now, as I have not had any relief from my burning and itching for two months now. \n\nSome days it has been so bad that I am hunched in fetal position in my bed. It has started to interfere with my job (I work with people with disabilities, which is an emotionally demanding job) and I have had a lot of break downs on a daily basis. Luckily I do see a therapist who is wonderful, and we are working on managing my anxiety surrounding this. To top it off, I have not had sex for two months now, and I have a long term partner who I very much enjoy having sex with. I usually have a very high sex drive, so this is taking a huge emotional toll on me, making me think I will never have \"normal\" sex again. He has been so so wonderful throughout it all and is doing all he can to assure me that he just wants me to feel better and that sex can wait.\n\nSorry for this being all over the place, I guess this post was part question, part just venting. Tacrolimus is another option but it will have some serious  burning to start out with before adjusting so that is not really great either. Neither tacrolimus or clobetasol helped me, only irritated my very sensitive skin. It is unfortunate there are not a lot of options for lichen sclerosus. I have heard of good results using pure emu oil. I used it briefly and it seemed to help a lot but I used it too frequently and gave myself contact dermatitis, really a terrible place to have that. The vitamin e concentration is very high which if used too frequently will cause issues. So I just use a bit of coconut oil on occasion if it is a bad flare up then make sure to wash it off later that day so the oil does not sit on my skin too long.\n\nI am sorry you have to go through this and there are not a ton of options. It will be some trial and error to find something that works. Lowering your stress levels is optimal which is kind of a joke because this causes so much added stress. I gave up clob and switched to a brand called \u201choney Pot\u201d. The vulva cream has helped to relieve the itching. The clob burned all day, every day. It is possible you are reacting not to the clob itself, but to something it is compounded with, like a preservative. Did you get an ointment or a cream? Creams have a higher water content so they need more preservatives. Ointments are usually less likely to promote irritant reactions, so they are preferred for the genitals.  \n\nTo me, the clob does not feel much different than vaseline. I also tried tacrolimus, which for me had a mild minty burn for the first few applications, but nothing major. Some people definitely react worse to it than others. \n\nI would definitely call your doctor back and tell her that the clob hurts a LOT. A few days of \"discomfort\" is one thing, but \"burns like hell\" and \"no sleep\" is another thing. Besides, it could be indicative of a different problem or something. \n\nAs for sex, are you just missing your \"regular\" sex or are you being totally abstinent? I definitely recommend pursuing whatever ways of having sex you can that are comfortable for you at any given stage. It takes some good communication, but if you can make it clear to your partner ahead of time which areas are no-go, some chill sex sounds totally possible, even if it is not the same things you usually do. Call the doc!! It might not be lichen sclerosis. I am so sorry it hurts like that. For me, the ointment dis not hurt, it soothed starting on day 2 It is the gel kind. She told me to try it through the weekend and if nothing has improved, to call on Monday. She said that obviously if it burns too much to discontinue it over the weekend, but she did not mention the tacrolimus.  But that is a good point that she could have missed the mark and it could be something else... \n\nAnd I have been celibate since this all started, especially since it started with UTIs and sex was not an option at that point. While the string of UTIs have resolved, I have still been in too much pain and/or discomfort most nights to want to attempt sex. Once I can get get things to a more manageable level, I would like to try though and make it work in whatever way is comfortable enough. &gt;Thanks for the suggestion! Will look into that, especially once I figure out if this is for sure LS or not, as I do not want to apply anything yet before speaking with my gyno. After reading around on this sub, I have seen a lot about coconut oil providing some relief. I have heard good things about the use of coconut oil topically, in general. Never heard of emu oil, but that is good to know it can cause that. Sorry to hear about the contact dermatitis, that sounds painful! \n\nAnd yea, I keep telling myself that after some trial and error that it should become more manageable. Just trying to get through things until I know more about what is going on/ whether or not it is truly LS. I am supposed to have a follow up in Dec, but worst case I may have to go in sooner. hm it might not be LS. it is hard to diagnose just by sight alone, usually you need a biopsy to confirm. i started feeling relief from clob within a couple of days.\n\ndefinitely go back to the doctor though. you do not have to suffer through the pain. you can also use another emollient in the meantime - a lot of women in another LS group I am in recommend emu oil. i use something called Emily's hot skin soother and it really helps. both of those are on amazon. \n\nwhen the pain is really bad i take a lot of sitz baths. ice packs can help too. \n\nI am so sorry you are going through this. I used the clob for a month and while it was fine for most of the time, it eventually started to burn me and cause inflammation. The doc switched me to mometasone, which seems in studies to work as well but is less intense. Might be worth trying this, instead? A gel? Why a gel? It sounds like ( I have a fluocinonide gel for my psoriatic ears and it does burn. I assumed it was the medication, but I just looked at the ingredients and it contains sodium hydroxide...?\n\nApparently gels often contain alcohol, and it makes sense that alcohol would burn, especially on injured or sensitive skin. Gels are also less effective than ointments because they dry fast, whereas ointments form an occlusive layer that maximizes the absorption of the medication. And drying fast means gels can dry out the skin. \n\nGels do have advantages, which is why they are still prescribed sometimes; they are good for oily places or places where greasiness is particularly problematic, like the scalp. No one wants greasy goop in their hair. And I think the less-wet formulations are preferred for rashes that are already \"wet\" (weeping.) If it were me I would call and ask your doctor why she wrote you a gel and if it is possible you could try an ointment instead, especially if you have sensitive skin in general. \n\nAnd re: sex, sounds like you have a plan. I know in my experience, even just cuddling and making out is really good for pain (since it releases endorphins) and for relationship intimacy. Thank you for the suggestion, I will let my gyno know about this/other alternatives! For sure. I looked at the bottle again and it says ointment. It is thick and opaque like a gel, so I guess I confused it for a gel. Oops! \n\nI will say it did not burn upon application last night, but it is also not doing any good. Still woke up to very bad burning/itching this morning (which has been my daily baseline for the past couple months). But yes, she told me if it does not improve my Monday to call. It is weird that the patch she found looks like textbook LS, but I guess you never know if it is something else, or just not the right treatment for me.\n\nI have had gynecological issues in the past, just never something so chronic. I know everyone here can relate though and this seems to be a wonderful community. And yes, I agree that even cuddling/making out can be very beneficial. Honestly it is just the intimacy component I miss. On days the irritation/pain  has not been AS bad, I have been able to take my mind off things a bit when trying to be intimate. I have read stories of insensitive partners and it makes me so sad people can be like that. I feel very fortunate to have the most supportive and mindful boyfriend. We started dating at the very start of the pandemic, so when I told him I just want a normal relationship, he joked that this has not really been normal from the start, hah!", "Is LS pretty much always kind of flakey?  Mine is not flakey at all! It used to peel off in a way but now the skin just goes super fragile and tears", "i hate this disease. this disorder has made my already shitty mental health even worse. it frustrates me so much and i am battling it on my own. i ask everyday why me? why this condition out of all things? i just want to kill my self to be honest. I ask myself the same questions on hard days. But truthfully everyone has something. And there are a lot of things far worse than LS. Do what you can to manage your symptoms and please speak to your doctor about how it is affecting your mental health, they might be able to recommend something or someone to help. It really is a hard thing to deal with but can definitely be manageable. I hope you have a doctor who can help treat the symptoms. Also let them know how much it is affecting you emotionally and how important it is to get this disease under control for you. In the meantime a warm bath with baking soda can be really soothing for irritated spots. I honestly hope things get better for you. Sending you love and hugs!!! I have metal problems from this too and it sucks. I am just trying to take one day at a time. I get it. Ever since I starting dealing with it, the mental toll of the disease along with the already horrible physical toll can be incredibly hard to deal with. It often makes me hate and resent my own body even more than I already did. Its made me want to kill myself too.  I have been in therapy for a while now for other mental health issues and now to deal with LS too. It can really help. There is help, it can get better. Sending love. I understand and I am so sorry.

If you do not want to be that close and personal with your bfs mom (which I understand, idk if that is even ethical \ud83e\udd23) then you could start researching other vulvar specialists/derms near you or just visit your obGYN/derm/GP and start from there.\n\nBtw that cream is supposed to burn (sometimes it is a lot for some people) the first few times. Refrigerating it for 30 min before application is said to help. The burning should go down after about a week or so of usage, so stay strong. Treatment prior to diagnosis could also interfere with biopsy results, which could make it harder for a doc to diagnose you later on. Also make sure to take pictures of it flared, so that if you are all cleared up when your appointment comes, you at least have something to show them. Good luck with everything and wishing you the best \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e Apparently the burning with tacrolimus is quite variable between people, but for me it was not bad. More like a minty burn or a spicy food burn, uncomfortable but not bad, and after a couple applications I do not notice it anymore. Hope it is the same or better for OP. &gt;I am hesitant to ask her about Lichen since I do not want her to think I am a hypochondriac.\n\nWhy did she prescribe you pimecrolimus if she does not suspect LS or something similar? Either way I do not think you are being a hypochondriac. You have severe itching and common causes have been ruled out, so it is probably LS or another inflammatory skin condition like lichen planus, eczema, psoriasis, etc, especially given the Hashimoto's and Vitiligo.\n\n Do you have any itching inside your vagina or is it strictly the vulva? Any flaking or scaling? It might be helpful to see an experienced dermatologist, since skin conditions seem like most of the likely candidates. I have a derm as the main person managing my LS. It is strictly my vulva that itches. I feel like with all the scratching it gets sore all over. No flaking or scaling, I just noticed that I am very red. \nI am definitely seeing a derm soon, it is just that you have to wait an eternity to get an appointment. Thanks for the reply &lt;3 Thanks for answering! &lt;3 \nI have actually been seen by her for other things before this all started and she always makes sure I am super comfortable. My boyfriend asked her about Lichen since we started doing research because I am going crazy at this point and she made the \"hypochondriac\" comment, but later on said it is a possibility given my other diagnoses so I am not sure if I should approach her again. \nThanks for the advice with the cream! Wow, she actually called you a hypochondriac! That is a bit dismissive for a doctor, but I am glad she came around and that you are comfortable enough with her, that is a pretty lucky connection you have got! I hope you get some relief soon \ud83d\udc95 Redness and itching is typical of LP, but LP usually affects the vagina too (but not always.) Sometimes it causes white marks on the cheeks and/or gums, so you can look for that. You might just have LS but not have developed any white patches yet.\n\nAnd yeah, it is crazy how long the wait times get for appointments. \n\nThe scratching can make things worse, so try to avoid it, although I know how hard it is not to scratch and I am not great at it either. Repeated scratching can even cause another lichen, lichen simplex chronicus, so it is important to break the itch-scratch cycle. Ice packs can help a ton, and so can a tepid bath. Sometimes I have to trim my nails short just to reduce the damage I do scratching, even in my sleep. (My LS is not that itchy but I have psoriasis that itches like mad.) Due to my Vitiligo my labia is already full of white patches. \n\nThanks for the advice, I am hoping to get some relief from the cream. My boyfriend's Mum asked to see me in 2 weeks and I have some pics of flare ups, maybe she could give me the right diagnosis. Ok, it is possible some of the white patches are actually LS, or sort of both (there is a vitiligoid sub-type of LS.) It looks like if any of the patches are thickened, crinkly, flattening/fusing, or otherwise atrophied that is indicative that it is an LS lesion rather than pure vitiligo. Hopefully the derm can sort it out. The good thing is that pimecrolimus should help for a wide variety of the conditions it could be, so I hope you can get some relief even sooner. My biopsy came back as LS, and I barely had any of the white spots. My symptoms for years were what you described, and I think my Gyno said the hormonal IUD is not ideal for auto immune stuff. I had gotten mine out in 2019, so taking it out will not cure you, but it might help with symptoms. Birth control bills with estrogen are supposed to help auto immune stuff. That is what sold me on going back on the pill after no BC for two years. Thanks for the answer! &lt;3 Sadly I cannot have birth control with estrogen in them due to migraine and lipedema. \nDid your itching get better after treatment? Have you tried lasers and O-Shot? Aw yeah migraines are the worst. Have not tried those other things yet.", "29M - Almost Diagnosed Hello,\n First of all, I am very glad to find this subreddit. I have been struggling with LS symptoms on my glans for almost a year now. I am uncircumcised, and also have a bit of \"extra\" foreskin. I have a history of numerous skin irritations on my penis since I was a teenager, and to get worse, the bad habit of unconsciously touching the region when anxious - and alone ofc (not anymore since the major problems started). So I was very used to have red patches/ irritations here and there, and never worried too much about them. However, a year ago I started getting different spots, not itchy/sensible, that were not going off. One of them became really white and \"thick\", and then I went to an urologist. We did a series of exams and found nothing, and he told me that the problem could be lichen sclerosis. He prescribed Betametasone ointment, and I applied it for 4 weeks once a day. The results were very good, after 2-3 days the white spot was thinner and was almost gone (although I had noticeable depigmentation side effect of the corticoid). I finished the 4 weeks treatment despite having sensitivity issues/other new red patches/irritations which I suspect were due to the ointment side effect of making the skin very sensitive. I was glad the issue was gone, but few weeks later (about 4), glans irritations came back, but in different spots. It seems I cannot touch my penis/have sex anymore without having problems (although I did it without lubrification - I just realized I prolly cannot do that ever again in my life - will always need a lubrificant, which is not a big issue anyways). Aside from the glans, out of nowhere I got some bumps on my scrotum skin. I was using a body cream on my legs at that time, and I strongly suspect it was the trigger for these testicle patches, since I did not have them before. I also suspect the Corona vaccine (Pfizer) messing with my immune system, but I already had the glans lichen before taking it, so I am not sure (only the scrotum lichen appeared after it). Anyway, few days after, these \"hives\" on my scrotum started to itch a bit, and some of them have a white patch right on the center. I know it is likely lichen again, and went straight to a dermatologist this time. I had a very traumatic biopsy collection of glans tissue (they did not speak good English), and here I am waiting for the results.  \n\nI am almost sure it is LS, and I am a bit afraid of also having some kind of dysplasia/malignancy on the skin. I read on the internet that LS increases the chance of skin cancer. The collection was made on one specific white area, but I have a lot of other red patches on glans/inner side of foreskin ATM - I hope none of them have these major problems apart from LS. I am very anxious to apply my Betametasone cream again, but I guess I need to wait for the healing  of biopsy spot (the doctor gave me very little information on how to proceed now, just told me to go back there in 2 weeks to see results/discuss).\n\nI just wanted to share my experience in order to feel a bit better. Also, I found weird that I had patches on scrotum as well (and seems that everyone had them only on the penis). Anyone already had LS in other parts of the body?  \nAnother question: anyone had non itchy patches? Mine are not itchy at all (apart from scrotum, but very very slightly). \nThank you for the attention!", "The itch is unbearable (flaring) I am having the worst flare in a while, likely a combination of stress and holiday foods that I do not normally eat. Just need to bitch and complain about how fucking AWFUL this disease is. I can barely concentrate at work today because of it.\n\nI have clobetasol at home and will have to start that regimen again. \n\nAnyone else need to vent? Let us complain together. YES. same here. i had the worst flare up of my entire life in early november that i just fully healed from. i am very newly diagnosed so i am still figuring out triggers. the other day i ate foods (garlic and onions) that i know trigger my IBS, but i never thought about how they could affect LS. welp. i am thinking they caused a flare up bc i have had embarrassingly bad itch, burn, and general discomfort for the past 2 days. also the stress of the holiday season makes things that much worse. i will be thinking and praying for you\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f I was diagnosed years ago and I feel like I still learn new triggers! The embarrassment sucks too...like I cannot tell work that my fucking genitals are inflamed and itching because my immune system is attacking itself!\n\nWill be thinking about you, too! I hope both of your conditions get more bearable soon! Oh man. I am sorry, that is the worst. And at work ... it is just impossible to be professional and appropriate when it feels like your vulva is on fire. It is absurd we have to. \n\nI appreciate the anecdotal point that others also feel that stress and/or food set it off on a runaway chain reaction. I feel that way but it is hard to define sometimes. \n\nI have taken ice cubes from the break room to the bathroom with me. I wrap them in a paper towel and hold them for as long as I can get away with it. Lucky now I work from home so if it is bad I get in the shower. Or, at least, I do not have to pretend everything is fine when IT IS NOT FINE. \n\nHope you get some relief ASAP!! I have been thinking about icing the area all day - cannot wait to get home!\n\nThank you for the kind words! Try cold-pressed nigella seed oil (also known as kalonji oil, black cumin seed oil). It has worked for me and also some others online thank you! Mine has been awful, too. Cannot I just order a new whoo-ha already? :( Can someone explain to me why a flare up is? Do you have white patches or is the vulva inflamed and irritated? it is is when all of your symptoms resurge", "LS vs Yeast Infection Itchy white patches formed around the base of my penis and new patches start showing up. I am a circumcised 21M. How can you know if its LS or Yeast Infection? Do they have the same symptoms? Go see your doctor. Assuming that you are describing base of your penis at point it joins the body, there are a whole host of things it might be: yeast infection, reaction to a new washing powder, eczema, psoriasis etc. If there is no glans or meatus involvement, it is unlikely to be LS but get certainty and go see a doctor. I wish you all the best. That is some kind of a relief. Yes there is no glans involvement and yes I will see a doctor soon. Thanks! You can get Canesten over the counter (or the generic Clotrimazole Topical Cream) to treat a yeast infection.

At first i had itching and little cuts but i haven t got that anymore for a long time. Does this sound like something else besides Lichen? Thank you Sounds like lichens to me, from what you described.", "Help for a 9-year-old girl and her mama My 9-year-old was diagnosed on her vulva and anus. She is in the 6 weeks of clobestosol.\nI am so sad for her. Sad that she is 9 years old and has already had three vaginal exams. The first sign of it was broken blood vessels and blood blister like things on her vulva in March, but it took two more appointments and then a third with a pediatric gynecologist to get a diagnosis and treatment.\nHer school is very strict so I have to formally request accommodation for bathroom use, so she is not holding in her pee and leaking and so she can apply aquifer when it is really painful. Are there any more accommodations you could think of that a young woman at school might want to be more physically comfortable?\nIs there anything you can think of that I can do to make this easier for her? And possibly preserve her ability to have pain free vaginal sex and give birth? And anything I can do or say to support her on this journey? I really do not want her to think that there is something wrong with her or at least nothing more wrong than any other person if that makes sense. I do not want her to feel like a faulty design or something. So often people act like being healthy is a moral issue, like if people were good enough and tried hard enough they would not be sick, you know? She has already shown signs of other autoimmune issues and this kind of seals the deal. I do not want her to think she just did not try hard enough to be healthy. I want to say the right words that will make her feel empowered to take care of herself and empowered to advocate for herself.\n\nI know I am kind of rambling. I am sorry. It is just that she is just nine and starting fourth grade and in that place where they play with dolls at home and cell phones at school. Part baby part woman. I just wish she did not have to deal with this. But she does, so I want to do right by her. I am so sorry you and your daughter are going through this! I was actually diagnosed with LS (both vaginal and anal) at the age of 4 in 1979. The treatment then was not the steroids we have now (it was testosterone cream and Eucerin). My symptoms went away after about 2 years, and I forgot about it until this year when I was diagnosed again after dealing with a year of itchiness. It is now back in remission again. \n\nIt is typical for LS symptoms to go into remission at puberty, as happened to me. I did not have a lot of issues after puberty and was able to have sex and children without issue, so an LS diagnosis is not necessarily a sentence to sexlessness and an inability to have kids. I also got diagnosed with thyroid cancer after the birth of my 2nd child, and again, it is turned out okay and I only think of either diagnosis when I have to apply ointment or take a pill. Granted, I have the benefit of being in my 40s now, but doing mindfulness/meditation exercises to connect me more to my body has helped (the Headspace app has some good meditations for kids that may help her).\n\nMy parents are great but not very communicative about body stuff (hence why I forgot about my earlier diagnosis until I checked my childhood medical records). I would say keeping the lines of communication open with her is the best - a practice I have started with my kids on \"uncomfortable\" conversations is to allow them to bring them up over text (they are teenagers now) or do it in the car on the way somewhere where there is a known end to the awkwardness (when you arrive at the destination).\n\nTwo final notes - there seems to be evidence that girls diagnosed with LS before puberty do not fully develop labia minora; every lady's undercarriage is different so if she makes a comment like that, it is all good and should not prevent her from feeling pleasure in the future. And finally, I do not remember all the exams I had as a kid but my records show I had 4 of them. I think it may have left me with some skitishness about sex I wish I had realized earlier, but with a caring partner it has not held me back from enjoying that part of our relationship. Keep an eye out for that sort of trauma response as she is in health class or learning more about the birds and the bees.\n\nGood luck, and reach out if you have questions! You sound like you are doing a great job helping your daughter through this already.  And you came to a good place for further information and support. \n\nI have heard from people on here who have been diagnosed with LS during childhood, went into many years remission, and then experienced flares again later in life.. so, it may be reassuring just knowing that it can get better and that people can still have fairly normal sexual function with LS if the disease is not allowed to progress out of control.\n\nContinue to monitor the situation closely and be as consistant as possible with the application of the medicine.  \n\nIt sounds like some females who are diagnosed with LS during childhood go into remission around puberty and then sometimes get a return of symptoms later in life after things that cause hormonal changes like childbirth, changing or stopping birth control or menopause.. im not doctor or anything, and these are not my personal experiences, but this is what I have gathered from some of the other members here.\n\nIm a male and I was diagnosed with anogenital LS at age 29, just for context. Although my sexual functions were negatively impacted for a while, I have been able to regain all of that lost function and resolve all symptoms with treatment.\n\nBest wishes! Hiii! I am really sorry for you and your daughter, I know it must not be easy. You seem like a great mom, you asking for help and advice really shows how supportive and caring you are:)! It might be hard for kids sometimes to express how they feel but listen to her and be open to talking about it without it being awkward or uncomfortable (so she knows she can come to you to talk about it). I remember when I first got diagnosed, I felt misunderstood even doctors could not understand my pain at first, I wish I had someone that did support me and honestly just listen to me. I think what is important is to follow the doctor's recommendations , stick with the treatment, vaseline also helps and gives me a lot of relief, loose clothing helps, fragrance free soap, fragrance free detergent, sleeping with no underwear, sitz baths... To properly control symptoms she needs to be consistent with the treatment, some people even go in remission. I had a really hard time at first, now that I found the proper treatment for me, sometimes I even forget I have LS but I do have some bad days just like anyone does really! It is different for everyone! I can only talk from my personal experience but I can still enjoy sex, LS does not stop me from having sex and I can also have kids not yet but I sure hope to have some one day\ud83d\ude0a Goodluck with everything \ud83d\udc95 Hopefully this was a little helpful!:)) Thank you so much for your kind and informative reply! Although I have been reading extensively online, you shared information that I have never seen before like the issue with the labia minora. And you shared a more hopeful prognosis then we have heard thus far, but I am not sure if that is because they are pretty sure hers is autoimmune related. I love your idea about using text if we have to navigate hard conversations about her health as she gets a little older. Right now my favorite time to do it is on car rides when she is in the backseat and I am driving? She seems so willing to divulge and engage at those times. Thanks again! Thank you for your compassion! Regarding your recommendation to be consistent with the medicine, I have a follow-up question. Have you had better outcomes with thin application of medication or thicker applications? She has other rashes unrelated to LS and her skin does not respond great to any thing really. We barely even use soap. Anyway, sometimes I cannot tell if it is another rash flaring up because of the ointment or if it is the LS being irritated, and also  she does not like feeling goopy anyway, so I have been leaning to more of a thin application, at night time. I mean I am sure to get all the impacted areas but I do not lay on heavy. What has been your experience? Thank you so much for your reply! I just asked this to the above poster but I would like to ask you too. We are very consistent with the medication application but have you found it to be more effective with a thicker application or is it okay if it is a thin application? Also regarding what you said about the Vaseline, we are doing the treatment at night and aquifer during the day. Is that how you do it or do you put the Vaseline on top of the treatment? Although now that I am asking that I realize probably you are not using steroids right now if you are in remission. Anyway, any little bit of info helps me navigate this better, so thank you very much! Oh my gosh! Read this book! The first 20 or so pages goes on about a girl who got diagnosed at a young age (like your daughter) with LS.\n\n\n\nBest of luck! Btw, here is a link to how I dealt with my LS after reading Ginny's book -\n\n Aw, your story brought tears to my eyes. You sound like an amazing mom. I am so sorry your daughter is suffering with this at such a young age. I had a similar childhood with chronic autoimmune issues, and I remember how hard it was on me and my parents. I also understand what you mean about blame, and I wish my mom did that for me. I still have so much anxiety and always feel like I must be doing something wrong to have all these issues my friends never have. My mom always blamed it on my picky eating, saying it is karma for this or that, that I take too many antibiotics (ok this one may have some role but I had legit infections???), etc. Having that support would have made a world of difference for me.\n\n\nI developed LS at 22 (23 now), and have been getting stem cell therapy for it which has been really game changing. I am not sure if my surgeon treats younger patients, so she may have to wait until 18 if it is still an issue, but I do know that the Coyle Institute has helped younger patients with this and has helped put them in remission. Google the TULIP procedure with Dr. Michael Coyle. Long waitlist and $4000, so it is not an immediate or cheap solution, but maybe something to think about. Although, I have also heard that it is fairly common for prepubescent LS to go into remission after puberty so I am really hoping for that to be the case for your daughter. In the meantime, I really like v magic/Egyptian magic or emuaid to soothe the skin, they are hormone free. Emuaid is particularly fantastic if she has itching. I find them much better than aquaphor, but it is individual so it may take time to find the product that helps her. Others really love lisepten salve, terrasil skin repair extra strength, and various other creams. Low strength lidocaine/benzocaine could also help numb things so she does not itch or burn while in class, as it can provide relief for up to several hours. You can get vagicaine for $2 at most drugstores or Walmart. While at home, the BEST thing ever is a cold gel pack or a bath\ud83e\udd24. I also love soaking in borax, about one cup in the bath helps with the itching and inflammation more than you could imagine. I urge you to do research on borax and LS, it is very off label (lol) but sooooo many sufferers have found it helpful. I also think baking soda, Epsom salt, or even plain baths are a great alternative, just no bubble baths or anything that will irritate. She should not use any soap down there, just warm water to clean. Showering in a bikini bottom may help keep shampoo and other irritants from running on her vulvar skin. I also recommend soft, 100% cotton underwear during the day and no underwear while sleeping (or whenever possible, I pretty much love commando lol). Switching to a free and clear detergent is also recommended to reduce irritation. Soft toilet paper and teaching her to pat instead of wiping will also help greatly in healing the skin. A bidet or spray bottle is even better, but I know it is hard since she is 9 and at school. Additionally, a lot of patients benefit from dietary changes. I personally went gluten free to help with the LS and autoimmunity. I am also low dairy, but I cannot resist occasional cheese lol. There is trial and error to find her trigger foods, but things like reducing sugar to control inflammation help most people. Reducing oxalate foods can also help a lot, especially if she has pain when she pees or poos. Since you mentioned her having other autoimmune issues, you could look into the AIP diet to see if that helps bring her body into a better balance. Lastly, what I wish my parents knew to do for me when I was in her shoes, is go see a functional medicine/integrative health/naturopathic  doctor. I know there is a lot of quacks in that field, so it will require some research on your end to find someone good. And I am not saying ditch conventional medicine - use the steroid. But, there is most likely a reason, a root cause, for why she is getting LS/other autoimmune issues and figuring it out could not only help put her current ones in remission or in a more controlled state, but it can help prevent her from developing more issues later on. It could literally be anything from a mild hormone imbalance, thyroid issue (common with LS), mold or heavy metal toxicity, a sensitivity to certain foods she is eating that does not cause a GI response but results in inflammation/stress on her immune system, or just that her immune system is really stressed out and needs to heal, and they can help her with all of that. And they will take a whole body approach to help her figure out the issue and tend to have more natural treatments/lifestyle changes to help supplement her current care. I cannot emphasize this enough, finding these answers now could be the single biggest difference you can make in her life. \n\nLastly, there is a really amazing Facebook support group made by Alicia Mae Cain, the author of \u201cHelp! I have Lichen Sclerosus\u201d (highly recommend, it is $10 on Amazon), for parents of children with LS, if you are not in it already. Lots of help for you and her I am sure! I will add the link to that group and her main support group- she has too many to count lol but she is a hero. \n\nLinks: \n\n(\n\n(\n\n\nOh and far as sex goes\ud83d\ude09- even before I did stem cells, I was always fine in that regard. Before treatment with steroid it hurt like hell, but I never experienced tearing or anything, just burning. After using steroids it is not an issue. LS is all about control and management, so having a normal sex life and life is completely possible unless it is one of the extreme cases. If it is an issue, there are million solutions for that when you get there from physical therapy/dilators to surgeries (fentons procedure, laser, stem cell etc) that can repair any damage to her tissues. I am sure the options will be even better by that time too. I have not had kids yet, but there is always c sections lol. \n\nOk. I am done, sorry that was long \ud83d\ude02\nAgain, I am so sorry your daughter has to fight this battle too! I wish you both the absolute best of luck in this and everything else \ud83e\udd70\n\nETA: Omg! I made a mistake, I gave you the wrong link. The the link for parents with LS children is ( Thank you so much! Oh my gosh. The amount of time and effort and knowledge and compassion you put into your response blows me away. Thank you, thank you thank you for the useful information. You gave me a lot of leads to follow up on and a lot of advice I can put into practice. And we do not have a naturopathic source yet but we are going to acupuncture. I realize it is a little bit different but we believe in fighting from all fronts! You are very welcome, I am happy to be of any help! I think acupuncture is a great idea to help her. I have heard so many positive things from other LS patients in these groups so I hope it helps her too! Good luck with everything and I hope your daughter regains her comfort soon \u2665\ufe0f My doctor said to apply thinly, about a small pea size (for the ointment) and so that is what I do! It is a pretty strong steroid, she does not need to apply too much of it!:) Also, she should only be applying the ointment to the affected areas. I do not use the vaseline and ointment at the same time! I apply the ointment 2-3 times a week and I always apply it at bed time. On the nights I am not applying the ointment, I will be using vaseline instead. I am not in remission right now, but I know it is possible to be in remission! I still have symptoms but they come and go, sometimes I feel like I do not have LS because I feel much better ever since I started the treatment!  But I do get bad days...If I feel uncomfortable or am having a bad day with my LS I will try and apply vaseline during the day as well. I hope it makes sense!\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc95 &gt; So often people act like being healthy is a moral issue, like if people were good enough and tried hard enough they would not be sick\n\n\\^\\^ I totally feel that. \n\nTo be fair, I have not read Ginny Chandoha's book, but from what I have read about it, it might not be what you need right now. From the Amazon blurb:\n\n\"As Ginny points out, if you feed yourself well and quit dousing yourself in toxins, you will be well on your way to feeling better. \" \n\nAnd not to be a nitpick, but the fact that the name of our disease is misspelled in the book's title does not give me much confidence in it. Hello mama! \nI have had LS since I was a child as well. It sucks, and took many years to actually get a proper diagnosis (I am talking early 20s). Your daughter will thank you for the early diagnosis someday! I too, also have other autoimmune diseases ( Morphea scleroderma, and reynauds), and I do believe it is all related. \nMy best piece of advice is to educate her about LS as best you can. Let her know that with proper maintenance, she can live with this. Someday, it will become nothing but a minor nuisance. Yes, I am serious! I do have flare ups that do keep me up at night, but only when I get lazy with the steroid maintenance. \n\nI have a very normal sex life, and have birthed two beautiful, healthy babies :) please stay positive for your daughter. If she senses your fear or worries, it will weigh on her. Being a girl is hard enough. I absolutely understand and feel her pain, and as a mom - I feel your pain too. You are doing the right thing and have taken all the right steps. There will come a time when she will not need to excuse herself to the bathroom to apply medicine. Give it time :)", "Intense itch! Hi. \n\nSometimes I get an very intense itch. It is not like an itch where you want to scratch it. It dosen't help much to put on lidocain gel. Hydrocortison in large amounts helps somethimes. But nothing really helps for good, except time. Often it dissapereas after 2-3 days. And then it it happens again efter a month or after several months. It is just so annoying and intense! Can anyone relate to this? Yes, I totally experience this. All I have been able to do to calm it is by putting a cold wash cloth on it. Some zinc cream might work as well.\n\nI was visually diagnosed with LS by my gyno, but I am waiting for biopsy results. Have you been diagnosed or are you just feeling this symptom? I was diagnosed 4 years ago. Never got a biopsy. But somethimes I wonder if it was best to get an biopsy, but I have also heard, that the biopsy can be negative even though you actually have LS. \n\nI hope I someday find a good way, to get rid of this extreme itching... Wow, you have had it so long and you still experience flares that often? I feel like you should defiantly get a biopsy. I think it is very unlikely that a result could be negative. Maybe you are dealing with something that has very similar symptoms. I have spoken to lots of people that were just finally diagnosed with yeast or vaginitis and the steroid treatment was not working too well for them. My gyno said that after the initial treatment I should be going back to my normal life and having flares occasionally. Which does not seem like the case for me right now \u2014 though it is only been 6 weeks. I see so many people getting relief after 2 weeks. Also, loads of people are being tested for mycoplasma and ureaplasma. They also can have the same symptoms. I do not have any white patches or fissures, so they took a biopsy from two different areas just to be sure. \n\nAnyway, I hope you can find relief. I feel like zinc cream helps with the itch quite a bit, but it is pretty messy! So... a couple of days ago I was examined by a very competent Vulva-specialist, and she concluded that I suffer from Vulvodynia... so that pretty much explains why the treatment for LS did not work very well... So I have been mistreatet for LS in over 4 years... she did not even have to take a biopshy to conclude that I suffer from Vulvodynia and not LS. When I was teenager I also thought that I suffered from Vulvodynia, but no doctor would confirm that... So I was right, after all... Wow that is amazing! I am so glad you finally found a doctor that knows what they are doing! I got a call from the nurse at the biopsy and she told me it looks like I most likely have eczema. No signs of LS on my results. That is insane that you have been treating for LS all this time, that was my fear \u2014 that I would be wrongfully diagnosed. The steroids are pretty horrible if you are using them for the wrong thing. I am just lucky I have not been treatment myself as long as you! Here is where following your gut instinct and knowing our bodies well really comes in to play and this is a great example. I am really happy you kept searching and finally can get the help you actually need. I have been following my gut my entire journey and not accepting all kinds of things and it got me so far. I hope others read this and learn from this as well \u2014  thank you so much for sharing! It is such a good thing that you also keep on fighting!\n\nUnfortunately I had a lot of other stuff to deal with in my life the last years, so that made it even harder to listen to myself and fight for answers... I really also convinced myself that I had LS and the weird symptoms that I experienced was because of the fact that LS also can be experienced very individually and in various difficulties etc.\n\nBut at last I did not give up! And it is such a relieve to finally know why I had these very odd symptoms. Often I thought that I had some kind of disease that was so extremly rare that it was not discovered yet... and it made me so depressed... \n\nI have shared my story in a new post on this reddit page.\n\nI hope you will get the right diagnosis much sooner than I! So glad you shared your story for others. As I was diagnosed with eczema I also had itching. Maybe it is eczema too. A biopsy is great to rule things out honestly.", "treating regardless of biopsy? has anyone had a negative biopsy but a doctor that treated them for LS regardless? \n\ni first went to a derm who between 2 biopsies and 5 visits still could not figure out what was wrong (she also seemed relatively uncomfortable in this area). \n\ni went to a new gyno for a separate issue and she brought up LS before i did, but said since my biopsies were negative it could probably be ruled out, but now has no answer for what it could be. \n\ni am thinking maybe my derm biopsied in bad areas or something? i have had essentially every LS symptom, started April/May of 2020. \n\ncurious if anyone followed steroid treatment for LS without official biopsy confirmation? My grandmother had many inconclusive biopsies for suspected LS and got treated with clobetasol. Recently she was finally diagnosed with Zoon's vulvitis. \n\nI think if the biopsy is negative or inconclusive, the doctor has to use their best judgement and decide based on symptoms, history, appearance, etc. It sounds totally plausible to me that your previous doctor choose a poor place to biopsy, especially if she was uncomfortable looking closely at the vulva. I read that it is important to biopsy an older lesion because the histology is more characteristic than for new lesions, which tend to be non-specific. Also if you do not have lesions (white patches), it may be very hard to detect.\n\nI saw a dermatologist recently who wanted to biopsy me even though (or because?) she was obviously very uncomfortable and unfamiliar with vulvar anatomy. She told me my clitoris was my urethra so I doubt she would have had a good chance picking the right spot to biopsy. I refused the biopsy, not because I am against them, but because my grandmother said they were really painful and I read that they are unnecessary if the presentation is clear, and I think my vulva looks like pretty textbook LS, but the derm barely glanced at it while I was standing in front of her. If she had taken a good look with me on the exam table and then said I needed a biopsy I probably would have said yes. Anyway, she let me start clobetasol without the biopsy and \"see how it goes.\" I know in the pediatric setting they try to avoid biopsy and use expert examination instead. If they have no idea what else you might have, and you are suffering a lot of symptoms, I do not see why they would not consider trying out a steroid ointment. Most of the differential diagnoses for LS are treated with steroid ointment anyway. I have never had a biopsy, in fact my doc only brought up the possibility for the first time after ~4 months of not responding to clobetasol. I think they will probably offer you a topical steroid, and you should probably give it a try to see if it helps. Lots of skin conditions can be treated with topical steroids, so whether it is LS or not is almost a moot point. And regarless make sure you are moisturizing, Aquaphor healing ointment or coconut oil. Best of luck! Whoa that is awful. If someone was looking at my vulva and called my clit a urethra I would pull on my panties and run. My first biopsy did not show LS. It was a few doctors later who diagnosed me with LS without biopsy. Suffered for years. Once I started with Clob, I was finally getting relief from bouts of sleepless nights scratching. I have a negative LS biopsy that confirmed I had evidence of lichenification consistent with Lichen Simplex Chronicus (just a non-specific diagnosis for thickening of the skin due to itching). It is weird because I do not have an itching problem but do have LS symptoms... but my doc said that if I did have itching she would still have me on clobetasol, just less often than if I had LS. Got To be careful with corticosteroids because they can cause thinning of the skin, but I think it was like 1x a week or something to prevent further scar tissue formation and worsening of the problem. Hope that helps, and good luck!! And hows your symptoms now? How are you treating it and are u in remission now? Nope. I have never had any improvement in the skin around my clitoris or between labia majora and minora after 4 months of clob. I have now developed symptoms of Cushing's disease, so I had to quit the clob, and my doc decided I might be allergic to petrolatum so I have had to quit the only moisturizer that really worked for me. I have been trying borax in a sitz bath for about a month, but I think it is BS. Possible I do not have LS so they want to biopsy, but no other real ideas about what it could be. Absolutely miserable, constant pain, have not been able to have sex since last June. Do not worry though, it is rare to be like this, 90% of people respond to clob and few have side effects. I am just really fucking unlucky I guess. I have been on the clob for less than a month, so I think it is too early to tell. I also do not have super salient symptoms like itching, just occasional pain. I am more worried about the changes in my vulva (clitoral phimosis, disappearance of inner labia) which are probably going to stop progressing rather than be reversed. And you are completely fine now? I think my symptoms are in remission so I am not actually using the Clob cream these days wow, yikes i would absolutely run out of that dermatologist. the derm i saw did prescribe clobetasol at first but said to stop using it after a couple days when they got the first biopsy back. i am going to give it another shot, more consistently and see if it helps at all! thank you for the response aquaphor has been my absolutely life saver these past 10 months!! luckily i do have clobetasol prescribed from before they got my biopsy back so i am going to give it another try! thank you really hoping that it will help me the same way! it is been 10 months now and i am so so frustrated and sick of it :( It will!

I have been prescribed steroid cream and apply it to the affected areas. I was wondering if this is efficacious on stopping or reversing the spread of LS even if only applied to already infected skin. Throughout the progression of this I have had little if any red irritated skin. It seems to simply be the white scarring that progresses slowly. Will applying the cream work or is it only for red itchy areas? I am a female with LS. My understanding is steroids are used to stop the spread and prevent it developing into cancer. You should contact your doctor for more info. Short answer is yes. I use Betamethasone ointment and it is removed thick white scar tissue from underside of my glans. Yes it took a long time. It sloughed off a layer at a time over a year or so.\nAs other poster pointed out using the treatment also lowers to normal the cancer risk. Yes. I apply it all over my vulva and soak beforehand because LS thickens the skin. When you soak, your skin softens and the ointment better penetrates to the basement layer of your skin which is where LS starts. I am in remission because I applied the steroid as my doc said. Every night for one month, every other night for one month, and twice a week forever! I apply it every mon. and thurs. my skin is back to its normal color again! And also I do not have irritation and I know that my cancer risk is significantly lower now that I am using it Thanks for the reply. I got prescribed a steroid cream but I know there are different kinds. Do you know of they all work fairly similarly? I might try and book a consultation with a leading Derm for Male LS in the uk. I would like to make sure I am on the best course rather than having to change treatment and lose ground There are different kinds of high potency steroids that are effective, but you are going to want an ointment and not a cream. Creams rub off easily and really do not treat LS the way they need to. You can ask for Clobetasol Propionate 0.05%, or Bethanethasone diproprionate 0.05%. The second one is what got me in remission.", "28/M-LS Given Clobetasol that says not to put it on genitalia or folds.. Kind Of difficult to get myself to apply it when it says to not apply it in that area. \n\nIs anyone currently using Clobetasol on male LS? Yes, reason being is because it thins the skin.

I am contemplating whether I should get circumcised or not. Fear losing all the sensation and a possibility of a messed up sex life Yeah already circumstanced at 8 years old for a different medical reason but getting fat must have pushed it back down. \n\nHere is to hoping the latter does not happen. So perhaps another circumcision for you to remove that extra foreskin which is causing LS? I know for a fact that a properly done adult circumcision cures LS in men, my urologist and 5 different dermatologists have mentioned this to me I guess my biggest issue will be finding GTA on PS1 again to pass the time while it heals.\n\nI will bring it up with the doc at the next appointment. \n\nFrom what I remember it was not a big deal. Op does it cause you severe pain or crazy itch or is it mainly a visual issue? It used to itch but it does not anymore. No pain but retracting the foreskin was restricted a smooth as normally and seemed like it.\n\n\nAlready now seeing some improvement with retracting. Still very much a visual issue. It is almost transparent which does not look ideal. When it was itching was it an ongoing severe itch or just occasional time to time mild itch?\n\nAll the best to you sir! I do not think I would call it ongoing severe.

There is this clinic  from Dr. Newman where he said his treament is so great for LS. I called there like 1 year ago and they told me that for women this treatment seems to work amazing but for men they have only treated like 3 or 4 without great results. So you have to be careful about what you read also.\n\n&gt; Then there is a italian Dr. named  Francesco Casabona  where he claims that his treatment is the best. His treatment is PRP and what I have read over the internet is that is not so great for treating LS, anyway he wrote me about 6 months saying that he have treated tons of men with LS having amazing results. You have to be some kind of suspicious about what they say and what they write in their websites. The only way I would get a treatment like these is having a conversation with a real patient that had LS before and after he is perfect because of the treatment. And honestly I havent found anything about it on the internet (including forums). We have to consider also that LS in men and someone else said in this post is very rare. LS is a lot much more common in women than in men.\n\nSource: \n\nI wonder what to make of this. This is an interesting post and I kind of agree - there does not seem to by info of successful treatments of male patients with PRP / native stem cells ...\n\nSo has any male around here been successfuly treated with these methods or do you know anyone who has? Sorry I cannot help with treatment for males other than my sincere condolences for the struggle. I follow a FB group for women with LS and several have had Dr. Newman\u2019s PRP. They seem happy with it and do not regret the enormous cost (up to $10k with travel and treatment). PRP seems to be widely used for many conditions now. The main concern expressed about Newman is lack of clinical trials. It is an excellent sign that he is not a total quack bc he was frank about his experience with males. As you may know, PRP is the  \u2018vampire facial\u2019 made widely known by the Kardashians.  I was diagnosed with LS just 9mo ago and often feel desperate enough to try anything. Good luck to you. xo  &gt; bc he was frank about his experience with males\n\nIs there somewhere where I can read about his experience with males? Did not find it.\n\nThank you for kind words, I am not yet diagnosed, have an appointment soon. I have other auto-immune problems and some symptoms that could point to LS.\n\nI wish everyone here the best! Still if some male knows about concrete results of these treatments or knows where to read more, please share! Oh did I misread this?

Hi everyone! I am 24f diagnosed with LS at 21 after having it flare for a year without diagnosis, during which time it got pretty bad pain-wise, probably because (CW: abuse) I associated sex with pain anyway due to an abusive relationship in my late teens, and did not think to tell my new (lovely) partner to stop when it flared up for the first time and was hurting like hell. Thanks to treatments, I am much more comfortable now\u2014my anxiety (GAD) can cause flare ups, but I can comfortably pee, exercise, enjoy some sexual activity, wear jeans, etc, again, and my skin is no longer white and has not changed architecture since. Anyway, overall, as described, I think I have had a pretty successful experience with clobetasol and protopic; I am not in remission, per se, because I still need to use it 4x a week and have minor itching/have to be somewhat careful, but I am okay. Until\u2026 I have to get a Pap smear. It hurts like hell! Not so much the smear itself (the inside feels okay), but the metal speculum makes the skin around the entrance hurt so bad, and then it makes the entrance tighten up, which makes it all worse. Does anyone have any advice for making these more bearable? Any prep you can do beforehand? I have sensitive skin anyways, so I am not sure what moisturizer to try or how to help the skin stretch better! Thank you and hope you are all doing as well as can be :) Sounds like a rough time; I am glad that you have been doing so much better!\n\nFor pap smears, it may help to find a good gynecologist that has gentle hands. Tell them before starting the procedure that you have had severe have pain with pap smears. I have heard some are very understanding about abuse/trauma history and are able to accommodate it. And obviously they need to be aware that you have LS. I would ask them to use the smallest speculum and a plastic one or one that has been warmed up, if possible. They should go slow and check in with you. \n\nAnother trick I heard to help yourself relax is to do a long, strong kegel right before they insert the speculum. This makes your muscles tired and less able to reflexively tense up. I have done that for the last one or two pap smears and I think it helped. It is also useful for inserting tampons, which has always been difficult for me. (F54) I eas diagnosed Oct.2020.

I am worried it is just going to absorb into my clothes instead.\n\nThanks so much. My doc said that it is mostly absorbed after ten minutes, so it can be cleaned off then - for what it is worth. I wonder if you are using too much, though - the greasy feeling is pretty mild for me and does not last for hours. And it needs to be kept to the inner parts with no natural hair. What do you mean inner parts? My white discolouration is not in my vulva area, it is below/around that and down toward my bum too. \n\nThank you! You should not feel greasiness after a couple of hours..you might be using a bit too much. If it is the ointment and not the cream, use about a pea-sized amount. I find that it is best to use after bathing and drying the area. Rub it in very well. I have LS in the same area (near my bum) and once it is rubbed in, I do not feel any stickiness or greasiness after about a half hour. Hey there!  Yeah, we keep hearing this about the prescriptions and doctors not providing explanations. Come join us on FB where we have several articles explaining, in plain detail, exactly how to appy clobetasol.  ( Even the pea-sized amount we are instructed to use a SMALL pea as it spreads to a lot of area even in that small amount. It should not ever feel greasy, in fact, you really should not feel it is there.  Are you a member in our FB group?  I posted the link in a comment in this thread. I use about a pee size amount for my entire lady bits including the hood and clit, when I have a flare up. Although I will apply more if needed. I have the cream and never really felt the greasy feeling though. So I am assuming you have the ointment? If you are uncomfortable using the ointment can you instead get a prescription for the cream which in my case absorbs very quickly. Thanks - I am going to join that group! The cream has more ingredients and has caused irritating affects on me. Ointment should only be greasy for an hr or two. Far superior to the cream. Male here but same feeling/issue. The foreskin covering the glans makes it so that the greasiness stays until i wipe it off or take a shower. I thought it was just normal... No worries it can be there too, I have had some in that area. I would agree with everyone else, use very little. It is strong stuff. I use a tiny tiny amount.", "Supplements Can I take aswhaganda with LS?", "Lichen Sclerosus Male Circumcision Hi,\n\n**Background:**\n\nI am 20(M) and have been diagnosed with LS four years ago. Started with common symptoms like itching, pain, phimosis and skin-tearing and that is when I went to seek medical attention. My first doctor did not know what it was but gave me an antifungal cream which for some reason removed most of the symptoms and then referred me to a dermatologist who diagnosed me with LS and prescribed me with a strong topical corticosteroid cream. From this point on, I have never had any \"flares\" with the first symptoms again (itching, pain, etc.) but I still used the cream because of white spots and red (inflamed) areas of the skin. However, after having used this cream for like three years, my skin had been thinned out a lot and that is when I went to a new dermatologist who told me to stop use the cream (for some reason the first dermatologist, who I went to see a few times a year, did not notice this...) He also saw that I had a quite severe case of skin adhesions (basically the foreskin attaches to the glans) and so he referred me to an urologist who thought that a circumcision would be a good option for me. Having had all these problems for so many years (thinned-out skin as well as the skin adhesions) I decided to go through with the procedure. I am now into the healing phase of circumcision.\n\n**My questions:**\n\nSo, now to my questions. I am still healing from the circumcision but I wondered about how the circumcision will affect the state of my LS? Is there any guys out there who have went through with circumcision and gotten rid of the LS? Has it gotten worse? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sorry if this is not the right place for this post. I am fairly new to Reddit and could not find a subreddit (?) for only male cases of LS and understand if this post is completely irrelevant to some of you females out there (which I have read are more likely to get LS). \n\nThanks in advance for any answers! There is some very good success stories on here and Facebook of circ's putting it into remission for decades. Let us hope you are one of them.\n\nDo not worry re male female ls, we are all in this crappy thing together my man.\n\nHow is recovery going? Once the circ scar area heals completely this is hopefully where you will be pain free for the long term. Make sure to use a good emoilient cream to keep the skin healthy. Also balneum plus is good too. Oilatum for showers and baths.\n\nGet it into your morning shower and hopefully it will be no more than routine like brushing your teeth buddy!! Circumcising is highly likely to be curative. You might possibly need to use steroid creams for a while just to assist with the healing process. I wish you all the best. Great to hear and thanks for your answer!\n\nRecovery is tough, had complications with my first surgery (heavy swelling) so I had to do a few more (four in one week). Therefore, my recovery will take longer than usual. Has been like three weeks and I still have weekly check-ups where a doctor puts on bandage. Will probably be a few months before things are back as usual. Cannot really see the scar-line atm but will use something like vaseline once things look better, that should work as an emoilient? I do not have Balneum Plus in my country, what is that? I will use perfume-free soap when I can start showering as usual, my doctor recommended that at least. Because of the bandage, I cannot really shower as usual now since it is not good to get the bandage wet. Exactly, I talked to my dermatologist before the surgery who said that I might need to use it afterwards as well. However, he prescribed me a less strong steroid cream. Thanks a lot for your answer and support! So your issue is many an appearance issue and since starting the treatment you never had pain or crazy burning? Well, because of my usage of the steroid cream, the skin got much thinner and this caused me pain. It did not help that most of this thinning occurred on the foreskin, which, combined with the skin adhesions was not comfortable at all. I have had some burning at the urinary meatus, although I am not sure if this is due to LS or something else.. I would say that the major problem, and the reason for the circumcision was the skin being very thin and the adhesions.", "Knowledgeable doctor in Northern Virginia?

Not a dr, but LS commonly treated with clobetasol ointment. Is this what she gave you? Yes, that is what she gave me. I totally think you should see Dr. Krapf, she is very knowledgeable but at the end of the day, all she will give you is clobetasol. She does not have the keys to any secret special potions. I would begin the clobetasol, and use it 2x a day until you feel better and then taper to once a day, every other day, and eventually get it to 2x a week maintenance. If you leave it untreated, it will only get worse.  they  recommend bathing for 20 min before applying and then rub in a pea size amount for 90 seconds, it helps absorb better. Glad the podcast helped! My regular gyn is pretty knowledgeable and I have relied on that podcast for supplementary info and other things to try, but I have been lucky I responded well to the steroid ointment. I think I am most confused about what specific areas I need to put the ointment on. And how important it is to get it only on those areas. I have ordered a hand mirror so I can see better, but I am not seeing really obvious areas, although I can feel areas of discomfort. Ok, great start! Use a qtip or your finger to apply where you see the white spots or where it is extra itchy/ hurty. If you start to see improvement, the. You know the diagnosis was correct and that you do not need a biopsy. My biopsy site still is tender so my recommendation is to avoid it if not totally needed.  My doc said daily for two weeks and then start cutting back.  If it touches nearby adjacent skin, it is ok, do not get upset by itx I was just diagnosed today and was prescribed TRIAMCINOLONE. She said it was \"easy peasy\" to treat. That is NOT what I have heard in my research. A little concerned. I follow up in two months. Yes, that is part of my concern too. My dr was very casual about it and that seems to run counter to everything I am reading. Thanks for your input. It is so helpful to hear from others dealing with it\u2014especially those who trust their doctors! Hi! Feel free to message me. I have been happy with the doctors I have seen here. Though I will note that they are an OB and a Dermatologist so if you are looking for a GP I am not 100% sure! I also second the commenters saying to start the clob. I got a clinical diagnosis and at that time was in so much pain I could not do pretty much anything. A month of clob and it started getting better! Not everyone sees overnight results so it is good to go ahead and start as soon as you can. (I was really glad I stuck with it.) Will do, thank you! I have started, on day three now. Fingers crossed! Hi, can I also have the dr names?", "Daily Lube and painful sex I am looking to get some help. I am 40 years old and have been with my husband for 12 years now and have a child together (c-section, could not vaginally because of LS). My husband has been very patient and understanding with my LS. I have had it for almost 30 years now, was misdiagnosed at 14 and had unnecessary laser surgery. \n\nIt seems to have gone into remission for the past couple of years but since we have recently tried to be more intimate, every time I get extremely sore and have a yeast infection. It seems as though any form of change down there whether it be shaving (which I have given up) or being intimate makes my vagina angry. I just went to the Dr\u2019s for an updated pap (using the smallest insert she had) she noticed that I am extremely dry but yeasty, which makes no sense. She recommended using lube all the time. I have tried the steroid creams in the past and they make things burn so I am wondering what anyone else uses as a daily lubricant that will not cause yeast? My husband and I have been intimate but have not been able to have sex. I am scared of the tearing all over again. We are working our way up to it, but I am just left sad and frustrated that I cannot have a normal enjoyable sex life. I do worry that one day he will have had enough and will find someone else who does not have any intimate issues. I am so sorry you are going through this! I have heard some women have luck with coconut oil as a daily emollient/lubricant, and think there are some posts about it here. Vitamin E cream (plain) or Aquaderm might also be helpful and available in trial tubes so you do not have a buy a giant tube of something that may not work.\n\nI use Aquaderm occasionally but if I use too much i find it can turn too liquidy and make me feel uncomfortably \"squishy\" or damp (I have issues with fissures that will weep and hate feeling damp as a result), so like everything YMMV.\n\nEditing to clarify: these are \"for comfort\" suggestions. For sex, I have heard good things about Sliquid and have used good old Astrogilde myself. Have you tried boric acid suppositories fo help with the yeast issues? \nI also recommend estrogen cream, vitamin e suppositories, v magic, borax soaks, and uberlube. I also want to try the ah YES brand. \nIf clob doesnt work for you, have you tried other steroids or a calcineurin inhibitor like tacrolimus to get your LS under control? My sex life was similar to yours prior to getting the right treatment, although I did not get yeast infections, that is doubly cruel! I hope you find a solution \ud83d\udc95 I am sorry you are struggling. I am new to this, but saw that you mentioned the steroid cream burning. I heard that the steroid OINTMENT is better because the cream has alcohol that makes it sting. So if you have not already done so, maybe try the steroid ointment instead? Thanks so much for the advice. I have never heard of the Vitamin E cream before and will definitely give that and the other lube advice a try. It is nice being able to talk to other people who are having or have had the same problems. These are all new things for me to try. Thank you! Just when you want to give up, you find alternatives to try. I have ordered some boric acid pills and fingers crossed that clears up the yeast. I have not used steroid creams in over 20 years. When I was a teenager I had laser surgery and was put under for it. I woke up butchered by the Dr and was left with more damage and scarring than when I went in. I was misdiagnosed at the time but I am worried that the steroid creams might thin it out even more. May I ask what worked for you? I am not opposed to trying the creams again. I am willing to try anything. Thank you for responding! I am so glad I came across this forum. I am learning a lot and the support is great too. I have not used steroid creams in 20+ years and would not even be able to remember which ones I tried but after reading other comments on the forums it sounds as though the clob ointment is very helpful and maybe I should give it another try. Creams can also be irritating because of extra additives like preservatives, which are needed because creams have more water in them. Ointments are definitely preferred for sensitive areas like the vulva. Of course! I am so sorry the laser treatment made you worse! When I was first diagnosed the combination of clobetasol ointment, estrogen cream, borax soaks, and (1-2) vitamin e suppositories prior were enough to make sex painless. It took time, maybe a 2-3 months of being very diligent with this routine to get there. For me, I used a very small amount (pea size) of steroid all around the area so I did not experience any skin thinning from it. The estrogen plumps things too. I am currently trying stem cell therapy which has been successful but expensive and has painful recoveries.. there are many paths to take with their condition I use cerave ointment and find it to be extremely helpful. It is in a blue tub. V Magic is amazing. You can get it on Amazon Cannot say if it prevented the yeast, but I was recommended coconut oil and vegetable glycerin as lube. Stopped after a while because it was too slippery for both of us. Recently told to use Aquaphor on a daily basis, so maybe that will help since I have not wanted to try sex for a while for obvious reasons.", "support group for LS   Have you joined? There is a lot of information on all sorts of treatments. Loads of supportive women. Thanks! Is there anything like this for the rare bunch of men who are dealing with this?

No hair really grows there and it seems scaly but not painful. It is itchy sometimes but usually stops when I stop wearing a thong and it is never been intensely uncomfortable/unignorable. No lumps and bumps. Basically it looks like severe chafing. I also had a bad habit of working out in lacy underwear that I really had to stop.\n\nAt one point it was worse but I stopped wearing too small/G string style underwear and it is been at a minimum lately. I always thought it was just my anxiety and terrible underwear choice but now I am not sure.\n\nHonestly I have a whole host of health issues that scare so I did not really get thinking about this but now I am worried. I have a history of Hashimoto's, which was treated by fully removing my thyroid (I also had cancer) and then giving me thyroid replacement hormone. I have been doing well with that for 7 years or so. \n\nI am just worried. I have not had sex yet (thank you covid) and the horror stories are a little much for me. Can someone tell me what labial fusion is and how I would know if I had it? \n\nI also kind of have large labia majori, which I read was normal but for fucks sake porn makes me feel otherwise and idk if something is wrong with me. In terms of sex drive, I feel fine and have not had pain from anything that was like fingering/toys.\n\nCan someone please help me out and reassure me about LS ?  could it be a very mild case maybe if it is not near my vuvla yet? Does LS come in flares or is it more of a slow burn thing? Does treatment work and am I ever going to have sex ? \n\nSincerely, \n\nA panicked hypochondriac Lichen sclerosus is not common, especially in younger women. On that basis alone, it is super unlikely that this is something you have. \n\nIt sounds more like you are having a reaction to environmental things - your undies, possibly other clothes or detergents. You could have a yeast infection causing some skin issues and itching - super simple to clear up. \n\nGenerally recommended for anybody with a skin issue to just wear cotton underwear- granny panties, if you must - for a while. Definitely not lace for workouts and definitely definitely not a thong or a g-string. Bacteria can work its way around from back to front - you do not want that. You would be better off in cotton or even no underwear under a long skirt for a while. Maybe save those for special occasions when your skin is not being weird. \n\nIf you had fusion you probably would not be able to play solo easily without pain - you are almost certainly fine there. \n\nYou should talk to your obgyn - they can see if it looks like yeast, chafing, or something else. \n\nAs far as treatment, yes, it is effective for many, so LS is unpleasant but not a death-sentence for a sex life.  But from what you are saying I doubt you have to worry about this one. You should see an obgyn and ask them - what is up with the white patches, is this normal, this itches, etc. But it is most likely they will tell you to pick up a package of monistat and stop wearing thongs, and you will be okay!\n\nNot a doctor here, so advice worth price charged. Hope you are feeling secure and comfortable soon. Hi, I am a 26 year old female and I was diagnosed with LS when I was 6 years old. I was deemed healed at 14 and then all of the sudden about a year and a half ago my vagina seemed to be irritated 24/7 and it was driving me INSANE!!! I went to a vulvar Dermatologist and sure enough the LS was back and I had to go back on steroid ointment. I recommend seeing this kind of doctor instead of an OBGYN because I cannot tell you how many times I was told it was just yeast and wrong underwear from the gyno. They are not familiar with LS and since it is so uncommon, it is not something they immediately jump to as the root of the problem.", "Question: Is there a subreddit where people with pelvic pain can get information from a healthcare provider that specializes in pelvic pain?

I am a longtime lurker and have finally decided to reach out\u2026 I am just curious, has or does anyone else here have constant vulva pain with touch? So about 2 years ago I noticed that I have soreness in the creases of my labia (between the inner and outer lips). This pain is there 6/7 days of the week with the occasional day off and occurs with touch. I have been sexually active before, with a condom and have tested negative for all std\u2019s (have not been tested for hsv1 or 2). My last sexual encounter was in 2018. I am unsure of why all of a sudden my vagina has done this. I thought it was a hormone problem, so I removed my hormonal iud in January of 2020. The iud also gave me recurrent BV for the 2 years i had it in. The pain did not change, but the bv eventually stopped. I got my hormones check in April of this year and everything was okay except I had lower than normal DHEA Sulfate. I do not know what to do and it has been weighing on me. My vulva appears just fine, except I have very prominent fordyce spots that also appear to have pain associated with touch. My GP always says everything looks fine and I get my pap yearly.  I do not know what else to do :( in the last year I also appear to have some clit pain every once in a while, say if I have been messing down there a lot. Any advice is appreciated The \"very prominent fordyce spots that also appears to have pain associated with touch\" you mentioned seemed to stand out to me.  Have you had more than one doc give you their opinion on that?  None, they are always there\u2026 it does not look abnormal in the slightest, but I do notice on the side that is worst the skin is much darker So you have always had them and they have always caused pain? Not always caused pain, but I have always had them This sounds more like r/vulvodynia. It could be a really bad flare too, have you used your steroid in the area? Hmm, so i take it you have had more than one doctor give their input on that matter already? I guess I was just wondering what the odds are that the fordyce spots could have been misdiagnosed.  IF only one doctor had made that diagnosis, then I would consider getting another specialized doctor's input on it just to be sure, and to put your mind at ease. So yes, I use hydrocortisone and it helps. I also have had severe excema on my arms in the past and I used the steroid cream from that (bad to do without doctor\u2019s supervision I know) on it and helped a lot. Do you think a dermatologist would be the best route? I agree it definitely sounds like vulvodynia. VVD is not a diagnosis exactly, kind of like \"headache\", but like a headache, it can be treated without having to know exactly what caused it. You might want to try a pelvic pain clinic if you can find one. My derm referred me to one but I have not gone yet. \n\nAs for LS, it sounds possible to me that what your GP thinks are fordyce spots are actually LS lesions. It is also possible to have symptoms of LS before any lesions show up yet. I think those areas you mentioned in between the inner and outer labia are a particularly common location for LS (but do not quote me on that). I also think that the BV could cause some nerve irritation that could last after the BV was gone, which I think is a common etiology for VVD. You can of course also get eczema on the genitals, although I guess you would know what that looks like. \n\nI would definitely try a dermatologist or experienced gynecologist. I would also suggest seeing a gynecologist instead of your GP for paps, BV, and other vulvo-vaginal and hormonal things if they come up in the future. I always got my pap smears and birth control from various GPs, and I am pretty sure I had LS for years and none of them noticed. They even reassured me that things were normal that were not. When I finally saw a gynecologist, she was surprised to hear that I would never seen one before, and that GPs \"even do paps anymore.\" I see a gyn derm and a gynecologist. Anyone who is a pelvic pain or vulvar specialist is ideal, but if you see a regular derm or gyn just make sure they treat genital skin disorders since often gyns do not know about skin issues and derms do not know about genitals and it is hard to find the right fit True story. The first derm I saw was definitely afraid of my vulva and barely glanced at it, and then tried to convince me my clit was my urethra. And my gynecologist referred me to her because she thought *she* was not competent enough to deal with a skin condition.\n\nHowever did you find a gyn derm?? Wow that is so bad! Like so so bad\ud83d\ude2c dont all doctors need to know basic anatomy like where the urethra is?? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI do not think there is a lot of gyn-derms out there, but they do exists and I have heard of others seeing them. The one I saw was Dr. Badger at Stanford. I was lucky that she was within a couple hours away from me, people apparently travel to see her Thank you for the input! I will start looking for a specialist in my area As I realized after I got there, she was actually a physician's assistant and not a doctor. But I am pretty sure even PA's \"should\" know what the urethra looks like.  \n\nThanks for the tip! Stanford is not near me, but I have a relative in CA with Zoon's vulvitis so maybe I will suggest her. Wait\u2026 it was a woman!?? I immediately assumed it was a man but this makes no sense. Her entire career in medicine aside, she does not know the difference between where she orgasms and where she pees from? \ud83d\ude2c\ud83e\udd23 wow. \nAnd yeah Dr. Badger is pretty old school but she knows her shit She seemed afraid to look at mine, despite it being her job, so I bet she is one of those people that never looks at her own. In fairness, we were discussing a picture I was showing her when asking about how to apply the ointment, so the image did not have full geographic context I suppose, and my poor phimosed clitoris is not 100% typical-looking. Still does not look like a urethra, though. \n\nAfter the disagreement, she googled imaged it to try to explain to me where I pee from, but I guess she realized she was wrong and then she just let it drop. Pretty awkward.  Not uncommon for gynos or dermatologists to be clueless about LS. Find one who knows how to diagnose and treat it.", "LS on breast Last year I was diagnosed by biopsy with LS on my breast near my nipple. I noticed my first spot about 4-5 years back but did not see a doctor for it until a year ago. I am wondering if anyone else on this sub has experienced LS in places other than their genitals? What was your experience? My derm examined my genital area and did not see any sign of LS anywhere else but I am so paranoid it will flare up in places other than my breast. I would appreciate to hear if anyone has a similar diagnosis. Thanks I had LS around my nipples and around my mouth area. It just looked like ashy skin and itched a little. It was very mild. I did not even think it was LS for the longest bc it flared up rarely. Is yours entirely gone? I no longer have it on my lips and nips but I get flare ups on my vag once in a while due to weather or something strange When you were diagnosed was it in all 3 locations already? I was diagnosed like 5 or more years ago. I was undiagnosed for a solid 3 years bc my gyno kept calling me crazy for imagining symptoms that were not visible... \ud83d\ude12 but anyway, I had it in all three locations but after a good 2 months of using clob it went away. I have noticed that when my estrogen is low (due to birth control) I get a lot of flare ups. So I am careful with the type of birth control pills I take now. Can I ask what types of birth control pills you take that do not cause symptoms? I am considering changing mine to see if it helps but really would rather not come off them completely I take Junel 1.5/30 I think it is called. It is a \"medium\" pill. When I take Junel 1/20 my estrogen is too low. Lo loestrin fe was too low in estrogen also. Depo shots had no estrogen if i remember correctly and is the type I was taking that triggered my LS. Thank you! I am on the same dosage of pill also so I guess I might not need to worry.", "Does this look like lichen scleoris  Are you itchy/pain/burning?  Not too much but my skin feels dry and my clitoris is like dried out and not the same I think it is worth seeing a gyn and getting a biopsy.

What symptoms do you experience that make you think it is LS? Please mark this as NSFW NSFW!!!!!!! The fact my skin is turning pale. I think my labia minors is shrinking and my clit is weird as fuck Your skin does not appear pale, your labia minora appears normal, and your clitoris looks normal. I think that you are obsessing over an issue that does not exist for you. You have had a gyno, a GP, and a Dermatologist examine you and they all said that you do not have LS. I too, do not see it. I am not a doctor, however I am a nurse practitioner (specializing in cardiovascular) I am also looking at photos and cannot actually examine you in person. Are you certain that this could in no way be related to your HSV-1 diagnosis? You do not think it appears pale? Maybe it is cuz I am used to my vagina looking darker pink and this is weird for me. My clitoris up close is having lots of issues and decreased sensitivity. I want to believe I am obsessing truthfully. My labia minors is shrinking compared to before. Is it possible I have low estrogen? Because I had pain during sex and cuts but going off my low estrogen BC got rid of those. I think having HSV1 made me much more aware of my vagina if that makes sense leading to obsessing. Do you see LS often? Or do you have LS? I am just scared :( Honey. I can tell you are stressing yourself the fuck out. From someone with LS, nothing looks wrong with your vulva at all. Doctors will not perform a biopsy because nothing is wrong. You need to relax.\nI see that you just came off of birth control after a long time. Hormonal birth control can cause darkening of the nipples and genitals. Since you are coming off of it, your skin is lightening.\nNone of your photos look like you have lichen sclerosus.\nI think your skin is just dry and you are getting freaked out about your body changing since coming off of birth control. All of the symptoms you have are normal for coming off of birth control after a long time of being on it.\nUse vitamin E oil on your genital area for the dry skin and stop worrying please Ugh yoire a fucking angel and thank you for going through my posts and listening.

Maybe a month or two ago a doctor I went to see suggested I had LS and put in a referral to see a specialist, sadly, however the appointment is not until the end of September. is there anything I can use in the meantime? I am not overly itchy like I was during that really bad flare up that caused me to go get it checked out but the itching and dryness is still mildly annoying when it does happen. I am not sure where you are but if you can get hydromol ointment and use it in the shower, it will help the dryness which in turn will help the itching a little. As for the itching, I have an emergency tube of Eurax just in case! Best to run it past your doctor first in case there are any complications that could arise from using it though. Coconut oil! I find it calms the occational itch I get and protects the skin. My gynecologist recommends it too. I use the clobetasol once a week now for maintenance and coconut oil the rest of the week when I remember it, especially before bed and after showers. A&amp;D ointment helps too I used shea butter before I was diagnosed. I have been using castor oil in the place of my prescription, as I have not been able to get to a doctor for awhile. It is been really helpful. My doctor said cortizone 10 is a good alternative to keep things at bay in a more mild dosage than clobetasol, but as with all steroids, you should use it as needed to clear the flare-up and then dial your usage back to once or twice a week in order to prevent skin thinning side effects. Depends if you are male or female. But an emollient like Epaderm is recommended for daily use to moisturise and form a barrier. A soap free washing agent (e.g., E45) is encouraged. For flare ups steroid ointments and creams are prescribed, but you will need to wait to see your doctor for those.

My dad has psoriasis and they thought he had toe fungus for years when it was just nail psoriasis all along. Psoriasis can definitely cause itching in the genitals. (Psoriasis is also associated with lichen sclerosus; I have both.) Lichen simplex is a possibility especially if you have been itching and scratching for a long time. Lichen sclerosus and lichen planus also, the latter especially if you have itching inside of the vagina. What is your doctor's specialty? You might want to try seeing a dermatologist if she is not one. \n\nI wonder if the cream helps at night in part because it is moisturizing. I would definitely suggest moisturizing with a bland unscented moisturizer and skipping underwear whenever you can. Not wearing underwear, leggings, or tight pants helps me a lot. Thanks for the inputs!\n\nMy doc is a Gynecologist, and she was mainly interested in the vaginal flora, where I do not have any issues. But maybe if I go back now she will expand the options cause she went for the simple solution.\n\nSeems strange that topical Clotrimazole helps but oral Fluconazole does not have an effect. Any other ointment helps less. Doc gave me something bland, I try to keep using it, but if it does not have an effect, motivation is low.\n\nI have the toenail issue since I am 12, so do my grandma an my mum. None of us found a solution.\nIt only really became a problem after I started biking a lot (3, 4 years ago), but I ignored it back then. I think I should also try IPL - less hair means less shaving means less irritation.\n\nUnfortunately, nail psoriasis pics look quite like what I have, but only in the 2 big toe nails, nowhere else. Never wanted to believe psoriasis is an option.\n\nLichen planus is out of the picture I think. I was also wondering if it could be a fungus resistant to Fluconazole but responsive to Clotrimazole.", "Just got diagnosed 17M :( Nothing to ask, I knew I had it but I am still not happy about it, I will have to start steroid cream today twice a day for 4-6 weeks and then if it does not work we will try circumcision.\n\nI kind of want to cry but also I do not because this is just life right? I have had so much worse in my life in terms of diseases and stuff so what is one more. Luckily my case is mild so I do not have any pain or itchiness or anything.\n\nLet us hope the cream works I am 72 yrs old and been diagnosed for 18 months. I probably had this since pre-teen. I also have not been circumcised. \nI was first told I need to be circumcised then went to a urologist who said it was not necessary.\nIf this is due to phimosis be aware there are other treatments if you do not wish to be circumcised. My nephew in Holland had a surgical procedure to loosen the foreskin by cutting the goreskin, his brother said it looked like a castle. \nMy phimosis over the years has been caused by antibiotic use. The betamethasone cream I was prescribed cured this last problem in under a week.\nIf you ar ed in the USA be aware that there is a consistent opinion in the medical profession here for circumcision. In my experience I have only ever had a problem when given antibiotics,  this causes yeast infections. Knowing this you can apply over the counter cream either in advance or when symptoms appear. I was doing the latter, but last time I was left with the phimosis. \nI hope this helps. There are reasons to keep your foreskin that are ignored. I just wanted to wish you good luck. I am female, was diagnosed at 16. I am 24 now. Clobetasol has not completely made my flare go away but has helped tremendously. I also suggest taking a warm bath with a little hydrogen peroxide and baking soda a few times a week, especially before applying the clobetasol. It absorbs better.  Try to wear loose clothes and clean up after sweating. All cotton underwear is the best. Wishing you lots of luck!", "Thank you all! I was diagnosed a month ago and felt so alone!

For the most part I am fine, patchy white vulva but no pain.  But I do get flair ups that seem to coincide with having more sex than our normal pace.   I usually only apply my clobetasol when it hurts.  I wonder if I should use it more as a maintenance cream even when I am not sore. Today is a bad day, it hurts when I walk.  The only relief seems to be hot water from my shower head. I am pretty sure that is not a great idea but it provides short term relief. Any suggestions on short term relief? I will be applying my cream now on a more regular pace. I am hoping this flair up will be under control soon.  My gyno &amp; dermatologist recommended I use  Triamcinolone 0.1% ointment (Rx) 3x per week, at night, for \"maintenance\" since I have never had a bad flare up. Now that I am having one, my derm just called in Clobetsol for me - she said it was stronger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; Flair ups are awful. But I seem to respond well to clobetasol. I have also seem to have some success with diaper rash cream when things get really bad. It sort of calms down the itching.  Yes use more regularly. You want it to be in remission - pink skin not white patches. When you get to that stage use the clob for maintenance on a less frequent basis.  Also try zinc oxide cream to sooth the area Yes!! I have used zinc oxide. It is great. Girl I feel your pain. I just got over a flair up that took a total of 4.5 weeks for the clobetasol to totally stop the itching. During that time frame I used the cream and when it got painfully bad I used tea tree oil mixed with either a coconut cream or an olive oil base. Probably better to start with the coconut cream so it is not as strong at first. It takes a bit to get used to...may even burn at first. But then it goes away and totally takes the pain with it. Lifesaver for me and was in terrible pain. I also changed my diet to gluten free. It is an autoimmune trigger with Lichen Sclerosus.  Best plan of attack is to treat it from the inside out.  I do think I have to learn more about my trigger points, including foods that can aggravate the situation. Thanks for the advice.  There is not a lot of research for us.  It seems the Britts are on the ball. They even have a nationally published brochure. I have had it for 40 some years. The comments are all correct. The clob. use seems to be what works for you. We are all different  My gyno says to use Clobetasol 3 times a week, and states that I will likely have to use it that way for the rest of my life. So yes, you probably should be using it as a maintenance cream.

My gyncologist recommended it (her office does the procedure...). My dermatologist did not recommend it. So, that is what I know. Is it purely for repairing aesthetics or is it a treatment?  All treatment. Interesting.  I had only heard of it as an aesthetic surgery.  Do you have any links to information regarding it is use in treatment for LS?  I would really like to learn more, but I am only coming up with unrelated uses. Yes. I am relying on discussions with my gynecologist. Aesthetically, I do not like how I look but my partners are more than ok and I am in very stable relationships. The theory according to my gynecologist is that the clobatosol will work from within. I am will to try! I had this after giving birth to a very large baby. My pelvic floor was really weak. It helped considerably, but a side effect I think is nerve damage.

Could be clitoral fusion. I had that. After about 8 months of pain and tearing from over cleaning (before I was diagnosed) I finally went to my family doc. Diagnosed on site and started the process of seeing another 3 docs for further confirmation.\n\nMy fusion is gone now after using clob. Scarring is still there though and the color is light pink instead of dark pink like the rest of the area. That definitely sounds like LS to me. I have had a very similar experience, and my LS is on my clitoris. \n\nClobetesol, prescribed from your doctor, will definitely help. Then I recommend figuring out a long-term way to manage your symptoms. Some things that work for me: reducing stress that can cause flares, avoiding underpants if possible or wearing 100% cotton, natural remedies like emu oil. Definitely sounds like something that could be due to LS. It is not normal for sex to hurt, even for people with vaginas. Did your doctor start you on clobetasol? I imagine if you respond to it, it would be very likely that this symptom would improve, too. yes i have been using clobetasol twice daily for six weeks and now i am down to once a day for the past 2 weeks but i am still having this :( it comes and goes so maybe it is due to stress/not being aroused enough? i have been seeing my gyn every 3-4 weeks and he never mentioned anything about the clitoral tissue, but i will definitely ask about it next time. did find anything to help ease the pain when it was happening? thank you for replying! i have been using clobetasol twice daily for 6 weeks and now i am down to once daily for the past 2 weeks. i have a feeling it is due to stress so i am going to try to keep an eye on that. would using emu oil help with this type of pain? or is it more for maintenance to avoid flare ups? emu oil is more for maintenance, but I know some women use it in lieu of clob and have found it to be successful! I am scared I have LS on my clitoris nothing is helping it and I cannot get a diagnosis", "21 (Male) with pinhole phimosis Hi there, \n\nI have pinhole phimosis and what I believe is scar tissue around the opening of my foreskin. From what I have read that is pathological phimosis and is more complicated than your standard phimosis condition. I have been using the phimocure rings for about 2 and a half months. At first, I saw some progress for the first month but after moving up two sizes, progress started to slow down significantly and I do not see the phimotic ring really expanding after all of the stretching. I wear the phimocure rings for about an hour and a half in the morning, noon, and before I sleep. Is there anything that I am not doing properly? Because I would like to get this resolved without having to resort to surgery. Hi. Do you think you have LS?  The obdurate ring of scar tissue might indicate LS and pinhole phimosis would create the conditions where penile LS is more likely to be seen.\n\nStretching of the foreskin where LS is active is likely to make your situation worse as the stretching is likely to cause further micro tears and scarring.\n\n I would strongly suggest that stop stretching and book an appointment with a dermatologist with penile LS experience. In the meantime, stop washing with soap, use a fragrant free emollient wash such as e45 and moisturise the foreskin and glans, to the extent possible, with a bland moisturiser such as Epaderm. Also try to the extent possible to ensure that urine is not trapped under the foreskin. Maybe using a plastic syringe - no needle! - to flush after urinating would be helpful. \n\nPenile LS is often diagnosed without a biopsy. If it is identified you will be prescribed a course of Dermovate or ultra potent steroid cream. Unfortunately your pinhole phimosis is likely to complicate treatment. The dermovate itself might well reduce the foreskin tightness to some degree without stretching. Also a dermatologist could prescribing Betanovate to assist with stretching if LS is not present or when in remission. \n\nI am advocating approaching a dermatologist in the first case as LS is a skin disease and there will be a tendency amongst urologists to focus on surgical options in the first case. \n\nTreatment of penile LS with steroids is c.60%+ effective in causing full remission. The current main theory around the cause of penile LS is the retention of small amount of urine within the foreskin in main with a \u201cpredisposition\u201d to the disease, most commonly some sort of autoimmune condition, although it would be fair to say not a lot is known for certain. \n\nI wish you all the very best. I have really thought about whether I have LS/BXO. I visited my general physician and he said to me that I do not have it and that I should continue manually stretching (I plan to upload photos later) after applying clotrimazole to the affected area for a week (which I did). Thankfully it does not look too inflamed which has me to believe that there might be hope to fixing this. I really do not want to have to get cut. First comment is the scaring I had from tears due to phimosis disappears in time. I asked my dermatologist about this and she said yes that happens due to type of skin cells there.\nNext. There is a procedure to cure this without circumcision,  my nephew had this done in Holland.  Cuts are made around the opening and when healed the opening is restored to normal size. I dont know the official name. \nHope this helps That is a preputioplasty I believe. The scar tissue that I believe I have does not look too horrible nor does it look inflamed a lot. I got it checked out by my GP and he said it looks fine. I have considered looking into it as a last resort kind of thing. I am from the United States and I am not entirely sure if they offer such a service there. Also did your nephew have any issues after the procedure? Preputioplasty can work in adults is the tightness of the foreskin is a function only of the phimotic ring, and ideally the finer the better. If the foreskin is tight generally it is, unfortunately, less likely to be successful. \n\nRe tears and scaring, I would agree with lahend entirely as long as LS is not present.\n\nIf you are comfortable that LS is not present, see your doctor again to reconfirm and ask for a prescription for betanovate/betamethasone to facilitate the stretching. \n\nMy impression, from the UK, is that US doctors are less informed about non circumcision options given the frequency of RIC in US. In Europe we are generally not keen on circumcision generally with some countries actively discussing banning RIC for any non medical reason. Addendum: I would still see a dermatologist. LS can have atypical presentation and again the frequency of RIC in US would reduce the likelihood of a GP seeing penile LS frequently. Exactly the problem I have faced here in the USA. GP I went to in early 1980's with an adhesion tear told me to put antibiotic on it, that caused a fungal infection ! Absolutely no clue !\nMine was diagnosed by my dermatologist who took a lump of my backside. Later she gave me betamethasone for my tight foreskin. Then 2 yrs later I complained about a adhesion tear and she examined me and said the ointment didnt work before!  I said I only used it for the tight foreskin for 3 days. She then said you have LS and I thought you knew ! So finally a diagnosis and treatment! Not as far as I know. The communication line was to his brother in UK, to my daughter here in USA, to my wife to me. He is married to a Dutch doctor so gets excellent direction ! The question I would like to put at first is: Why do you neccesarily want to get your foreskin open? Do you have concrete problems with the current state?   \nPlease do not get me wrong, I do not mean to provocate, it is a honest question. If you actually can live with the current state without any problems, why change it? Is it about hygiene? That is also possible with pinhole phimosis.   \nAre you concerned not to be able to have enjoyable sex? Believe me, you are! \n\nBefore you totally stress yourself and think about surgery or how to avoid it, the first question should be: Does it absolutely need to get changed? It is mostly for hygiene reasons. My foreskin balloons up when I urinate and it can be quite uncomfortable. I am not too concerned about my sex life just yet, but I do want to clean down there without running into issues in the long run. I understand that. But you really can feel calm about that.   \nParticularly if your foreskin balloons the space between foreskin and glans gets flushed completely. It may sound ugly but urine is sterile until it leaves the body and gets contact with oxygen.   \nAnd as I told before, while showering or bathing water gets inside the foreskin too and flushes the area so there is absolutely no need to get concerned. \n\nMaybe the ballooning foreskin makes you need to sit to pee but think by yourself, would THAT be a reason to change the current state at any cost? I do not think so. Whilst I agree with you sentiment that if it works etc...  However Frostychimp has expressed a concern re LS specifically. Untreated LS can caused material damage, making sex uncomfortable and, in the worst case, causes urethral strictures and materially increases the risk of penile cancer, which in normal circumstances is extremely low. So whether he chooses to stretch or not, it would be worthwhile making sure that LS is not a factor.", "Update from the last post still no response from my gyno and I fear it is getting worse ", "Weird request- but people with vaginas please help I have had LS for years- it is flaired on and off.

I had inflamed tissue just inside my vagina that my NP thought might be hymen tissue that healed funky, creating a pocket causing recurrent infections and lots of vaginal pain. I got a call from the nurse saying I had lichen mucosa and said my NP was prescribing Clobetasol to use as needed and to follow up in a month. I was super confused, but made the follow up appointment, picked up the Clob, and did a quick search on lichen mucosa... which comes up with nothing. Did not see related at all to what I was experiencing. I was nervous to use the steroid cream because it clearly states external use only and I did not want to put it inside my vagina. I went to my follow up appointment Friday where my NP said I have lichen sclerosus. She gave me an Premarin cream to use for a week on my labia which she said \u201clook chapped\u201d. And then to use the Clobetasol for at least two weeks after and then to continue use until I notice a relief in symptoms. She did a blood draw for Estrogen levels to see if that is worsening my symptoms and said to follow up in a month. \n\n\nAnd I am feeling really lost and confused. I guess when she said that I had this chronic thing that she would sit down and explain it, how it would effect my life, possible life style changes to look for, what worsening symptoms to look for... maybe a pamphlet or something. \n\nAfter googling lichen sclerosus and do a quick reddit search I was able to find a lot more information that has calmed some of my fears and created a whole bunch of new ones.\n\nI am confused about whether LS causes tissues to thicken or thin? Because of tears (which I believe the inflamed spot that the biopsy came from was the result of a tear) can I still use vaginal dilators? I also do not have any white patches so I am not sure where I am meant to put the Clob. My labia are clearly experiencing inflammation and dryness. But my biopsy occurred internally, which means the lichen is present in my vagina not just externally. I asked my NP about how to use the steroid but she did not really give me a clear answer. I am also pretty sure that I have had two tears in the anal area. They felt like paper cuts, healed after about two days. Should I be using the Clob back there? Can I still takes baths? What type of underwear should I wear? Can I go swimming? Also... the Premarin is not providing any relief... none whatsoever. So should I be using the Clob along with it? Hi! I do not have the internal symptoms but have the rest. I had a lot of the same questions early on. Here is a few hopefully helpful answers from my experience but of course keep checking in with your doctor:\n\nI use the steroid treatment on any area with symptoms\u2014anything painful, itchy, etc\u2014in the region, even if the skin does not have white patches, since you can have LS without seeing white patches.\n\nLS thins the skin and makes it weaker which in turn causes tearing and scar tissue, which is thicker. So it is kind of both thin and thick :/ \n\nthe fissures you have that feel like papercuts\u2014I used the clob on that because those likely are caused by LS too (the \u201cfigure 8\u201d pattern). Mine recurred though so I had to see a colorectal doctor who gave me a topical muscle relaxer which healed them up. I still do maintenance treatment w the clob there, though.\n\nAlso, I used the clob regularly (1-2x/day) for way too long because I saw a different doctor than my usual doctor, and that different doctor gave me some bad advice. (I now am careful to see my usual doctor!) the overuse of the clob made my skin thin and addicted to the steroid\u2014it would totally freak out if I tried to stop using it. I went to a dermatologist who prescribed me Tacrolimus to use as a secondary treatment. If you can, maybe see if you have a dermatologist in your area who is familiar with LS\u2014I see an obgyn and a derm about it and the combo is really helpful.\n\nFinally, the early stages are hard and confusing... and it IS a chronic illness, so flare ups happen even after the initial treatment is done (I know some people have remission, I never have, I am in my 20s and I have to use treatment 3 times a week to keep it under control\u2014which I consider not too bad compared to what it was before!!). It is definitely difficult to have this condition but when you get in a good rhythm with your treatment, it goes okay. (Early on I did clob 2x a day for few weeks, then 1x, then every other day, so to be able to not do it every day is a win in my book!) I add this because no one told me when I first got diagnosed that having to do \u201cmaintenance treatment\u201d is not a bad thing\u2014it is perfectly normal.\n\nAnd finally, you can use dilators! It helps to slowly stretch the skin. Just make sure you use lubricant because the skin is a lot more fragile.\n\nEdit: formatting was wacky on mobile Also, I recommend soft non-thong underwear with cotton lining! And swimming is ok as well as baths but try to avoid irritants, and make sure the skin airs out to dry afterward or gently dry with towel. \n\nAlso maybe ask your NP if you should use the clob on the labia\u2014I do and it helps loads, but best to check with the dr. My guess is that she gave you the Premarin to use alongside the Clobetasol. But I remember mine was \u201cchapped\u201d as well from the LS because the skin was so fragile, and after a few weeks of the clob it started looking much better!\n\nI hope this is sort of helpful\u2014ive had it for 3 years and am still learning new things all the time. Always ask your Dr questions when you have them! Yes to all of this!! I have also recently learned the clobetasol works better if you soak the areas in water for 10 minutes before applying. \nI have LS internally (inside my vagina) as well. It sucks and definitely causes painful intercourse but you are not alone! \nSee a dermatologist or gynecologist as soon as possible to give you better information. Does not matter which speciality, just make sure the doctor treats LS patients regularly and knows about alternative treatments like Mona Lisa Touch.  Thanks for responding! I am seeing my dermatologist in April and I am hoping she will be able to give me more answers. How much of the Clob do you use per use? Pea size? Also what do you use on your period? I use a pea size per affected area (so that much for both vulvar and anal regions). And make sure to gently rub it in enough! I do not get periods anymore because I started taking birth control continuously\u2014periods were definitely tough because both tampons and pads were irritants to me, being scratchy fabric. I wonder if a cup would be more comfortable tho I never tried it! Or maybe period panties! It is also been really hard to find an OBGYN. My OBGYN from back home(before college) retired and he was wonderful. My dermatologist is back home as well. I work at the only hospital in town on the postpartum unit so I work with every OBGYN in town and do not feel comfortable seeing any of them which led me to the NP that I am seeing right now. I am not sure how much she knows about LS but at least she is sympathetic and we were able to reach a diagnosis. These are good questions. I am sorry you are not getting more support and clarity from your doctor. If it makes you feel better, I got a pamphlet from my dermatologist, but it was still pretty useless! \n\nFor underwear, cotton or none (or maybe silk?). Definitely avoid synthetics. I also avoid tights and leggings, especially synthetic ones. I am trying thigh-highs with garter belts, not sure if I like it or not. \n\nYou can definitely take baths, but avoid bubble baths and scented soaps and things. Taking a bath before applying the ointment helps it absorb. My derm told me to take a bath three times a day but I think she is crazy. Use gentle, high fat soaps like Dove and wash gently with your fingertips, not a washcloth.\n\nI think you can probably go swimming, especially when you get symptoms under control. I think someone on here said it was fine for them as long as they dried off promptly afterward. Hanging around in a wet swimsuit definitely is not a good idea for anybody. I would just pay attention to how you feel afterward. Biking and horseback riding may also be a challenge. Personally I have always found biking painful.\n\n(Most of this lifestyle stuff is recommended to everyone with genital skin problems, not just LS.)\n\nWhen you say in your vagina, but near a hymen tag, I guess you mean right at the entrance to the vagina? It is generally accepted that LS does not affect the vagina, but a similar condition, lichen planus (LP) usually does. It is also possible to have both.\n\nMy guess is dilators are fine. The rule of thumb is stop if it hurts. I know dilators are regularly used to manage LP.\n\nI am likewise confused about the question of where to apply. When I asked the dermatologist, we got sidetracked into a disagreement where she insisted my clitoris was actually my urethra, so I did not get a clear answer on that. I allegedly have psoriasis on my anal area, but I think also LS, so I am not sure whether to put the clob there too, or not. As for putting it inside your vagina, I think that comes with risks of yeast infections, but it can be worth the risk sometimes. It is usual to put cortisone in the vagina to treat LP. I do not know about a steroid as strong as clobetasol, though. I think it is worth a follow-up call to your NP to clarify the details on that.  \n\nThe Premarin cream is an estrogen, right? Those are helpful if you have low estrogen (like in menopause for instance) but they do not treat LS by themselves. Typically, one would use clob twice daily for a couple months, then taper to a lower dose/frequency (but never stop completely), and use an estrogen cream concurrently and indefinitely. Estrogen by itself for LS is an outdated treatment. It helps the skin get thicker and stronger, but it does not fight the inflammation that drives LS.  \n\nIf you like getting the \"long version\" of things, you might like this book I read recently, the \"V Book\" by Elizabeth G. Stewart. It is pretty dated (from 2002) but it is a very comprehensive and helpful resource on vulvovaginal health. It covers LS and LP, and talks a lot about lifestyle changes and symptom management. It even has advice on how to talk to doctors. I have read a lot of papers and \"scientific\" sources about LS, but most of what I have written here is in that book. \n\nI hope you get some better info from your NP and find out what works for you. You might want to seek out a specialist; most general practitioners, and even derms and gyns, are woefully inexperienced with LS, let alone rarer vulvovaginal conditions.  The vaginal pain has created vaginismus that is preventing me from using the cup anymore. Which is a real bummer because I really liked using it. That is so valid. It is important to feel comfortable with the dr... and it is so great your GP listened to your concerns! I went undiagnosed for at least a year because no doctor believed me and my symptoms progressed so much during that time, it was excruciating. I hope your dermatologist appt is fruitful\u2014my obgyn diagnosed me (I moved cross country and found one right away luckily) but it was the dermatologist who really explained a lot of the nuances to me and came up with helpful methods to ease my symptoms and manage the disease long term. So hopefully come April you will get lots of helpful info!! Ahhh, it all just makes me super nervous. I was having yeast infections for a while last year from the one pocket of hymen tissue(or whatever it was). I have been clear on the last two Pap smears that I have had but definitely not interested in repeating that experience. \n\nShe drew labs for my estrogen levels but I guess I am surprised she did not draw for possible immune issues. But I am also on an estrogen birth control and have for years so I feel like it would be odd for my levels to be low. I guess that does seem odd. I imagine you are not in menopause if you are on birth control? No, I am only 24. I do not know. Maybe she has another reason? Some birth control causes low estrogen, but surely not regular estrogen-containing birth control.", "White patches on glans Hello (m/26)\nFirst post here!\n\nSo... after treating my inflammation I have noticed that I have no improvement in the discoloration! \nI am wondering if the white patches will ever fade away! \nAny experience or help in the subject?\n\nIm in a mental mess, and I will talk about this in my next consultation! Since I\u2018be suffering with extreme anxiety over this.\n\nThank everyone, I wish you well! Besides the white appearance, do you have crazy pain/itchiness? Or its just mainly an appearance issue? Just appearance issues rn, which I am glad My white patches took about 6 months of treatment to become 99% back to normal.  For me, the pigment loss was probably the slowest symptom to resolve itself, so dont get discouraged just yet. \n\n\nTreating the problem early &amp; properly will help, but stressing about it will not.  When I was first diagnosed with LS last fall, I thought my sex life would be over and I would basicaly be saying goodbye to my penis as I knew it.  Its a pretty scary thing to be diagnosed with, but its not as bad as it sounds if you take care of it before it gets too out of control.  \n\nI ended up having to take it a little bit easy on the intercourse for a while, but I dont have any kinds of issues from LS now. If i have one advice it would be to avoid urine coming in contact with the area. Continue the treatment and follow/ups. It takes time for things to fade just like how it took time to form. That is exactly what I am going through. \nEnded a 5years+ relationship couple months ago and I am thinking I will not be able to date any girl again bc I feel so self conscience about my glans appearance. I am glad I do not have itchy/burn sensations anymore (for now at least) but the cosmetic issue is affecting my mental health and I am pretty sure that does not help in the recovery. \nThat is why I am bringing that topic to my GP next consultation. \nI just want my pigment back  lmao\n\nAnyways, I will try to keep a positive attitude! That is make sense! \nI always wipe myself now to avoid any irritation! I am circumcised so it is easier (yeah I am that lucky being circumcised and have LS)  Well, I guess having no partner may be better than having one that wont support you through a challenge like this.  I am sorry to hear that it didnt work out though.\n\nIf you look on the bright side, the pigment loss is just a cosmetic thing, and its not really like a STD or anything.   At least you can weed out the shallow partners if they have an issue with it\ud83e\udd23.  Just dont let it affect your confidence, and you will find somebody who is supportive. Wise words!\nYou made me feel a little bit better! Ty so much!!! \nI will not lose my hope then,  since you said yours took about 6 months to disappear! I am basically on the beginning of the treatment I believe. Glad to help.  I also experienced rapid relief from itching and burning and stuff.  That stuff disapeared within a few topical applications for me.  Cosmetic things healled more slowy though.  Overall, things appeared about as fast as they disappeared..\n\nAbout how quickly did your itching and burning sensatins go away? I would say 2 weeks, probably less!\nIt was quick!!\n\nNow it is \u201conly\u201d cosmetic! Are you going to be on steroids for the long-term now? \nSince is a life-long condition for what I understood.\nI do not like that scenario but if it is what it takes... I am ok with it. Since you are still early on in your treatment, I would recommend making sure you have a good Dr. who can help you decide when it is appropriate to start tapering down your dosage, and how to do so. \n\nYou dont want to continue using topical steroids indefinitely at the rate you are probably using them now (2xday), but you also dont want to start tapering down too soon or too rapidly.  **One important thing I will add here is that \"rebound effects\" from stopping or tapering down on steroids too quickly can be real nasty, so listen to your body and do not be afraid to talk to your doctor about tapering down more slowly if you feel like you need to**\n\nA good doctor will be able to help you weigh the costs and benefits of continued steroid use based on your improvement in symptoms and a number of other factors.  Continued steroid use has its risks and drawbacks, but the general consensus is that that the steroid use is less risky than leaving LS untreated.  \n\n You probably want to get some improvement in cosmetic symptoms before tapering down, but talk to your Dr. about it. Most people continue topical treatments indefinitely with some sort of lower \"maintenance\" frequency  and/or just apply as needed during flares.  Kind of a \"listen to your body and see what works\" type of scenario a lot of times, I think. That makes sense!\nI will be talking to my doctor about it for sure! \nYou helped me a lot! I feel less anxious :) \nTysm! If it is what it takes to deal with this condition... \nI hope I will get some improvement sooner or later on the coloration! I was very afraid that it could be a permanent issue. \n\nI just want to control this, and not be controlled by it! If that makes sense . I know exactly what you mean.  That Is why I have been researching this topic so much.  I want to find a way to get rid of LS permanently.  \n\nHave you heard of the possible link between LS and Lyme disease?  I feel like finding a way to cure chronic Lyme for good may also cure LS. \n\nIf you search \"lichen sclerosus Borrelia\" you will find plenty of scientific research on the possible link between Lyme disease and lichen sclerosus.  Here is a great article to start with, if you are interested in the topic. \n\n Any chance you got a biopsy done? And iif so..Any chance they tested that tissue sample for Borrelia/Lyme? I did not have a biopsy done! \nMy gp said it was LS by looking at it and the dermatologist that he refers me confirmed the diagnostic!\nWe talked about the biopsy but they said it was not necessary as it was pretty obvious \n\nIm going to check that article rn! Well I avoided the biopsy also.  My doctors and I were confident in the diagnosis. My inguinal (waist/groid area) lymphnodes have been causing me problems for years prior to the LS though and I had one of those biopsied years ago, so I am going to see if I can get that lymphnode tissue sample dug out of the archives and tested for lyme. My doctors never told me about that connection with Lymes! There is so little research behind this LS condition that it is almost unreal. \nThey told me some doctors think it is one thing and others say it is another. It is kind of frustrating \nFor instance, my dermatologist said that HPV can have a role on LS but there is no 100% evidence on that! But she told me that she saw some patients with LS + HPV lesions! Could be related or not... super helpful ... lol What did you do to treat yourself? Thanks \nTopical steroids for sure Well I would not expect most doctors to say or even know anything about the possible link between LS and Lyme.  Even the dermatologist who diagnosed my LS (a pigment specialist who my regular derm. referred me to) was not aware of the decades of research supporting the link between LS and Lyme. \n\nAnyway, the underlying cause of LS is still not completely determined.. Plus most doctors really dont talk about Lyme disease.  Its taboo for some reason. There is too much conroversy around the topic- partly due to mixed mixed scientific data that is a result of the fact that Borrelia bacteria are so good at avoiding being detected with the testing techniques which are routinely used.  Even the mixed data does not completely explain all the controversy around Lyme though, so people have suggested all kinds of other wild things.. idk.\n\nMost of the research that suggests a link between  LS and Lyme involves some sort of alternative, or modified detection method. Well the answer to that actually is not a very short or explicit one, but here is what I can say for now.\n\nAfter doing some research on both topical steroids and LS, I actually decided I wanted to take advantage of the unique opportunity to test out some different home-made salves on myself before resorting to steroids.  I am a bit of an ethnopharmacology nerd, and I have had bad reactions to prescriptions in the past so I figured it was worth a shot.  \n\nIt worked great for me, but its still a bit too soon for me to share specific details about my treatment.  I hope to be able to share that info with people as soon as possible though. Wow this is great news! Shame you cannot share. When will you share? Many thanks The patent process is in progress already.  FDA approval will require clinical trials as well as much more time and resources, but I will share all the info I have as soon as I finish getting the patent stuff finalized. I feel you. Its the white areas on glans that affects me the most. Looks like coming sex will be with lights off. I might try borax baths and we can talk if that really works I have been using an ointment containing hydrocortisone, polymyxin B and oxytetracycline for about six weeks now, mostly internally but I do try get it on my glans. I have the impression the white patches are getting better, but very slowly. What is the cream called?", "UTI anyone? Anyone else get UTIs often due to LS? My obgyn says I am more prone to them due to it being an immunodeficiency disorder. If anyone deals with this, how do you cope? I do not go anywhere without otc Azo uti pain reliever.  Second I feel one coming on I take one and start slamming fluids.  Like literally the second or I am down for the count til meds kick in. Hmm. Interesting. I did not know this was a thing. I do not get UTIs but I do have interstitial cystitis which is basically all the symptoms of a UTI but no actual infection. So I take lots of AZO when I have a flare. I never even considered a connection! I thought I was constantly getting UTIs but when I would go to the doctor to get antibiotics, all my results came back negative for UTI. I went to my gyno and was diagnosed (by elimination) with Urethral Syndrome. During the examination, she noticed that I had lichen sclerosis. Maybe look into urethral syndrome and bring it up with your gyno. There is treatment for it! My scarring is bad enough that my urologist is monitoring me for obstruction of the urethra. It could be that you are more prone to UTI's because of a similar reason. I am literally reading this feed because of a UTI flare up right now. I have seen one or two medical journal articles discussing a connection but nothing \"proven\". What is Azo? Azo is a UTI medication. It does not take it away but it helps with the pain and the urgency to pee feeling. My obgyn says UTIs are more likely due to having a lowered immune system down there. I am having a UTI now again. I get them soooo often. It is annoying.", "Does this happen to any of you ? Why does my vagina look dry in the first two pictures then normal sometimes?? Like after I wear leggings my vagina looks like the first two pix and idk what is wrong or I have lichen\n\n( You have posted here so many times. Obviously we all want to help but we are not doctors Just asking if this happens to any of you I realize but you have posted a bunch asking if it is lichen or not etc. have you had any luck with the creams the doctors have given you? If doctors cared, I would not be asking here. Please be considerate of peoples situations I am asking if this happens to any of you. Please stop patrolling my posts and commenting that I have posted before. Like I am allowed to ask especially when doctors are too busy to make an appointment with me. Did not ask for a diagnosis. Asked if someone knows what this is. Thanks Like the other poster said. We are not doctors. This is a support group for people with the condition. We cannot advise you, necessarily and the first step if you DO have LS is to start a regimented routine of medication. Maybe find a different doctor? Leggings are tight and not breathable. If you do have LS they might be making flares worse. If you have Facebook there is a great group there. It is called Lichen Sclerosis &amp; Lichen Planus Skin Disorder Support. It has 4.1k members. I would suggest joining. They are really good with questions and support. Patrolling your posts lol you post here quite often and it is not a super active sub so...it kind of pops up every time? Either way, best of luck in finding out why you have the skin issues you do. I get that. I have other conditions and I do not mind talking to people who are wondering about them. Just thought other ppl were the same Ditto on the leggings bit! Also wearing non cotton panties can have an irritating effect, using soaps/products that are not all natural and/or are scented as well. It is my understanding that the pain and itching associated with lichen can come and go in waves, so if it looks more normal some days maybe it is because you have not been scratching etc on those days (if that is one of your symptoms) Best of luck to you. I second this and I have said this before. Nobody is patrolling your posts and because there are so many different skin conditions that can mimic each other, our anecdotes about what works and does not work or what happens and does not happen may not apply to you. They vary SO widely among LS sufferers as it is!You have not been diagnosed, you have other issues from your own admissions. So, what you have may not be LS and us relating or not relating to you may be more harmful to you than helpful. I will say it again- if the doctors are not seeing you, find another doctor, and another, and another. You have to be your own advocate. In the same vein, if you have multiple, multiple doctors who specialize either in skin conditions or women\u2019s health telling you it is not LS, maybe you should listen to them. If you have other diagnosed and confirmed conditions, then this could be a manifestation/worsening of those conditions. Leggings are a trigger for me!  Really does not look like lichen to me. I am not a doctor so cannot be sure, but lichen sclerosus has a shiny white appearance. It looks like dry skin to me. Vitamin E oil helps me a lot with that, and avoid shaving as much as possible. When you do shave, use a sensitive skin soap with no fragrance.", "Lichen Simplex Today the gyno diagnosed me with \u2018lichen simplex\u2019. Does anyone here have this?

If you havent seen a dermatologist, I suggest that. oh god, 3 years :( sorry to hear that. no I have not I just went to my normal GP. I will have to find myself a dermatologist or get a referral, not sure how it works as i have never seen one before!

So I have been reading that if your a male with LS you can get a circumcision and that can cure your disease and if not you can use steroid creams to manage it. Does this mean that if you have it and we are circumcised at birth steroids are your only option? steroid creams are highly popular with most physicians, but alternative approaches are explored. PRP-injections have been performed on females with promising results but i am not aware of high quality long-term studys regarding this treatment.\n\nBS like homeopathy and vitamin D/E creams did not show an effect beyond placebo.\n\nProblem is that this disease is rather rare so its difficoult to find enough patients for a high quality study. also big pharma has little to no interest in funding studies bcs there are too few potential costumers since its a rare disease.

Does anyone know how much skin should be removed from the penis when having lichen sclerosus? This question is driving me mad. My husband was circumsized as an adult due to LS and he had the foreskin removed, and the scar is now probably 1\" under the head of his penis. It caused lots of cracking and pain for him originally, so he was glad he got the procedure done. Not sure if that answers your question? Best of luck with your recovery. Hello, yes it does, thank you. Did he specify this to the doctor beforehand or all he knew was his foreskin was going to be removed? Was there any skin movement left after the procedure? Hey, I am not sure, I would have to ask. It was over 10 years ago so we were not together and now its fully healed. I would say his penis now looks like a 'normal circumcised one' - so there isnt really skin that moves around cover the head (if that is what you mean). There is a bit of a scar there, but only noticeable when i got \\*very familiar\\* lol, and looked for the purpose of looking for LS, not casual fooling around.   I think he had all the affected tissue removed, so maybe that is how far down it went. Oh maybe I got a very similar procedure since I was told all the affected skin had been removed as well. With skin movement I mean whether you can/could stroke any shaft\u2019s loose skin back and forth without covering the glans, or if it is more of a tight skinned one piece thing. Sorry for being so specific.", "Suggestions for steroid application? Hi friends,\n\nHoping to solicit some advice here - you all have been immensely helpful as I have started to navigate treatment for LS. Hoping I can learn from your experience. \n\nAfter a rocky start with clobetasol (seemed to make my symptoms worse? I also have been very stressed, so triggers are unclear), I have been on estrogen cream  alone for the past 2 weeks. Experiencing itching, discomfort, and white skin that persists. It is becoming apparent to me that my doctor does not have much experience with LS. She recommended that I use Zyrtec every day for itching, estrogen every day, and a steroid only when the skin itches (?) which feels incorrect based on some posts here. \n\nI asked her for mometasone thanks to some suggestions on this sub. I started it again last night. So, my questions are\u2026\n\n1. How often to apply? I was going to do everyday for 3 weeks, then taper off to every other day for 2 weeks, then 2x a week after that indefinitely \n2. Does anyone here successfully use estrogen and a steroid? Do you apply it at different times of the day or together?\n3. Where to apply? I did not get clear instructions on this\u2026or anything, really", "Managing hair down there? I feel like my skin is \u201chappier\u201d when I have waxed, but I am always concerned about causing it further damage. Does anyone have any information on what the best approach is? Following because I have also noticed this and  had the same concern... Maybe it is that creams etc sink into the skin more effectively? If I could I would have laser hair removal done, but unfortunately it does not work on my hair type. It would not be wise to wax or get laser removal your hair is there to protect from infections cuts and other things that can happen. I would go with just trimming with sissors. I have been going with sugaring for the past 5-6 months. I find there is less skin irritation - I cannot speak to if this is sugaring in general or just the practitioner I see for the service. She is lovely and I will not say it does not hurt - but it does not feel like it is ripping skin; just grabbing onto the hairs. I waxed for a while before and went to a place that used both soft and hard waxes. I found that was a little too hit or miss - some of the ladies there knew their stuff and then the others caused a lot of pain and sometimes even bleeding. I have also had good success with sugaring! Some women find that trimming the hair closely with something like a mustache trimmer (or other) works best, others can tolerate more aggressive removal like waxing.  I think you just have to find what works best for you, there is no one perfect answer. My gynecologist recommended laser hair removal because I have sensory issues and cannot stand the feeling of hair moving against my clothes. She said it is better to get it done and risk a few instances of damage to the area and then not have to worry about it anymore than to have regular damage to the area.", "Has anyone else experienced a cystitis-like feeling? Wondering whether this could be related to my Lichen Sclerosus (27F). I was diagnosed half a year ago but believe I had this condition for at least 5 years, primarily around the anus but now I feel like my vagina is affected as well, especially the area near the clitoris / urethra. \n\nAfter going to a jacuzzi I at first thought I had a fungal infection, however, now I believe it is a LS flare up. Because the fungal treatment did not work and the itching  remained. What is bothering me the most is the feeling that my bladder does not empty properly and I often feel a burning sensation after peeing.  Does anyone have similar symptoms ? I occasionally get the burning while peeing sensation but it comes and goes from pee to pee lol. You potentially could have a UTI so maybe go see your pharmacist or doctor and see what they think. As for the bladder not feeling empty after you pee, try sitting like a cowboy (backwards) on the toilet. It is going to feel tricky to sit like that at first but you will find that the pee just gushes out and you do not need to engage any muscles to empty it all! i strongly recommend seeing a urogynecologist. i have interstitial cystitis and LS. i have the same symptoms as you and they flare around the same time. I (47F) have had similar feelings on occasion but never attributed it to LS. \n\nI did once think I had a UTI but it turned out I just pulled a muscle from standing up weird after peeing because getting old is hell, kids. What is interstitial cystitis? I was diagnosed with IC and LS at the same time. IC is definitely what you described here. Often feels like a UTI, but you test negative for uti. I am not sure how common the two are, but it seems there may be a correlation. First question \u2014 are you on treatment? \n\nAlso \u2014 yes I do get urethral symptoms sometimes. I have only had one flare so far, but it hurt to pee for 2 weeks. Once I got treated it went away, but I would not be surprised if it came back after a flare. While cystitis is an infection inside the bladder, IC is inflammation in the *lining and wall* of the bladder, and it does not involve an infection. \n\nIt is tough because LS, a UTI, or IC could all cause urinary symptoms.  (Although, I imagine that feeling of the bladder \"not being empty\" after peeing sounds more like bladder issue than LS.) I would definitely go and get a urinalysis and if that is negative, maybe a urine culture, and go from there. Yes I am using a steroid cream. \n\nBut how did you treat the urinary symptoms during a flare up? The clobetasol seemed to work within a few weeks Even on the urinary problems? Yes. My urinary symptoms were painful urination and it felt like I was not able to evacuate everything. When I apply the clobetasol I apply all over the vulva. It took care of my urinary problems right away, while all my other symptoms took months.", "New to this Hello, i am a male in his early 20.\n\nI am glad I found this subreddit because I do not know anyone around me who has this condition and I do not know who to talk to without feeling judged. You should know that my symptoms are a bit strange or at least I think. In my case, I have no pain and it looks a lot like irritation, my foreskin skin is red and there are cracks, but without pain. I have nothing on my penis head. At first there were only a few cracks, but after my doctor prescribed yeast cream and cortisone cream, my skin became really red and the cracks multiplied. So he prescribed clobatazol twice a day for 10 days and advised me to go see a dermatologist and according to him i have LS. It took me quite some time to accept it since it will be with me all my life. Here is my question:\n\nHow long should i wait before i see an improvement or the symptoms go away completely?\n\nDo the symptoms go away for you (I know they can come back depending on the person) or you just control them but they are always there?\n\nDo you have any advice to give me?\n\nI am sorry in advance for my english. It is not my first language If it is LS, I regret to welcome you to the club!\n\nFor me, it takes two weeks of the steroid cream -but then it improves almost completely. \n\nBut I am surprised that your doc gave you clobetasol after you experienced redness with steroid cream and yeast cream.  It does not seem safe to assume that the yeast cream caused the redness. Maybe it did, maybe it did not. Personally, I would discontinue the creams until it went back to your normal, then try the simple steroid cream by itself. If the redness returns, I would be very careful about using clobetasol, as it is one of the most potent steroid ointments you can get. \n\nFor me, some yeast creams caused me terrible pain and burning. And clobetasol did fix it up. So your doc may be exactly right. \n\nFor me, it mostly goes away and is not a problem at all. I have been treating with clobetasol for 12 years very successfully. Any progression of the disease is pretty slow. Sometimes I have a flare, and it just sucks. Usually this is in a time of greater stress in my life. Because pain in the genitals is SUCH a help when life is difficult...!\n\nAlso seems to be a link to diet and general health. So, the best advice I have is to have a healthy diet, keep inflammation down, practice meditation, be at peace as much as you can, communicate well with any sexual partners, use clobetasol when needed, and not to worry, it does generally recede most of the time. \n\nAlso, I suggest that you take care in masturbation. Many lotions and creams are irritating to LS. You might try simple coconut oil. You do not want to chafe, but the also do not want to introduce fragrances or other irritating agents. Similarly, take notice or whether condoms or lubricants cause a problem. You may have to try different brands of condoms, if you use them, and see what happens. I cannot tolerate most over-the-counter lubricants, so a partner must do a good job of making that happen naturally. Darn. \n\nFor me this has been a painful and annoying problem, but not life-changing. And I have had children since my diagnosis. So, there is hope. Good luck to you! thank you very much for taking the time to answer me it is much appreciated. \n\nI did not mention it, but after that he prescribed mycosis pills and contisone cream as the first time I thought it was weird, but hey I am not doctor and I reacted again and worse this time. I tried another corticosteroid cream without improvement. It was after that that he told me that he was very likely to have LS and that the biopsy would surely confirm. \nWhen I went to see my pharmacist, she repeated several times that after 10 days I had to stop the treatment, it scared me a bit.  but with your case it reassures me a lot. I can add that the pharmacist is right - I should have said that I use the clobetasol as little as possible. It will thin the skin over time. It DOES fix a flare of LS, but it is definitely not something I do every day. I use it once or twice a day for a few days in a row when I feel it flaring up. This happens a few times a year. So, the pharmacist is correct!! Do not use it constantly. \n\nI hope you get some relief, though.", "I am feeling devastated. I 26F, was diagnosed with LS in January this year.  I went to the OBGYN for infertility issues and came out with 2 brand new diagnoses. PCOS and LS. I started clobetasol treatment immediately and it worked. No more itching, burning or tears in my skin. No more white patches. It was liberating, sex is amazing, besides the occasional flare ups.But then today.. I went to clean out my PC and found a 6 year old folder with nudes. I looked through them and found a picture of my vagina.I am in literal shock. I do not remember that it ever looked like that?! So i grabbed the mirror to compare and... My labia minora and my clitoris hood is gone.. I did not even notice over the 6 years that is was gradually disappearing. I feel devastated, robbed and afraid. For 1.5 years my fiance and i have have been TTC. The fact that we cannot conceive has made me feel broken and it is really been hard on my mental health. Now with this i cannot help but feel less of a woman. My ability to bear children, my fucking genitalia disappearing?! What am i supposed to do with this, it all just feels so cruel. I cannot talk to anyone, besides my fiance. I am kind of losing hope here I am sorry you are having to go through this. Sending you so much love and I will be thinking about you \u2764\ufe0f That is a terrible place to be in, and I am so glad you have the diagnosis and treatment that you need! Are you also seeing a therapist and taking care of your mental health? \n\nHave you talked to your fiance about it? Did they notice the changes? I bet they did not care and thinks you are as sexy as you have always been! \n\nI know things are hard right now and it really sucks to have the visible proof that things have changed so much. But none of the issues you are having make you less of a woman. You are valid and you are beautiful. Do not ever think otherwise!\n\nEdit: SO terminology and typos.", "LS and Oral sex? You all I cannot tell you how relieved I am to find this sub is active.\n\nI went to my gyn this morning for an \"itch\" that I was pretty sure is not yeast and a lesion that seems to come and go. I was really just expecting a diagnosis of dryness (cause using a vaginal moisturizer helps some).\n\nUnfortunately she is petty confident I have LS, with some minor labial fusing already. Upon getting home and reading the first 10 hits on Google I am confident she is right. Im 32, have type 1 diabetes, pcos and a history of inflammation, my mother also has autoimmunity issues and went through early menopause.\n\nI am trying to read and gather information on short and long term treatments and prognosis, so I do not spiral in these visions of my labia and clit sealing themselves shut, my husband leaving me and my life being over. (It is not going well) \n\nDoc is doing a yeast test to make sure we do not treat with steroids on top of a yeast infection,  then we will  treat with clobetasol/clindamycin.\n\nOne thing I have not seen is information on sex while using the steroids. (I will ask my doc next time we talk, but I am hoping for faster answers and experience here) I assume if it is comfortable, regular intercourse is safe if he wears a condom, but what about oral? Is that something we are doing to have to give up? Or just plan to only do on non application days?\n\nAlos, are there long term detrimental side effects to using the steroids long term? Are supplemtal natural treatments and diets effective? \n\nThanks. The thing to consider with oral sex is your medication, which is topical.  Typical dosage is every day for a month, every other day for a month, and then twice per week in perpetuity.  It is a good idea for your partner to wear a condom for intercourse for two reasons; to protect himself from your medication and to provide needed lubrication to protect your damaged skin.  Oral sex can be problematic due to your topical medication.  Avoiding it for 24 hours or so following application may be necessary.  I am not an expert and you may want to ask your doctor and do some research, but I would think the period of time between doses after the initial 24 hours should be fine for oral sex. i have read that steroids can be washed off after a little while because the skin has already absorbed it. maybe you can ask or look into that? That is kind of what I am wondering.  Like if I use it before bed, is it absorbed and worn away enough that a quick wash would make it safe? If this is going to be a lifetime management I need to find some way to make it work. \n\nI will still ask my doc before we approach that activity :) i would love to know too. i have not been diagnosed with it (yet?) but oral sex is probably my #1 thing so i would like to have it again some day haha I will try to remember to come back and update you when I have a more definitive answer! I hope you get some answers soon (hopefully you have something more permanently treatable) Omg I never even thought about this before! I have heard that these things soak in pretty quickly, such that you do not have to worry about wiping it all away when you go to the bathroom. I do not know if there would be enough residue to harm your partner or not, but I am curious to hear what your doc says. I will probably be going through this soon, too; I got a probable diagnosis last week and and a referral for a dermatology appointment in a month and a half. I had not even thought about oral sex. :/\n\nIf it turns out it is a hazard, I imagine using a barrier would solve that. I know protected oral sex is not popular, but it can still be very nice. You can make a dam easily by cutting down the side of a regular condom, or you can buy the ones made for that purpose. My hope is once I am weaned down to just maintenance dosing it will not be an issue on in between days, or the day before application.  I will update the sub once I have some better info! I have never had an issue with oral other than it requires planning. I apply the cream every night before I fall asleep. We have sex before I apply which kills spontaneous sex but that is ok. I do get up to wash if we are going to have sex in the morning. I have not had an issue with this. I use steroids most days (morning and before bed), but I have the urge to shower before sex because I get self conscious over flaky skin. So I shower, use moisturizer and pre apply a little bit of vasaline on the areas I know are most sensitive to friction and have at \u2018er! Depending on the condition. My skin, I will let my spouse know if we need to avoid certain things or positions. Oral has always been fine when the skin is not painful. I then apply the steroids after sex.\n\nI am interested to follow this thread though to see what your doctor says. I had not even thought of residual steroids affecting him. Interesting, my doctor prescribed my a clob ointment and an antifungal ointment to deal with my LS + yeast function dual prognosis. Cleared up like a charm.\n\nAfter your LS is suppressed, you should be fine for oral sex. I only use my clob ointment for flare-ups (as this is what the doc prescribed), and a regular coconut oil based vulvar moisturizer otherwise. Just be patient with the healing! Please do a biopsy to confirm diagnosis. My obgyn was 100% sure I had LS, she thought my inner labia disappeared and my vestibule was shrinking. (I have never had lips and my vestibule has always been this size, it was her first time seeing me and everyone is different!) I had a biopsy done and the results came back as eczema. I treated with clobetasol for 3 months without complete relief, and finally I have been told to stop due to clob being too strong and probably doing more harm than good. I usually wait to apply my clob until after I have had sex (I am in a relationship so I can pretty much guess when it will happen). We have oral, vaginal, and anal sex with no problems! I post a lot about tips and tricks in this sub to help relieve symptoms and maybe even strengthen your vulva a little and reduce the need for clob on a regular basis (and get it down to maybe weekly or once every two weeks for maintenance). I also do not think any leftover residue after hours of application would be harmful to your partner, but it is still important to think about them when it comes to your sex life. Everyone is experience is so different. \n\nHowever, for me, after the first month or so of using the steroid ointment daily, I am now at a stage where I only use it for flare-ups, which are irregular, usually stress related. Perhaps once every two months or so on average. \n\nIn those cases I apply the ointment for a day or two. At those times I am usually not interested in sex of any kind to be honest, due to irritation. \n\nBut most of the time I am not using the ointment, and so it is not an issue, and our sex life is pretty much as normal, including oral :) I think the idea is to not take medication I do not NEED. If there is yeast Ill take Diflucan first, then we will reassess the LS. But if I just start using everything at once its harder to tell which treatment I am responding to. I will if my doctor thinks I need to. I trust her judgment. I have all the risk factors and symptoms for LS. While a biopsy can give a more definitive answer, it is still an invasive procedure and puts me at risk for secondary infection (read: type 1 diabetic with a history of Toxic Shock Syndrome. We do not cut unless 100% necessary). If I respond to treatment predictably then it is reasonable to assume it is the correct diagnosis. If it looks like horses and sounds like horses, it is probably horses. Thanks! Ill take a look for some of your posts! I am really hoping my case is like yours where I can get to only needing the steroids on occasion.  I suppose only time will tell. Im glad to hear some less gloomy experience here. Well if you trust your doctor and the treatment works once you try it, then that is great. In my case, I have been very thankful for my biopsy, but there were not major side effects involved for me. I really hope you can find relief soon. From what I have gathered, the steroid soaks in relatively quick, so sex and oral on steroids should not be an issue. As long as you are not wiping it off in less than 15 minutes, you will be fine. One big thing is to make sure you are moisturizing! Aquaphor is what was recommended to me and it works great. &gt;if you trust your doctor\n\nYou know, there is no winning with Reddit is there? Reddit screams about trusting your doctor and the professionals, until they tell you to second guess them.\n\nI do not remember asking for diagnostic advice, but thanks for your concern. Lol \u2014 I was just trying to state that it is better to get a set in stone diagnosis, as many people have been diagnosed with LS without a biopsy and it turned out to be something far far worse. In my case, I was lucky it was something a little less extreme but still wrong. I also still gave you some advice about steroids and sex/oral, as I was using clobetasol for 3 months before I got my actual biopsy result. You can also just call a pharmacist. Best of luck. Lol. Just emailed my gynecologist with the same question! I will report back when I hear from her. I could not find anything about oral sex with applying the steroid cream.", "7 Days to Die / 7D2D / 7DTD Day 14  Was this posted intentionally on this subreddit? was this an unintentional reply? This is not a video game sub. Nope. How does 7 Days to Die relate to Lichen Sclerosus? Happy Cake day!", "White bumps I was diagnosed in March and have been taking the clobetasol cream, now twice a week, but recently I have developed bumps on my perineum area &amp; at the opening of my vagina. Should I be concerned? Will it go away eventually? \nI do see my gynecologist on the 23rd, but I was wondering if anybody else had this issue. Sounds like you may have tapered down the dosage too soon or too rapidly.  Did your doctor already talk to you about what to do if you have a flare in symptoms? \n\nIf you are having a flare you probably dont want to wait a couple weeks to do something about it..\n\nI would message your doctor about your change in symptoms.  They may want you to increase the dosage frequency again for a while and then taper back down more sowly after things resolve.", "Vent (Female,22), need advice? Hiii:) After I got diagnosed, my doctor prescribed me the clob steroid (cream) it did not work and so she then prescribed me the ointment it did help. Now it is worse then ever, idk if my body got used to the ointment or what not and so it is not really working anymore\ud83d\ude05 it feels like my skin is on fire constantly. Apparently it could be linked to stress/anxiety? I have been stressed out a lot (kind of  always am) so maybe that is not helping. It is been affecting my mental health. I talked to my doctor back in October of 2020 and she decided to send me to a specialist because she does not know what to do. My appointment is now in a month from now(it was all booked before that). I am in so much pain, my skin feels like it is on fire... I do not know what to do to take the pain away, I have no one to talk to...Being stuck home does not help because I cannot do things to keep my mind off of it. I use emu oil, extra virgin oil, cream I try to keep it as moisturized as possible, I am also following all the recommendations. Any advice would mean a lot though. Thank you:) I know it will be okay, just having a bad day:/!", "Newly diagnosed - please help me with some product recommendations \ud83d\udc96 Just diagnosed today, doc was in a rush so did not get to ask anything :( I am in the UK and I am looking for:\n\n1) a good moisturiser (ideally a cheap one!)

I am a M23 and my girlfriend is F22, we have been together for a year and 3 months. In the beginning of our relationship before she was diagnosed with LS we had an extremely active sex life I am talking 2-3 times a day almost every other day for like 8 months straight but toward month 9-10 she stated having a lot of itching, pain and swelling. She want to the gyno had a biopsy and her gyno said she has LS and basically our sex life has become non existent, her sex drive has disappeared due to pain and her associating sex with pain due to her LS and now intimacy is out the window. This situation overall is sad and obviously no one is to blame here this is nobody\u2019s fault, and due to this LS her confidence has been destroyed and it makes me feel sad because I truly do love her with all my heart she is the perfect women to me with or without LS she is the one I want to spend my life with. I came to this forum to ask the people here how can I support my partner with her LS I been doing my research myself but I wanted to hear from real people going through this as well. I always try my hardest to be patient and understanding as much as I can and I have even sat down and told her we do not need to have sex if it is painful we can just do other sexual things that do not involve penetration because I do not want her to feel pressured to have sex, and she understands I have needs as well and I told her I appreciate that. She currently uses a cream her gyno provided her whenever she starts to feel like symptoms are occurring. I just want advice on how to help her feel confident about herself and regain her confidence sexually and for us to have sex again because she expresses how it is a sad situation but overall I just want advice on how to help a partner or how would you like your SO to handle your LS and what things you guys have done to help your LS \n\nSorry for the long read!! \nThank you in advance guys If she has advanced LS, sex may be excruciating for her especially if she is lost a lot of structure. I would suggest a set of dilators if she is willing. You want to look for a sex therapist. There is a lot going on here and you guys are so young. A sex therapist will talk you through all the stuff people find so much unnecessary shame in, help you get to what is physical and emotional and what everyone needs and what everyone can do, and can talk about the medical parts without blushing. \n\nI would hope that you would find that while maybe you cannot be like rabbits anymore, you can be intimate in different ways. Likely that she will recover well - maybe need physical help - and maybe you will need to spend less time with penetration and more time on foreplay. You for her, to make sure she is thoroughly wet and ready, and she for you, so that the penetration time is ... shorter. Everybody still gets everything they want and need, in the end, if it works out that way for you. \n\nBut - sex therapist. It is a real job. It does not involve having sex with you. It is about helping the person with their sex life from every relevant angle. Thank you for the advice I appreciate it! Buy \"Curing Lichen Sclerosus: Beating the Disease\" by Ginny Chandoha.\n\nLet your GF read the reviews on Amazon on the book.\n\nI bought the book two months ago, starting reading + applying 2 weeks ago, and I can almost have sex now without any pain at all and I have not even quit smoking yet (nicotine really screws the immune system). \n\nAll I did was cut out chemicals. The book is kind of older, lots of new products out that are very low in chemicals. What I did was switch to Bronners soap, and \"ingredients matter\" for all other products. No more chemicals in my foods.\n\nAt first it seems overwhelming. Honestly after reading it I felt the worst is felt about my LS because I realized I was going to have to make big changes.\n\nThen after doing some changes (still working on quitting smoking) I have already experienced huge releifs from my LS.\n\nAlso make sure she is doing the 1000mg omega-3 3x a day. Thanks, a lot I will definitely check that out and I am glad to hear that you are doing well I am not sure how long ago she got diagnosed but make sure she keeps using the cream as prescribed, I think I had to do it twice a day for a few months, then once a day, now I am down to as needed. I used to have tearing/fissure feelings, but it disappeared fairly fast (I was very very early in stages, but I would have rectal bleeding from it and lots of bleaching skin). Also it might be interesting to see if she has any triggers, like food (mine is dairy) and she might need new underwear (cotton is better, thongs irritate it) and tight pants like sleeping in yoga pants, or too much time in leggings make it worse for me. Shopping trip! Hey, I feel for ya, awesome on you to reach out for advice. My LS started around 18 so really impacted my early 20s sexual activities and long term relationship at the time... \n\nIt was awkward at first, but pelvic floor physio really helped me, taught me how to use dialators, relax vaginismus, etc. It took a number of years of use of the steroids to clear up the damage and scarring that I had (and new skin to grow, and nerves repair). So time is definitely your friend. But it takes a toll on your relationship for sure.  \n\nAt the time my gyno really stressed that I should explore non-penetrative sex and 'play' with my partner, which I think was more awkward than anything at that age. But the older I get (and have other pelvic floor dysfunction) you realize that can be fun too and you just need to communicate and ensure both you and your partner are getting the intimacy they need.\n\nFor me external toys ('clit suckers' are my fav) are MUCH better than vibrators, dildos, etc. and you can just fool around together or, use the external stimulation to help relax you for and during sex. \n\nThe disease sucks for sure, but its definitely not a life sentence. But like your partner is going through now, initially until things clear up and start to heal (skin and nerves) it can be really challenging. It will pass though with time.  Good luck! Thank you for the advice and all the input yeah she does have a cream which she is been prescribed and uses it twice daily I try to remind her to use it and so far she has not said anything about any certain triggers so it is still a learning curve with LS a lot of trial and error till we get a routine Yes the steroid cream made a huge impact for me! I have also heard of some using lotion down there for extra moisture. \n\nIt is really devastating finding out you have LS, but there is been so many success stories! So I am hopeful for her. Oh and to find my triggers (I had other autoimmune diseases pop up, it seems to all come at once) I went gluten/dairy/soy/egg free for a few weeks and within two days I felt better overall. It is a lot to consider but if she has any other autoimmune issues it might be worth considering. I know the success stories are there which is hopeful, yeah she has psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis but food has not really affected her but definitely worth trying to avoid certain foods, most the time she is fine just the occasional flare up and really it is the penetration that hurts her and sometimes leaves her hurting for 2 days so we have stopped that, but we are hopeful keep using the cream and avoid any triggers. Patience is a virtual but thank you again for your advice. Thank you for your kind words and wonderful advice. Yeah it is never fun when you get diagnosed with LS and we have a very strong bond and ofc I love her so I have made it clear to her I do not care if we do not have penetrative sex I want her to feel comfortable and if she wants that then I am all for it, but do not want her to feel like it is expected ya know. For me we came to an understanding just cause you cannot have sex you can still do other things to maintain that passion/intimacy with your partner. I will definitely bring up those ideas you mentioned and you know communication is key I appreciate you for responding to this post. Absolutely!! Best of luck! I think you are in the right place too, it helped me a ton when I found it and it made me feel less alone. Thank you for looking for ways to help and be supportive of your partner. That is hugely meaningful and significant! \n\nWhat kind of medication is she using and is it a steroid? And is it a white cream or a clear-ish ointment? I ask because I and a number of other people I know with LS reacted pretty poorly to the cream version of medicines. For some reason the ointment version worked much better and did not seem to cause a reaction that was making all the irritation worse. \n\nSome things that might help during flare ups:  \n\nsitz baths or regular baths with baking soda. \n\nSome type of coconut oil or almond oil to moisturize. Some people also use emu oil and find great relief with it (there is regular emu oil and then there is a brand that contains tea tree oil, so be careful which one you buy - avoid emuaid max as it has extra strength amount of tea tree oil in it and can make it feel like it is burning down there). The moisturizer is important because it helps reduce the fusing of skin. Personally I notice that if I do not use something to moisturize after bathing, then my skin feels \u201csticky\u201d and things stick together more down there, which might contribute to skin fusing and genital structure loss (I do not know if it is been studied formally, but lots of anecdotal evidence from people with LS in another support group I am part of suggests it might). \n\nYou yourself can apply the coconut or almond oil as foreplay as well. Her being aroused and ready to go will help significantly when it comes to potential penetration. If you try it and it hurts too much to continue, make sure she knows it is okay and you understand and you can get off in another way that does not involve penetration. \n\nDilators might help if the issue is with scarring making things too tight. Her gyne would be able to determine if there is scar tissue causing problems. \n\nI saw you said she has some other autoimmune issues as well. The autoimmune protocol diet was HUGE in getting my autoimmune disease under control and it had the added benefit of helping my LS! \n\nIf she has LS in her anal area, using a lidocaine cream or preparation H with lidocaine before having a BM can REALLY help with avoid skin tearing and pain in the moment. \n\nIf she gets irritated when wiping with toilet paper, she can try using a peribottle to rinse with after going to the bathroom (either #1 or #2) instead. \n\nWhen lounging around the house I wear loose pajama pants and men\u2019s boxers. It is so comfortable that I would continue to do it even if I did not have LS, haha. \n\nStress is also a huge trigger for flare ups for a lot of people. It stinks because LS itself is stressful and it can turn into a vicious cycle. I have found mediation to be helpful, but I have also learned to anticipate some increased symptoms when stressed out and increase the frequency with which I take sitz baths and use oils. Sometimes that is enough in itself to avoid the increase in symptoms. Thank you for the wonderful reply! I appreciate all your suggestions and definitely will be implementing them thank you again I forgot to mention the name of my favorite AIP cookbook! \nThe Autoimmune Protocol Comfort Food Cookbook: 100+ Nourishing Allergen-Free Recipes by Michelle Hoover is a great cookbook for some AIP-friendly comfort foods. After we got practiced at the recipes in this book we started adding other books and recipes too. It is hard work at first but you get used to it pretty quickly and it REALLY helps a lot.", "Difficult week, I need to vent. I was diagnosed with severe LS about three years ago when I was 16. I do a no grain, vegan, sugar free diet, I use clobatesol and emu oil every day, I do not wear underwear, I have not had sex since I was diagnosed but I still have flare ups every few weeks. \n\nMy vulva area is pretty unrecognizable at this point, my inner and outer labia fused before I was diagnosed and my vaginal opening is pretty much gone. It is extremely painful to pee \n if I do not stick to my diet but sometimes it feels like punishment for eating normal foods because I will have a dinner that I love, something like pasta, and then I will dread using the bathroom for the next few days. \n\nI want to try stem cell treatment with Nathan Newman but I cannot afford it, even if I were to make payments over the course of a year. \n\nIm feeling kind of at a loss, I cannot do what I love anymore, I cannot eat the foods that I love, I cannot even talk to the people in my life about it because it is embarrassing, lately I have started to feel like it would be better if I was dead. I am so sorry you are struggling with this! Just know that you are not alone. I cannot imagine what it is like. Sending love. I am so sorry you are going through this. I get how unfair it is.  Have you ever tried borax? I am so sorry this is happening to you.  It is really, really, really hard.\n\nOne thing I can promise is that the grief and pain are not constant and permanent.  This will wax and wane. If you keep trying, you will likely manage to find a method of control that does work for you. It is not today, and today sucks.  19 can suck in a lot of ways for a lot of people.  Survive. Do whatever you need to do to survive. \n\nYou have got to reach out to your doctor or a therapist for help with those feelings.  Your medical doctor is absolutely a good first step.  You can reach out to them and tell them that you are not coping emotionally with having a poorly-controlled disease and need to get help.  They will almost certainly refer you to people - a therapist can absolutely help talk you through options that it is hard to see when you are in the middle of pain. A sex therapist can help too - they can help with the feelings around this, and around whether or not your vaginal opening is \"gone\".  They can work with that and are 100% not embarrassed by anything you have to say there. Doc may also refer you to a nutritionist or a food therapist.  I worked with one for some time. I expected her to scold me for being on the gluten-free fad bandwagon, but she did not - she believed me when I said that when I have bread, my knees start to hurt like crazy, my hands curl up and ache and it is hard to type, and - yes - LS flares up.  I have been GF since 2013. I keep thinking I am wrong about diet, and eventually push those boundaries, and.... nope.  Headaches, knees, hands, vulva. Blargh. Sucks.  She helped me work through all the bullshit and figure out how to feed myself responsibly and without shame.  I could not have done those things alone.  I needed help but I did not know where to find it. My doctor pointed the way.\n\nSounds like you have a major inflammatory response happening and like you are trying to control it with diet, but not everything can be controlled that way.  (Another thing the food therapist made me learn.  Not everything is related to what I eat.)  Work with another doc.  Find a naturopath even.  I saw one. He took blood and found  I was anemic and deficient in vitamin D.  Fixing those things was HUGE.  (Imagining yellow light flooding my body was less helpful, unfortunately, but he had plenty of good sense things that helped me.)\n\nIf you sometimes feel suicidal over this, it is 100% appropriate to throw EVERYTHING at the wall and see what sticks.  Find other kinds of doctors and therapists.  Put it all on a card, whatever, deal with it later if you have to.  Your job is to survive.  Ask anyone and everyone for help.  Being broke is better than being dead. Being embarrassed is better than being dead.  Do not stop beating on doors until you get help - you will find some doors are closed or cruel.  *Keep looking*.  I am so sorry you are going through this.\n\nI know what we go through can be incredibly private and uncomfortable to talk about...if you feel alone..talk about it with trusted friends or family anyways! I have decided that it is an illness that is a part of my life...so I talk about it. People have been surprisingly supportive and understanding. You do not have to be super specific if you are not comfortable with that. While they do not understand exactly how it feels..they have dealt with their own struggles that make them sympathetic to mine. \n\nIf you do not feel like you can do that with anyone in person, you have done the right thing by talking with us! Support makes life a lot easier.\n\nIt is ok to feel embarrassed about talking about it..but it is not your fault. Our bodies fail us in a million different ways. It is an illness, you did not choose it..you just get to choose how to deal with it.\n\nFinally I wanted to ask/mention...you said you flare up every few weeks...do you happen to get your period during a flare up? I have found my period to be incredibly irritating...if that is the case and you have not mentioned it to your doctor I would suggest that. It seems like you are being incredibly proactive. \n\nIt will get better...and until it does we are here for you! Also a good counselor does wonders. Therapy has made my life so much better! Did your doctor tell you to use the clob every day? That is a strong steroid to be using every day. I had an issue with it being too strong and actually causing a ton of irritation which was making everything worse. Eventually I tried using it again when I was down to using a steroid only twice a week per the protocol my doctor gave me, but even then it was too strong for me. You might be in the same boat. \n\nDefinitely ask your doctor about that and double-check how much you are supposed to be using and when. Topical steroids can still cause problems just like oral steroids, though it is more uncommon.\n\nEdit: I use triamcinolone now, which is a couple steps down in strength from clob. Thankyou for the reply, and I have not, i thought that borax was an insect repellent but I would be open to anything. I diddnt expect so much support from people on here, Thankyou, when I first found out a few years ago, I talked to a friend about it, she was uncomfortable talking about reproductive stuff so Its been hard to imagine talking to anyone about it again, I have gone to therapy before, I would consider starting again.  My flare ups are worse when I am on my period, I switched to cloth maxi pads which helps. Thankyou for the reply, my doctor wants me to use it every day for now but there have been times when I diddnt use it for a week during good patches, I have heard about the skin thinning effect, and it is good to know that there are alternatives, I will consider asking my doctor about it. Thankyou Thankyou, I appreciate it.", "cycling? does anyone in this group cycle? any tips on how to avoid aggravating LS? haha Short distances and cotton underwear/biking spandex with a cotton crotch", "Menstrual Advice Needed Hello everyone! I am a 23 y/o recently diagnosed with LS. Every time I have gotten my period for the last 6 months, I have had rashes and burning on the days winding down off my period. I usually only wear pads during this time. Tampons have never been something I have been comfortable with. Do you have tips to make this time easier? Is a diva cup the way to go? I have not tried a diva cup, but would be curious about others experiences...I have found that using organic pads help, changing them really often and putting some sort of barrier cream on my skin. I usually use emu oil or coconut oil You might be having an allergic reaction, or just major irritation, to something in the pads. Personally I find them very chafing, but they can also cause skin reactions. Try and find natural fiber pads with minimal additives, or maybe try reusable cotton ones or period underwear. Personally, I find period underwear 10x more comfortable than pads. It also might help to change them more often, since the menstruate itself could be pretty irritating. I have not tried diva cups but I imagine that could be good, because you do not have to have anything against the vulva, as long as you are able to insert it. I know some people with LS would have difficulty with that, but it would totally depend on the individual case. I have been undiagnosed for years and recently diagnosed. I did not even realize how irritating tampons were until I switched to the diva cup for sustainability reasons. I find the same irritation from pads (even unscented). Diva cup rules. Fyi I also switched to the diva cup like 6 years ago.", "Case study: Male 36, recent onset There is a real dearth of information on Male LS. Hopefully this is helpful to someone in a similar situation.\n\nBackground:\nMale 36, caucasion, generally healthy, no previous health issues or medications. Uncircumsized; have had a vasectomy. Low but regular alcohol use, some light cannabis use. Frequent exercise.\n\nMy mother has some sort of skin condition, dry itchy skin which reacts poorly to sunlight in the spring and summer. Condition could never be properly diagnosed or resolved and started in her 20s. Arthritis on both sides of the family.\n\nPresentation:\n\n2019 noticed urine flow was weak and there was dribbling after using the bathroom. Asked doctor about it, suspecting prostate, but he said everything looked normal. At this point I began squeezing with my fingers after peeing to empty the remaining urine from the penis (some dribble still is inevitable after standing up from the toilet).\n\nDec 2020 it suddenly became more difficult to orgasm during sex. This was never a problem before. I chalked it up to getting older.\n\nJan 2021 noticed what looked like a friction burn on tip of penis after intercourse. I ignored this entirely believing it was just rough sex without a condom. The tip was red and inflamed. It did not seem to heal properly.\n\nA few weeks later after sex, the skin on the tip of the penis torn quite deeply and began to thicken. The foreskin had begun to tighten and took on a vague whitish band (extremely subtle coloring differences at first). \n\nAnother few weeks past, then during intercourse the frenulum partially tore and I screamed out in pain. My wife became concerned and had me try Canesten suspecting a yeast infection. I used it for about a month without success. Tried Hydrocortisone cream and Vitamin E oil which did not help either.\n\nAt this point I began some research and realized that this was acquired Phimosis and figured the closest resemblance was LS/BXO. It was so subtle though and the information cited it as rare, so I was skeptical. There were virtually no images online of early phimosis to reference, only images of severe cases.\n\nOver the next 3 months the foreskin got tighter and tighter and the white plaque on the tip of the penis spread, nearly cover the whole surface. The white band on the foreskin was pronounced and easily visible (unmistakable really). Sex was too painful to continue. I was now fairly positive that I had LS and met with a family doctor. He agreed and referred me to a urologist. \n\nAt this point I tried applied coconut oil and taking baking soda baths and found them somewhat helpful, but not curative.\n\nAfter waiting about a month I phoned and found that due to the pandemic we were looking at an 6+ month wait to see a urologist. I contacted my family doctor and he prescribed Taro-clobetasol 0.05%, to use twice daily for 3 months.\n\nThe condition improved slowly but noticeably in the first week. After about the 3rd week the white plaque on the tip and foreskin thinned and the foreskin wasnt as tight. Sensitivity has returned to the affected skin, sex is enjoyable again.\n\nNow, after about 4 weeks of treatment only the whitish/grey/purple color on the tip of the penis still remains and there is some very minor tightness to the foreskin still.\n\nI will post updates in the future. Let me know if you have any questions or advice about what to expect next. So, as someone who was just recently diagnosed with Male LS as well, I do want to tell you that you need to keep an eye out for Urethral Stricture. I am 37 and I have developed 3 Urethral Strictures (Possibly more now) and they have caused me to go septic on 3 seperate occasions, one of which involved me fainting and hitting my head on the wall. That trip required an ambulance ride to the local emergency room, a Cat scan, and then anotehr 1.5 hour ambulance ride to the nearest Trauma Center. I ended up in the ICU to get my blood pressure back to around normal (It had fallen to 70/40).\n\nPlease, get into a Urologist as quickly as you can just to verify you are alright, this is not anything to fuck around with as it can end up killing you (Did I mention I went septic twice?)\n\nI have spent over 20 days in the hospital this year alone with this new diagnosis (Though now that it is diagnosed, I have been dealing with the disease itself for at least 10 years or so). I do believe you are correct. It is extremely likely that I do have a uretheral stricture. I would assumed this was what actually led to the LS though (?). A stricture would cause a dribble of urine which would interact with the skin downstream. Thanks. I will bring it up with the urologist when I get to see him/her. The way my Urethral Specialist explained it to me is that LS actually allows for the tissue to be scarred more easily. You have just reminded me of nasty friction burn I got last year after sex, before my recent suspicion that I think I have LS. Had not linked the two until now.\n\nThanks for this post, everything you have described sounds exactly like my situation. I went to the doctor two weeks ago and he thought it was thrush. He gave me hydrocortisone cream which has done nothing. I am back next week so I am going to be more forceful. I am certain this is LS.", "Itch Hi!! So I am trying to figure out what this itch is.

I found an article on Google scholar about treating children who have BXO with a patented medication called OZOILE. From what I read, it seems OZOILE is some form of mixture of ozonated olive oil and vitamin E acetate. The study was done in Italy and I cannot find out if OZOILE is available to the general public. I did order some ozonater olive oil to try anyways. Anyone have any thoughts or ideas? I would like to try this OZOILE but not sure how possible that may be. Sorry to be a downer, but this article throws up some red flags for me. It is published by MDPI, which is... controversial to say the least. They were previously on a well-known list of predatory journals, and have published some really shady pseudoscience. \n\nThe design of the study does not allow them to look at symptom improvement, they are just checking mRNA for inflammatory markers in samples. That is fine, but it does not really tell us what we want to know. \n\nThe company that makes it, Erbagil, also seems pretty weird? Ozoile, by its patent, has to be made with \"+Oil\" meaning only the olive oil harvested from the Erbagil Estate. \n\nI guess I am just saying proceed with caution. There is not much to support their claims. If you still want to try ozonated olive oil to see if it works for you, you can get a different brand, it is all the same thing. Appreciate the input. Of course we should question what we read and what it means. However, im pretty sure it is ozonated olive oil and vitamin E acetate, not just the oil. Not sure i want to get both and figure out how to replicate the cream Hey just wondering if you had any further thoughts. I have been using ozonated olive oil with quite a lot of success Hey man good to hear!

I thought I was going to have 5 days of irritated vulva hell. Turns out, soaking your area in salty water for 5 days straight is super good for your affected area! Well, for mine anyway. I do not know if it is that or a combo of using vitamin E oil every night whilst camping on this sailing trip, but I have to say my affected area is looking and feeling much better! Less red, less irritated, less swollen. I wonder if it was the salt water, Vitamin E oil, lack of stress from being in nature/ off work or all of it combined. Has anyone else tried anything with salt water before? Wow that is interesting.  Thanks for sharing! I would have thought that \"5 days straight in a wetsuit sailing\" would have been a recipe for disaster. You started using the VitaminE oil at the same time though? Too bad that makes it hard to determine which variable was responsible for the results.  You may have to do another sailing/camping trip(that sounds like so much fun!) in the name of science.. This can probably be tested at home with salt baths at a set concentration. I definitely will try to, we have Sea Week in a couple weeks so maybe I will try then!", "Do you experience peeling skin? I have been dealing with on and off itching in the vulva area as well as peeling/flaking of the top layer vulva skin. This typically happens after sex that is rougher or longer than normal, or with insufficient lubrication. I realize irritation or even fissuring can be normal under these circumstances, but this looks weird to me. The skin appears white in those areas, but not in the way I have seen pics of LS. Rather, it looks like the white dead skin you see on chapped lips when you get them wet. It is not shiny and I could rub it off (I do not because I do not wish to cause more irritation).

In fact if I am not mistaken, that was the very first symptom that I had! It is like the sensation of standing on them after a long time. And when that happens, I usually get the same sensation in my vagina as well, and usually that precedes another flare if I dont have my ointment on. And if I have my ointment on properly, I usually do not get these sensations.\n\nI have noticed over the past weeks that it is also in random parts of my body and never sticks to one area for more than maybe half an hour or hour (except for my feet when I do not have any medicine on). If it is in my vaginal areas, if I do not have medicine on it will suddenly fare and feel so irritating. That is kind of how I discovered I had a new area right above my uretha, in the area of skin between there and my clit. I put clob on it and within half an hour it was better, and I stopped feeling like I had to pee every 5 seconds. A couple hours later and it was feeling near 100%. I have yet to put it on this morning and I feel it coming back. I also had an area kind of like that between my vagina and anus and with some ointment application, it felt pretty much 100%.\n\nThis has to be related to my LS, I feel, because this started right about the same time that did.

Check it out here if you are interested: (\n\nHope everyone is doing well! So grateful for you! I was diagnosed a few months ago and my doctor made LS sound like it was no big deal. After months of lackluster treatment results and this disease basically consuming my entire life, I can regretfully say that is not the case. I have been so disappointed with the lack of research and support I have been able to find online. Keep it up, and thank you. I am reading your entire blog. Aw, thank you so much. I do not understand why doctors play it off as if it is no big deal (they clearly do not themselves have LS). Super frustrating indeed. The research is getting better, but we still have a way to go, that is for sure. On my website you can see I also have a YouTube channel. I have a series where I discuss medical terms and what they mean. In 2022, I will have more on what the research says - stay tuned. How are you feeling now with your symptoms...mine definitely took longer than I expected to calm down. I will definitely have to check you out on YouTube as well! I feel like this blog post articulated a lot of what I was feeling / my errant expectations about treatment. I really thought I would start a steroid and my symptoms would be fully resolved. You are so kind for asking. Clobetasol seemed to exacerbate my symptoms, so my doctor had me stop and just do an estrogen cream for the last two weeks. It seems like it is helped clear up most of the white patches, but the skin is super red and raw. I am working through that now. I am supposed to go back on Clobetasol on an as-needed basis, because the itching is still terrible at times, but I am terrified. I have seen posts on here talking about \u201clower strength\u201d steroids and I may ask my doctor about those. Sorry for the long winded response, it is just so nice to have someone to relate to! How did you come to get so involved / knowledgeable about this? Was it your own diagnosis? Yes, if you cannot tolerate Clobetasol there are so many other options out there. Clob is ultrapotent; you may want to look into potent or mid range potency options. Many do well on triamcinolone but like most things, there can be some trial and error to find what works best for you. It is definitely worth asking for and discussing with your doctor as estrogen does not actually treat the inflammation caused by LS, so it is key to find a treatment plan that will reduce inflammation. I was diagnosed about three and a half years ago, but was symptomatic and misdiagnosed for over ten years. Sadly, this is quite common. My background is in science and research, so I have always been passionate about evidence based information and that really helps me learn the science and disseminate it in a digestible way. Also, connecting with Lichen Sclerosus Podcast really inspired me to create content about my experience with LS and all I have learned. Also, a lot of therapy, haha! Feel free to DM me here or on IG if u want to keep me updated on what is going on with your doctor and the steroids. Ten years?! That is heartbreaking, I am so sorry. Such seems to be the case with health issues that primarily effect women. I did not know that about estrogen; so that makes me feel a little silly, and clearly I have so much more research to do. Appreciate the knowledge, and thank you for your openness to being a resource! I definitely want to stay connected. You are a literal angel, and I am grateful. You are not silly at all. none of us are taught a thing about this. Estrogen can help plump up the skin, but does not treat LS. So sometimes folks will use steroids and estrogen cream. It is all about finding what works best for you. I was overapplying my steroid for almost 9 months before I learned that was not the way to use it lol. But no one told me otherwise so I did my best with the knowledge I had at the time. And yes, average diagnosis time is between 5 to 15 years rn!!! ", "Has anyone tried Emuaid?

It is not at a point where it affects how I function sexually but has caused really unsightly scarring and discoloration. I have anxiety and have avoided women all my life because I am petrified of scaring them away or grossing them out.\n\nI have been going on a few dates with this girl recently and she is pretty amazing to be honest. She is so cute and seems like she has a great heart, shes beautiful and really witty.\n\nI have no idea what to do about intimacy. I want a relationship so bad but the thought of making her deal with my problems down there is terrifying. I almost feel like I would be inflicting myself on her, it puts her in such a shitty situation where she has to settle for my shitty genitals or feels bad for leaving me. I wish I could just be like everyone else.\n\nAnyway, if I do decide that i am going to keep chasing after her anyway, and things do get to the point that we are getting intimate, how do I go about it ?\nI am assuming a discussion beforehand is completely unavoidable, how early/late should I bring it up ? How have you guys told partners and how did they react ? If you are a woman what way would you like a man to explain an issue like this to you ? \n\nThanks so much for listening to me I greatly appreciate any advice. I have said, \"I had some tearing and it caused some scarring\".  Straight and to the point.  Never been a problem.  \n\nAny woman that is at the point that they are that intimate with your dick is unlikely to be \"scared away\".  If you think your anxiety is bad, check out what women say about the looks of their vaginas.  So many of them think men will not like the looks/color/etc. but I have yet to meet a man that could give a hoot what the equipment looks like when things are getting hot and heavy.\n\nAny women want to weigh in? Thanks mate this is very reassuring to hear. I would let her know that is an autoimmune issue and there is no way to give it to someone! If she is a great girl, she should be able to take the news in stride and be understanding. You got this!\n\nEdit: spelling mistake Is it the appearance or texture?  If it is scarring, I bet it looks worse to you than anyone else. Just like women fixate on every ripple of cellulite on the backs of their own thighs. \n\nI am an ER nurse. There is a great deal of variation among men. Is the scarring less noticeable when you are erect?  I have seen veiny ones, gnarly ones, smooth ones, textured ones, and the scars that result from piercing can be -- interesting. \n\nI had a partner who had calcium deposits under the skin of his scrotum.  He told me ahead of time so that I would not freak feeling pebbles under his skin. He said it directly, matter of factly, and assured me they posed no health risks. That was more than sufficient. \n\nIf you really feel self conscious, talk to your doctor. There may be options. \n\nGood luck.  This condition is not YOU. LS is linked to autoimmune prevalence in those who have it, but that is not something you can transmit sexually. It is due to genetics.Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease.  \n\nRegardless, you got this. My partner is awesome about it, just communicate. I do not think you have to worry. Everybody has stuff they are worried about, becoming intimate. \n\nI (a woman) would want to know before we got naked. Hey, I have some scarring, it is an autoimmune thing. Not contagious and not active right now, but it left a mark. Do not want to surprise you. \n\nShe might want to hold up right there and verify with the internet. That is fine. Give her the space to do that, if she wants. \n\nWith any luck she will just want to kiss it and make it all better. \n\nHonestly, it may make her feel a little more chill, seeing you have an apprehension. Might make her feel less nervous about whatever she worries about. \n\nSome scars and colors that do not get in the way of sex - that is not anybody\u2019s burden or a real problem at all. You are going to be fine. I have been there. A couple of things to have in mind, if she is a good girl or the woman of your life (for the matter), she will understand when you explain. Consider when you are intimate with a woman that lights are dimmed most of the times and if you wear condom there is nothing to worry about, she will not see anything. If you are in a situation where you have to explain, let us say a couch and she masturbates you, I recommend to relax and say that your glans have a pigment issue since you born and she has nothing to worry about. That is the easiest choice for me and problem solved. Then if you have to explain later when you are in a relationship with her just say about the real problem and she will understand everything and be calm about it. Most important you too. Thanks mate You are welcome. Is the first time I have ever talked about this.  I have been and still am in my personal hell with this problem.  I have been circumcised a year ago and my penis health is improving. There is not enough people who share their experiences and help each other. Hopefully there will be more like us to support and relief the pain that causes. Yeah it definitely helps to talk about it. It is good to hear that the circumcision has helped things. You are right about it being a personal hell, I already had a number of unrelated issues down there before finding out I had lichen. It literally feel like someone is playing a joke on me.\n\nIf i can find a partner who accepts it that would be the greatest thing in the world for me personally. My last advice is that you should live your life at your best and try not to worry about it, we are very self-conscious about the condition and before you know it time flies. Just accept it and move on. The woman of your life will never leave you over this.\n\n Seriously, it is a waste of time to be so worried. I wish you the best of luck finding a partner! I understand completely, it can be difficult to talk about but I agree with others. Mention it beforehand to give her a chance to take it in and research it if she feels the need. She probably will want to know she cannot get it. I have come to the conclusion that it is probably a bigger deal to you than it is to any partner you may have. Good luck. Yeah I have just been straightforward with partners. Like, it can feel like one of the most embarrassing issues, but it is not your fault and all you can do is cope with it! I just tell them I have this weird skin condition that causes scarring/pain and might have to sort of request time off every once in a while to heal. Never been a problem really! Agree with other posters\u2014making it clear that it is not an STD or contagious and giving them access to education if they need it could help. Hang in there! I am in the same boat, I am 21 years old (a male) and the head of my Penis for the last 5 years has been this smooth white. It just keeps getting whiter, I think I caused this from over masturbating when I was young. I never used lube either. I remember I had a piece of skin that looked flaky on the tip of my penis and like an idiot I tore it off... that is where it all started. One doctor had seen it and asked what it was, I said I got my dick Caught in a zipper like an idiot and he prescribed me with nothing. Said to just use vasaline. It scabed up after I tore the layer of skin off and I think I tore off the scab prematurely. Now here we are and almost half the head of my dick is a pearly white and where my glans meets my shaft. Lots of discoloration. This has honestly made me really depressed and I thought of taking my own life. I have 5 had girls on top of me ready to fuck Me, but I was too embarrassed to inform them of my issue. Now, I do not even try to start a relationship with a girl because of this condition. I just quit masturbating a couple days ago to see if it will resolve this discoloration and I started applying bio oil and I said a prayer to god. This has ruined my self esteem, my sex life, and I am starting to lose all motivation to do anything. I have not told a single soul about this, I would literally pay 10,000 dollars with my outstanding insurance to restore my penis to what it once was. I am young in my prime and I am still a virgin because of thiS bullshit. I am at the point in my life where I really want someone to love. I am just so embarrassed and so disgusted of my \u201ccondition\u201d there is no pain, itchiness or any side effect other than the wrinkly smooth white discoloration. If god is real why does he do these things to good people. :( I wish so badly I could go back in time and never tear that skin off and went to the doctor instead. Worst mistake of my life, I could have been with some very breathtaking ladies. Most I have ever done was finger 2 girls and had my dick rubbed on the outside of my pants. I am going to give this no fap about a year and see a doctor again soon but I think it is hopeless. I either gain the strength to tell a woman about my fucking stupid medical issue or just die a fucking virgin. I want a son so badly too. I want to be proud of my body. I feel like a shell of who I once was. I never show my depression on the outside though. I use to smoke a lot of weed since the age of 12 and I am 80 days sober. All my friends smoke weed so I am now a loner. I just really want to find my dream woman to spend the rest of my life with :((((( **Hello.**\n\nI noticed you dropped 3 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.\n\nMaybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.\n\n***\n\n^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^\u2764\u2764\u2764 ^| ^(", "Can someone explain what a flare is? Am I in constant flare? Like how do I know the diff. How do I know it is calmed down or if it is going crazy. My clitoris gets worse every week and during out and my skin is crazy pale but not ripping For me, most of the time, I am fine. I forget LS exists. \n\nThen, one day, there is an itch. Or a tear. Or a burn. If I am lucky I notice a minor itch immediately and hit it with clobetasol and try to fix whatever is going wrong in my life that set it off. Did I start eating some random new food? Is my husband being a big jerk lately? Do I need to tell work to back off on some things? Do I need to adjust something with kids? Did I change underwear or soap? Does the day end in \u201cy\u201d?  Sometimes there is something likely related. Sometimes there is not. \n\nBut a \u201cflare\u201d is a period of \u201cworse\u201d after a period of \u201cbetter\u201d. Clobetasol makes it better but then you back off on the clobetasol for weeks or months, using as little as possible to maintain normalcy. But it is a balance, and when you are not using enough clobetasol to balance life or circumstances or whatever, LS asserts itself again and you curse the universe for a bit. \n\nIf you do not have an official diagnosis or clobetasol, get to doc. Could be a yeast infection. Could be LS. Could be something else. But for me, clobetasol chilled everything out from \u201cI cannot live another moment like this\u201d to \u201c I problem at all\u201d in two weeks. Now I just have occasional flares. They suck, but clobetasol puts them out fast-ish. I appreciate the thought out reply. Where exactly was your LS affecting you and was it whiye payches or cuts? Or overall whiteness?? And did you have any atrophy? When diagnosed, I had a full white figure-eight.  It was not white patches, it was entirely dead-looking tissue-paper skin all around, with purple around that. It had been unbearably itchy, I could not sleep. I would tear and rip open at any time, just sitting down might break it open. Would take a long time to heal.  Was terribly painful.\n\nI suspect the labia have atrophied, but I do not exactly have a photo progression.  It is not really causing me a problem, but they are not what they were twenty years ago.  Everything still functions well enough. It is not the same, but it is okay.\n\nWhen I have a flare now, it is generally itchiness and/or a slice of skin opening up unexpectedly and painfully.  Skin can go white / purple in blotches, but it usually does not get to that point.", "So what exactly is this?? New Long story short, I have white patches on my labia and near my clitoral hood region, and a mad, itching rash there. I noticed the patches today when I went to rub off what seemed like yeast, and was shocked to find that it would not come off!\n\nEverything is telling me I have \"Lichen Sclerosus\". What is this, and why is it SO bad?? Does it mean this mad rash and itching is just going to stay forever? What is the deal??\n\n\n\nStory: A while back, I had a little red sore/ blister come up on the bottom of my vulva, close to my vagina, and I thought it was the result of recklessly wiping too hard in that area (it could be, I am still unsure). \n\nThen when that cleared up after a few days (it was a little painful to sit down and walk because it would get irritated), another blister (?) came up, this time much closer to my vagina. This one was flesh coloured and looked like a bump of skin, while the other was red and looked a little more like a sore. This lasted a day, and again, was easily irritated, so I would have to be really gentle when walking around. For both, I was basically waddling around like a penguin, and taking slow steps up stairs. This one took one day to chill out. \n\nTHEN, yesterday, when that cleared up, I had mad itching on my clitoral hood and the area there after I had a shower. I thought damn, was I just a little too careless with the shower gel (I always attempt to get it to stop from falling near my genitals, which is obviously, near impossible - and yes, it is scented). It itched all day yesterday and today, and I noticed what looked like a rash developing in the area around my clitoral hood - do not think that is ever happened to me before, it was scary. So this morning I thought, I will take a shower and attempt to clean up the area with just water so I shot the area with some moderately hot water - I hoped that would help clean away any debris. Then, after coming out, I noticed some white bits on my labia, near my clitoral hood, and on the top too. I was confused, I thought it was yeast, and I thought whyyyy, because I just cleaned up. Took a closer look and waa surprised to find that the 'yeast' did not rub away. I was very surprised and confused. Then I search it up, and every answer points to Lichen Sclerosus. Is that what this is? It is scary when so many people are saying \"I was scared it was Lichen Sclerosus\", why the fear? What is the deal? Are people afraid because with Lichen Sclerosus, the itching never goes away? Is that even realistic?\n\nAppreciate any feedback, thanks. Hi - sorry you are going through this! It sounds like it could be LS. The itching is a common symptom, as are the white patches, but LS symptoms usually get under control and go into remission with treatment of a topical steroid. It is the sort of thing you have to treat forever; some people find relief/ remission with changes to diet and other lifestyle changes but it varies by person and there is not a ton of documented research on it so topical steroid is most common treatment.\n\nI (47F) got diagnosed when I was 4, and went on to have 2 kids and normal sex life  and no real complications besides what I thought was a serious case of swamp ass this year and it turned out I was having an LS flare. It is all back under control again with no more itching.\n\nGet to a gyn or a dermatologist to confirm and get some meds so you can get some relief. Hang in there! Aw thank you for your warm response. I appreciate that :-)\n\nYeah, I guessed it would be - due to the white patches. I will definitely get myself checked out though, to be certain. Do you know if the blisters I described sound common to the experience/ symptoms?\n\nSucks that you were diagnosed at only 4 !? I am sorry to hear that, but it is good/ relieving to hear that you have never been so badly affected by this as well. I do not want bio kids luckily, and I already skip, for example, dairy (I am attempting to go vegan) which some have stated as flare up triggers, but I cannot imagine working with this feeling, and hope it does not affect my sex life so badly. The scariest thought is if treatment is ineffective. Have you experienced side effects of any of the treatments?\n\nIt makes sense that people would be pretty miserable about something that you constantly have to treat/ keep in check. Thanks again for your response! Sounds like it could be ls (no caps for this mysterious satanic condition). It is true it can be controlled with topical steroids. Generally a biopsy is the surest way to diagnose tho some docs will dx visually and some docs know little about it. Sorry you are suffering! The itch is unbelievable. I was dx last year then in the last month 2 docs said I do not have it or have a mild atypical case. I believe it is actually in remission as I have been treating it w Betamethasone ointment and tried every recommended moisturizer. I like coconut oil and aquaphor. I also soak in borax (yes that crazy 20 mule team borax) but did not confess to my docs. I find it soothing and it STOPS the itch. There are some great posts in this sub about managing ls. I got a lot of tips and support from a FB group. Also, I definitely freaked out for a couple of months but am able to have sex, travel, exercise etc. Take a breath and pamper yourself xo I think blisters are also a possible side effect- I have had one myself but my gyn did not directly attribute it to my LS.\n\nAnd yes on how distracting the crazy itching is! Mine was always worse at night but there definite moments at my desk where I did a shimmy to try to scratch without actually scratching. Thank you \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc I have never had surgery before and the idea of it makes me want to faint lol, so I am going to hopefully avoid that for as long as I can.\n\nDefinitely going to talk to a gp about this today, and see if I can get me some cream.\n\nIdk if it is because I am good at ignoring my pain, but the itching does not seem so bad after a couple of days now. Perhaps that is just the effect of me attempting to gentle with the area. No idea.\n\nWhat is really spooky is, I have this very vague memory of having a white patch down there years back, that went away... do they tend to go away? Perhaps I am imagining this.\n\nThank you so much for your help btw. It is so good to know that kindness is alive in this sub \ud83d\ude42 You are so welcome! I am still laughing about swamp ass. Perfect name for LS.", "Male LS - Clobatesol usage I was following the S3 guidelines of using clobetasol daily for 12 weeks. Since this was mainly drafted for woman i wonder if it is also ok to use clob for such a long period on the foreskin, glans and meatus? Im a bit worried i damage the skin irreversibly. \n\nAny male LS fellow who used it? For how long?\n\nThanks guys I am not a male, but my derm (who specializes in LS) has said that LS damages the skin, not the clobetasol. It is a false belief that clob thins the skin or damages it, when in actuality, the LS does the damage. My dermatologist, who specialises in penile skin diseases, was involved in drafting the BAD and European guidelines. \n\nThere is an element of generalisation in them in that the nature of male and female genitals are, obviously, different and the action of the clobetasol on the mobile, double layered foreskin is complicated.\n\n In short he asks his patients to use Clobetasol for 4 weeks, use something weaker for 4 weeks, mainly clobetasone, and then go back for a further month of Clobetasol if necessary.  \n\nHis concern is that overuse of Clobetasol on the foreskin will complicate circumcision surgery, which is 90+ curative, if the steroid treatment fails to put the disease into remission. \n\nThis is an aspect of his treatment over which we have disagreed as I am not prepared to pursue surgical solutions unless absolutely required. My LS is currently in remission. \n\nI wish you all the best Hi does clob help fade out old scars and swelling around the urethra from LS.", "Dermovate and the clitoris Hi folks, just a question about the use of dermovate. I started using it around my vulval opening as prescribed, then started to also feel an itch up near my clitoris. I used it there too for a couple of days and the clitoris has now felt sore and sensitive for a couple of days since. I am at a loss as to whether this is progressing LS, or whether I have irritated my clitoris by exposing it to a strong steroid and I should leave it alone for a bit. Anyone else had the same issue? My LS is primarily at its worst around my clitoris and I have not experienced increasing pain or discomfort after using dermovate on it but have you been applying it under the clitoral hood? It could just be that you have incredibly sensitive skin and the LS has had a flare up or maybe the dermovate is a bit strong for that particular bit of skin. \n\nAll I can recommend just now is make sure you are applying the correct amount of Dermovate and keep the area clean, dry and moisturiser when you are not using dermovate Hi I may have this. &amp; similar to u it is on my clitoris. Just did biopsy today but was wondering if in diagnosing they did the vinegar test for you? I did and the problem areas turned bright white. Also I do not have any skin shrinking and sometimes the itchiness is just pain/tearing. I have never heard of the vinegar test before actually! That is quite interesting. But no, I got examined and it was plain as day to the gyno that is what I have haha", "Color I have been on the steroid ointment for a few days now and have not noticed any color improvement. I just have a small white patch on the vulva, but for some reason it just will not turn anything other than white. \n\nDoes the steroid ointment bring the pink color back or is it more to just stop it is spreading? I also noticed a very small brownish dot that was not there before... has anyone ever noticed anything other than white? It is going to take a month or so to notice a difference. Things start to be the color they were and it also helps from spreading. Dark spots from bruising are common with LS. If it does not go away or it looks like a funny mole you have to get it checked, though. I understand the skin will always be lighter than it was. Could it be a sign of something dangerous? It does not look like it is changed much, and definitely has not been getting worse. Just weird. I have never had anything like it. But it is only the size of a sharpened pencil tip A tiny spot like that is probably not a cause for concern. The main concern for dark spots on the vulva is skin cancer, but that sounds like just a little bruise. Darks pots from bruises are common with LS and they can look scary but they are harmless. If it sticks around and does any of the things that moles are not supposed to do then you should get it checked like you would any funny mole. Very true, thanks for the advice :) I am still new to this fun new issue I have got! Me too! I think I just read about it a lot because it makes me feel more in control of it. Yeah me too. I go from \u201coh this is not so bad it could be worse\u201d to \u201cwhy me my life is over\u201d hopefully it gets better for the both of us! In my personal experience some areas have returned to normal color over time and others have stayed white", "Early signs of LS in Male~ \"white band\" Hello everyone. After looking at so many penises ranging from so many infections and diseases I think I may have finally found my issue. Unfortunately for me the Holidays are in order so I will hit up a dermatologist when I get back home. \n\nNevertheless I am curious to know your inputs/insight on my circumstance. Basically from reading through this sub I saw that early signs start with a \"white band\" on the foreskin. Sadly for me this was 1 thing that felt that connected to me.\n\nIt has been prevalent supposedly from what my gf said but I havent noticed it until recently because i was just being self conscious about it. I thought maybe i went to town on my guy too much and that was the reason but now I am feeling like I am in a whole new ball game. \n\nI know we cant post pics here but for all you guys who had seen early signs of LS from the formation of a white band, I am asking very politely and shamefully if you could relate to what is happening to me with this band.\n\nI am thankful for all the help I can get, thank you all for this information.", "Fusing and its impact on desire/satisfaction Hi all. I have been on clob a few weeks now, and the flare has settled down. I can have sex without tearing, given generous amounts of lube. My concern is with fusion over my clitoris. It is partial, but happening. I am guessing there is no way to really reverse the damage. What happens when the fusion gets worse? Do I lose the ability to get turned on or to orgasm? I am just starting to process what this all means for the future of my (and dear hubby's) love life. I have heard soaking in borax or using a cotton ball method with borax can reverse fusing and help slow it down alongside clob usage. Clob should also prevent future fusing. Some people also like to massage the area or use a vibrator with suction. In the event that fusing occurs to the extent that it affects your sex life, there are surgical options. \nStem cells have also helped people unfuse without any cutting, really cool treatment option.\nOn another note, I have heard from many women with complete fusion over the clitoris who can still fully orgasm. The part you see is really just the tip of the iceberg, Google clitoris anatomy.  \nIt sounds like you are healing really fast! Hang in there\u2764\ufe0f My take is that fusion/phimosis/burying tend to change the *type* of stimulation you like, rather than making stimulation impossible. I have a pretty phimosed glans clitoris (my foreskin does not pull back from the tip of my clitoris), and I think it is part of why I prefer deep massage-like pressure and rumbly vibrators with large heads over a lot of stroking. \n\nI have read that anatomical changes are permanent, but since starting clob I am pretty sure my glans has unfused from my foreskin a little bit. I have also read about minimally invasive techniques to free up the glans when it is phimosed (e.g. for treatment of keratin pearls). \n\nAlso, if the clob is working, it should prevent progression. So the fusion should not really get worse. \n\nIf you ever do have difficulty orgasming, I recommend getting a strong vibrator like a Hitachi or a Doxy. Hitachis have been used successfully to help women who have never been able to orgasm. Personally I have found them to be VERY efficient, and fun to use with a partner.", "Waiting for diagnosis mid flare Hi everyone. Apologies because I am sure this has been asked but I am freaking out and super uncomfortable.\nI think I am having my first real flare up and I cannot get in to my gyno for 9 days. Have not been diagnosed but my doctor said it sounded like LS last time. Feeling like I am doomed. \n\nI am really scared that it will progress before I can get in to my doctor and I am feeling super overwhelmed. Can anyone let me know if that is too long to wait or if I should go to some sort of urgent care? I am concerned they will not be able to do anything.", "Feeling completely hopeless. Just learned I have LS after almost 6 years. Because of the condition I am depressed since I was 15 and never had sex. For last few years I thought it was yeast infection and tried treating it with antifungal cream, of course it did not help and now I am reading there is nothing I can do about LS. How do you guys manage to cope with that? I know changing your diet and lifestyle to a healthy one can help a little bit but it will not make it 100% go away and I could not stop eating meat or fast foods from time to time. It feels like my entire world felt apart. I had hope I will cure it and have normal sex life in future but now I feel nothing. I do not even want to try steroid cream because it has so many negative side effects that are even worse than LS. I tried psychotherapy but it did not help since my issues stem not from my psyche but my body. I feel like I am cursed. I am ready to tell my dr that I would like to look into assisted suicide. In my state there is something called the \u201cdeath with dignity act.\u201d I read that in some cases, if quality of life is completely diminished (which min is) then I may qualify. I am done living like this. And if living like this is my only option, I am happy to die. I would rather not. Good luck! I really hope someone can help you, maybe a specialist. But I am completely hopeless too and I am ready to be done. Age 29, diagnosed at 23. I have had twelve years of on again off again clobetasol steroid cream usage and it fixed me up so fast. If there are unwanted side effects, it will be unfortunate, but so far it has literally given me twelve years of life. \n\nEating perfectly does not solve problems. Do not fall into that trap. If you have a true dietary issue you could find it, but it is not fast food or meat. It is a disease. (I had to get a lot of eating disorder therapy to get there. Literally, the lesson is \u201cyou cannot perfect-eat your way into solving problems. Not even medical problems, unless you have an allergy.\u201d)\n\nSteroid cream is easy and well tolerated. Yes, it is potent, but after a couple of weeks you could be effective symptom free. Beats skin ripping up and becoming cancerous!! Beats it by a mile!!!\n\nWhatever you are reading to freak you out, put it down and get a doc\u2019s perspective. Yeah, steroids can sound scary. I do not ever want them - until I need them, and then thank goodness they exist. Thank goodness. They are powerful. \n\nTwelve years, no side effects yet, I got to live. It is definitely worth trying. \n\nStill worth therapist. There is grief and adjustment and stuff to deal with. And if you feel cursed, perspective can help. Therapist can help with that. \n\nI hope you feel better soon. I know how you feel and I am very sorry, have you tried steroid creams and olive oil? if that is so I will give steroid cream a chance, before that I will try to see if rubbing olive oil on my foreskin helps, I heard it improved the condition in some cases but I am not sure if it works on men, if not I will arrange a meeting with a doctor and ask him for perscription I have. I have tried everything that is available to me. I have been in support groups for ages and literally done everything that others have done. Good luck to you!! I hope I can end my life soon! Take care! \u2764\ufe0f Sorry to hear that, I feel the same way about this condition. It is just seems like ultimate curse from god. I use Bio Oil on my foreskin daily and occasionally steroid cream during flare ups. The steroid cream works great you just have to apply it sparingly. Ive had the condition for over 10 years, it is managable do not panic! You just have to figure out what regime works best for you. Thanks if the olive oil alone will not work I will definitely try steroid cream. Btw did you have white spots on your foreskin, did they disappeared completely after using the creme? I do not understand why you would not try the steroid cream. Of course you are going to read more negative things than positive bc that is what people want to vent about. Believe it or not, there is a lot of people living their life normally. I am. I learned what triggers me and what is ultimately causing the LS and it is my estrogen, it is always been too low bc I took birth control for 8 years. For the years that I have had LS, I was taking the smallest dose of estrogen I could. Once I changed my birth control to something with higher estrogen, it is like my LS disappeared. I have not had to change my diet at all. Before I figured this out, I was using my steroid ointment and it seriously changed my life. It stopped the itching, burning, fissures and I could have sex again. Please get some help, it is not the end of the world. There are people here with success stories, there are blogs where people share what helped them, there are podcasts also. I would do further research and try to keep a positive outlook. What are your symptoms exactly and have you tried steroid creams? Im sorry for what you are going through, have you seen a specialist? Have you tried systemic steroids orally? It is an inflammatory \"autoimmune\" disease so systemic oral immune modulators might help? Please go an see a specialist and discuss all the options and do regular follow/ups with them and keep on trying until you find what works Yes and they do not disappear completely but they are dramatically reduced by the cream, but results may vary depending how severe it is to begin with. When I was first diagnosed I went to the doctor as my foreskin could not even pull back because the skin had tightened and scarred, it was painful and ugly, and I feared for my sex life. After being given an effective treatment (Dermovate) after first being given an ineffective one (Betemethasone) I was amazed at how much the symptoms reversed. My penis actually looked like nothing had ever happened, foreskin completely back to normal flexible and more importantly, it looked how a penis should again! it was quite an emotional experience for me after suffering with it for a while. So definitely try the cream! I have no reason to believe a god exists. But it certainly does feel unfair. I am just scared it will mess up with my hormone levels and cause gynecomastia or something similar. It is hard to stay positive when you know it will stay with you for the rest of your life. Inflammation and white spots, very noticeable ones, on my foreskin. I have not tried the steroid cream because I am scared of side effects like gynecomastia. But there is a lot of cases, like mine, where it does not stay for life if you just try to figure what triggers it. Why not take the chance of using steroid cream and find that it actually works? Sorry this sounds mean but youre just crying about something that might not even happen to you??? Like I said, you will read a lot more negative than positive, take the chance, bc you might get a positive outcome like A LOT of people. Everyone here will help you, be a shoulder to cry on if things somehow got worse. But I really do not think it will, I mean, you already have LS, ya know? Try to stay positive \ud83d\udc95 If olive oil by itself does not fix it I will have no other choice than try steroid cream I am just scared it will not help at all with LS and will give me other conditions that will further lower my self esteem like gyno or hair loss. Why.. why would olive oil fix it?\n\nEdit: a word It helped a lot of people, made white spots disappear completely.. But mainly women so I do not know if it will make any difference if I am a man. Any pain or itchiness? No but I remember I sometimes had issues with pulling off my foreskin during masturbation. That was the only time it really hurt. But the worst thing are those white patches. They look disgusting and my self esteem is non existent because of them. I do not even want a girlfriend right now cause I would be too self conscious about LS to even have sex with her. So right now your issue is mostly an appearance issue? \n\nI suggest you see a specialist and get steroids or if you are worried about thinning or whatever just take a tacrolimus \"immunomodulator\" that has no side effects and similar results of steroids Yes it is appearance issue that ruined my life. I will try tacrolimus thanks. I just hope it is available in my country and the doctor will understand. I just read about tacrolimus and it apparently can cause diabetes and hair loss. I do not know if living like this is even worth it to be honest. But keep in mind that it takes time and consistency to improve appearance and I want you to know that girls do not really care as much as they are thought to. They literally want your presence and companionship more than an even toned penis. As long as it functions it will be enough. Best of luck and stay positive I do not know about that if I were a girl I would be scared it is std or yeast infection. Living like this is not worth it for me. No it cannot and your resources are wrong. It is used by MILLIONS around the world for eczema and its APPROVED FOR BABIES as young as 2 years to use safely with no side effects. A huge study of 10's of thousands of patients have used it for two years and non had side effects.\n\nStay away from google it will confuse you Okay sorry I guess people lie on the internet. But is it a cream or pills? I see that it is used for people with organ transplants. Would a doctor really prescribe something like this for a skin condition? Yes we are talking about the low potency ointment for skin inflammation Thank you very much I will try it. It is a shame you cannot buy those things without prescription tho. Taking a steroid ointment is very different than taking an oral steroid. Oral steroids have a lot of side effects because they travel through your blood. Steroid ointment mostly only has local side effects. Mainly it may weaken your skin in the area that you apply it, but LS already does that much more, so the steroid is like five steps forward and one step back. \n\nAnother option is to try a steroid-free medication like tacrolimus. I have been reading about this as well and how long-term use can potentially lead to skin cancer/lymphoma/SCC of the area applied. Is this also bunk?", "Alternative treatments? Has anyone heard of or had success with alternative treatments for lichen sclerosus?\n\nAfter being misdiagnosed with chronic yeast infections since I was a baby, I finally was diagnosed via biopsy after I saw a new ob/gyn last October (my old ob/gyn had retired). I had literally never heard of this disease before and I still do not understand it at all. My ob/gyn prescribed me clobetasol and I followed the standard directions. After two months, I had gotten no relief so I stopped using it and just dealt with the intense pain and bleeding I frequently have. In March of this year, I saw a dermatologist for an allergic reaction I was having to some skin moisturizer. He diagnosed me with hidradentitis supporutiva as well and started me on two months of antibiotics. He plans to have me start Humira next month as a long-term treatment for the HS. About a month after starting the antibiotics, my lichen scleorosus has gotten so bad. I am in constant pain and cannot sit down sometimes because it hurts so bad. I am bleeding so much too. It got so bad that I tried using the clobetasol again but I actually had an allergic reaction (intense burning, pain, hives, etc) to the clobetasol so my dermatologist told me to stop using it. My dermatologist told me that the Humira should treat both the HS and the lichen scleorosus but I have not found anywhere that says immunosuppressants are a treatment for lichen scleorosus. I am scared of topical steroid creams now so I am starting to lose hope of ever getting relief. I am sorry you are going through all of this. \n\nI do not know how to fix it. But I do wonder if the antibiotics could have allowed a yeast overgrowth? Frustrating when they falsely misdiagnose yeast infections over and over, but maybe this time, with antibiotics, that is really happening. At that point if you tolerate diflucan it might be worth trying. The antifungal creams always burned too much when my skin was raw. \n\nOthers here have suggested emollient creams that are gentle. It seems to me that coconut oil could not hurt, to maybe try that at bedtime. It is done wonders for my son\u2019s eyelid eczema, so I have seen it is a special kind of safe moisturizer.  That is what I would try first, before a manufactured cream that might have less gentle ingredients. \n\nBreathable non-thong undies are a big deal too. Super clean.  Fragrance-free gentle laundry detergent (I use All free and clear powder) for your undies and your bedsheets. \n\nIf the docs cannot help and these things do not help, might consider talking to a naturopath. They may have ideas for getting your whole body happier rather than trying to path up problems one places that cause another one somewhere else. \n\nHope you can find some relief! Please accept my sympathies about your condition. I strongly recommend you educate yourself about lichen sclerosis. A google search will deliver several excellent sites that talk about it. I am seeing a female-specialist urologist who is monitoring me for any changes to my lichen sclerosis, and I use clobetasol twice a week. My naturopath has me on the following:\n\n*  10 mcg Estradiol vaginal suppositories, 2 weeks daily then twice a week.\n\n* Zinc and Vitamin A supplements\n\nSo far, I seem to be in remission. I also have lichen planus in my mouth, and the sensitivity in my mouth continues, and I cannot eat spicy or overly hot or cold foods. I use a different corticosteroid in my mouth, alternating with Protopix.\n\nFWIW, I also had HS for many years. I seem to have aged out of it. My adult kids have it, too.", "Cant find / books related to LS Hello everyone! Does any of you have the PDF of Lichen sclerosis beating the disease by Ginny Chandoha or do you know any way to buy ebook version of it? I dont live in USA. I am also open to other suggestions about books \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I have The V Book by Elizabeth Stewart. It is not solely about LS, but there is a section on LS. It is also a little outdated. But it is a wonderfully comprehensive resource about vulvovaginal health, and I found it very empowering, especially when dealing with doctors. Thank you I will def check it. I was hoping to find a whole book related to LS but it is not very common I guess", "Biopsy experience (F 20\u2019s) In case anyone is curious I just wanted to report on my experience with my biopsy. I (F early 20s) went to a dermatologist who said she just thinks an allergic reaction(soaps, detergents, etc). It took me months to go in so my most serious symptoms have stopped. I requested a biopsy anyways to be sure. \n\nThe only thing I felt was the needle when she did the shot to numb the area. I hate needles and it really was not bad. After that I did not feel anything and have had 0 pain or bleeding since (3 days now). Just a small stitch or 2 that should be dissolved by my next appointment. Most of the pain comes when the numbing stopped for me. I was in a lot of discomfort for a week, but polysporin helped me heal. Curious to know your results when you get them! Where did you get your biopsy done? Like on what general area/spot I mean She did the biopsy pretty much on the cusp of my labia majora and minora, pretty far down, basically to just the right of the vaginal opening. Hope I described it in a way that makes sense haha You\u2018re lucky. I had my biopsy done 5 days ago and it still hurts a bit when I sit down or wear tight jeans Same. I had my biopsy done a little over a week ago and it still hurts/bleeds on and off. Mine just hurts but does not bleed. Did you get stitches?  No stitches. I bled more than normal the day of too. I am wondering if the NP nicked a vessel or something because when I got off the bed there was blood all over the place! Yes that does sound a little bit strange. Probably a combination of hitting a vessel and no stitches. I bled only on the way back home from the hospital and that\u2018s it. oh wow ouch, i am sorry to hear that! that is exactly what i expected to have happen to me. took me 6 months to go in because i was afraid of doing the biopsy. i am surprised to hear they did not do stitches for you! I got one or two, but did not bleed that much. definitely saw a decent bit of blood on the guaze they had used during though. i hope you heal soon! I sure I probably needed one! Thanks it is getting better every day It really depends on where the biopsy was done. Some places will be more painful than others. agreed! that is why i just shared my personal experience with it, i know it varies person to person.", "My experience so far with LS (and my road to recovery which is working great) I was scared to post this here, I have been lurking on this subreddit for a while, but I made a 'subtle first post' where I shared my experience and LS healing and so I thought I would post here in hopes that you all can get help from it.\n\nSo I was diagnosed with LS about 4 years ago. It was not much of a problem, I would put on the steroid cream and then sex would only sort of hurt and the LS would mostly go away.\n\nThen over the last 3-6 months, it really started hurting. Could not have sex.\n\nMy comprehension of auto immune diseases up until 3-6 months ago:\n\nProbably caused by stress or just your \"immune system attacking itself\" (looking back, that just sounds so rediculous... how the body just 'magically' starts assaulting and destroying itself)\n\nAnd if I am lucky, the LS will just go away.\n\nWell it was not. It was getting worse. The roid creams were not working. I was starting to experience the saying \"it is like a thousand paper cuts.\" It had never gotten this bad.\n\nSo I started doing research about Auto Immune Diseases (AID). I will refer to Auto Immune Diseases as AID from now on.\n\nPeople who is parents drank / smoke while they were in the womb have a higher probability of developing an AID.\n\nStress can be a factor, but probably is not a primary one.\n\nI have been diagnosed with AID in the past, without getting notification from those who diagnosed me that it is an AID.\n\nLot's of other weird stuff that correlated with me having a weak immune system.\n\nPersonally, just my perspective - you do not have to embrace this - but from what I have experienced in my life - there is a cure for every ailment besides the physical death. You just have to find it. Sometimes its hard.\n\nI was not excited to have to go through this 'finding a cure' problem with LS again.\n\nSo I spent about $500+ dollars on new vitamins, pure vitamins, supplements, etc. Nothing really worked after about a month. No change. I was taking so many vitamins. Nothing was happening. Creams were not working.\n\nSo I purchased a book on Amazon with some INCREDIBLE reader reviews about lichen sclerosus. They were so moving some of them made me want to cry a bit, and I had not even read the book.\n\nSo I picked it up. And started reading it. And it broke my heart.\n\nI have not felt that depressed about LS, even when I could not have sex, when stuff looked 'weird' down there, when it hurt to pee, etc. Reading this book opened my eyes to the reality of what I have, and how to treat it, the changes I would have to make, and how the steroids I had been applying were probably going to have long term effects due to my already weakened immune system.\n\nSo.....\n\nI started applying what I learned in the book.\n\nWhat I have done so far:\n\nOmega 3's, 1000mg, 3x a day.\n\nCut out ALL chemicals from my daily experience. I only use bronner's soap for my body, hands, hair, plates, dishes, silverware.\n\nFor household cleaners and laundry detergent, I use products by Ingredients Matter.\n\nToothpaste - I use CaliWhite chemical free toothpaste.\n\nI carry soap with my in a small bottle everywhere I go so I can wash my hands without chemicals.\n\nI am only eating fresh foods now. No more foods with chemicals. I try to eat organic as much as I can. personally I hate cooking so this is a huge change for me. I need to do more of this.\n\nI do not use the steroid cream anymore. \nSince then, my skin is 'white,' but it is mostly healed. I have to 'go slow' for sex at first until everything is well lubricated but after that - I am just fine. \n\nThe 'thousand papercuts' feeling has completely gone away.\n\n\nAnother thing that I have learned in my research is that Nicotine REALLY, REALLY messes with your immune system. I had no idea. So I am in the process of quitting. I am sure once I do that, on top of what I am already doing, my LS will be so minimal or probably disappear.\n\n*ALSO* something I did not realize in the beginning that made me so sad was that I thought this would be a long and arduous journey and that freedom from LS would only happen at the end.\n\nThis was not the case. Just these simple adjustments really cleared up my LS. Making changes will have an effect - your body will heal. So small changes will make also beneficial changes in your LS.\n\nSide effects from going 'chemical free' that I have noticed:\n\nMy Back-acne has completely cleared up.\n\nI have about 70% less blackheads on my nose and face.\n\nI have more energy in general.\n\nThe callouses on my feet are melting off. It is very weird.\n\nMy dandruff is pretty much gone, and I do not have to use head and shoulders anymore. Bonner's Tea Tree soap is working great.\n\nI really hope you all pick up the book. It is really brought faith into my life after being kicked by this horrible ailment called LS.\n\n\nMuch Love to all of you. I am glad for you, but I have got a quibble with your use of the word \"chemicals\". Everything is made of chemicals. Perhaps a more precise way of saying what you mean is \"no synthetic ingredients\", aka derived from petroleum.\n\nA whole food diet is really important for me... Minimally processed ingredients, food cooked from scratch. Yes! This is an accurate statement. \"No synthetic ingredients.\" Is what I am referring to when I say chemicals. Ya... I will miss it too! I vape personally. Making the jump once my juice arrives to half the nicotine level I have been using. Oh sorry, I meant it the opposite way. I grew up in a home with both parents that smoked in the home, my dad would chain smoke (up to 4 packs/day) especially on long car rides with us. Not sure if my mom smoked while pregnant, but I definitely had a ton of exposure. I hated it, still do. Lost my dad to lung cancer and COPD and he was in his mid-50s. I would not wish that battle on my worst enemy. I started the autoimmune protocol diet for my UCTD and it helped immensely with that and the LS. Diet is definitely a huge component! \n\nI am glad you are feeling better! I do encourage you to keep seeing a doctor regularly to monitor your condition and get visual checks, especially since we cannot always see everything down there so well. \n\nI say this because I have an older relative who never had symptoms and only experienced the white plaques. She went to a dermatologist for a check up after almost a decade and found that she had cancer in a few spots because the disease was still progressing even though she felt totally fine. This is what I am the most scared of :( I also mostly do not have any other symptoms other than the white spots and occasional very bearable itching My doctor told me (and I have read in a research study he gave me) that using a steroid regularly was the best way to prevent cancer and it showed a clear difference between the groups studied. I will see if I can find the study online and I will link it. Thanks! What about the side effects of it though? :( lots of people seem to be really concerned about them on here Outside of the initial use of multiple times a day after diagnosis, the use is not often enough or in sufficient quantities to become a problem. I was concerned too and asked two doctors and my pharmacist about it. They all said that since I am not slathering it over huge areas of my body the systemic effects would be minimal, if any. I use my steroid two times a week and that keeps things under control. I also use an amount that is about half the size of a pea and I make sure I only apply it where I have white plaques and/or I feel symptoms. \n\nMy doctor said that if I end up with a flare at some point then the directions for application will change back to something more closely resembling using it twice a day every day for a few weeks, but the diet has really made a huge difference and I have not had any problems in over a year!\n\nEdit: I also use a less powerful steroid. It is triamcinolone and is less potent than clobetasol. I had the triamcinolone on hand from another rash I had elsewhere and my doctor said we will try it and if it does not work then we will go up in power, but it worked just fine. Thanks!!! That gives me so much hope and power Hi thanks for the great detailed post. May I ask which Perrins you are using? Many thanks", "Does this white appearance look like figure 8  You have posted your pics in here a bunch of times. I know how desperate it must feel to not have answers as I am in the same boat but the people here are not doctors and we can only give you an answer so many times. I hope you find a doctor willing to help you  Nope. Figure 8 is vulva, perenium and anus. \n", "Is fusion caused by sticking of the skin due to excessive scratching? Or is just a natural progression of the disease itself and has nothing to do with scratching?  From what I have read and been told, the fusing happens because the skin tears and heals by joining up to nearby skin. I am not sure it is got anything to do with the scratching in itself, but the scratching will lead to further tears and disruption of the skin meaning the damaged skin has to find more skin to join to, exacerbating the fusing problem. \n\nI think that is why it is important to keep the skin moisturised and medicated when necessary so it does not tear and fuse.\n\nHope this helped! Once I started using steroid creams I noticed the skin becoming dry and sticking. Thankfully the cream has been amazing anmt reversing the white scaring I just experienced sudden and extensive fusing. After more than a decade of LS being well-controlled, it suddenly went utterly haywire and fused everything from the clitoris down. Goodbye, all gone. In a couple of weeks. \n\nNo warning except for some super itchy nights. I did not scratch. I used clobetasol but it was not enough at that point. \n\nI think that when you are scratching enough to tear the thin skin of the labia then those tears lead to scarring that absorb and tighten the labia. You do not want those tears. \n\nBut the itching itself is indicating the progression of disease. Not scratching does not mean nothing will happen. \ud83d\ude13 I am so sorry \u2639\ufe0f I have pretty substantial fusing but very minimal history of tearing or scratching (since mine is not very itchy, not because I am good at not scratching.) I am hoping that now I am diagnosed and treated, the fusion will not progress any further. I am just going to go out on a limb and assume that the fusing is caused by the same thing as the vaginal narrowing and the reabsorption of the labia minora --- which is a direct result of the inflammatory process.\n\nMine also is not super itchy, more painful. I cannot say I am not scratching in my sleep but I do not really scratch during the day, especially because I am certain I will break the skin that way. I lost one side of my labia minor at this point and the other is significantly shorter. No idea if fusing will ever happen to me as well... but... fingers crossed!\n\nThe most important thing is to keep the inflammation under control enough that it does progress.", "Had 1/2 of my labia excised, now doctor wants another surgery. Help! Hi! I have had LS for years now (I am almost 31 F) it is been utter hell. I have done all of the steroids, and last year I had 1/2 of one of my labias excised (I jokingly called it my \u201cNemo fin\u201d \ud83e\udd74).\n\nAnyways I figured I will just never be comfortable going to the bathroom or during any sort of sex, but I saw my doctor again today and she says we may have to do an entire excision and reconstruction of my perineum. She is also so confused as to why I have this \u201cso young\u201d.\n\nThat all sounds so barbaric, but I am willing to do anything because of how this drastically effects my quality of life at this point. \n\nHas anyone else had multiple excision surgeries? Or any for that matter? Does this seem extreme for my age?\n\nThanks! Does she specialize in this? No! She is my regular gyn, but has done this with several patients. \n\nI guess I feel like an idiot now for not even thinking there could be LS specialists \ud83d\ude26 There are definitely vulvar disease specialists. I think you should consider going to one before going all in on surgery again. Where are you located? I am in Western NY! I have to assume there is got to be someone in NYC that would specialize. There is a specialist named Jill Krapf, as well as Andrew Goldstein. They operate out of NYC + DC. It is not the best if you are financially strapped as they do not take insurance but look into it.  Thank you so so much!! I had an appointment there without a biopsy for $1400, if that is do-able for you (I think with biopsy it might be closer to $2k but you have already been diagnosed) then def consider it. Good luck and I hope you do not have to go thru any surgeries again Absolutely agreed. Also if going ahead with surgery, insist on having an experienced surgeon who has done many vulvar surgeries before. Surgery for LS in women is not recommended because it is known that symptoms return afterward.  Did you try tacrolimus or pimecrolimus ointments or even retinoids?  The NIH even lists cryotherapy and laser treatments as potential treatments.  Surgery for LS is limited almost exclusively to removal of the foreskin in men.  \n\nI suggest contacting ( and see if they have any recommendations for you or could maybe help you find a knowledgeable doctor. How have you been using the steroid ointment? Thank you that is a huge help! I have only done clobestasol (spelling) I used clobetasol for 3 years on and off. Usually daily for 2 weeks then 2x a week for two weeks and then \u201cas needed\u201d. But I also went 3 months using it daily because I really felt I was \u201cas needed\u201d, I had huge tears. Have you ever tried a slightly weaker steroid? The clob was too strong for me and was causing me more irritation, no matter how I tried using it. Eventually the doctor gave me triamcinolone which does not cause the same irritation thankfully. I would definitely try to see a specialist and get more opinions, especially being so young! I am 36 and cannot say I have known anyone else around our age have such drastic treatment. Thank you I am going to try some specialists suggested. I am embarrassed I feel like such an idiot that I trusted my doctor so much, I do not think she did anything wrong, I look fine physically after surgery etc, I just assumed I would deal with hell \u201cdown there\u201d forever and was willing to try anything. I appreciate your help I am going to also ask for a different steroid! I may be downvoted like hell but knowing it could help, so be it.\n\nHave you tried stuff outside of the traditional medical fields?\n\nWim Hof Method (go see some of the testimonials on recovery from auto-immune disorders on his channel), fasting or... I do not know it is actually the only two ones I kind of believe in.\nOh and I also personally believe in the possibility that clay may help but for what it is said in the field it would be even longer to have effects with scarred tissues so...\n\nAnyways, my two cents, maybe it rings a bell or gives some hope :) I have not tried any of the above but I am open to ANYTHING! (Silly me for not thinking for myself and only listening to professionals, I feel stupid) You have given me a lot to research and I seriously appreciate it!!! Well I am glad to hear it!\n\nAt least what is sure with Wim Hof method is that it will give some benefits... It just does, really. You can check /r/becomingthiceman and /r/coldshowers for communities around this. It helps so much with anxiety it is crazy actually.\nAnd if you are not anxious then at the very least it will make you love the winter :D\nBut I will let you research !\nYes Theory has a nice video/documentary about Wim Hof on Youtube that is a good start, but the videos on Wim's channel about some recovery cases are really motivating too.\n\nClay is also sure to not hurt. Now, would it work is another question! I love it because it is fun to have dirt around and on your body, but I am not even sure it has an effect. There is one documented case of good efficience agaisnt some crazy african flesh-eating bacteria that makes me think it must also work for more, but science is not there yet (and might never be because who is going to make money on dirt).\n\nAnd fasting is a bit trickier but I really think it can help. Science has started giving some positive feedbacks on it, media outlets even titled \"fasting 3 days reboots your immune system\" (as a comment on an actual study showing this or something akin to this... But you know, media interpretation of the results might not be the most unbiased so again, I will let you check).\n\nAlways listen to yourself and stop whatever feels bad but go and experiment I guess it is better than remaining passive, at the very least :)\n\nAnd a happy cake day to you ! I have heard alternative treatments such as Vit D and zinc. Oral and topical. Healing the gut biome. PRP. Gluten and sugar free diets. Etc. I am 30M and I dont seem to have bad symptoms. Rash and pain not really an issue. Just the white scarring. But ivd heard women getting relief from Zinc Oxide cream. We call it Sudo cream here. Just a basic nappy rash baby cream. I will apply it if I think the skin is starting to redden Thank you!!! GIRL NO!!! Do NOT let anyone perform surgery who is not up to date on current LS research, which she clearly is not if she is stuck on your age!!\n\n\n\nFollow this Dr ^^ listen to her podcast episode on \n\nYou can even reach out to her for a second opinion asap!!! She can see you virtually if you pay out of pocket since it would not be in network (unless your in D.C.) \n\nIn the podcast episode she discusses different surgical options!! There is no good reason for doctors to *not* accept any insurance; they are always sketchy. It is a huge red flag. Thank you so so much!!!! They are like the leading researchers into lichen sclerosus rn as far as I know", "Fusing inside my vagina I have had some fusing on my vulva outside my vagina, but recently I noticed a mass forming on the inside the lips and it seems to be fusing of two sides together. How can I stop fusing on the inside? I would definitely, if you have not already, visit your gynaecologist or doctor about the mass you are speaking about. If you mean that your vagina appears to be fusing shut from the inside then I know that I have been recommended to have either regular sexual intercourse or use a vibrator/dildo regularly to keep it open and prevent the skin from tightening or shrinking too much in that region. But I would definitely go get seen to as I cannot imagine that is comfortable at all and I would be apprehensive to experiment as you do not want to make the situation worse Agreed, this definitely needs a doctor visit. Any new growth like a \"mass\" also needs to be checked by a professional to make sure it is not a malignancy. Absolutely agree with getting that checked out ASAP. I have lichen sclerosis too and my mass turned out to be vulva cancer so please go get checked. Thankfully it was caught early but the LS is still an issue as it is autoimmune which puts me at continued risk of a recurrence. Close monitoring is a must with LS. Hope all is well though. Mass was probably the wrong word, I am pretty sure it is just my skin fusing together but I am meeting with a doctor next week", "Urinary tract issues Does anyone else\u2019s sclerosus affect their urinary tract? I was diagnosed last year after over a year of thinking I was just consistently having UTIs. My biggest symptom is pain while urinating and the burning urge to pee when I have a flare up. Occasionally I have blood in my urine too. Just curious if anyone else has these same symptoms as I have not come across anyone else who has. Almost every time I have a flare up, I also get UTIs I used to have a lot of problems but they pretty much cleared up when I got the LS under control.  I have had only one bad UTI in the last ten years, and I know how and why that happened - not related to LS at all. All those UTIs I used to get, the interstitial cystitis they said I had, the yeast infections they said I had ... all of that pretty we cleared up with treatment for LS, for me. \n\nBlood in your urine is definitely something to discuss with your doctor. You should not be having repeated UTIs. SOMETHING is letting bacteria in through your urethra, it seems. Is the opening damaged by LS? Is it the treatments you are using for LS, the way they are applied maybe, something??\n\nHope you can get some resolution. Blood in the blood tubes. Pee in the pee tubes. And no bacteria in either!", "when is it safe to start having sex? i have been using clob for a little while now and i feel the itching subsiding. will i ever be able to have pain free sex/masturbation? Start gentle. If you are not having pain you should be fine!!", "From subtle symptoms to labia suddenly fusing before my eyes PLEASE HELP So I have had up until now very very mild symptoms of LS. So mild I fact that I thought it was all in my head and no doctor noticed it. Well I started feeling itchy about a week ago, that improved. But then I got very stressed out and also had rough sex for the first time in a while. The sex was painful, my labia swelled up, but the pain subsided. No itching. I do not have the classic white patches. But now I am looking and I think I see my labia is literally starting to fuse overnight! (Will put photos in comment if allowed)\n\nIve applied coconut oil but have no idea what to do. I do not have access to any high potency corticosteroids and it will probably be days to a week before I can see a doctor. Can I apply otc hydrocortisone cream? I put on some coconut oil since I hear moisture is very important for LS but I know it will not stop the fusing and I am terrified tbh. My doc told me to use otc steroids when pregnant, if they controlled it well enough. They did. I suspect you want an ointment rather than a cream. \n\nI would doubt you are fusing that fast - maybe you are still swollen? Or maybe torn and the tear is being too aggressive in where it is trying to stitch itself back together? \n\nHope the best for you. Maybe you can see a dermatologist or obgyn faster if you tell them it is an emergency, and graphically, why? Shape of a body lifelong is truly an emergency. \n\nGood luck and I hope you get relief soon. Wow that is really scary! I think it cannot hurt to try over the counter steroids if you can get them. If it really is LS it should help stop any fusing going on. \n\nI hope you can get to a dr soon! A diagnosis and prescription should help. Thanks! I do not have any actual tears that I am aware of but I just started my period so would not know where the blood was coming from. I do have what looks like dry, peeling skin around the vaginal opening. I do not know if this is a symptom of ls or not.

I have got a doctor appointment scheduled but it is not till March 3rd unfortunately but seeing if I can get in sooner with a different doctor.", "Is this Lichen Sclerosus? I have had these white spots for exactly a year going in January.  They come and go but lately have been sticking around more often.  They are always sore/painful.  I have been to multiple specialists and nobody has been able to give me a diagnosis or even anything that resembles one.  I have been prescribed Clobetasol (along with numerous other steroids and Tacrolimus) which I am not sure has worked at all.  Not being able to get answers coupled with the pain has made my mental health non existent.  I have a skin biopsy scheduled to hopefully get some form of answers but I would appreciate any help.  Just knowing what I am facing would be huge a relief off my shoulders.  \n\n\n\n Hi. It is not entirely clear, but given lack of a frenulum, I am assuming that you are circumcised. If this is the case, and it was a neonatal circumcision, the chances of this being LS are quite low. LS tends to be a disease of natural men or men who were circumcised later in life. LS in men is closely linked to urine being occluded within the foreskin. An exception to this would be men who are overweight or have a buried penis such that a pseudo \u201cforeskin\u201d is created. You are doing all the right things to determine if it is LS and a biopsy could be helpful but LS is not always very easy to identify definitively even with a biopsy. I wish you all the best. I am at and have been circumcised since birth.  This popped up after a unprotected sexual encounter but I have taken every STD test there is and passed them numerous times.  I have seen urologists/dermatologists/infectious disease and I am no closer to an answer than when I started.  I think that is the most demoralizing thing, the toll that has taken on my mental health.  Not feeling like I am ever going to get answers (and hearing how often the biopsy will show nothing) is just completely demoralizing. The solution will lie with a dermatologist I suspect. Try and find one specialising in male genital skin. I could suggest one in London in the Uk if useful for you. I am in the US sadly.  I go to a decent dermatologist but he is just completely non committal on diagnosing anything and only gave me medication for LS because I brought it up being a possibility (which of course he agreed with). I think you need to find a specialist with experience in LS just to remove it from your list of possibilities. In wish you well. Since LS is a skin condition I suggest to phone around and find one with LS patients. My dermatologist that I had for years, removed a pre cancer. I asked her about a problem with my foreskin caused by oral antibiotics. She informed me I had LS (short version) BTW where in USA are you ? I am in north Dallas area.\nYes that looks similar to a white patch I have on my glans. I am in Las Vegas. You should have a good choice of dermatologist's in Las Vegas. Let us know how you get on. I did a skin biopsy at my dermatologist.  He made sure to repeatedly tell me that this test could be for nothing and the tissue could show normal leaving me right back where I started.  Needless to say, with the pain and scarring I am going to go through, if that is the case I am going to be extremely fucking pissed off.  I will likely just throw in the towel on treating this issue after that because I am tired of paying doctors and having my time wasted for no answers.  I feel like I could talk to my cat and it might be near as helpful.", "Lichen Sclerosus is caused by urine exposure! TL;DR: Make sure to wipe yourself clean after peeing. There is scientific evidence that Lichen Sclerosus may be caused by urine exposure:  ( . In another study it was found out that many patients who had undergone the urostomy ( a surgical procedure that replaces your bladder with an external one) had a high chance of contracting the lichen sclerosus near the areas that the skin was exposed to urine coming from the external bladder. The possible theory is that the urine coming in contact with the skin causes an inflammatory reaction of the organism:  ( .  \n\n\nI have also read that male circumcision has a high chance of curing/lessening the symptoms of lichen sclerosis. There is also a study that shows that 70% of patients with phimosis suffer from Lichen Sclerosus :  ( ( so my theory is that the phimosis is probably caused by the lichen sclerosus , due to the urine exposure, which in turn makes the skin more susceptible to damage, then it is scarring and in terms making the skin less elastic and shortening it. It may also be the other way, that the phimosis \\causes the urine to come in contact with the skin and causing the lichen sclerosus).   \n\n\nAlso it is found out that male patients have far less chance to develop the lichen sclerosus in the anus area opposed to female patients. Well it makes sense, because males have longer urethra (the penis) and when they pee, the urine does not come in contact with the anus area. Females on the other hand have shorter urethra and there is higher probability that the urine will come in contact with their anus areas.  \n\n\nIt turns out that I also suffer from lichen sclerosus and was losing hope in curing it. Since the time I have started to wipe the urine thoroughly after every visit to the toilet I do not even have to use steroids or topical treatments anymore, which at least for me is a proof that the urine causing lichen sclerosis might be the case.   \n\n\nSo seems like the solution would be thorough wiping and disenfecting the areas where the urine might have come in contact with.  \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Let me know if it worked for you! Please upvote so everyone can see. I think this has been the direction of travel of most research about penile lichen sclerosus for sometime. I would suggest that your theory should perhaps be the other way round ; Phimosis, in its various forms, is far more common that diagnosed penile LS, which suggests that phimosis is causal for LS. I think there is also a lot of research being done that suggests penile LS is under reported, particularly in infant phimosis so it may be the linkage is more than simply causal. This suggests the direction you wipe may play a role. \n\nCan anyone speak to the use of bidets? Great question. I have been using a bidet for years, and now that I am at home all the time I can use it basically everytime I use the restroom. I also use a sitz bath after bowel movements. None of this has improved my LS. I wonder what percentage of people cured their LS by using bidets or wiping. It would be a great study. Honestly the more that I read about LS on here and on other forums I more wonder if it really is all the same disease or if there are a few different conditions that are being lumped under the same name. \n\nI have seen a few other people who have had an experience like mine -- aggressive disease at a young age, no symptom remission from clob, adverse side effects to clob. Now I am ~2 wks into tacrolimus with no change. Honestly it kind of bums me out to read all this stuff where people say \"just keep urine off, just use a steroid, just try borax soaks, just reduce stress, etc.\" I have tried it all and nothing changes. \n\nI have not had a biopsy yet, my doc wanted to avoid it out of concern that it will not heal, but at some point I am going to have to do it. Maybe it is not LS at all. Either way, I fear that I have run out of options and all I can do is manage the pain and remain permanently celibate. I agree with this completely, being super careful not to leave any urine dramatically reduces my symptoms, its difficult though, sometimes I am shaking and wiping for like 5 minutes, I am certain there is nothing else, then I go in another room sit down then one bead of urine will be like 'heyyyy'. That sounds pretty exhausting, and I understand why you would feel burned out. I suffered for around 7 years before treatments randomly started working, the same treatments that did nothing later worked, which I cannot explain at all, its so difficult to pinpoint what causes it and what helps it, what works for some doesnt work for others, its a tough one to manage for sure. Honestly it is pretty reassuring to hear that treatments started to work for you at some point, even if you do not know why. Maybe things will get better someday. I dunno.  My LS started in the little dimple at the top of my butt and spread to my butt and perineum before I had any vulval presentation.  I have noticed that urine on affected skin can exacerbate symptoms, but I do not think LS is *caused by* urine exposure. I have been using a bidet for several years and my LS is definitely not cured. I found the full text in case anyone wants it. \n\nPersonally, I doubt urine is necessary cause or sufficient cause for LS, but it makes sense to me that it could be a contributing cause. \n\nAnd it totally makes sense that it worsens symptoms, but that is not the same as causing it in the first place. For these patients with urostomies, I think it was probably surgical trauma + urine + genetic predisposition, not just urine alone. Only a few of the patients in the study got LS (most did not), and one of them had an ileostomy (not a urostomy). Also consider that LS can turn up in the mouth, under the breasts, and other places not likely to encounter urine. I am not saying urine is not a factor- I think this is strong evidence that it is- but I guess I would rather the title said \"urine may be a contributing cause\" rather than just \"LS is caused by\" which sounds very definitive. Haha ya, that last drop that is always waiting for just after you to finish wiping.  Aways having that last drop waiting didnt seem to be nearly as much of a probem for me before I developed LS.  I agree about urine making symtoms work, but I doubt it is the cause of the symptoms. Additionally, LS can occur in places other than the genital region like on arms or breasts.  I am pretty certain that we are not peeing on our boobs. Get a biopsy NOW, you will heal, if your Dr will not do it, time to find a new Dr. Here are some good resources \n\n\n\n I am a guy who just recently got diagnosed. It spread from my perineum, both ways. I am circumsised, I do not wet myself, etc. \n\nI just came to this sub today. I am so glad there is a community for this, but it seems like everyone here is too eager to find answers and solutions where there are none. \n\nIt is an autoimmune disease. Your body is attacking itself. There are no solid causes or solutions. I am kind of worried by some of the posts I see regarding homeopathic remedies and whatnot. You are probably right. I actually need to get another doctor anyway (I found out he was withholding tacrolimus as an option, so when I had to go off steroids I was left without treatment for 2.5 months). I am just scared because he is the first person who diagnosed me/listened to me and did not blame it on a psychiatric problem.", "Biopsy results Did your biopsy results just say straight up it is lichen? Mine say it is hyperkeratosis and I do not know if it can still be lichen or not? I do not know when will I be able to consult it with my doctor because of a corona outbreak here :( If you google it, it seems they are very much so related. It is thickening of the skin caused by inflammation. No, mine was I think marginalized? It is very early stage but clob did the trick! Mine was half eczema/ lichen My results did not show anything at all, but my doctors still insist it is LS and that we just tested the wrong spot / too soon. One biopsy was sclerosus other was planus exacerbated by the sclerosus", "Clobetasol ointment is messy and leaves stains I noticed that my ointment leaves darkened splotches on my panties so I have been wearing pads to avoid a mess and stains in the crotch of my underwear, but it feels like such a waste of pads. I have also read that wearing pads with lichen sclerosus in general can cause problems. But I do not want dark spots on all my underwear so I am not sure of another solution other than just buying all black underwear. But even then, the steroid ointment will still get in my underwear and potentially be a little messy, and I do not want to get steroid all over any spot where I sit down if it soaks through even a tiny bit. Am I being too paranoid? Am I using too much ointment? This is all still very new to me and I am just trying to get a good rhythm going with the ointments and whatnot I have never heard of it staining, maybe try and use a little less and see if that works! You should be applying a thin layer. A little goes a very long way. I use like half of a pea size, maybe not even that much. And I never had an issue with it staining any of my underwear or leaving any kind of dark spots. It is clear ointment, I would call your dermatologist and see what is happening or the pharmacist and ask if that is a common thing. Maybe you got a bad tube or something You are using too much. Thin layer that is absorbed rapidly is all that is needed for my different steroid. That is how much I am using, the half pea size, and I use way less than that on the spot on my hip since it is a much smaller area. I know I am not the only person this has happened to. It is like a grease mark, like if I were to use Vaseline. Came out in the wash so it was not a stain really, just a dark spot on grey cotton underwear. I am already not using very much at all but I guess I will try using even less. I just do not want to end up not using enough and having the condition stay bad or get worse because like I said I am already hardly using any. Wow, I did not know that was a thing. Well, that sucks then that it is leaving a black grease look on your clothes and yourself. That is unfortunate,  I am sorry. It is not really staining. The spots come out in the wash. It is similar to a grease mark from using Vaseline under grey cloth. It is not a black grease look, the grey cotton underwear just has a slightly darker splotch. It does not look like car oil or anything, it just looks kind of like it got slightly dampened with water and it comes out when the underwear gets washed. And I never said it was leaving any marks on my skin either.... That is the thing though, I am honestly barely using any and it seems to take all day (for the morning application) or all night (for the nighttime application) to fully absorb. It is possible that it behaves differently than another steroid ointment, I am hoping to hear from someone who actually uses or has used the clobetasol. But yes trying even less is my plan. I am just worried because I am already hardly using any. I do not want it to end up not being enough to calm the affected skin and therefore allowing the condition to progress. Thought I read that this morning, I was pretty groggy when I read your post but my bad... Haha no worries! I have not had any issues with staining and I am a clobetasol user. For all the steroid creams and ointments used I would say it absorbs at the same speed. I think that you can get clobetasol as a cream - you could see if that makes a difference. Also, I presume your high frequency of application is due to a recent diagnosis? Might be less of an issue when application is once a day or week. Yes I just got diagnosed a few weeks ago so hopefully it gets better when I can use it less often.\n\nBut here is the thing. The schedule my dermatologist is having me do is clobetasol 2 times a day for three weeks and then take a break from that for a week and use an anti-inflammatory ointment twice a day during that week. Then I repeat that whole thing a second time, and then after that I am supposed to use the clobetasol 2 times a day only on the weekends and use the anti-inflammatory ointment twice a day on the weekdays. So I am not sure if it will get much better because I will still be using some kind of ointment twice a day every day. I would be concerned myself about using a ointment that frequently for that long! Perhaps talk with your doctor after the first cycle of ointment? I have been recently diagnosed and recommended 2 times per week. The Dr recommended using it at nice as it is very oily (I have the ointment, not the cream) so I try to not wear underwear to avoid them getting ruined with it and to let things breathe. What times of the day do you apply? Just once in the morning/afternoon (depending on when I get up) and once at night.\n\nThe schedule my dermatologist is having me do is clobetasol 2 times a day for three weeks and then take a break from that for a week and use an anti-inflammatory ointment twice a day during that week. Then I repeat that whole thing a second time, and then after that I am supposed to use the clobetasol 2 times a day only on the weekends and use the anti-inflammatory ointment twice a day on the weekdays. Not really a good fix - but at least recognition this totally happens to me. It leaves a greasy stain. I try to make sure I apply it before I sleep and then do not sleep in underwear or bottoms and just let it \"air out\". Otherwise, if I need it during the day, I have saved already destroyed-by-clobetasol underwear and wear that on those days OR wear a thin panty liner, which I hate. I am so glad I am not the only one this happens to. I really do not use very much at all, especially after all the other replies basically said that I was. I cut down to using hardly any, but it is still kind of messy and leaves those stains.", "F28, newly diagnosed postpartum, urinary discomfort I am recently diagnosed with LS postpartum after being misdiagnosed with a yeast infection for way too long. \n\n1.) My biggest symptom/complaint is urinary burning/irritation. It is absolutely awful and I am extremely triggered by it after years of having painful kidney stone issues. \n\nI just want to make it stop. :( I ordered a warm water bidet after reading some other posts on this subreddit. What else can be done? Why does urination hurt so badly, and why is bathroom hygiene so essential? I am still learning about this. \n\n2.) I was on clobetasol for about 6 weeks and seeing some improvement but still having some bad flares. My dermatologist wants to switch me to Tacrolimus 0.1% to see if I respond better to that. I am afraid to switch because many on this subreddit say it burned badly for them and I just do not think I can handle more pain down there. \n\nThank you in advance for your help! I think experiences vary with tacrolimus sensitivity. I use it on my anal area for psoriasis. It does not feel nice the first one or two times I apply it for a flare, but it only stings for one or two minutes and it is not super painful, just annoying/uncomfortable. Once the flare calms down then it does not sting at all. Maybe you could fill the prescription and try putting a tiny bit on one spot and see how it feels. If it is awful, you can wash it off and continue with clobetasol. \n\nI do not have experience with the urinary problems, but one thing I have heard you can do is pee into a bath, or use a squirt bottle to dilute the urine as it comes out. I heard they also give those to people postpartum since urine can sting then, too? If you like the bidet, it could be a good travel solution in case you have to pee away from home. It stings but it is bearable &amp; works quickly. I use a cool compress after &amp; it helps get through that few minutes of discomfort. (Disclaimer: I have several diagnoses and I am not 100% sure whether this treatment was prescribed for LS.) My doc gave me an ointment that has testosterone and estradiol in it. I use it on on my vestibule, and although it has not entirely eliminated my urinary discomfort, it has reduced it quite a bit. Maybe you could ask your doc if that is an option for you? Good luck! Thank you so much! I will look into it", "Clobetasol making it worse? Hi all. After a few months of terrible itching (but not much else, skin looked fine) I was diagnosed at the beginning of this month. I was prescribed a topical cream (Clobetasol) and I have used it daily for the last 3 weeks. \n\nMy symptoms have gotten noticeably worse over the last few days. Skin is now turning white and looks deformed, and the area is growing. Has anyone else had this experience? Contacting my doctor tomorrow. \n\nThis whole thing has been such a nightmare. Any help is appreciated. Hi Them\u2014this happened to me, though it was making it red and angry! Clobetasol worked for the first month and then suddenly started making my skin go haywire. My GP suggested it was simply too much for my skin to take after weeks of daily use and switched me to mometasone, might be worth checking to see if this might suit you better at this stage? Hey! The first week I was using clobetasol I was so red and tearing a lot! After a couple weeks, I went back to my doctor who prescribed triamcinolone which is not as strong as clobetasol. After a week on it, the pain started to subside and the redness greatly reduced. \n\nThere is so many different ointments out there! You just have to try them and see what works.\n\nGood luck! This gives me hope! Thank you. Thank you so much! I have such little info about this disease that it helps a lot to hear firsthand experience. I will ask her if a different cream is the right move to course correct. Good! I think I even posted about it here. It was so bizarre that it was fine for so long and then seemed to not suit my skin overnight, but the GP seemed to think this could happen with cumulative use if the skin was too sensitive. If you have cream, make sure to switch to an ointment! It is far less irritating", "I just want to cry I am at three weeks on steroids and I was a moron who tried to have sex. I knew it was not going to go well but it is been so long and I wanted to surprise my husband who is been so patient with me.\n\nAnd it is still like fucking a cactus even with plenty of coconut oil and lubrication. Albeit, it is better than it was over the last few months that we tried to have sex (over a year ago)... but tolerating pain is not really what I want out of my life.\n\nI guess I am going to try topical estrogen, but I am just not feeling positive. I am supposed to start tapering the steroid in a week and I certainly do not want to apply it everyday because of the risk of getting too much systemic absorption... but this is the second prescription topical I have tried and there just is not much proof that topical hormones are effective. I am pretty concerned that through the taper it will rebound and go back to ulcerating.\n\nThe area around my anus is still just as bad as when I started steroids and it is still bleeding and fissuring! I am not even sure if the improvement over the last week in the vulvar area is the steroids or that the disease was just hitting a slight lull.\n\nJfc.\nHow are you all coping with this? I just want to cry and scream and break something.\nI do not think I will ever get my sex life back. I do not know how to tell my husband that I toughed it out through that.

Hi--\n\nI am wondering if anyone has ever found any good resources for intimate partners of those with LS. When my wife was diagnosed back in 2014 I went looking for support resources to help me adapt to how our sex life was going to change, and I found nothing.

I am 31 female and I am quite anxious about having lichen sclerosis,  I was diagnosed quite late in the game, I use a strong steroid and have no symptoms of itching anymore. But if I could reverse the fusing somewhat that would relieve some stress I have!  I had laser surgery in April for fusions.  Did your doctor recommend it? Can you please elaborate on what the problem was and what type of laser treatment and if the fusions are completely corrected? Sure!  I had fusions along the bottom/back part of the vestibule (closes to the perineum), and my clitoral hood had fully fused shut, hiding the clitoris.\n\nThe surgery was performed with a CO2 laser, 4 incisions were placed surrounding the vestibule.  If you are looking at the vulva face-on, they are placed at 2 of the clock, 4 of the clock, 7 of the clock, and 10 of the clock.  There was also an incision or two to separate the clitoral hood.\n\nAfter surgery, the incisions have to heal open, so I had to use a dilator every night for 2-3 weeks. \n\nIt was pretty painful at times, but not awful, and i only ended up taking about 1/2 my prescribed pain meds. \n\nOverall, I am very very glad I did it!  Although I still have some symptoms (burning, thin skin) the fusions have been completely resolved. It is great to hear a story like yours. Thank you for sharing! You are welcome!!  I am glad I could lend some insight :) Thanks so much for sharing this ! I wanted to ask if there is a name for the CO2 laser ? I want to ask my gyno about this. Where abouts do you live ? I live in Australia and so far I have been dismissed saying fusing is irreversible :( You are welcome! I am not sure of the exact laser used, but it is just called a CO2 laser.  I live in the US, and I see a specialist that treats only vulvovaginal issues.  You may have better luck trying a dermatologist! It was never an issue for me, even with the fusions.  I honestly did not even realize the hood had fused over. \n\nBut, before the fusions, I found direct stimulation to be too much and almost painful, and preferred over-the-hood only anyways, so I am guessing my experience may not be the same as everyone else\u2019s. How is Intercourse with you? Are you able to have it? Now that I am getting treatment (clobetasol, estrogen cream), I am having no issues! Hey! May I ask who you see/who did your laser surgery?

I address what LS is, and then focus on the super important questions I often get asked, \"is LS serious? is it dangerous? how much attention should I give it?\n\nCheck it out here: (", "Hi, on the outside of my vagina above the clitoris and the lips usually itch and I went to my gyno last month and she gave me stuff for yeast infection however I still itch and I am unable to go back due to lack of funds. Little white areas down there and they itch from time to time. Idk what to do  Can anyone help?? Hiya, sorry to hear you are having this trouble! Have you got a diagnosis of LS or are you maybe thinking this could be what is causing the irritation? It is common for LS to be misdiagnosed as a stubborn yeast infection so if at all possible I would try save up and get yourself seen again. \n\nFor the time being, I recommend that you avoid all soaps - body gels, shower gels, perfumed creams, chemicals - the lot. Use only water for cleaning. Once you have cleaned the area with water, let it air dry and absolutely do not rub it dry, you could make it worse. Wear breathable underwear or none if possible and wear loose fitting clothes so as much air as possible circulates the area. Use an emollient or non perfumed moisturiser like E45 or an eczema moisturiser from a pharmacy to keep the skin soft and prevent further irritation from dryness. \n\nReally try and avoid itching or rubbing the area if you can because any disturbance to the area will really cause it to become irritated. \n\nI think you need to do everything you can to try get back to see your gyno and ask for a reevaluation of your symptoms and treatment as the earlier you get the correct treatment the better. \n\nIf you got a cream treatment for a yeast infection, it might help to apply it when you get excessive itching as most creams like that are designed to help ease the symptom of itching. \n\nTo cut a long story short, keep it clean and soap free, air dry - no towels, moisturise with non perfumed moisturiser and let the area breathe as much as possible. \n\nDefinitely get back to the gyno as soon as you can afford to as you will want to get started on correct treatment as early as possible if it is LS. \n\nHope this helped! Comfortable has great advice! \n\nLichen Sclerosus is not super common. Yeast infections ARE super common. So, it is reasonable to assume it is yeast until proven otherwise. Have you tried a different yeast treatment? Maybe a seven-day course? \n\nEverything Comfortable said is good. No rubbing or scratching.  Avoid all scented things, especially soap or laundry detergent. Personally I do not even use other ointments or creams - I air-dry and let it be - but some people do find they help. If the itching is severe, I will even take either a hot wet washcloth OR an ice pack (wrapped!!) and put it between my legs for some  relief. \n\nMaybe you can sleep with no undies, too.  Seems to help. \n\nProblem with treating it like LS without a diagnosis is that steroids come with side effects too. If I KNEW it was LS, I would get a steroid cream. But without being certain? Playing with fire there. If you do not have a big figure-eight with tearing-apart tissue-paper skin, and you do not have a diagnosis \u2026 do not assume it is LS. \n\nHave you also been tested for sexually transmitted infections? That is an important step of you do not know what is going on yet, if you are or have been sexually active.  If you are in the US you should be able to contact Planned Parenthood for help with that. \n\nIf you have tried several times with yeast treatment and the itch does not go away, Comfortable is right again: got to go back to doc, even for a phone consult. They are wrong, it IS NOT yeast, and they have misdiagnosed you and they are leaving you to suffer. They need to provide a next step or further advice. \n\nGood luck. Hope you get some relief soon!! Hi thank you for responding! I have never been diagnosed with LS only a yeast infection but I did research on my symptoms and what is irritating me and I saw LS so I had a few questions about it. The only cream treatment I got for the yeast infection was the Canesten V (3 Days) one and I used it from time to time and it helped but I was not sure if i still should have. Thank you again for your advice and I will definitely try to save and visit my gyno again! Hi, thank you for responding. The only treatments I have used is what my gyno had prescribed. Im not sexually actively at all and I will definitely call tomorrow and ask to speak with her because I am in discomfort. Thank you again for responding and for the advice! I would also try a seven-day over-the-counter yeast treatment if that is available in your location. \n\nDefinitely do not jump to Lichen Sclerosus as a possible diagnosis. As much as I am angry it took forever to get a diagnosis because they kept telling me \u201cgo away, it is yeast\u201d \u2026. Usually, it really is yeast!!! Thanks a bunch! As I said to the other person I had questions about LS because the symptoms matched mine. I will definitely find out the true cause tho Concerning going back in: Do you have Planned Parenthood where you are? They do not just do birth control, they actually do pelvic exams and the likes. I have always gone there for my regular pelvic exams and they are who finally decided to do a biopsy and diagnosed me with Lichen.\n\nHoping that is an option for you. If yeast treatments do not work, it is worth it to be seen again.\n\nPlanned Parenthood does sliding scale and your bill could be $0 depending on your income. I have never paid anything out of pocket.\n\n(Also, fully agree DO NOT treat for Lichen unless you know it is. Steroids can thin the skin and cause problems all on their own. There is other dermatological conditions that can effect the area as well that have different (non-steroid) treatments and it is worth it to have a better idea of what you are dealing with before going forward with anything other than moisturizers. --- But if you see a different doc, let them know you have not had much luck with anti-fungals. They will probably want to retest for yeast to make sure it is not a less common strain that do not always respond to things like Monastat). Hi, thank you for responding and the advice given! I have never heard of that over here but the only \u201cpelvic exam\u201d I received was when it was looked at from the outside and not internally. (I payed the same price when i expected it to be cut down lol) Anyways, the good news now is I called my gyno and was told that I can come in to get reevaluated free of charge and only pay for the prescriptions!

I am so angry for you that no one is taking you seriously. I think I caught it relatively early which is why doctors do not kkow what it is or want to treat me tbh looool fuck but my mind will not stop Honestly i do not blame you. It is scary. I wish i had more answers for you. Might live in denial until docs care. But maintain with creams until we know I have LS with no whitish patches. So, if it is irritated, you need to use a barrier cream like all the other times not using medications. Also, they should do a swab to test and rule out yeast and BV. That is straightforward with paps but sometimes you have to ask. Now, you need to go to someone who knows about LS. Do you have pain, ripping , cannot use tp near sometimes, paper cut feeling, pain during sex because of it? Poster above is correct in skin fusing etc and can be from internal changes etc.  Often do not need a biopsy, confirm help with treatment but if treatment is not working they need to rule out other issues.

Since our little community can have particularly sensitive skin, I wanted to provide a quick list of names that the chemical formaldehyde may hide under (which was taken from a thread on the front page):\n\nFormalin\n\nFormic aldehyde\n\nMethanediol\n\nMethanal\n\nMethyl aldehyde\n\nMethylene glycol\n\nMethylene oxide\n\nSome chemicals that are used as preservatives can release formaldehyde, such as:\n\nBenzylhemiformal\n\n2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol\n\n5-bromo-5-nitro-1,3-dioxane\n\nDiazolidinyl urea\n\n1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (or DMDM hydantoin)\n\nImidazolidinyl urea\n\nSodium hydroxymethylglycinate\n\nQuaternium-15\n\nAdditionally, here are two websites that might be helpful and interesting, as well as the original politics post that inspired this post (I do not want to get political, I just want to cite my sources). \n\n( \\-  the Environmental Working Group's \"Skin Deep\" Cosmetics Database\n\n( \\-  NIH Household Products Database: Formaldehyde\n\n( \\- a politics article that has an interesting conversation about what can be in everyday products A woman in another website said her LS was all toilet paper related and it was from the chemicals  Does anyone have recommendations on toilet paper brands? I am in the USA. I think Toilet paper might be causing my LS.  I read a woman swear that toilet paper gave her LS. I believe she said she would just use water. I have found hand held bidet is on Amazon. I have been buying generic deuce bottles and fill them with water to rinse  I can only use a certain type of TP, so you are not alone! What is it called? It might help all of us  It is called Scott brand one ply. It does not leave any residue, it is pretty cheap,its septic tank safe, but it is bleached and does have glue on it. I think everyone is triggers are different, so some people may really react to this type while others may not.\n\nSome other triggers of mine are alcohol and sugar, so if you have not looked into those yet, maybe give them a try too :)", "Are you allowed to share pictures to get another persons opinion? I know no one can diagnose but I am keen to know if anyone has had anything similar to me as I have not been diagnosed with LS etc just yet. ", "Anyone know a specialist in the northeastern/Midwest USA? Title. Will not disclose exact location, but I live very close to the Great Lakes and am willing to drive. I have seen a urologist and a Derm in the past year and neither think I have LS, yet my symptoms are getting worse and I know if I do not see a specialist, I will not get a diagnosis any time soon. Cannot find much online. Any help? I am in the SE US so do not have local recommendation, but this website started a provider database to help with this sort of thing:  Thanks for the info! Unfortunately it is still very difficult since I am a male and every doctor I found in that database that is in a major city near me is some sort of gyno/female specialist. Appreciate it regardless Dang - sorry about that! Hope you are able to find someone through other means. ", "Constant itching I have had extreme itching for about 2 years now but has gotten more constant over the last year. It is literally bothering me 85% of my day. If I do not scratch my legs twitch. Have tried probiotics and many creams. There is not anything visually wrong with my vagina or the area that itches. My clitoris and the around around it all the way the lips itch\u2019s almost constantly. It gets worse during my period doctors say no lichen sclerosus but i cannot do this anymore they keep testing for std yeast etc and I do not have anything. I have been dealing with this for 2 years and still nothing works. If someone has a suggestion please let me know. Look into what you eat. I found when I went gluten and dairy free things got much better It is going to sound weird, but hear me out on this. Have you tried applying natural Greek yogurt to the itchy affected areas? The cold from it being in the fridge will smooth the area and I am sure there is probiotics in that too which help. Mainly just the soothing effect yogurt has helps. Just make sure to keep the area clean too cos it is food after all\n\nAlso if you use period products like pads, consider switching to an organic cotton vegan brand with no plastics etc. The mesh on most period products is like a cheese grater for the skin and the perfumes do horrible things to ur skin When I am consistently dairy free my itching goes down. If I accidentally eat dairy I feel like my itch flares  up. Might as well try dietary changes and see what helps. have you seen an allergist? Not yet I have been trying to get a referral but I just switched to a new doctor If it itches like crazy, but the skin looks normal, that makes me wonder if it could be some kind of nerve problem. Is it like a burning, crawling sensation?  PGAD classically has symptoms similar to arousal, but I remember someone describing it as itching/burning, like an insect was biting them all day. PGAD may be caused by a cyst sitting on a nerve (Tarlov cyst.) \n\nDo you take any medications? Some medications have weird nerve side effects, like SSRIs, especially on the genitals. \n\nI think it is also possible to have LS symptoms even before any lesions show up. In all the creams you tried, were any of them ultra-potent steroids? What exactly do you eat in a gluten free diet? Unfortunately, I love my dairy. Sigh. I am trying. I have tried nystatin and clobetasol propionate. The clobetasol helps a little though. It just does not last long. I have brought up pgad because and it was dismissed. I thought it was that for a long time. I have been having nerve issues elsewhere so I have asked multiple doctors but everyone just keeps saying it cannot be it Well my husband and youngest daughter have xeliacs so I have been cooking gf for 12 yrs. We eat everything just substitute gf for regular things", "I am confused I am here in the states. My doctor is saying I have some type of dermatitis\u2026..  However, I am not keen on his assessment. Just a question or two. Does Lichensclerosus trigger pain? I am not having that issue. My private skin is turning red and the skin is peeling. I am clear for any std you can be tested for on paper. I did have a wart a year ago. However, this is not that. I just keep getting told it is a type of dermatitis. But the shits been here for months", "Insomnia due to clobetasol? Week three of 2x a day clobetasol and I am going through a severe bout of insomnia, which is unusual for me. I did also stop drinking and smoking weed before starting this new treatment regime, so I wonder if that is just finally catching up to me. Anyone else experience anything similar when using clob?", "What is a good treatment \u201cstarter kit\u201d in terms of soaps/toilet paper/underwear etc I (24F) was recently diagnosed and im a little overwhelmed about creating a personal treatment plan (other than the steroid cream I have)\n\nMy case does not seem super advanced, I have just had minor itching for a couple months. \n\nWhat lifestyle changes/products were game changers for you? I am a recent graduate so looking for affordable options! Personally, I never use the typical soaps you find on the shelves. I use a prescribed soap alternative (pretty sure you can just buy it too) called Dermol 500 which I have been recommended to use by my doctors but just make sure I wash it off completely in the shower. \n\nI have been told to avoid toilet paper as much as possible where I can because of the harmful chemicals that are used when making it, they can seep out and irritate the skin. So I would use non-perfumed toilet paper if you have to use toilet paper at all, or just wash the area with water after the toilet if you can or i was also told I could try using cotton (like the balls but in sheet form) with olive oil to wipe after because it is a good moisturiser and will not pull on the skin as much as toilet paper.\n\n For underwear I recommend keeping entirely clear of thongs or anything that will manage to wiggle its way right up in there and be sure to get either 100% cotton underwear or silk as these are less likely to irritate the skin and are far more breathable materials! Cotton is the more affordable one in this case and make sure the gusset is 100% cotton too. \n\nAnother thing you might not have thought about already is washing liquid/powder - I was told to ONLY use non-bio and so far I have found a drastic improvement among that and the rest of my treatment! \n\nI hope this was helpful and not too overwhelming haha, let me know if there is anything else you want to know! I use Aquaphor or Eucerin baby wash, All Free &amp; Clear detergent, and no underwear. If I am not using clobetasol, I use this skin soother on the area:  I did not make any lifestyle changes. The steroid ointment is the only change. It works great. Thanks! I was reading a lot of the posts on here and it made it seem like this disease always results in extreme issues so it is good to hear your perspective Looks like I am headed to our local co op for organic toilet paper haha! Thanks for this list it is very helpful. I was curious on how much this disease has affected your life? I see some posts on here that are more on the extreme end (severe pain w sex/urination etc) and was wondering if that was the case for everyone I did not even think of changing my detergent!!! These are helpful tips thank you Perfumed detergents always make me flare! I have been using all free and clear for 20 years, I think it is the best for sensitive skin issues. There is definitely a selection bias where people with the most severe symptoms, and/or treatment resistant cases, post the most. According to studies, steroids do work well in the majority of cases. However, it is still a good idea to do the things that generally support genital skin health, like wearing cotton underwear or no underwear, avoiding tight pants and leggings, avoiding harsh or scented soaps, and moisturizing after bathing. I was only recently diagnosed actually but I suspected LS for about 3-4 years. I only sought medical help 5-6 years ago for my problem when I had sex for the first time and felt an excruciating pain like I was being ripped in half and my skin was pulling horribly. \n\nI was tried on countless treatments like anti fungal creams, low grade steroid creams, psoriasis treatments, oils, creams, ointments you name it! The only thing that made an ounce of a difference was trimovate, which eventually was what made the Drs realise that this was something more challenging and serious. \n\nSex has always been uncomfortable for me, the majority of the time I experience either pain or burning friction but idk if it is lessened or I have just become more tolerant of the pain. I do not think this is entirely down to the LS though, I am almost certain it is come along with lack of lubrication, the anticipation of pain and less than gentle partners. Also it is important to note I am not currently sexually active so since starting my Clobetasol treatment I have no comparison, I just know masturbation is far more comfortable and easy particularly with coconut oil!! \n\nAs for peeing, I experienced burning in my initial flare ups of LS before steroid treatment but I do not actually get much trouble with peeing at all!  I do however find that I cannot wear jeans anymore because it rubs too much and feels a bit suffocating haha. \n\nI think I am very lucky that my skin is responding incredibly well to the clobetasol treatment and I am now in the second month of my three month treatment plan and that is even after I had a thrush outbreak which was less than comfortable Wow I am not new to LS at all but This is the first I am hearing of this information. When you go number 2 how do you manage that? And after rinsing with water how to you pat dry( I only ask because I have to go to work and wonder how u do these things in a public bathroom) Cottonique (brand) or other 100% cotton underwear. Kind Of expensive but they fit great with the right measurements. No tight pants. Do not wear wet bathing suits for a long period of time. I personally use Dove unscented soap and it works fine. Try not to have sex or do anything to tear it more during flare ups. During flare ups I wipe with a wet washcloth instead of toilet paper.\n\nEdit: like someone else said, it is important to use unscented gentle detergent for the washing machine with your undies and pants in it! Like \u2018All brand free and clear\u2019 In public I tend to just use the toilet paper provided haha, it glides easier when I have put moisturiser on my bum because I do not rub the moisturiser all the way in so when I wipe (gently) it glides more smoothly across my skin. And then as soon I am able to, the area gets a proper clean haha. As for drying, I do not wipe, I dab it dry and after a shower I do not touch the area with a towel at all, I was advised to air dry so (it is sounds weird) but I just air my bum and vulva in front of my tower fan hahah, dries super quick and then I am safe to put on my steroid ointment or moisturiser! As for the avoiding toilet paper when in public, I have not found a fix for that yet and just have to be super careful! I just picked up my steroids today and am excited to get some relief. \n\nIt is so weird that more women (atleast in the US) are not taught about caring for your genitals. I only just learned about how bad all the chemicals in pads/tampons are. Also shaving!!! Why is not this a part of sex Ed? Thank you for the advice!!! I appreciate it!!! For the no tight pants thing, do you think wearing leggings for ~2 hours for exercise will cause flare ups? This was super informative. I appreciate it! I have not been sexually active since the pandemic began so I have no idea what the sex situation will be for me. But I am beginning the steroid cream today! No I do not think wearing leggings for half a day or a workout would make it bad especially if they are not TOO tight. I do not wear leggings every. single. day. like I did in middle school anymore but I can get away with wearing them for sure! You just do not want to go for a long period of time with too much friction but leggings are mostly bad because of synthetic materials they kind of trap the moisture of the sweat in. Moisture + friction is where things start going downhill. Cotton blend leggings are so comfy and still very stretchy so those are okay all day with cotton undies. I like to wear those under dresses. So it really depends on the material. I am mostly talking about super skin tight leggings for all day, tooo tight jeans, and thongs like other people mentioned. Sadly thongs and black lacy panties are kind of a thing of the past for me \ud83e\udd72 but comfort is priority.\n\nAlso I am about the same age as you, cis woman just so you know! I saw my Derm today and ~2 years after my diagnosis she is taking me off maintenance clobetasol to switch to triamcinolone but told me to hold the clobetasol in case of flare ups. Long term steroid use can make the skin thinner so that is probably why. I am happy for you to get a diagnosis and support for this issue! \ud83d\ude42\n\nEdit: also I was using Emu oil, sadly it is not vegan but the derm approved of that instead of coconut oil. Someone else suggested olive oil but I have never tried that. Coconut oil works fine if the area is dry!\n\nDouble triple edit: Dr bronner\u2019s unscented Castile soap is also great if you would rather use that instead of Dove unscented. Dr bronner\u2019s has soooo many great products. For periods if you have them, try a menstrual cup. They are easy to get used to in my opinion. Plenty of sizes and options out there if the \u2018diva\u2019 does not work for you. There is also 2 sizes of the diva cup for people who have or have not had kids; make sure to get the right size for your body. Unscented panty liners which have cotton on the outside should be okay too. My must haves: bidet attachment, cotton underwear, Dove sensitive soap, reusable pads, loose cotton boxers for sleeping. F(26) Ever since I was diagnosed, I think the biggest gamechangers for me are \n1. staying clean. -I do not use any special soaps but showering on a daily basis is essential. \n2. Ditch the thong. -I have stopped wearing thongs regularly which I loved but they really are not the cleanest form of underwear. So I typically wear briefs or boy shorts. Cotton is the best, because it is breathable. I find that I get more irritation in my spandex underwear. \n3. Diet, - when I cut out processed foods I experience less flare ups. Idk if there are studies being done on this but there should be! \n4. Alcohol. - I try to limit my alcohol intake, when I drink heavily I experience bad flare ups and tend to use my clobetosol a lot more the day after drinking. Excellent I am so pleased for you! I am sure when you do next have sex you will be fine if you just listen to your body, use plenty of lubricant and communication with your partner! There is a brand of bathroom wipes called water wipes. They are sold at target and on Amazon. My doctor recommended and I have been using them for 4 years now!", "Clobetasol WILL NOT thin your labia?? Have not been officially diagnosed with LS, but my OB thinks that is what is going on.  However, I saw a dermatologist the other day just to get another opinion.  The dermatologist told me that clobetasol will NOT thin the skin on your vulva (labia, perineum, etc) the way that it will thin your skin on other places on your body.  I am a bit skeptical about this info.  Has anyone else been told this?  I definitely worry about using this high potency steroid so much and having it thin my skin! My derm told me the same thing! She said it would thin your inner thigh for sure, but the vulva can take it. I have been doing it twice a day for just about 2 months (going in to see if I can step down Tuesday!) and (knock wood) no problems from the clob. My doc says the same. I am as skeptical as you are. I have been using it for 2 months, twice a day since mybiopsy. Nothing has thinned. It has stopped the thinning as far as I can tell. I love the stuff Here are a couple studies on long term steroid use. It is good to do research into the possibility. It is frequently cautioned against but as far as I have found they are is no conclusive evidence of vulvar skin thinning with long term use. \n\n&gt;The absence of an atrophic effect of the medication is surprising, but could be explained by the rapid decrease in application regimen with VLS improvement (to 3 times per week), and by the fact that most treated lesions were on the mucosa rather than the skin. A different susceptibility to long-term topical corticosteroid therapy between mucosa and skin could explain the differences in induced atrophy, but further studies are needed.\n\n\n\nThis is the only case study I have encountered where they attribute steroid use to vulvar atrophy. Note it is a case study and thus an example of one single person.\n\n\n\nHere is a long term study of 507 women and topical steroids.\n\n&gt;This prospective, single-center, longitudinal cohort study of adult patients with VLS suggests that individualized preventive TCS regimens that achieve objective normality of skin color and texture and are used by compliant patients who attend regular long-term follow-up visits may modify the course of the disease. There was a significant difference in symptom control, scarring, and occurrence of vulvar carcinoma between compliant and partially compliant patients. The adverse effects of TCSs were minimal.\n\n This is correct. As I understand it the LS thickens the skin so the steroids stop this. Prof Gayle Fisher from Australia has written some excellent articles re this disease and how to treat. Well worth  Googling My doctor warned me about thinning in my perineum (most of my LS is near my bum). I had to be very careful with how much I was using. It is my understanding that the constant itch/scratch cycle and repair of any tearing causes a \"thickness\" in the area and that the clobetasol heals/thins THAT bit but not that clobetasol causes thinning of the skin. I am not sure I have written this completely accurate based on a medical conversation but I have it correct in my mind! :D  I have also been told that the vulvar region is a lot stronger than most people believe. I mean, heck, we deliver babies from the area, right? We have a Facebook group you all can join, if interested. It is called LICHEN SCLEROSIS LICHEN PLANUS SKIN DISORDER SUPPORT and there are 2300 women waiting to support you.", "Diagnosed last week, any others with other auto-immune disorders? I was referred to a Vulva specialist and finally got in last week. While speaking with her I was going down my list of other diagnosis and was surprised to learn this this is also an auto-immune disorder. This bring my total diagnosed auto-immune diseases to 5 (hypothyroidism,  Rosacea  ,psoriasis &amp; sjogrens). I was curious if others with this diagnosis have other disorders that may be similar.\n\nDuring my appointment it was also noted that I have a estrogen deficiency which has caused my labia minora to recede. I have been on birth control for almost 10 years to address \"peri-menopause\" symptoms but my OB/GYN never mentioned that this was a possibility.  So many questions and fears going through my head. This is a very interesting post. I have OCD, which is more common in people with auto immune disorders, and I have have a level of autoimmune disorders which fluxuate in my blood. I am also being tested for endometriosis next week, which I believe has links to autoimmune disorders. I have fibromyalgia and mild chronic fatigue. I also tested positive for the antibodies for Lyme disease (borrellia). I have been diagnosed with 4 thus far: Hashimoto\u2019s, lichen, Celiac, and pernicious anemia. Hey I thought I would jump in here, I have psoriasis and lichen, so there is Definetly a relationship between the two! I have LS and  alopecia areata but I do not understand yet how they are connected. I am seeing a gynocological oncologist and a dermatologist. The derm only wants to keep injecting into the skin but it is still in new areas. My thyroid never shows up wonky I think alopecia is one of the more common autoimmune conditions to run with lichen sclerosis. Probably a similar inflammatory pathway I have hypothyroidism, rosacea, and I suspect another auto-immune disorder. My money this time is on hashimoto's disease. LS is an auto-immune disease and it often goes hand in hand with other auto-immune diseases. If I do not have hashimoto's, the only other thing I could think would be chronic fatigue disorder. I have no energy, I wake up and I have to sit/lay down within minutes. I struggle to get anything done throughout the day. I do get bursts of energy which I then utilize to get chores and errands done, but then afterwards I am pretty much spent for the rest of the day. my BIGGEST fear is phimosis. I have lean PCOS, androgenic alopecia and major depression, and pelvic floor dysfunction. I have thought I had a thyroid disorder but my lab results always come up within range. I try not to get too freaked out by auto immune labels. I do my best to combat all of my health conditions with healthy diet/ stress relief. I found that stress is my biggest trigger.", "Is this disease something I should be afraid of? ", "New to sub! (30F) So happy to have found this subreddit!! I have had LS for about 6 years and have recently been trying some more natural methods for comfort and to calm itching.(in addition to occasional steroid cream)  So far my favorite and most effective remedy is a baking soda bath and coconut oil after. What are some of your favorite natural remedies? Thanks for any input! Welcome! For me, using an emollient such as epaderm helps when I am not using steroids. I am also happy to find you guys!  VMagic claims to b natural and it works so good.  Got it online.  I hate LS.  It really feels hopeless some days. Thanks for the tip, going to try it! I use emu oil and that had been really helpful!

I have strongly suspected for years that I have LS due to symptoms plus my mom's LS diagnosis. \n\nThe thing that has by far been my biggest struggle is finding any sort of contraceptive I can live with. I am in a committed relationship, but we are definitely not ready for a kid. Condoms are tough; pretty much all types of lube burn on contact, and I struggle to keep my arousal up, causing them to dry out. The friction is murder. I tried an IUD once for a month but it caused such a severe flair that I was in pure agony until it was removed. I have tried multiple different pills and the Nuvaring; I find that all of these increase my pain and kill my sex drive. What is the point of being on birth control if I cannot even enjoy sex? At this point, we are forced to use the withdrawal method as it is just about the only tolerable option, though I do not like the odds of pregnancy. \n\nI would like to hear about your experiences and insights into this problem, I feel like I am stuck with few options.  I am not sure if the pill is known to have any effect on LS but I am on the mini pill and I do not see the difference. First I recommend you get a proper diagnosis via biopsy  I am in the same boat as you, and would love any other possible solutions tbh. Maybe a bit controversial, but how about natural planning? There is an app where you track your period for a few months to ger a clear pattern of your cycle.\n\nThen you can see when your ovulating as you can generally only get pregnant for 5 days around this time. So you can avoid sex or condoms or what ever for these 5 days. \n\nThe other 25/26 days of the month your free to get your freak on (lol). This only works reliably if you have a regular cycle. \n\nHave a friend that has been using it for a year with success (aka no pregnancy). \n\nOtherwise what iud did you use before? There are two types, one using hormones and one made of copper - maybe you could try the other type to see if this brings on a flair up. Maybe the previous one used was hormonal hence the flair up? I have been successfully using the copper iud since 2013. But i get its all deeply personal. \n\nGood luck!  What sort of adverse effects did you have from the IUD? I just had mine removed. I am hoping things gets better. ", "Skin on my penis is turning purplish and I have developed pathologic phimosis. Is this BXO? The skin on the head of my penis is changing color and texture.  The color change is purplish/whitish, and the texture change is making it almost glossy smooth.  I saw my doctor about this about a year ago and he told me it was just \"pigment change\".  Should I see another doctor about this?  It seems like it might be getting worse, but it is hard to tell.   My penis is usually painless, but it does hurt mildly sometimes.\n\nIn addition to this, my foreskin ring has become tighter.  I have always had tighter foreskin, but it was not nearly this bad as a teenager or in my early 20s.  When I pull back my foreskin, it looks like (  If I have a full erection, pulling it back all the way is painful.  It almost looks like there is scarring or some kind of lumps on my foreskin when I pull it all the way back.\n\nI am 30 years old and male, not sexually active.\n\nIt looks worse in real life when I am looking in a mirror.\n\n\n\nWhat do I do about this? Could you put a warning up on what people might see when they click on the image please? Got a bit of a surprise! Anyway, I do not know if you have LS, only a doctor can diagnose and you might need to have a biopsy like I did. Get a second opinion or see your doc again as it sounds like it is changed since then, any change in shape, sensitivity etc should always be checked. Hope you get the answers you need. Oh man, that looks familiar.  \n\nThe white and purple around the glans LOOKS like my LS - to me.  I do not have a penis, but I have visited a few of them.  None of them have had that white-with-purple stretched-way-too-thin look like you, and like I have.  \n\nIn any case, it is unusual, and it is changing color and texture.  Heck yeah, you take that to a doctor. A new doctor.  I had to visit many times before getting a diagnosis -- so many docs are not familiar with this condition.  They are trained on horses-not-zebras, and then they sometimes ignore the zebras when they appear.   You want to follow up on what is going on there.\n\n I have a new doctor now who may or may not know about it.  If I am lucky, he will refer me to a urologist or a dermatologist.  If these doctors have not heard about it, I am out of luck.  I do not have much in the way of doctors to choose from where I live.\n\nBut yes, I plan to have it looked at to the best of my ability. Definitely sounds like it. Definitely has to be checked to be sure. I saw my family doctor and he says he does not think there is any pathology. He has referred me to a urologist.", "Recently diagnosed (F22) and a little hopeless... Question: are there any success stories as far as an enjoyable sex life? From what I have read, everyone \"manages\" the pain but generally avoids sex or accepts it will always be somewhat painful. That is terrible?? I have been using the steroid cream for over a month and at least it does not always hurt now, but sex definitely is not on the table. I do not know. I love my BF but I feel terrible, I mean it is hardly a romantic relationship anymore when you have stopped having sex for a year. \n\nRant over, ha. I am grateful to have found a community and am fucking torn about what I have read I am sorry you are going through this. It is a complicated issue and such a tricky disease to navigate. Honestly, I have not seen a lot of pure success stories either. I think it has to do with how little information doctors have about LS since there are not a lot of treatment options or studies. Steroids tend to be the first and only course of treatment.\n\nI have read about laser therapy treatment being somewhat successful but I am sure it depends on the case. Medical lasers have been used for a while now to stimulate healing and elasticity in scar tissue and for vaginal rejuvenation. It is only been recently that some vulvar specialists and dermatologists have been trying it for LS. It is expensive, experimental, and can take multiple treatments. That said, I think it is worth looking into. \n\nDefinitely try to find support groups or someone to share your concerns with. The emotional toll is heartbreaking, especially with a relationship, so take care of your heart and mind, too. I was diagnosed at 24 and I have been very successful in managing LS. In the last year I have had two flares, each under a week long. Both occurred when I was outside of my normal routines. Other than that, I have no symptoms and am a happy newlywed! It is possible!! I was not diagnosed for a very long time. Only my third or fourth gyn could help. The steroid cream made everything go away and now I am good as long as I use a non prescription cream regularly. Do not feel hopeless, please, there is a good chance that there is help for you.", "Newly diagnosed - but is it a wrong diagnosis? Hello,\n\nI was referred to a dermatologist/venereal disease specialist by my gynecologist for white spots on the entry to my vagina / just inside the vagina. My gynecologist told me she thought they were HPV warts. I had to wait 2 months to see the dermatologist, and during that time my itching in the vulvar region/anus/inner labia increased significantly. \n\nThe dermatologist said it is not HPV, it is LS, and that she can also see scarring where I have been scratching, but that it is early stage and we can get it under control with a cortisone cream which I am now using daily. She claims it is not at all indicative of a sexual infection like HPV.\n\nHowever, everywhere I look on the internet it does not seem LS is something that affects the inside of the vagina/inside of the opening? Is this an area affected by any of you? Or is it possible I was misdiagnosed ? \n\nShe did not schedule a biopsy or take any sample, it was purely by clinical exam.\n\nIf it would be helpful, my medical history includes Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, and anti-nuclear antibodies with symptoms like lupus, but no definite diagnosis on that front. I also have IBS and a family history of psoriasis, UC, Crohn\u2019s, and PSC. My mother was recently diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease.\n\nThank you in advance for your help. Mine was diagnosed by biopsy, and I do have it just on the inside of the opening as well.\n\nDefinitely try to get a biopsy done! You are not the only person on here that has a family history of autoimmune issues. \nMy dermatologist diagnosed by exam only, confirmed by urologist. \nExperienced clinititions seem to diagnose this correctly if classic white patches exist. \nI would say if steroid creams help over time they got it right.\nThere seems to be more misdiagnosis of LS as yeast or  uti than other way around.\nGood luck. Mine impacts the very inside sometimes, but you could have lichens planus instead/as well. I would seek a second opinion so you can get proper treatment. Lots of people with LS have other autoimmune diseases as well! I have fibromyalgia and asthma. I know others with psoriasis, eczema and vitiligo. They go hand in hand frequently, when you have one, you are more apt to have others. You are right, it is generally accepted that LS does not affect the inside of the vagina. But I could see it maybe affecting the introitus, as a kind of borderline region. Or maybe you have LS and LP; some people do have both. (LP is also itchy and usually affects the inside of the vagina.) I agree it does not sound like HPV.  \n\nIf the steroid helps, you can probably be pretty confident that you have something in the vein of LS or LP. If the steroid does not help at all, maybe you would want to consider a biopsy or other tests. Thank you all for your help! I have been psyching myself out that it was something else entirely and worried that the cream would not help in this case. I am due for a follow up appointment in 3 months so I will ask my dermatologist about LP then. \n\nWhen she told me I have LS I heard the words \u00ab\u00a0Chronic inflammation\u00a0\u00bb and instinctively thought it was autoimmune but she insisted it is not although it has been linked to thyroid problems and recommended I get my thyroid checked. It is interesting to know then that autoimmune illness tends to accompany LS. Well, it is heavily believed to be an autoimmune disorder. It is not proven to be or proven not to be because they just do not know a lot about it, but most experts consider it to be one.\n\nThat being said, using the steroid cream cannot really hurt you, it just may not help much if it is something else. :) So I would not worry too much until you explore more. Hello everyone, thank you again for your responses. I will ask about a biopsy at my next appointent in April. \n\nI wanted to ask, I have developed 4 hard white bumps around the vaginal entry as well. Is this typical with LS? They are raised bumps, not patches like at the entry to my vagina. I have raynaud\u2019s too! And I have LS. I had it around the opening pre-treatment and now it seems under control. This is not the most helpful answer maybe, but I think bumps CAN happen due to LS\u2014lesions, scar tissue, irritation\u2014but also can happen as a result of a lot of other things, so it is likely that you will not have a sure fire answer without having at least an examination or maybe some tests :/ Hey op can u update on this? Hows the itchiness and the whiteness? Hope its better would be reassuring Hello, after about a month on the clobetasol my itching went away completely. However, white bumps started popping up on my outer and inner labia and even inside the vaginal canal. At my next dermatologist appointment she confirmed that some HPV warts started to pop up probably due to the fact that I already had the virus and clobetasol diminished the immune system in that area causing the warts to show up. So now I have paused the clobetasol (although my doctor said that the LS looked much better) and I am using an HPV treatment Aldara; once the warts are gone I can go back on the clobetasol if need be.", "What emollients do you use? Trying to buy a emollient to replace my soap with. What do you all use? I use Aquafor. I used Vaseline but it is so damaging to clothes. I also use Vaseline which also has additional Vitamine E in it", "What is the gentlest detergent out there? I am starting to notice that after washing my clothes with free and gentle by Tide I experience a lot of itchiness all over my body including down there. This last for a couple of hours after putting my clean clothes on. \n\nIs there anything more gentle/natural than that? Preferably in pod form bc I am lazy haha\n\n(My skin must be extremely sensitive. I was actually using neutrogena\u2019s ultra sensitive skin moisturizer on my face and it still caused a ton of burning. Only Korean moisturizer/Vaseline does not hurt. Weird!!! ) I use fairy non bio and that is supposed to be fairly non reactive on the skin but I was told to put any clothes that touch the genital area (underwear or pyjama bottoms) on a second rinse to take all of the detergent off of it, or alternatively give them a rinse under the tap after you have got them out the washing machine. It is a bit of a longer process but should save you itchiness in the future! Ooh yeah throw that away! I personally use ( In the powder form. \n\nSecond the other comment that says to double rinse. You could try a baby detergent. Not all free and clear detergents are made the same. Tide also makes me very itchy - as does Purex. All Free and Clear has been my go-to for 20 years. \n\nI have also tried the ECOS brand and Kirkland from Costco, but I keep going back to All.\n\nAll Free and Clear comes in pods too! I use products by Ingredients Matter It could be the material of your clothes as well, it is encouraged to use only 100% cotton material when dealing with LS. Could it be that as well? Oh hell! I thought I was ok using Tide Free &amp; Gentle. Recently my arms and thighs are super sensitive and itchy. Thought it was skin degradation or some other progression of auto immune condition.", "Should I make an appointment? So I (25 F) noticed yesterday a super dry patch of skin in the crease of my leg and vagina, and it is not itchy at all, but I did scratch at it and all the skin there flaked off and now the skin there is super shiny. But I got a mirror and basically super inspected myself because I am paranoid. Well I noticed the skin between my vagina and my butt looks white and shiny, like at first I thought it was discharge honestly but a closer look and I realized it was just my skin. I do get cut easily when I shave , idk if it has anything to do with it but I do not know does this sound like LS? Or something else? Just trying to avoid doctors if I can help it because of the virus and everything. But it scared me because I never noticed it before The leg thing kind of sounds like it could just be dry skin, but the white area between your vulva and butt sounds like a potential issue to me. If it is LS, it is important to get it treated promptly to stop it from progressing.  \n\nThat said, I believe the time scale for progression is slow, like months to years. If you are not having any symptoms like itching or pain, I would think it would be ok to wait a week or so and see if it still looks suspicious. \n\nI would also recommend taking pictures of what it looks like now so you can compare. If it goes away, you might still show your gynecologist the picture at your next pap smear or whenever you see them next. If it does not go away, then yes you should probably get that checked soonish.", "What does LS actually look like? Hi everyone,\n\nI had a biopsy taken yesterday from my vulva and have a long week of pending results ahead of me. My gyno was saying it is unlikely to be vulva cancer because of my age (30), but we would need the biopsy to rule it out. She acted completely stumped about my condition like she is never seen it before, which is not exactly calming my nerves. I do have an autoimmune condition (ulcerative colitis) for which I take immunosuppressants. \n\nI have itching that comes and goes, but the reason I went to the doctor is the white patches all over my vulva. It is not bumpy or different from my skin in anyway it is kind of just like I lost the pigment in my skin. Is that how LS looks like for you? Hi - sorry if you are headed towards this diagnosis. There is no mincing words, but this is one of the most difficult conditions to manage. Yes, what you are describing is what mine looks like. I am a 40 yo woman, diagnosed at 26, and I have unfortunately a very progressed case. It is almost exactly what you have described (in a figure 8 type pattern, both vulvar and anal skin is affected), but throughout time, my inner and outer labia have fused together, causing major loss of architecture, and now my clitoral hood is beginning to fuse together, too. I am prone to tearing, which looks like actual slits in the skin or small cuts - primarily on my perineum. I have many dark spots, that are essentially blood blisters from the skin being so thin - basically any sex will cause this. \n\nYour first line of treatment will likely be high-potency steroids, but in many cases, this causes so much more problems down the road (absolutely one of the reasons I have such a progressed case), so I would suggest you do lots of research on the effects of these medications over the long-term.\n\nI have had the best results at managing my symptoms with all natural stuff including:\n\n\\- Manuka honey for tears\n\n\\- Emu oil, vitamin E oil, castor oil for lubrication or anti-scarring\n\n\\- weekly acupuncture treatments\n\n\\- a strict grain-free, low-sugar, dairy-free diet, focusing on gut health\n\n\\- Recently started doing a borax saturated-solution treatment at home, which is astonishingly unfusing long-fused skin (you can read all about other people's experiences here:  (\n\nI feel like there is more, but not recalling now. Anyways - that was a really long answer to say, yes, sounds like me! Thank you so much for this response, I so so appreciate it!! To add, yes, what you described is what it looks like for me. I am fortunate that mine is extremely easy to manage with clobetasol and I had a doctor that knew exactly what it was after one look. I am also relatively young, 27F, and started to experience what the other poster mentioned, tearing that looked like slits and a beginning of labia fusing. It is so important to see your Dr ASAP and get on treatment. Mine seems to be completely back to normal, thankfully. Thank you! So glad to hear a good experience! I will keep Clobetasol in mind when I talk to my doctor. You should look into the effects of long-term use of clobetasol. Being a high-potency steroid, it reduces inflammation, but at the same time, it permanently thins the skin, and the vulva is covered in very sensitive, thin skin to begin with. I was on clob for 3 years successfully managing the LS symptoms, before it literally stopped working and wreaked havoc on my vascular system - like full body petechial rash - scary stuff. I was immediately advised to NEVER use it again. My skin then went into steroid rebound, becoming much worse - more susceptible to fusing, to tearing, to damage of all kinds. For women with LS, this is something to be aware of. Clob is not ideal for long-term management. Good to know. I am lucky enough that I barely use it every other week at this point, only if I start to notice a flare up really. I seem to have a mild case, but I do agree that long term use of anything really, comes with risks. I do think that finding what works with your body sooner rather than later will help you get control and manage things right from the start - good luck! Yeah I would definitely avoid using it long-term. I only use it during flares and I taper off very slowly. After that it is all about managing symptoms. I have heard very scary stories from other women about serious fusing and permanent damage to the area from using clob for so long. You are so resilient for dealing with this condition for so long and kind for sharing your insights. I am almost three years out from my earliest symptoms and have noticed that the steroids have made things worse for me very fast (same w/coconut oil, it works at first but w/prolonged use it quickly becomes an irritant). My gyno had me using it daily for 30 days and before I got to the end of the 30 it was unbearable. \n\nI am going to complete a two week trial of Julva, which has vit E and Emu Oil in it (and DHEA, hopefully that does not cause a reaction), and the gyno that created it says it is good for lichen. It is very pricey, but if it works it will be worth it. \n\nGoing to check out the borax treatment you recommended as well! Thank you again for sharing! &lt;3 You are welcome! I actually have the exact same reaction with coconut oil. It is not a good fit for me. I am very curious about Julva. Please keep me posted! Will do! :) Have you given Julva a try yet? Any thoughts? I hope you are doing well! I will be honest, I have not opened it! I have started taking 20 min Borax baths then applying vitamin E and emu oils and it is been incredible (and soooo much cheaper than Julva) I have had maybe 3 minor flare ups since I started, all very manageable and only mildly uncomfortable. If you are not a member yet check out this lichen fb group (women only). It is a super supportive and active group! Tons of excellent info :)\n\nI just realized you are the reason I found the fb group! Your link and info about borax baths are the most helpful things I have found! :D\n\n( So happy that is been working for you! I hope you are early enough in the disease process that your body can really heal with the Borax. It IS working for me, but my damage is very severe, so still looking for more. Definitely keep doing what you are doing! Yeah! So, I had a flare up and tried the Julva and it burned. I was hoping it was temporary but each day it was just as bad if not worse. There is coconut oil in it, which I am definitely sensitive to so that is probably why, although there are many different ingredients so it is hard to be certain. I gave up on it after three days and tossed the rest of my sample.", "Start of LS?  You should definitely make an appointment with your doctor to get a biopsy. Mine started out the same way, looking the exact same. Do not leave it untreated.\n\nOtherwise advice depends upon the person. I know some people use coconut oil or other oils to moisturize (I do not, my skin is too sensitive). I do use Vaseline as a way to protect the area bc it is an occlusive. But I only use it when I am not using the steroid cream. Some people take baths (never did anything for me). Best advice I have found is pretty simple: do not wash with soap, wash your public mound with mild soap and let it sort of rinse into the area, rinse out completely each shower/bath. Wipe gently or blot! I only use water wipes (Pamper\u2019s Aqua Pure Wipes, pricey but worth it) as I have found TP is too rough on my vulva and perineum where I have it. And I have switched to 100% cotton undies OR no undies when I can (sleeping, or in a maxi dress in the summer, etc.). Lube and foreplay is your friend (I have found sex causes or worsens tears for me &amp; I gently clean each time post sex). But PLEASE go to a doctor to confirm and get treatment.  Thank you so much! did you also get the tears in the third photo? I have started using clob which has helped the itchiness, but i am worried the tears are something else. I did start getting the tears. I kind of ignored it for awhile (which is not good advice lol). Sometimes if I have a flare, I still get tears from wiping or sex or whatever. Tearing is a symptom of LS. I think probably bc it thins the skin so it makes the skin more likely to tear.\n\nHave you had a biopsy yet? That is the best way to confirm the diagnosis I have not gotten it yet. My derm suspected it might be related to that and just gave me clob to start using and see what happened for a little with it. It has definitely decreased my itching which is so nice, i needed that relief. But interesting, were your tears always in the same spot and look like that? I just worry like std wise, but all swabs have come back negative Yes, almost exactly the same. Just small tears that look like that. I also get them on my perineum too. I am glad the clob is helping! They did a full STI panel for me too, including HIV &amp; everything negative. If the clob is helping that is probably indicative of LS. But I am certainly not a doctor lol totally makes sense and i so apologize asking online, but the results I have been getting are all over the place so had to reach out to others at this point! I really appreciate the advice and guesses :) You are very welcome! This is just my experience and some research/hearing from others on this sub. I find a lot of conflicting information is out there and I think it is because the scientific research just is not there yet. At least in the US, not sure where you are. I have also seen a LOT of completely useless doctors (OBGYN and derm) who have no idea about this condition. So, please advocate for yourself if your doctor is not being helpful. thank you! my gynos were def done testing and just saying they dont know and dont think std related due to swabs being negative but did not offer advice past that- the derm i saw took one look and was like, my best guess is lichen and gave me cream and the directions to update him if it helps then we can maybe do something else beyond that! The thing is i had a funky low blood test for an std but they said it was in a range that needed confirmatory testing hence the swabs\u2014- led to all my worry and doubt but i think from what i am hearing is it is more likely related to lichen! I would say it certainly looks like my LS did when it started. I was also getting the tearing. The clobestasol has made a world of difference. I wish I would gotten biopsied sooner. Good to know and once more, your tears, were they of similar features to mine?? They  only appear on that white patch for me! That looks and sounds exactly like mine I had the same tear over and over, it looked very similar. If it is painful or you get on in or on your urethra you can get rxlidocaine jelly that really helps to use the restroom/move without pain Wow! sounds great! thank you!! It was a worry! I already have clob, do you use anything else? Just clob and lidocaine if I get a tear. It helped immensely over time. I rarely have symptoms anymore, except near my period or if I am particularly stressed and it is never as bad as it was before diagnosis. I thought for sure I had an std that they were missing because it was just so so itchy and painful. Very minor now. I hope that you find success! Oh my gosh amazing to hear and know! I have been swabbed so often now the doctors are over me, but alas I am a freak in rechecking everything. the derm seemed pretty sure it was in it, and otherwise seemed interesting compared to typical std symptoms. Thank you for your responses! Yes, I would say they were similar. I do not recall what they looked like but I felt them. Not pleasant. Thank you for getting back to me! Just working to figure this all out, doctors have been just as confused, but the derm seemed to know more. What are you using for it if you dont mind me asking? I do not mind. My doc prescribed Clobetasol Propionate 0.05% ointment. She said to use a pea-sized amount 2-3 times weekly. I was worried about skin-thinning but my dermatologist said using it at that frequency, the thinning of skin is negligible and the damage from the LS is a far worse concern. Mine progressed rapidly so I use the ointment 2x weekly to keep it under control. It works well for me. Amazing! I have just started and was worried about the same situation. These tears and the consistent itching have been my biggest issues, but this ointment took the itching away almost instantly Follow up question to you all if you dont mind! When starting to use the clob, did you stop being as itchy? like even on days when you did not use it? Follow up question, when you did start using the clob, did you notice a decrease in itching immediately as well? I did almost the next morning and then havent used it for two days and still am itch free. For me, a few days of clob every time I start to feel symptoms means that I have almost never itched like that since diagnosis and initial treatment. I tend to notice(sorry tmi) that I will have micro tears when using the restroom or sex and I will use it for a few days and things settle down. It never gets to the unbearable itching, maybe just a little itch sometimes. Oh okay so then this is seemingly normal for it all! Good to know, I was worried maybe the itching had been in my head all along hahaha Yes, I feel like it started helping pretty immediately. It is pretty great stuff.", "Thoughts on Tulip ? Hi, I have been doing extensive reading on treatments available for LS\n\nOne that seems promising is the tulip procedure by Dr Coyle. A lot of women in Facebook groups rave on about how life changing the treatment was for them. It makes me want to fly out to Florida and have this done. But I am curious to know why his findings are not more recognized ? Is it still experimental ? \n\nDoes anything have any insight on this procedure or had it done ? I have talked to a few women, and even went as far to book an appt with him. Overall, it seems like it helps! Have you ever tried Mona Lisa touch? It is a similar concept except he goes deeper, specifically to the depth of your LS (as determined by biopsy). Overall, I would say about 75% of what I have read is positive, with noted reductions in pain/tearing during sex. I was all set to go have it done, but I found Dr. Newman, and ended up going for a stem cell lift with him and I am currently recovering, as it takes 3 months for full benefits (just like tulip!). But in just one month my itching/irritation is down by &gt; 20%, my burning is down by &gt;90%, and I am still too sore for pain-free sex, but hoping in a few more weeks that will be ok too! I never had tearing or fusing, but it helps with those symptoms as well! He injects PRP as well, which is what Dr. Coyle rubs on you after the TULIP procedure. \n\nI did not go with Dr. Coyle as he does not publish his research and I would say it is all very experimental at this point. He is only been doing the TULIP for 3 years, so long term effects cannot be determined. He does not provide any statistics which I did not like. Stem cells is also experimental but Dr. Newman is very up front with his numbers and his publications are available on his site. He has also been doing this for about 10 years now and has seen 250+ patients. Many other doctors offer stem cells for LS, he is just the most notable in the US. He also has a FB support group for LS sufferers to get support and talk to his previous patients about the stem cell procedure. \nThe TULIP is also a little riskier than stem cells, in that laser can cause scarring/harm to tissue, while stem cells have the same regenerative potential without harm, and actually uses the body to heal itself, since it is PRP from your blood and stem cells from your own fat. \n\nIf you go ahead with the TULIP, I am sure you will have great results! At the end of the day, the world does not care about LS, so that could be another reason his findings are not too recognized yet. It seems like he is gaining lots of traction, he is booked out for many months, I think as far as September or November rn, so book now!!! He does not take deposit or anything, so you can cancel later like I am \ud83d\ude02 Thank you so much for all this information!! Do you know what the fb group is called ?? For dr Newman\u2019s fb group you have to call his office and ask for Misty, and she will let you into the group, as it is \u201csecret\u201d. For Tulip there is a separate group that is rather new called dr coyle lichen sclerosus post-TULIP or TULIP curiosity group that you can look up and join :) Wow! Thanks for sharing-- do you mind me asking how much it cost or if it was covered by insurance? Unfortunately not covered by insurance. I paid $6250; Tulip is $4000. Very expensive. \nI think some people have had luck using insurance for Mona Lisa Touch though Thank you!! I will look into Mona Lisa Do you know some other doctors doing stem cells? I am curious who they might be since you mention it in this post Yeah look up dr Sabrina Solt in Scottsdale Arizona. And then I think fox valley plastic surgery offers something similar in the US. I know there is a doctor in South Africa, Australia,  and a few in Europe too that do it Thank you. Fox valley in Wisconsin? Yes, that is the one! \nThey call it \u201cfat transfer\u201d though so I am not sure if the concentrate the stem cells as much- but I have heard good things. (\n\nI also just found this one in TX too: (", "Mona Lisa Study We are getting to the end of our Mona Lisa Study for LS. We have 34 women out of the 40 we need. Help us over the finish line. It is a 6 month study with 7 visits in total. The first and last can be done in Washington DC but the middle five need to be done in NYC. We can provide up to $1,250 in travel related cost. Even though it is a sham controlled study, all women who are in the sham arm will be given real treatments if the study shows it is effective. I know there are physicians who are charging $2000 or more for only three treatments. In the study you will be getting 5 treatments and the laser has been especially calibrated for LS. This study is especially for those women who have been newly diagnosed with LS. In addition, I will give you advice on how to take care of your LS at the end of the study and I will wave all new patient fees if you want to continue to see me for care. So please do not waste your money on other treatments that are not effective such as PRP (O-shot, stem cell) and do not waste your money on Mona Lisa until we figure out if it really works (not just on symptoms, but also decreasing inflammation and cancer risk). Email me at  In addition, if you are part of a family with at least three members who have LS, please take part in our genetic study (all it requires is blood from each affected person). how old do you have to be to participate in the study? No study for men??? Do participants have to pay for the treatments?", "Successful stretching of LS scar tissue? \nI have been recently treated for Lichen Sclerosus with corticosteroids. The disease was caught early, although not before it destroyed my frenulum and caused me to develop mild phimosis, and I have been told I am now cured.  \n\nI appreciate that I am very fortunate in that my foreskin is fully retractable both flaccid and erect but it is meaningfully tighter then previously and, partly due to the loss of the frenulum, needs assistance to pull back to cover the glans post erection. \n\nI would like to ask if others have had any success with stretching the foreskin after the development of pathological scarring? Also, given the propensity for LS/BXO to return, has anybody felt that their stretching efforts in this particular situation resulted in negative outcomes? Just do small mild stretching multiple times daily  e.g. in the shower, when you have to take a piss, etc.  Once possible, wear the foreskin retracted under your clothes for periods of time.  Much of the scarring will go away and if you do the mild stretching will be replaced with less tight tissue.  heavy stretching that tears tissue should be avoided.  Did the doc give you any \"maintenance\" medication or routine? My doctor is a dermatologist. His position is that the scarring is permanent and whilst it may soften, it will not go away so stretching is of a very limited value. He certainly cautioned against anything aggressive which would create new scarring. Are you comments based on your own successful experiences? 100% based on my experience.  Scarring never went away, but softened and stretched over time such that it not an issue so long as I keep a daily routine of mild stretching.  The key is regularity, not doing it hard.  Best process is to just remember to give it a little mild stretch every time you take a piss.  Your dick is in your hands anyway and you were going to wash your hands, right?  Honestly, I think that wearing the foreskin retracted under clothes does something to accelerate the skin sloughing and replacement. Certainly retraction is helpful for preventing any further occlusion of urine and risking return of disease. Thank you for your advice. It is much appreciated. What did you do to get cured? \nAnd also, how did your frenulum get destroyed?", "(M28) Just diagnosed and starting dermovate I have just been diagnosed by Prof Bunker as having LS. I have no visible white patches. My main symptoms are bloodless tearing/splitting of the frenulum and periodic redness and irritation. This all started in October 2020 following a frenulum tear. I was prescribed betnovate steroids by my doctor and since then I have had tearing and irritation. \n\nProf Bunker listened to my story and prescribed a 4 week course of twice daily I  dermovate (Clobetasol). I have been following this for a week. I have noticed my frenulum seems thinner and more fragile and the end of my glans and frenulum is redder and more irritated. \n\nI am pretty sure this irritation is caused by the clobetasol. Should I stop? Or should I push through despite these side effects? (F54) I eas diagnosed Oct.2020. It got meaner, redder, internal tears recovering,I would not recommend stopping.it took 4 months of continued used fir me.... It WILL get better...im so sorry you got diagnosed. I do not know about males but females are prone to yeast infections...my doctor prescribed FLUCONAZOLE TABLETS USP 150MG... for the massive yeast infection that I got. February 2021. This not only cleared up the massive YEAST infection, but it also calmed the LS BEAST. Although I still have LS, I have been able to stop the CLOB AND NOW I take the FLOCONAZOLE ONCE every 10 days...and I have not had a flare up since February Today is June 26,2021. Talk to your doctor about it. It is prescribed for vaginal yeast infection....but I think it should include LS MAINTENANCE. You push through but let him know what is happening so he can modify his treatment if he feels appropriate. The guy knows what he is talking about: you are being treated by the leading authority on penile LS in the UK. I would call and ask. It is possible you are having a reaction, or it could be normal. If he thinks it is the former he could switch you to an alternative like tacrolimus. Or if you are taking a cream it could be something in the formulation that is irritating to you.\n\nI have to say I am surprised they diagnosed LS without any white patches and without a biopsy? In penile LS, the white patches are often absent in the early stages. Tearing of the foreskin and a broken or torn frenulum are often the early signs. There is also a marked reluctance to perform a biopsy on penile LS  - at least in the UK - as it has a rather low detection rate coupled with a more awkward harvest and recovery. Hi Nick, thanks, this is true. I have contacted his office so we will see what he says. I have anxiety about the steroids as they are obviously very potent and I previously had a bad reaction to them - the betnovate caused a dermatitis to develop around my eyes (I think there must have been a residue left on my fingers which caused the problem when I inadvertently rubbed my eyes). But clearly dermovate is the steroid of choice for treating LS so I need to give it a good go before resorting to more drastic measures (i.e. circumcision...) He said the diagnosis was incontrovertible based on my symptoms and photographs (of my previous frenulum tears). He did not mention the possibility of a biopsy. I may mention this when I see him again. It is interesting you mention that. I did find impovement a few months ago trying a fluconazole tablet and a course of topical clotrimazole. The clotrimazole does not seem to be working this time though. I am also under his care and I experienced not dissimilar symptoms and the whole of the top layer of membrane on the glans peeled off during my month. My impression is that he is very aware of the potency of the drugs he is prescribing and he is extremely cautious around extended use. I wish you all the best. If he says it is certain from appearance then it is probably fine. Biopsies suck, so if you can get away without one that is always a plus. My doctor originally prescribed it to me for One A Day for 3 days then once a week for 12 weeks then I will get a refill for another 12 weeks. But because the pill is so strong. I took it the first day and it cleared my yeast infection up 80%. I took it the second day and it cleared it up completely but I started to get it is on my neck and face, no rash appeared but it was itchy. I knew it was from this particular pill. However it cleared up a yeast infection which was extremely bad and it cleared up the lichen sclerosus to a point of comfort. Almost as if I did not have it anymore. So I did not take it the third. And I waited a week and took it oh, then I waited another week and I took it oh, but I started to get that itchy feeling on my neck and face again not as bad as the first time, so I spread out do 10 days. I did have a follow-up appointment because my liver enzymes were high for the 4th time. So at this follow-up appointment I asked her if doing it every 10 days was okay. She said it sounded good. I have been doing great since I have been taking this every 10 days. Usually by the 9th day things start acting up down there, so I take my pill on the 10th day and tadaaaas it all clears up again So once white patches are present it is considered later stage? How late?", "A hopeful message Hey guys, if you are looking this up you are probably freaking out a little bit. Here to tell you it gets better. Doctors do not like to tell you that ur diet matters but it does. Cut out sugars and fatty foods. Try an alkaline based diet for a few weeks and I promise you will see improvement. I use clob cream once every 3 months after making changes. Probiotics are extremely important. Avoid rubbing or irritation. I changed my diet and exercised regularly and I sometimes forget I even have the issue at all. Of course it is different for everyone but I am convinced flare ups happen due to poor gut health. Best of luck and do not worry, it is nothing to stress too much about, you will be fine and so will your sex life. Best of luck\ud83d\ude4f I see a lot of posts saying it gets worse with age which is most definitely true. However if you discover the condition earlier and take action sooner to better your overall health you will see improvements. Try intermittent fasting and drinking more water. There is definitely ways to counter its effects with a proper diet. I went from barely being able to walk to barely even noticing it is a problem. Refrain from sex or masturbation when you have flare ups. Keep ur head up and understand you are not alone. I hope this helps. I just posted/was freaking out lol, and this is literally what I needed. Thank you for the tips and positivity \ud83d\ude0a I posted this specifically for people like you. It could be so much worse and a lot of people have much more severe problems. Experiment and see what works for you. Literally posting this cause i had my first flare up in a very very long time. Why? Because I drank too much alcohol with tons of sugar! Diet is huge, doctors usually only want to prescribe things to you but diet causes 90% of disease:) keep ur head up and rest assured your life will be pretty normal! It is autoimmune and they do not even know what causes issue I have this for years. I wish I could something simple. It is my personal belief that poor gut health or not cleaning up after peeing causes it . I got it after taking tons of antibiotics which ruined my gut health and caused a huge imbalance in my body. I am not a doctor and that is strictly my assumption. But it is not super common so they have not done a ton of research on it Hey world. This is nonsense. No, an alkaline diet is not going to correct \u201cur\u201d disease. \n\nDoes not matter what you are so convinced of. It is nice you are doing better, but this post is irresponsible. I did not say out would correct anything but it lessens flare ups. Diet matters a ton. To each there own What probiotics do you recommend. I am 30M. I dont have irritation. Just the white scarring that progresses I just eat a lot of yogurt or take supplements but I am looking for a more natural solution. I have heard women talk about acidophilus for their LS. That is right. It is your belief. That is all. I use a probiotic as well and it has made  HUGE difference.  Also helps significantly with my T2 diabetes.  Takes some experimenting with the probiotics but they have been a life saver for me. Doctors are looking seriously at probiotics for treating all autoimmune disease.  One does not exclude the other.  And yes, part of the challenge is that every system is different.  Read the Autoimmune Brain. Well, there is scientific data regarding the urine exposure part. So he might be on the right track. &gt;alkaline based diet\n\nI am 21M unuct and have white scarring around my foreskin as well. I do not have any irritation, but I think my foreskin is a bit inflamed for some reason. Lookimg back I may have had very mild irritation but just the sort of thing you rub once and forget about it. I am not sure what to think of the white scarring. Is it there for life now. This is a horrible skin condition So does that mean there is no correct type of probiotic all auto immune conditions? Can I ask what strain? The guy is just trying to help and you lot are getting sour because you cannot be open minded to the possibility of it being gut issues. Gut issues are widely misunderstood so I think the guy could be on to something. I have terrible gut issues and just been diagnosed with this condition. Autoimmune diseases only came about when we started eating processed foods so to me that is an indicator gut issues can play a role in many things but that was not what i wrote about in the comment you have replied to, is it? Well it is your responsibility to realise that it is not a definite improvement, the guy obviously believes it will help people so let us not put him down on a post that could help people, and provide a helpful discussion. when did i insult the guy?\n\nwhy are you so distraught about this lol", "Anyone else\u2019s LS make them want to never wear pants ever?! Hello all! I am so happy I came across this thread\u2026. I was diagnosed with LS at 6 years old, went into remission at 14 and never had any issues until last year. My vagina was constantly angry, irritated and red. I kept getting tested for STI\u2019s because no one could figure out what it was! I am now a 26F and went back to the dermatologist who diagnosed me when I was a child and yepp the horrid LS has returned. I feel like any clothing I wear irritates me down there, I use the steroid ointment 3 times a week. Some days are better than others but it is always there :( I just do not know what to do. I work out constantly which does not help, I have read on here to use coconut oil as a moisturizer so I am going to start using that. Every time my period comes around the LS flares up. I sleep without underwear and try to wear loose clothing as much as I can. I am just frustrated and sad that this is something I will deal with forever. I stopped shaving down there, I literally do nothing to it because I am afraid of irritation!!!! Ugh! Just needed to rant. The ointment has helped but I mistakenly wore a pad for two hours when I was on my period and now I have a flare up and feeling discouraged. I hear you. Especially with the periods. I feel like I spend the entire month recovering from my last period and then the next one starts. I just bought a bunch of dresses and have stopped using pads altogether. I am currently using Thinx period underwear and have actually been doing significantly better when on my period. I would definitely talk to your doctor about it but you may need to using steroid cream daily during flare-ups. At least that is what my doctor has me doing but definitely do not take my word for it.   \nI just miss the simple days throwing on a pair of jeans and wearing them all day without pain. You are definitely not alone. Yep. I have not worn underwear since February\u2026 so sorry you are going through this. Have you tried emuaid or v magic? Those help me. Also borax soaks. HIGHLY recommend them to keep symptoms at bay. I spend like 2 hours a day in the tub when fighting a flare  (1-2C borax, sometimes I will add Epsom salt, coconut oil, or baking soda) and it helps me more than anything. 20 min 1-2x a day starting with 1/4 cup borax (or even less) is a good place to start. There is non bath methods if you do not have a tub. Lastly, I am just going to throw this out there because you are young and this sucks- there are other options, but they are very pricy. Look into TULIP or Stem cell/PRP for LS. Mona Lisa touch laser is also used and helps a lot of women, but it requires more treatments. It can be done more locally though since you probably will not have to travel too far to find someone who offers MLT. Sorry for rambling. You deserve a hug this shit fucking sucks Thank you for your reply \u2764\ufe0f I am going to try the soak you recommended to see if that eases the irritation and the coconut oil for my workouts. I was so desperate I googled LS underwear LOL. I saw some girls on here use period underwear, I might try that as well. I do actually have emuaid too!! Yay, I have got a few things I can use immediately. Thank you!!!!! I am going to try the period underwear and see if that helps any. I have learned a lot today from this forum so I am going to be trying some different things out. I used to wear jeans and jeans shorts all the time\u2026. Now I dread it!! \u2639\ufe0f it is nice to know I am not alone because I just feel so weird stressing about my vagina all the time and none of my friends deal with this or even begin to understand. Yup!! I have not worn underwear in years if I can  get away with it at home. I tend to wear dresses and work from home. Jeans are often very uncomfortable for me. I use a diva cup for my period. Any type of pad drives me crazy. Yes. I am with everyone else, I do not ever wear jeans. I usually wear skirts or soft pants, only cotton underwear and NEVER EVER thongs!!!!  \nI use the period pads that do not have the plastic layering on them. I noticed that those ones are less irritating but after reading what others have to say, I think I will try the period underwear.  \nI have tried every steroid cream out there and found they only made things worse for me. The one thing that has helped save me is Calendula cream and I have gone gluten free/dairy free/sugar free for years now. I have noticed a difference.  \nI am glad I came across this thread. Goes to show we are not alone and we are all feeling the same frustration. I am sorry the LS has returned and I hope you get some relief soon.", "NEW LICHEN SCLEROSUS TREATMENT BREAKTHROUGH!!! Greetings fellow lichen sclerosus patients. I believe I have discovered a simple new plant-based remedy for treating lichen sclerosus and I have come here to share the good news.\n\n\nWARNING: The plant I use contains chemicals which can potentialy act as MAOIs (or REMAs to be more specific) if they enter the bloodstream in sufficient quantities.\u00a0 Please DO NOT use this plant without adequate understanding of what MAOI's do, and please feel free to get more specific info or guidance from me if you intend to use it.\n\n\nLast fall I was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus (LS).\u00a0 Fortunatey I caught on\u00a0to the symptoms fairly fast and at the time of diagnosis I had only just begun to experience relatively mild tissue damage and sexual/urinary dysfunction.\u00a0 I did however have all the other classic symptoms like figure 8 shaped pigment loss, pain, itching, shrinking of skin in areas affected by pigment loss, plaque-like raised bumps/growths on skin, and more..\u00a0 It was a pretty scary situation to be in, as I am sure many of you know.\u00a0\n\n\nI was prescribed the standard treatment with topical steroid creams, however after researching them I decided to hold off on the big pharma drugs (I never ended up even picking up the Rx) and instead I began experimenting with using my favorite medicinal plant\u00a0Peganum harmala, in spite of the fact that my searches of the internet revealed no evidence of anyone ever trying to treat LS with\u00a0P. harmala.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nLong story short:\u00a0 I used organic food-grade 190proof ethanol to make an ethanolic tincture of\u00a0P. harmala\u00a0seeds, removed &gt;95% of the ethanol via specialized vacuum-assisted low-temp distillation apparatus to get a full-spectrum\u00a0P. harmala\u00a0extract, then I melted it together with some coconut oil and was able to use the resulting salve ALONE(no other lifestyle/dietary changes or anything)\u00a0to eleminate/reverse ALL of the frightening and uncomfortable symptoms of my LS with the exception of a small patch of skin which has\u00a0not quite\u00a0completely finished regaining all of its pigment\u00a0yet.\u00a0 Improvement in most of my symptoms began within the first week of treatment but the return of normal pigment was a slower process than the otherst..\n\n\nI mimicked the standard dosing instructions for treating LS with topical steroids by starting with a high frequency of application (once in the morning and once at night) and eventually tapering down the frequency as symptoms improved.\u00a0 I currently usually use it once every few days.\u00a0 \n\nAfter the first few weeks of using my cream twice daily with only positive results I experimented with applying the cream 4 -6 times daily for about a week with no side effects before returning back to the standard dosing schedule.  I also experimented with varrying potencies of the cream and found that too high of a concentration of my harmala extract in the salve(or lack of adequate mixing to distribute the harmala extract into the carrier oil) sometimes resulted in what appeared to be slight skin irritation which caused no discomfort and healed quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough I do not take any medications that could interact with MAOI's I did do some experiments with consuming tyramine heavy meals and caffeine while using overly generous amounts of this salve on my genital region and I experienced no noticeable effects that would indicate MAOI activity of my salve via this delivery method and dosage.\u00a0 I do however still find it necessary to give these special MAOI warnings out of an abundance of caution.\n\n\nBecause of the potential risks of MAOI interactions, it is worth noting that certain areas of the body such as the temples, palms, and soles of the feet are known for being able to absorb things from the skin into the bloodstream much more easily and efficiently than other regions of skin.\u00a0 \n\nMany years ago when I was looking for a better way to treat symptoms of my palmoplantar keratoderma I soaked my feet in an alcohol tincture that I made from P. harmala seeds.\u00a0 About ten minutes or less into my first foot soaking experience I began to feel an undeniably potent and uplifting euphria from the transdermal MAOI activity.\u00a0 \u00a0** If I had foolishly ingested something that has a negative interaction with MAOIs that day then my exerience could have been a very unpleasant and potentially DEADLY one!**\u00a0 \u00a0(side note- the daily harmala foot soaks work great for treating the symptoms of my palmoplantar keratoderma and the euphoric effects were only really strong that first time.)\n\n\nIf anyone made it through all that and is interested in trying to treat their LS with the salve I described above, it is possible to preare it without the use of specialized vacuum-assisted distillation equipment.\u00a0 I simply use the special equipment because I already have it and it makes the process much easier and more efficient for me.\u00a0 The journal article in the link below describes a simple method for preparing a similar harmala salve which can be replicated fairly easily in any kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe part you really want from the journal article is just this:\n\n\n\"product was prepared according to traditional treatise. Thus the plant material (1 kg of the seeds) was macerated in 6 times water (6 L) for 24 hours, boiled till the half of the water evaporated. The filtered extract then mixed with the same volume of olive oil (3 L) then boiled till all the aqueous part evaporated\"\n\n\n\nI really hope this info can help other people as much as it helped me.\u00a0 Good luck, and stay positive!\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n-the anonymous ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology enthusiast Sketchy", "Cream complete Ive seen many people recommending cream complete.\n\nHow has this helpef people?

But do not get the biopsy before the honey moon. It took me 3 hellish weeks to heal\u2026horrible! Google gyn specialist and make an appointment.  I found one here in Florida but she does not have appointments until October so good luck.  In the meantime do all the home remedies to see if it helps.  I would avoid having sex so it does not get worse. You definitely want to be better for your wedding!! what home remedies do you recommend? I am definitely no expert I am new to this as well.  Although i have been dealing with this for a while now, i just recently self diagnosed myself with this based on all the forums i have read.  For me personally it is the itching.  It gets unbearable.  Any dry rubbing against the area will cause a definite flair up.  So that being said when i have sex i put vaseline in that area.  I wash with water almost always.  I do on occasion use cetaphil just because sometimes i feel water just does not cut it.  When i use the bathroom i pat dry to avoid dry rubbing my sensitive area or it will flair up.  I sometimes feel when a flair up is approaching so i use cortizone in that area and avoid sex when it is approaching.  I also use seamless underwear.  Unfortunately i can no longer use thongs.  This has just changed my life completely.  I have started documenting the dates i get it to sort of have a log.  On pinterest i have found a lot of pins and some people suggest changing diet.  You can look it up on Pinterest.  I have also started following a few forums to educate myself and compare my symptoms with others.  I did get a cream called emuaid but i havent used it yet since i seem to be under control for now. I have had symptoms exactly like what you have explained, but my family doctor failed to address them properly, and after three years those cut looking things turned to little bumps. Finally my doctor sent me to a gynecologist, and I am now diagnosed with LS. \ud83d\ude1e True, those biopsies do not heal fast. Follow this forum there is also a webinar of some sort lots of information.   Yes do all the above plus find a new doctor. It does not require a super specialist and LS can be visually diagnosed and treated. I do believe it is important to get a biopsy to be certain but not everybody does. Definitely wait until after your wedding. Moisturizing is soo important. I like coconut oil, emu oil, aquaphor. I use lots of coconut oil for sex. The itching is best controlled with steroid ointment or Cortisone ointment. You will learn what works for you best. xo I have to try coconut oil.  I mentioned it to my husband and he says we are not cooking jajaaja but i have read a lot about it.  Unfortunately i have gone to two gyn\u2019s and they have not diagnosed.   This was prior to my self diagnosing.  Maybe i will go back and tell him what i suspect. Actually my guy loves using the coconut oil! I am obviously not a doctor and cannot say by the photos-there are typically white patches involved &amp; I do not see those. It is common to not be diagnosed for years and/or misdiagnosed for yeast. I was in my first huge flair when I saw a gyno. He did a biopsy and checked me for HPV, herpes, and all the STIs like trich and clymidia. It could be lichen simplex chronicus. Where in Florida? Update. Had my dermatology appointment today it is exactly that", "How do you stop the incessant itching? Ugh Title says it all. Help a girl out please! Personally when I am itchy I know that I need to give the area a little clean! So I just splash some water on it. I know some people find relief from ice packs too! \n\nMaybe some anti inflammatory medication like ibuprofen or antihistamines or just make sure the area is moisturised but not with water! I will try all of the above! It is just so sporadic. I will be fine for an hour and then it will itch like crazy then taper off yadda yadda yadda. Yup I am the exact same haha! I also know that letting air get to it in those moments really helps me! Try distract yourself too cos it may just be lack of mental stimulation that makes the itching seem worse! Oh for sure! I know if I am not occupied it seems way worse. What sorts of moisturizers do you recommend? I have tried coconut oil but could not tell if it worked or not lol I personally use a strong emollient commonly used for eczema called Zerobase. I know it can also be called diprobase too or something! Just a strong eczema moisturiser though with no perfumes or harsh chemicals Ice packs really helped me with the itch. I would often soak in warm water for 20 minutes, rinse off, pat dry and then hold an ice pack to my vulva. Taking an anti histamine can also help with the deep persistent itch. I have finally found a routine that works for me and now I itch when it is time to clean and reapply moisturizer. Water wipes work really well for easy cleansing and then I put on emu oil and vasaline. Also I have found if I have to much hair down there in a certain spot it will make it itchy. The skin is very delicate especially whennitiated and little corse hairs will make it worse. I do not shave, but I use little scissors to keep dense spots under control A cool rinse, a soak (maybe with epsom salt), no underwear or tights, bland unscented moisturizer, and if it is really bad, ice packs and maybe antihistamines. If itching wakes you up at night, you can freeze a water bottle and then put it by your bedside before you go to sleep so it is ready when you need it. My gyno pescribed me \"Elocon\" ointment. It is a topical corticosteroid and you apply a pea-sized amount of it once daily until eventually you only have to put it on a few times a week.", "white spots Does anyone else get white spots right before or the day their period starts? I noticed I have a small white spot in a spot I have never gotten any white areas at before.\n\nI know periods can trigger a whole plethora of issues for other ladies so I am trying to stay calm before freaking out over this disease again :\u2019( My itchiness gets worse before my period for sure. Have you tried a cortisone ointment and Vaseline? If you seem to respond to that treatment, it could be evidence of LS. But it would also potentially cause false negative results on a biopsy. However, early treatment is important, so do not be afraid. If caught early you can mitigate a lot of the worst symptoms.", "Folliculitis Had some itching between my buttocks and used the steroid on it fearing it was spreading LS. As it turns out, I think it was just the stubble growing back in from where I would (stupidly) shaved it, and now I am fairly sure the steroid use on the shaved skin has given me folliculitis, as this is how it is presenting (not like LS but like a rash of ingrown hairs). Has anyone else dealt with folliculitis without having to get \\*another\\* prescription?", "Sudden influx of NSFW pictures Why is there a sudden influx of these pictures and predominantly male\n\nNo one can tell you from a picture not even Dr and we are not Drs.\n\nI am incredibly dubious. \n\nUltimately if you think it is LS get a biopsy \n\nAsk for tips and tricks to deal with an active  flare and crop the pictures if it is in the tip of the glans no one but no one in here needs to see the whole head or the whole vulv If people are worried about LS, as long as the post is marked NSFW then surely its fine? Male or female, people just want help. Given the turn around time for doctors atm due to covid, reassurance or reaffirmation can reduce anxiety for some time.\n\nThere is some good Facebook groups for support, typically just text. Pictures are shared on discord and serve a purpose to compare. Typically your googling is not reflective of atypical presentations. But we are not best placed to say what is or is not LS from a picture No, but healthcare is not accessible to everyone and also, from personal experience, I have asked 5 doctors for a biopsy and none of \u2018them are willing so it helps to find a community. I understand they are not pretty pictures to see but if someone is having a hard time and wants advice then I do not see anything wrong with providing a picture It does not need to be of the whole damn dick though and trust me I am far from offended  by picture of dicks or of body parts I study mutilated parts for interest Then what is the issue? The pictures do not seem to be sexualized so I just view it as another body part that someone is asking for advice about. The pictures are not sexualised though so what is the big deal? Provided the op marks the post as NSFW I see zero issue.\nWe all have parts of our own. Not everyone can just go get a biopsy when there is a global pandemic happening.\n\nPeople just want some advice, LS can be really scary when you first learn about it/feel you have it.\n\nFrom what I have read it seems like it is more common in AFAB people as well, so that is why I would imagine where the majority of posts come from.\n\nI hope that anyone that sees your rant does not get discouraged from posting if they feel it necessary.\n\nYes we cannot diagnose you, but sometimes even knowing someone else is going through what you are can help. Exactly that. None of want to post random pictures of our genitals, male or female. We are all here for help. Someone might have the most presentable penis or labia in the world for all we know, but what they are looking for is support on LS, if someone can help spot that on said photo, then it might help build confidence to push harder for an appointment or provide confidence it is not. 'Yes, it might be LS. It is typical from the research I have done and similar to me. No it might not be, that just looks like x buddy  or z.' \n\nObviously a picture is going to be NSFW, so just hide the post.\n\nA lot of doctors at the moment will trial Dermovate or Trimovate with a protective emollient cream as a barrier for bad flare ups. The first two need to be on prescription but again, most people cannot get to docs asap due to covid and end up on the phone to their docs. If someone posts a picture here, a reddit user replies yes I think that is and the original poster calls doc, ends up and cream and finds relief, I would be made up for this, because LS sucks absolute ass. \n\nStay safe. I ve been having similar thought and am very dubious about the intention behind the recent influx tbh. If someone is genuinely worried and wants reassurance, I might have clicked in the past and even answered \"yes that might be LS, go to the doctor\". But now, my opinion is that some if not many of the posts are not advice seeking ones so I do not open them anymore. If you want people to look at your dick, deal with it appropriately. Do not pretend you are worried about having a disease, that is not cool.\n\nNot to mention that as there is no way around it, you have symptoms of LS, you need to see a doctor - period. We are not doctors, we cannot diagnose or prescribe medication you would need if you had the disease. So. If it is not LS it needs seeing incase it is cancer and GUM clinics are still working in the pandemic I do think this sub should have rules, and blurring out all body pictures as NSFW should be one of them. Nobody should see one without intentionally clicking to view it. r/psoriasis has that rule even though most pictures are not even of genitalia. \n\nAnd you are right, most of us are not doctors and diagnosis from a picture is not usually reliable. I think it can still serve a purpose, though. When I started googling about LS and thinking \"my vulva looks a lot like that\" I was worried I was just being a hypochondriac and the doctor would be at mad me for wasting their time over something completely normal. Fortunately I went anyway, but I could see how people would want a community to help them decide whether to see a doctor, what kind of doctor to see, and why not to panic until the appointment. Also, lots of people see doctors who do not know anything about LS and get told that what they have is normal and even that the symptoms are \"in their head.\" I think it can be helpful to have second opinions, even from laypeople, to give them the courage to seek a specialist. \n\nAs for why the majority of pictures are of penises, I do wonder that too. I was surprised because vulvar LS is more common than penile LS. Maybe they are all posting here because a lot of other LS communities only accept cis women. None of the pictures I have seen seem sexualized, and nobody put anything provocative in their text, so I do not suspect inappropriate motives. Not being offay with how Reddit can alter groups I think the blur the picture unless clicked on is an excellent halfway mark .\nSomeone from the group did message me to sort of say I am not a douche etc despite saying they see no issue. What I did say to them is there are males who thrive knowing they can catch people unawares . Just because it  does not look sexual does not mean that was not the intent it is a modern day flash a mac\n\nThis group was the very first group I joined on Reddit  \n\n I made the conscious decision to keep this part of my social media gore free. Sex free fairly bland\n\nSome people.dont want to see the sight of blood again this bluring could help with that and the biopsy pictures Im from a.clinical background and non if the pictures we could ever take could match the quality of medical photography hence why it is important. My own LS did not look like what the consultant normally saw as LS to the naked eye it had markers under the highly microscopic colposcopy cameras\n\nAt least one of the pictures on here reminds me a sub gland penile wart that was cancerous but Its likely not  ( it is 20 years since I was in that field -but this is why it is so important to go and get checked out and GUM clinics continue to run certainly in the UK especially for Doc I have this dodgy rash type Wow! What a stupid whinge! Do not come to this thread if you do not like it... simple! &gt;What I did say to them is there are males who thrive knowing they can catch people unawares\n\nIt is true, I have had that happen to me and it is messed up. Someone sent me a dick pic *because* I stopped talking to him.\n\nI wish Reddit made it easier to avoid content types. I like scrolling through r/popular but some stuff like the 'make me suffer' and 'nature is metal' I wish I could unsee. Wish I could block them from my feed but Reddit does not seem to have that feature. If we could make every photo in this sub auto-blur, that would be great, but I do not know if that is a feature. Certainly anyone posting truly inappropriate pictures should be banned. Do not click on pics labeled NSFW then? Do not need to click they just show up", "Structural Changes I was diagnosed a few months ago after trying to find out what my problem was for 4-5 years. I believe that I actually started having symptoms noticeably around the age of 11 (I am 23F) but they subsided for a while, and when I think back I had similar LS type pain around my anus when I was as young as 3-4 years old but nothing came of it then either. \n\nWhen I was officially diagnosed, the gyno told me that my inner labia had been completely reabsorbed. I recently had a horrible flare up, that appears to have taken even more of the tissue around my clitoris away, but it eventually stopped and it still looks okay.\n\nIt was not until around last week when I got a tear on the outside of my vulva, in the join of my leg to bum, that I am now feeling completely lost and isolated. The skin fusing back at that point appears to be pulling the bottom part of my outer labia away so that there is even MORE structural loss. \n\nI have been using clobetasol which does help and I absolutely lather my skin in emollient every day, multiple times a day. I am not particularly active at the moment as its too irritating to go to the gym. I stopped wearing underwear before this happened. I do not put chemicals on the area other than dermol soap substitute as prescribed and my clobetasol. \n\nI cannot get in contact with my gyno because everything is done through referral currently with the NHS so there is no email or telephone number to call. My GP is utterly useless with all of my medical conditions, and again I cannot find a new one because it is done by health board and they are my GP. I have not got the money or insurance for private medical care either.\n\nI am due a gyno appointment in January for my LS but I am feeling really low and alone right now with these changes. It is not the end of the world for me if there are structural changes, but I am really scared i will lose my clit, or the opening of my urethra will become affected or if i lose my labia majora completely. \n\nI feel completely forgotten about by medical professionals and I have so many other autoimmune conditions that this is a lot to take on too. \n\nI suppose i am just looking for more reassurance, or tips on other things I could try that worked for other people. My next conversation with my Gyno will be what she thinks the best steps would be in terms of seeking dietary guidance for the issue as I think i will need to find someone who can help me find inflammatory triggers.\n\nAny tips, tricks or advice for a very sad and scared lil lady?", "Just got my diagnosis! Hi guys,  \n\n\nI am 24 and I  found out that I have LS during a routine check of my IUD... I did not have symptoms like itching and bruising, only a white spot on the very top of my vulva (I thought it might have been from shaving when I noticed a change). Very embarassing, my gyne (who I trust and really appreciate) took a picture with her iphone... and showed me that one part of my lip has started to 'disappear'.\n\n I am now on Dermovate 1xday for a week then 2x a week until my next appointment + a sort of vaseline to hydrate everytime I use the toilet. I am super worried and I am scared that it affects my lady parts even more haha...\n\nDid the 'color' come back after treatment?\n\nDid the treatment really slow down or stopped any more 'fusing'?\n\nI have been having nightmares for the last 3 nights and indeed looked at 1000s pictures on google image. I feel like since I have known about it, it keeps getting worse.\n\nThanks in advance! Look into Thymosin Alpha! It is an injectable used to boost Immune function. I just finished it and it cleared mine up and mine was bad. Now idk if it will come back and it was expensive but it is worth looking into if you are financially able. $450 for a 10 day vial. Injected 2x day. Clobetasol - a potent steroid cream - is a standard treatment. For me, yes, color came back, and fusing stopped or has dramatically slowed. I use it for a few days a few times a year and that is all I seem to need. Anything already altered will stay that way, but it may not get any worse. \n\nThere are no other treatments known to be effective that are widely acknowledged. Topical steroid creams are it. Improve your health, absolutely, but there is no other magic bullets. My advice is, do not look at scary pictures of LS online. They are not going to be \"typical\" cases and they do not likely represent your future at all. It is kind of like if you asked for a picture of a cake to learn what a cake looks like, and you only got pictures of celebrity wedding cakes. Sure they are cakes, but they are not good examples of your average cake. Extreme LS cases that have progressed a lot are the ones that make it into medical journals and such. Your LS sounds like it was caught very early so there is no reason for you to progress like that. \n\nDermovate is the brand name for clobetasol. The standard is to use it twice a day for about 12 weeks or until symptoms are controlled, then taper off in frequency, but never stop completely. My guess is your treatment plan is less aggressive since you do not have symptoms, but I am not sure what the protocol is for that.", "Feeling positive &amp; hopeful! I tend to focus on the negatives a lot with this condition but I did some thinking and thought I would share a happy moment in my treatment with you all! \n\nI had a gyno appointment the other week. Long story short, she was just as upset as me to discover the steroids were not working, I would been in an almost constant flare for 4.5months and there were further structural changes and the LS had gone extra genital. \n\nWe did some thinking, and she noticed my skin was red with a shine to it and she guessed that there was possibly a superimposed infection on the skin. I left in tears on my drive back home from the hospital and thought that I am resistant to the steroids and my skin was never going to get better. \n\nLiterally less than a week into treatment with the Clobetasol mixed with fucidin antibiotic cream and clotrimazole anti-fungal cream (all of which she prescribed and I am to see her in 6 weeks) my skin looks SO much better. It is a healthy pink, there are no tears or open wounds, no obvious white skin (except my perineum which is notoriously stubborn). \n\nI am over the moon with the results, I do not feel like a lost cause and I am confident in where I am going with this now! \n\nThat being said I am staying vigilant and will be continuing to use my steroid as instructed.\n\nBut I thought you guys might like a lil positive post, so thank you for being my rock and guide through these horribly trying times!", "LS in the bum. I am curious to know if anyone with LS in their behind has taken a look at their anus? I am currently waiting on biopsy results, and my gyno told me my itchy anus is most probably due to LS in addition to my other vaginal symptoms. After continuously using the clob on my anus as well for initial treatment and getting a skin burn/reaction from it I had to stop. I looked at the anus and noticed it is extremely purple and has some bumps. Now I am starting to wonder if this is in fact LS or do I just have hemorrhoids? Unfortunately I cannot get to any doctors at the moment, and I would assume you could have LS and hemorrhoids at the same time obviously. But I am curious to know if anyone else with LS has an itchy puffy purple butthole? What does yours look like? I do not have any white patches anywhere, so I do not even know what I am looking at to be honest.\n\nI have posted with a picture elsewhere on reddit as reference to see what others think.\n\nThoughts? Mine just looked a tiny bit ashy. Hardly noticeable honestly. Sounds like you might have hemorrhoids. When my partner had them, his anus looked a little bruised Thank you for sharing! \ud83d\ude0a", "Mona Lisa touch long term effects. Does anyone know the negative or long term effects of this treatment? I am considering it! I cannot find the long term effects anywhere but I have read that women get it for years and feel great after... any thoughts or articles to share? I got 5 Mona Lisa treatments 3 or 4 years ago. For context I have never had white patches, but a shrinking labia, pain/scarring, and itching. I believe it did help me improve some, but it did not fix all my problems. I still keep up with my topical creams regularly which I think helps me manage my symptoms the most. Mona Lisa is frustrating because you get it every 6 weeks (not the same time every month)  so sometimes you are about to start your period and its painful due to where you are in your cycle and sometimes you have the treatment done while  you are feeling healthy down there and suddenly you are out of commission and itchy and in pain. I experienced a lot of itchiness after the treatments while I was healing. It was severe and required a topical lidocaine prescription. I was concerned I was making my skin worse with all the itching. It is already hard to have a healthy sex life with LS and the Mona Lisa schedule definitely made it worse for a while. I am sorry I cannot provide better concrete info. Just thought I would tell you my experience. I do believe it helped a little, but the process was not fun and not something I personally want to repeat. Good luck! Thank you for your help! Every response helps me get a smidge closer to a decision. Apparently it is helped a lot of women with lichen but I am so nervous to be the one that it does not. It is already so uncomfy from time to time. And I fight white patches and fixing flares with my steroid ointments. It makes me nervous to use them long term so I was hoping the treatment would prolong me using the steroids for a time. Totally understand. Steroid creams make me nervous too, which is why I use pimecrolimus cream nightly which is steroid-free. Its basically for eczema and has helped me with stinging and other symptoms. I only use steroid creams (desonide which is a low steroid or clobetasol a strong steroid) when I am having a flare or had sex and need to manage any possible scarring/soreness. If its really bad I use clobetasol or not too bad or more preventative I use Desonide. Hope this is helpful. Good luck!", "Worried about biopsy Hi, I am 41(M) and have had lichen sclerosis diagnosed for about ten years. Its not a huge area that is affected but I get a white area on the glans of my penis and a white spot that changes. Sometimes it is noticeable other times not as much. \n\nRecently it changed to looking a lot redder and I have also experienced some discomfort there which I have never had before. It got me worried enough to visit my Doctor. He then referred me to the hospital. By that time, it looked a lot better, like it was healing but the Doctor booked me in for a biopsy next week to rule out cancer. He is said it is unlikely to be cancer but recommend we get the biopsy done to be sure. \n\nMy worry is that it will be a punch biopsy, very close to the opening. It will be a small biopsy but will need stitches and will leave a small scar. There is also the risk it could affect \u2018my stream\u2019 a little. \n\nI am so torn as to whether I should go ahead with the procedure. I am worried about the appearance after the biopsy long term. What that could mean for future partners etc. As it looks a lot better that it did, it makes me feel like I should cancel. However the new slight pain I feel with it still along with the Doctors recommendation makes me then think I should go through with it. It would also hopefully rule out any cancer and possibly remove the problem all together. \n\nI know this is maybe just specific to me, but I wondered if anyone had any thoughts on this. My hospital date is in one week so I do not have long to decide.  It is keeping me up at night trying to work out what is best. Hi, I think you should get it done just to be sure. I was also very worried about mine (23F) and how it would look and feel afterwards but in the end I am very glad I went through with it because it has helped me in the long run! \n\nGood luck. \ud83d\ude01 hey man, did they diagnose something? I actually just got my results a couple of days ago.  Was all clear, nothing bad.\n\nI ended up cancelling my original punch biopsy when I posted my first message.  The lesion that had appeared (where I usually get a white spot on my glans) had almost disappeared and so I thought there was no need.\nHowever, about a week later, overnight, it appeared again and I was instantly regretting cancelling the biopsy.\nMy Doctor rearranged it - took a few weeks but I finally had the biopsy about 3 weeks ago.\n\nIt was a 4mm punch biopsy which meant I did get a couple of stitches and I do have a small scar now.  The procedure itself was not too bad though I was sore for a while after.\nAll in all I am happy I have had it done.  The problem area has gone now, and I am not worried about it being cancerous anymore.\n\nI still have an area of my glans which is noticeably whiter, but I am not too concerned about that, steroid cream may calm that down a little.\nI am lucky in that I do not have any other symptoms now other than the appearance.\n\nThe appearance of the scar where I got the stitches does worry me a little bit, but as it is only been three weeks since the surgery, I am confident it will become less noticeable as time goes on. i have been worried sick i have dick cancer because of some white scar like spots on my glans that i suspect are from when i had psoriasis on it as a kid. Urologist said i have extreme anxiety and nothing is wrong with me and stuff like that is very normal. I have a derm appointment in a week and cannot decide if i want to ask for a biopsy or nah, because i would straight hang myself if it turns out to be cancer, but If i do not find out for sure i am going to be sick worried. I am 17 btw so everyone kind of disregards the possibility that i might have it  I completely understand your anxiety.  I have gone through it too.  But I would like to give you some reassurance that you are very likely to be absolutely fine.\n\nFirst off, a urologist will know exactly what they are looking for with regards to cancer and from what I have been told, will only opt for a biopsy if they think it is really necessary.\nThe white spots that you have can just be depigmentation of the skin - it happens, or it may be lichen sclerosis - which is not cancer.  If it is lichen sclerosis, then a steroid cream helps.  I use clobetasol which is a very common steroid used for this condition - you will see many people talking about using \u2018clob\u2019 on here.  You usually only have to use it for a short time when it is more noticeable.\n\nAs for cancer, my urologist told me that cancer of the penis is very rare and when it does \u2018appear\u2019, it will look more wart like.  I do not suggest you google images of it as it is not the nicest thing to look at and probably wont do your anxiety any good - BUT, it sounds to me that you just have these white spots which is far from what cancer will look like.\n\nTo put it in context, I have had the white spots for probably 15-20 years and only in the past year did it change to something different.  Even then, thankfully, it was not cancer.\n\nLast bit of advice would be to dry yourself after you pee.  It is commonly thought urine could be linked to lichen sclerosis so it is best to dry your cock with some loo roll if you can.  This is especially important if you are uncircumcised.  Other than that, just make sure you have good hygiene down there and you should be fine.\n\nIt is easy to get yourself wound up thinking the worst with these things but seriously, do not worry.  Good luck at the dermatologist, I suspect they will prescribe the steroid cream.  I do not think a biopsy will be necessary but see what they advise.\n\nAll the best. thanks so much bro, i have been having some of the shiftiest days thinking the worse and it is hard to think stuff will be alright considering my terrible luck these past few months. I really hope it is not a problem. I hope you have a very good day Hey man, I wanted to give you the good news! derm diagnosed it as lichen sclerosus and gave me clobetasol to treat it. completely assured me it is not cancer and told me to come back in a month to share results. Ahh that is great to hear! Really happy for you that you have had that reassurance from the dermatologist.\n\nIt is easy to get anxious about these things. \nThe steroid cream should help. Get really diligent about drying yourself after you pee too, I think that can make a big difference. \nAll the best. \ud83d\udc4d", "Not sure if flare up really bad or treatment not working. I (23 F) got diagnosed with LS back in September, was given clob, it gave me a reaction. So I got betamethasone and used once a day and it helped a bit but never fully took it away. But lately I have been having a really bad flare up lately and was told to use my steroid cream (betamethasone) 2x a day for a month to see if it gets better. It got slightly better for a bit but now seems just as bad and that the cream is not working. So I am going to have to call the dermatologist about it again. So idk if this isnjust a super bad flare-up or maybe the cream is not working right, it never fully got rid of it before. Im also worried that there are not many more treatment options for me. Has anyone else experienced something like this? It took about 9 months of Clob treatment for mine to settle down. How long was it from did the start of your symptoms before you got diagnosed/started treatment?\nHas it been better now? Mine never fully goes away but just kind of recedes to a more manageable point (no discomfort outside of intercourse pretty much). In the beginning I had to use the clob 2x a day for 2 weeks and then 1x a day for a month and then was supposed to go down to every other day, but had to keep using it every day a while longer because it did not seem to work. So I would agree with the other commenter that sometimes it might just take some time to go under control? But definitely talk to your doctor if you can because every situation is unique! Now I use it about 3x/week every week but it still does flare up sometimes for weeks at a time even.", "I am having pain inside and burning. Does lichen even present here? And I am wondering is this lichen? Or does it appear abnormally white? Also can lichen even present here???? Idk what is wrong with me :(\n( My doctor (who is a specialist in chronic genital disorders) told me no, that sclerosus does not present external symptoms unless it is progressed extremely far already. I would consult with your doctor though. Generally lichen does not affect the inside. Often, people with LS also have other overlapping disorders. For me, the internal/entrance pain was caused by Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis, which is treated with an internal cream containing hydrocortisone and sometimes other things like clindamycin or sex hormones. Would you consider this the inside like where it looks white though??? I feel like it is outside :( and I am scared Ugh :( When I look here I see whiteness on your \"vestibule\" (between vagina and clitoris), and that could potentially be LS. I also see whiteness on your hymen, and that is less likely to be LS and more likely to be something like DIV. I am sorry that you are scared. Have you been able to make an appointment with a doctor? I am waiting. It could be maybe irritation from using estrogen cream idk tho What was the estrogen cream prescribed for and how long have you been using it? Did your doc tell you to expect irritation from it? I am pretty sure i had low estrogen from being on a BC pill for years and i had pain during sex that was greatly reduced after going off BC and using the estrogen cream and they didnt say anything i had to ask for the cream from my own research because I was sure that is what caused everything. but i have this fear of lichen even tho multiple docs have looked and said they see nothing (No one has done a biopsy cuz they think its normal) but ya idk like i sued the estrogen cream 2 nights in a row and im thinking maybe it just caused irritation which is why imf eeling pain... im hoping that is what this is cuz i just feel burning on my veatibule today and yesterday I am so sorry, that all sounds really hard. I hope it is just a little temporary irritation, but if it keeps hurting please check in with your doctor. If something in the cream is irritating for you they can get you a different formulation. \n\nYou may want to read a bit and ask your doctor about Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis, it has symptoms like painful sex, burning, and whitening of the vestibule and vagina so it might fit your case. They can diagnose by taking a swab from your vagina and examining it under a microscope.\n\n(I am sorry this is a really science jargon-y resource, there just is not a lot of good info out there) \n", "Does this look like LS? I have had itching near my anus for the past year and recently i saw the white/ purple spot near my anus, I am 21M, it is worse at night or when i wipe after using the restroom, sometimes there is blood but it is a tiny amount and only happens every few months  Honestly, it is hard to tell from a picture but I can tell you that I also had anal itching for a year or so and it would always be worse at night or after a bowel movement. I also have some discoloration of my anal area that appears white/purple. I always thought the itching was due to a minor hemorrhoid but now that I was told I have LS, I am not sure that was solely the reason. However, I have some whitening of the skin of my inner labia majora so the diagnosis was not just based off the discoloration and itching of my anal area. I had LS symptoms exactly as you describe for several years before any symptoms developed on my genitals which lead to my LS diagnosis.  I thought the itchy anus at night and the occasional little tears or anal fissures that would leave behind a drop or two of blood were symptoms of an intestinal parasite.  I was familiar with the symptoms of an internal parasite because I had unfortunately had to deal with that in the past.  Anyway, eventually I realized that LS explained the symptoms on my anus and that I probably didnt have an intestinal parasite.", "Newly diagnosed I was previously diagnosed with Psoriasis and have a basic knowledge of skin conditions from a mixture of taking medical coding classes and just researching Psoriasis and skin conditions that look like it... so not totally a newb to this kind of thing.\n\nI was using Protopic from my derm for the vulva where I have had this flare for five years now... but I just was not getting much in the way of results (I suppose it helps a little after a few months, but that is way too long to wait when it is causing breaks in the skin!), so I went back to see a gynecologist and she decided to biopsy, which came back as Lichen Sclerosus.\n\nThis started while I was pregnant (1st trimester) and just progressed to the point where we have not been able to manage sex for the last year and a half. Even without doing anything with it, it tears and bleeds and is incredibly painful. It is now spreading to the skin folds outside if the vulva.\n\nThe derm and I had guessed it was Psoriasis in an unusual area but it seems that LS is much worse because it is so destructive! My labia minora has shrank and vaginal opening has narrowed somewhat and I do not know if I will ever be able to have sex again. I am terrified!\n\nI am waiting for the biopsy areas to heal and then I am starting on a steroid and hoping in the future the Protopic can be used for maintenance? I recognize steroids have risks long-term... I have already discussed this with my dermatologist. Has anyone had any luck with using this for maintenance or so they can use less steroids?\n\nOver the last few years I have just been using suppositories for moisture and Aquaphor to seal when the skin breaks. It is the only real luck I have had thus far.\n\nHas anyone been able to get this condition (on the vulva/vaginal opening/anal area) to (medication-induced) remission?\n\nIs there any hope at all? Look into stem cells or Tulip. The steroid will help, but it can make tearing worse (at first at least) and I have heard estrogen cream can help. I know you are prob pre menopausal (based on you being pregnant 5 years ago) but I am 23 and have used it and it helps! I am also undergoing stem cell therapy and cannot recommend it enough. I will attach links for the tulip and stem cell. There is also the Mona Lisa touch procedure that some have had luck with, but the laser does not go as deep as Tulip (goes to a personalized depth based on biopsy) so it is typically considered less successful but potentially more accessible/affordable. \nAlso, once your skin is no longer tearing you can use dilators to reverse the narrowing, but make sure your skin heals first! I believe intimate rose is a highly recommended brand.\n\n(\nPlease note that the tulip can only be done in Pensacola, FL and consequently can have a 6 month waitlist.  Cost is currently $4000 USD, no insurance but some have had the included $500 for the biopsy covered bringing it down to $3500. It is usually a one time treatment, but touch ups cost ~$1800 \n\n(\nI believe Dr. Newman (I have seen him 2x for this therapy) is the most cost effective and the most experienced in the US.  Cost $6250 per treatment, multiple treatments usually needed (usually 2-3). \n\nI hope you find relief! Now that you have the proper diagnosis it should only get better \ud83d\udc97 Oh WOW that is expensive! My husband and I were looking into stem cell creams that have FDA approval for Psoriasis... wonder if anyone here has found those to be helpful.\n\nI guess in the meantime I might have to look into saving up and see if those treatments might be an option in the future.\n\nThank you for the suggestions, I greatly appreciate it!\n\nAlso: Yes, I am 33yo My understanding is that they keep watching the steroid use in the vulva and it is WEIRD, and inexplicable, but it does not cause thinning of the skin even with long term use of super potent steroid ointments like clobetasol. Counterintuitive, but \u2026 evidence we have today says it is okay to use steroid liberally inside the no-hair boundary. We think. \n\nClobetasol has been a total lifesaver for me. In my 30s I went from pain and tearing and torture itching to \u201cfine\u201d in two weeks. In my 40s now and this year suddenly it roared back - in a couple weeks most of the topography is just wiped away, clitoris is wiped off map (topically; the functional bits are fortunately under the skin), lips are pretty well gone. The itching roared back and I could not sleep at all. Clob calmed it all in a couple days. I will not get back what I lost, and maybe would not have lost it if I had not been as worried about the effects of steroid use on skin\u2026.  Cannot win. \n\nSeriously evaluate whether there is risk to using steroids on the vulva. Evidence keeps showing it is special and does not degrade like other skin does. Does not make sense, and yet they keep finding that to be true. Thank you so much for that information. After kind of failing with the Protopic I have been feeling really hopeless and the diagnosis did not make me feel any better.\n\nIt makes me feel so much better to hear you had fast results. That is been my experience with my feet with steroids - 1-2 weeks and it is gone.\n\nI will be crossing my fingers this is the same. Just butting in to say that I have also read that for some reason, mucus membrane is not thinned by steroids in the same way as other skin! Could not tell you why, though, as I am no scientist.", "Lichen Sclerosus ", "Circumcised for LS 23 days ago, how long till improvement? Hi all. Before the circ I had two patches on glans, mild pink shiny possibly slightly white. In the 3 weeks since, those patches changed, one to a slightly flaky patch, the other to darker shiny rubbery slightly raised patch, with scratch-like bits across it.  I realise early days, but I would be hugely grateful for any words of wisdom from experience as to when improvement might be realistic to expect? Thanks I am advance My dermatologist told me the skin cells change when you are circumcised.  But since circumcised and circumcised at birth both get LS I dont think this alone will help. Are you on a steroid ointment treatment plan ? Thanks, interesting. No treatment post op just a return visit to dermo in 3 months to see how circ changes things I guess", "Got some questions As the title says, I got a few questions. I am going to be bringing these up to my OBGYN when they come back to the office but I want some reddit advice in the meantime. I would *really* appreciate any response! (Before I start, I do have to say that I have been really stressed these last few days and that it may be contributing to my recent issues/flares.)\n\nI was prescribed 0.05% clob approx 11 days ago. It is done me pretty okay, but I am not sure if I am having side effects of the ointment or if it is not working fully. First thing I want to ask is how much do people typically put on? I ALWAYS feel like I am either doing not enough/too much. And how long do you rub it in for? I usually get a small dab on my finger, put it on a specific area, gently wipe my finger up and down a few times before moving on to the next area.\n\nSecond question is that I see people saying that they use a hairdryer or something to dry it into their skin. I dry out super easily so that is not really possible (im on estrogen rn for AV). Is it okay to let it air-dry? That is what I have been doing.\n\nAnother question. It has helped my vaginal skin be less swollen, less red, and overall look far better than I thought possible. For example, I had a small white patch at the bottom of my folds and that has nearly disappeared. I still have some white bumps in/near my clitoris that are still there, and I do have minor flare-ups, usually at least once a day for a short while, where I feel itchy, some burning/tingling, and sometimes it does look red. These past couple of days I have been having near constant flares (see first paragraph). I get real red looking, that thousand-papercut feeling and I get really small, painful, raw-like areas in specific areas next to my clitoris. I also get a discomforting feeling in my lower stomach. Rubbing a tiny bit of clob on it helps, but it takes a while to go away. Is this normal, or could this mean the medicine is ineffective?\n\nI have also noticed that for some reason, I have been peeing more? In a weird way, I can pee much harder and faster than before, but at the cost of having to pee more frequently. It is kind of like... my reduced vaginal swelling has opened up the pee gates? If that makes sense lol. I wanted to ask if this is normal/you have experienced this, or if this is something that I should mention. I will say that this happened almost straightaway after the first dose, near instantaneously.", "2.5 months into steroid treatment and skin feels more fragile, tips? I am now 2.5 months into the initial three month treatment for LS. Started out with clob and then got switched to mometasone after the first month as my skin started getting massively irritated after clob application once I would been doing it daily for four weeks. \n\nThe itching has disappeared and the red and pale areas are evening out in colour a lot, and the intense rawness around my vaginal opening is also vanishing, all of which is obviously good. The problem is my skin now feels so fragile in the folds where I have been treating that it is uncomfortable to walk for more than about 30 minutes, which was not an issue at all until I started steroids. I use emolient already. I am down to twice-weekly application and I find that this fragile feeling is worst immediately after I do the steroids and then feels gradually better as time passes, until the next application when it starts again. I apply thinly already, so it is not too much steroid. If anyone else had this issue, did you use anything in particular to strengthen your skin after the course? I used Mometasone but wasnt very good at applying regularly. I am a male. Maybe once a week. Not sure I would say it made it fragile but it dried my skin out massively. My LS has reversed drastically but I am not sure it is the cream. I started a supplement regime at the same time so its possible this helped. Would you consider not applying as often? I am glad to hear your symptoms have improved a lot. Personally, I never found my skin more fragile with Clob use. When I first started Clob I found my skin would feel really raw and dry, but then it got better when I applied less frequent and used emollient. I know ur applying 2   x a week now, but I do not know if uve recently stepped down or not. I have no experience using mometasone so I cannot speak to that specifically. If you think it is due to the steroid, I supposed you could try reducing the dose either use a small pea sized amount or try 1 x a week and see if it helps things.", "Pregnancy and lichen sclerosus Has anyone here gone through a pregnancy while suffering from lichen scl?\nI would like to know if it causes any additional issues or if your gynecologists have given you any suggestions.", "16M almost 100% certain I have lichen sclerosus I do not know what I can do. It is been going on for about 3-4 years now and it started in the foreskin and slowly made it is way up to the head of the penis. I have all the symptoms except really bad itching but it looks the same, purple ish skin and hard, dead skin that can be torn off easily that becomes inflamed in things like the shower and turns white.\n\nI have no problems with urination yet but I am worried I will soon. There seems to be no other explanation than lichen sclerosis to my problems considering the symptoms and how long it has taken to spread. I have tried talking about it to a doctor or my parents but I always get a panic attack and end up not asking for help. I am scared this will ruin my life You have to ask for help in order to get treatment because treatment is the only way to deal with a condition like LS. LS (if that is what you have) is for life, the sooner you address it, the MUCH better off you will be. \n\nYour doctor is there to be your doctor. They hear all sorts of weird, or what the patient considers to be embarrassing stuff all the time. Trust me, your doctor has dealt with much worse. That is their job! Make an appointment, please, it is the very best thing you can do. My mom never talked to me about women's health and I ended up so uninformed and afraid to ask questions. As a result, I talk openly and clearly and with no shame to my kids (of course, in age appropriate measures). I think one of the ways our society fails our kids is that we have made body parts embarrassing. You should have no shame when it comes to your penis. It serves you well in multiple areas of life, much like your feet, your neck, or your elbows. Why we have made it such a dirty subject baffles me. You certainly have a reason to see a doctor. Whatever this is, you need to get it figured out. Your issue is not in deciding whether to go... it is in actually *getting* there. Right? So, I say you take it in three steps:\n\nStep 1: Go somewhere private and meet your penis. I am not telling you to have playtime or anything like that, but look at it. Study it. Notice the things about it that look normal (those things that have always been there) and then notice the things that do not look normal. Try describing it out loud as though you are a doctor on Grey's Anatomy or something. Get all your sillies out here. This is just a body part. Make sure that you can put into words what is wrong with your penis. Be able to explain it two different ways: once to those who cannot see it and once while showing someone the problem.\n\nStep 2: Go to the parent you feel most comfortable with in this scenario and say something like, \"I have something serious happening and I would like to talk about it with you. I am uncomfortable and I would like to have your attention so that we can get through this quickly.\" Then, explain your issue in the first way you practiced: to someone who cannot see it. If you feel comfortable showing it, that is your choice. All you need is to get to the doctor and a parent can get you there. This will probably be the hardest part.\n\nStep 3: Walk into the doctor's office ready to explain things the second way: by showing. Know that doctors see all sorts of things all the time and he probably will not remember this in two weeks.  \n\n\nI forgot step 4: feel empowered. You have taken ownership of your body and taken steps in bravery that few grown men are confident to take. This is a scary thing, but I have confidence in you.", "Can Lichen Planus appear during or after Lichen Sclerosus I have spoken before here about my LS reversing over the past 4 months. However for the past month 9ve had little red bumps on tbe back of both my wrists that could maybe be lichen planus. Has anyone else had that and is it possible that my body has just expresses this auto immune problem in another form?", "Brazilian Wax? Anyone crazy enough to do a bikini wax? I shave sometimes for better sex with the hubby and its fine. When the hair frowns back it is a bit itchy. But I was wondering if anyone has tried wax? Would it injure my skin? I did it once and it was fine. Was not in a flare and I mentioned LS to tech so she would not freak, but she did not see anything. \n\nGrowing it back was pure itchy irritated hell and I am never doing that again. Softness bare was nice but the cushion is there for a reason \u2026 I need it!\n\nHair is out of bounds of typical LS effects, I am pretty sure. Would not do it if things are flared at that moment, but otherwise I think it is fine. Make sure you have enough hair for them to use to grab to yoink it out with. Laser hair removal was worth every penny! I have read sugar waxing is better for LS than regular waxing if you can find a place that does it. Shaving powder! Both waxing and laser are great for low maintenance smooth results. Both method will take many sessions for total hairless result, and also would require touch up sessions in the future. \nHowever both methods should be avoided if you have minor scratch looking LS.", "Just been diagnosed, I could really use some support and advice please :( Hi everyone. I discovered a small white patch on my genitals some months ago which I was scared was HPV. Hospital gyno said it was, but then two sexual health docs said it was not, but they could not tell me what it was. Just seen a hospital dermatologist and they have diagnosed me with LS. My symptoms are the small white patch, dry skin down there which is easily irritated, and often getting tearing down my perineum when I have sex. They have given me some steroid cream and told me I should moisturise and that I am not contagious, but that is about it. They were rushing because one of the other doctors had called in sick, so I did not get to ask any questions. I have done a bit of googling but from what I understand, this will not go away, I have it for life? So what does the cream do? Can it get worse? What is all this stuff I am reading about flare ups, what does that mean? What moisturiser should I be using? Why do I even have this? I am really scared, I have just started seeing someone and I do not want to not be able to be intimate, and I do not know how to tell them when I do not even understand it myself :(", "Did you stop having one night stands with LS?

If you use steroids how long do you have remission periods? What is the longest you have had between flares? months usually, however i did have a few years of remission at one point. I had some one time flings in the past, I just always explained that I tend to have discomfort at first and asked to start slow. It was never a problem, even if it is a one night stand the guy should still have the basic decency to want you to be comfortable.", "Epsom salt bath and moisture I read that Spain salt bags help LS. Maybe there is a simple answer if you should keep LS affected areas moisturized, how does an Epsom salt bath help - would not that dry it out?", "Struggling with intense itching for awhile now and no doctor will listen I am so confused. And I know this is similar to all the other posts so I am sorry if I am repeating things but I am struggling a lot. \n\nI have had the usual symptoms. Intense Itching. And a few months ago it was more around the anus and perianal skin. I have cracks on the perianal skin and when I do scratch, including the labia, I bleed immediately. And sex hurts. I cannot even think about it. I often end up just laying in bed with ice packs between my legs. \nBeen treated for yeast over and over again. Been tested for all STDs and was even told I have herpes. That came back negative so I switched soaps and detergents and such (was already using scent free/dye free and sensitive skin things though) at the doctors request. No change in symptoms. I went back to the doc and now it is, \u201coh... I think this is a wart. You have warts. Hpv.\u201d So now I am waiting for those results (never had an abnormal pap). I mentioned LS, which the doc mentioned a few appts ago, but she seemed set on her warts diagnosis. But confusingly she did prescribe me triamcinolone and it is the ONLY thing that has offered me any relief. \nWould this give me relief if it was HPV? I tried looking it up and only see that it should not be used for warts. \n\nI am so frustrated and ready to give up. I missed Christmas eve with my family last year because I was crying in bed with ice packs and trying not to scratch. \n\nAnd my bf is getting upset that they keep thinking STDs. And when the doc tested for herpes, it really put a strain on things. I know he knew it can lay doormat but I am sure he was worried I was cheating. \n\nLastly, they took a biopsy from the \u201cwart\u201d and I asked if they will look for other things too, which the doctor seemed annoyed that I was asking. The problem, my last appt was $300. And that did not include a biopsy. I am really worried that I will need additional appts/specialists just to get to the bottom of things and have someone listen to me. I cannot afford these appts. I work for a nonprofit in effing DC and my insurance apparently sucks for specialists/OBGYN outside of an annual. \n\nI am super lost and scared. I just want answers. But do not know how to get them when I cannot afford all these appts. And tests. \n\nNot sure what feedback I am asking for. Maybe just knowing I am not alone. \nI hope I get my biopsy results tomorrow...it is been a week. Write emails looking for knowledgeable, sympathetic physicians. I got these contact emails/numbers from ( DC is the home of this center so an email to them might point you in a better direction.\n\nI would also recommend taking a look at your lifestyle/diet and explore stress relief, anti-inflammatory, low oxalate eating options.\n\nJoining a clinical study might work for you, too.

I cannot express how surprised and thankful I was to see you did all this so soon after my post. I honestly posted out of anxiety hoping to get a call from the doctor tomorrow morning and I was not expecting this. Thank you. \n\nI do need to look more at diet. But I did start Orangetheory fitness basically a year ago and it is helpful with my mental health and I lost weight. I also told my doctor that when I work out I notice that I experience a lot of sweat/lubrication in the groin area and (tmi) my underwear gets pretty soaked. And it provides legit relief for that brief time frame...until I shower. \n\nI will have to look into the low oxalate diet more. \n\nAnd thanks again for all the info! Oh man. I am so sorry you are going through all of that. Sounds terrible. \n\nSounds also like the docs just do not know. It is awful, they do not know everything, they think they DO know everything, and they treat people who do not fit in a tidy box just horribly. Women with inexplicable pain or discomfort can go decades without help, continually minimally addressed. \n\nKeep advocating and speaking the truth. Ice packs on the vulva are not usually required. That is not normal. That is not even herpes, I do not think. They just do not KNOW, so they are making it up as they go along. \n\nKeep trying. If you really suspect LS, you can use the over the counter steroids,  but always be careful applying steroids to skin; frequent exposure is also permanently damaging to skin (... yay ...). But it is worth a try. Triamcinolone was enough to support me while pregnant. If it helps, do it.  And keep trying until you get a firm answer. \n\nMay also help to go to a doc appt with a log of what you felt (pain, itch), how badly, what day, and what helped it (bag of frozen peas while lying in bed crying for hours). Logs make docs happy. Sometimes. Maybe. \n\nGood luck, best wishes and hope for relief. Thanks for your response! I know it is not herpes (as the results came back negative... I did not even have sores). \n\nI am not sure why the ice packs help but I am guys it just calms down any inflammation happening/numbs the area so I get temporarily relief from the urge to scratch. \n\nI also have been logging my symptoms by simply marking the horrible days on my birth control packet. But I think you are point about having more detail would be very important and helpful. I will start doing that! \n\nThank you for your response. What kind of doctors are you seeing? It kind of sounds like you are seeing GYNs, so it might be time to see a Dermatologist. That is where I have gotten the best care, although I was diagnosed initially by my GYN. Sidebar: if it is LS, and the fact that you find relief when lubricated; apply a barrier cream/oil daily! Coconut oil works. See if it offers some comfort. I am so sorry you are going through this. Getting a diagnosis and waiting for results can be so stressful. It sounds like you are doing a lot of the right things already to alleviate symptoms. Here are some more things you might try/ask about:\n\u2022 Ask your doc for some topical lidocaine - this can be really handy when the pain/itching is intense\n\u2022 Seek out a gynodermatologist, if possible, or a dermatologist with gyno experience - yes, most likely a specialist and may be difficult for insurance, but perhaps getting a referral from your doc would help with that? In the long run, seeing a specialist usually leads to fewer visits, which can also offset costs.\n\u2022 Get a bidet attachment on your toilet seat ($40 on Amazon is fine) - you will not regret it. Keeping the undercarriage (my term \ud83d\ude09) super clean is important and not wiping the area with dry paper ever again is such a relief!\n\u2022 For fissures, try a little emu oil  - it will not sting or hurt and helps things heal very quickly. You can also use this as a barrier/spreader for your topical meds. Hey, this time last year I was experiencing exactly what you are experiencing. I told my doctor that it maybe LS and she gave me a cream which did an amazing job. Now I am free of all symptoms/issues. \n\nI will add the name of the cream in a few hours (I am away from home atm). Also I only used the cream a handful of times and used emu oil for the tears. In less that 28 days I was healed.", "When i wipe there is almost always blood, help :( So im having a flare up right now, i am using clobetasol for the first time (have been using for a few weeks) but whenever i wipe my butt there is little tears and there is blood. Is there anything i can do to help this? I use wet wipes at home and that helps a little but when im out i dont have any. It honestly does not hurt that bad but im worried this will worsen the healing process. Is this inevitable with clobetasol use? I heard it thins the skin. Hi, this happens to me during flares. it is not from the clob - it is from LS, which also makes the skin thin and easy to tear. I would be cautious when using wet wipes; my gyno told me that they could actually dry out and exacerbate LS. \n\nWhen it gets this bad, I usually take a shower after a BM. and a good tip from after my punch biopsy is to use a squirt bottle filled with water. works like a bidet. I agree that it is prbly not Clob at all.  Perineal bottles on Amazon help rinse after bm.  Keep moist down there with oil of your choice.  I like coconut. If you have only been using clob for a couple weeks then I doubt it is from the clob. It can thin your skin, but it is not inevitable, and those side effects can usually be avoided with careful use. \n\nLS itself can definitely promote anal tears, though. I used to get them a lot, long before I knew I had LS.  Constipation and tense/strained bowel movements can definitely exacerbate them, so do what works for you to have softer poops (water, fiber, exercise, etc) and to relax when you go (many people find reading relaxing; DuoLingo works wonders for me). I also wet the toilet paper under the sink so I do not have to wipe as many times. If I do not do that, it is like I cannot get 100% clean and I have to use a lot of friction, and there is just nothing like rubbing poo into chafed skin to cause a lot of irritation. (I also have perianal psoriasis though, and everyone is body is different, so I am just speaking for myself here.) Before I started working from home, I carried a little spray bottle in my purse when I went to the bathroom. I guess wet wipes are like a version of that, but I would be careful about the ones that you get, since lots of ingredients can be drying or irritating. \n\nI would also suggest you mention it to your doctor, just in case it could be a medication side effect or something serious, or in case they want to prescribe something special for your butt, like tacrolimus. My derm wrote tacrolimus for my butt (before we knew I had LS, just for the psoriasis) because it is \"better for the type of skin there.\" If you are not renting, consider installing a bidet in your home, it can make a huge difference.", "CAR-T cell therapy successfully used against Systemic Lupus Erythematosus autoimmune disease  Anyone know if this type of treatment or other cell therapy could be used to treat LS?", "New diagnosis (18F) Hello everybody, I am new to this subreddit. I was diagnosed with LS a few weeks ago, and I do not really know what to think anymore. I went to the ob/gyn with issues with tearing and bleeding during sex. You can imagine my disappointment when she told me that I would have to deal with it my entire life. My boyfriend is very supportive and has always been okay with me taking breaks from sex due to the pain, but now I cannot even bring myself to feel sexy around him. The scarring is so advanced at this point I do not think I will ever be able to have sex normally like my horny teenager brain wants me to. I do not think this illness is disgusting, but I somehow feel disgusting and broken for having it. I was prescribed clobetasol and have a follow up appointment in a few days. I am not sure if it is working, as I do not feel anything different like she said I would as the steroid cream started working. I really do not have anybody to talk to about this. Any advice or understanding would be very much appreciated. I was diagnosed at around 19 after tearing during sex as well. I am with you in that my boyfriend has always been so supportive and kind. I find it too painful to have penetrative sex, and we have found many ways to get around it. There are so many things you can do sexually besides penetrative sex that will not cause pain and still feel just as good for both of you (probably better for you even considering you will not be in pain!). When I was first diagnosed I was just as horrified as you, but the clobetasol usually helps keep it at bay. Does it suck? Yes. It sucks. But I promise it is not the end of the world. Try not to read too much online about it - lots of horror stories and just depressing stuff. You are not alone in being diagnosed so young and it will all be okay. Hoping this helps you to feel at least a little less alone and a little bit better. Best wishes :) Sucks but it is really great you were heard and got a diagnosis so young. I did not until my 30s -  but I should have been diagnosed at 18, definitely.  Years and years of pain and skin that will not come back. \n\nClobetasol is absolutely a lifesaver for me. In my 40s now. Totally manageable. There might be days where things are bad, but usually it is just a few days here and there and it is not a big deal. Everybody\u2019s different, but it ended years of agony within two weeks. Night and day. \n\nExcellent opportunity for you both to work on your oral skills, in my opinion. Today for you, tomorrow me! \n\nWelcome to a club nobody wanted to join. I hope you get some relief and feel well again soon! I am 25 and also feel very alone, like no one understands how draining it truly is! My boyfriend also is very supportive. Thank you for your comment! It made me feel a lot better. Do you still experience tearing while not having an episode? Thank you. I have definitely been reading up a bit too much about it online. I think once you get yourself healed your sex drive will return.  Right now, with the pain sex produced, it is no wonder that you have lost it right now.  The thing about the topical steroid treatment is that it can take weeks (and in rare cases months) to get healed to the point of resuming sex.  The important thing to remember is that when you tear, it creates scarring when it heals, and scars do not stretch like normal skin, so that creates a tighter area more likely to tear again.  So you might want to take it real slow when resuming, maybe a change in positions like you being on top for more control.  Just MHO.  Wishing you the best of luck.  \n\n\n (", "Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus Webinar by Dr Andrew Goldstein and Dr Jill Krapf of the Centers for Vulvovaginal Disorders (\n\nThis up-to-date webinar presented by Dr. Andrew Goldstein and Dr. Jill Krapf from the Center for Vulvovaginal Disorders reviews the most current information on vulvar lichen sclerosus, including diagnosis, treatment, and research.

Perhaps if it was her clit she would have been Great video, learned a few more technical things. thank you for posting!! Wow, about 90% of that scared the heck out of me but the other 10% was super interesting lol. Thanks for sharing. My partner watched it too to understand better.

My symptoms are not as bad but I worry about the future. I would love to go to their center in NYC. They do not take any insurances though. Shame. I am also 31 and just diagnosed. I only have occasional itching. Very minor. And have had my white spots for as long as I can remember. I have been to the gyno every year since 17. And just switched and she wanted to biopsy it. Crazy how undetected it goes! Thank you! I never knew that soaking the area or rubbing in clob for 90s was so recommended until now ;-; same with the time to use clob (4-6 weeks every day then 4 weeks every other day etc, my gyno told me 4 weeks then to do it twice a week!) The soaking and rubbing are important.  The dosing frequency is individualized.  It is best to follow the recommendations of your doctor who has evaluated you on that. Yeah! I ordered a sitz bath just to make sure I start soaking as I only have a shower so have never soaked it before ;-; if I knew I would have ages ago\n\nMakes sense! I am currently dosing for a flare so will likely speak to my doctor about what to do next soon", "Recently Diagnosed. Hey you all. I was recently diagnosed with LS via punch biopsy. I went undiagnosed for about 4 years, and started noticing symptoms when I was 14. (I am 18 now) I am a bit confused by my diagnosis because my LS patches only present on my knees and ankles. I do not have any near my genital region. \nHowever I am honestly really concerned about it appearing on or near my genitals region. Is this possible even if I only have it on my knees/ankles? \nCan I make these patches go away at all? I was prescribed dapsone and elidell pimecrolimus cream and have been on each for about a month and half now, but I have not noticed any of it going away. I was also told by my dermatologist that light box therapy could help? Sounds like you have got a diagnosis, which is great! I am not familiar with non-genital patches so that is definitely a question for your dermatologist. \n\nAs far as getting rid of them, I am also not sure but I am curious to know if you were having pain or itching on the patches before the cream? Has anything changed with them? i was not having any pain or itching before i was given the cream and medication. they just kind of sit there. i sadly have not noticed any changes with the new medicine/cream. :( There are other Lichen named auto immune problems. Are you sure it is Lichen Sclerosus not Lichen plants or another? \n\n\n yep. i am sure. like i said i had a biopsy done. Yes I am sure they said that. I had a biopsy on a growth cut out of my thumb. At my post Op visit the surgeon read the report out load then said, \"No that is wrong\" then had it re examined and sure enough they made a mistake. It happens. What medication and cream or ointment did they give you.\nSteroid ointment is normal treatment.  I use Betamethasone ointment but clobetasol seems to be very common. i was shown the lab reports and was told i have Lichen Sclerosus (et atrophicus) since i do not have it on my genitalia. however my biopsy did conclude i have LS just on other parts of my body. i even asked if they were sure it was right considering i read that people mainly have it on or around their genitals. and they said they were 100% sure it is LS. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f i was given elidell pimecrolimus cream Sorry I forgot you posted that originally. \nI do not think anyone on this LS forum has reported using this since I have been on here.\n\nElidel\u00a0Cream\u00a0is used to treat eczema (atopic dermatitis). It works by suppressing the activity of certain immune cells that cause inflammation (redness and swelling) of the skin.\u00a0\n\nDo you have the white scar tissue patches that Lichen Sclerosus is named for. OK but do you have the white scar tissue the LS is named for ? (In Latin) yes. i do I was diagnosed when I was 8. I had white patches on my ankles, knees and genital region. My dermatologist  had me put an ointment on it until all the white spots turned brown. I am 20 now and still have my LS scars on my ankles and knees. \n\nMy best advice to you would do everything your doctor tells you to and keep a very close watch on your genital area. If you see any white at all, call the doctor and get in as soon as you can. if i see any spots i will make sure to tell my derm straight away. thank you :)", "Need some advice using clobetasol Diagnosed with scrotal dermatitis (Lichen simplex chronicus of the scrotum). Was diagnosed after suffering for more than 2 years. So my lichen simplex is advanced. Though it technically falls under eczema, I feel lichen simplex chronicus shares a lot more with lichen sclerosus. I was prescribed pimecrolimus a month ago and i have been using it regularly, but the progress (i see some) is still slow. Maybe it is the extent of lichenifcation. In any case, I am thinking of trying clobetasol propionate for a very short time - 1 week or less. Is 1 week of clobetasol too much already to get steroid withdrawal if I stop? Or should I taper it down after that from 1 week twice a day to alternate days and then once a week and then stop? Please let me know what you think. TIA A lot of us do not see progress until using clobetasol for at least 3 months, nevermind a week. I do not think steroid withdrawal should be a concern as long as a proper routine was given by your doctor. \n\nI used clobetasol twice a day for a month, once a day for 2 months, every other day for 3 months, now I use it twice a week for maintenance. LSC is slightly different from LS, so consult with your doctor but 1 week of anything sounds far too short. Thanks for your reply. So that is twice a week for life? Or are you planning to stop at some point? \n\nEdit: I want to use it to get the thickening of the skin down a bit. More the skin thickness, more itching. it is driving me crazy. That is why i want to get it down a bit. Twice a week for life, but lichen sclerosus is for life and cannot be cured only managed (I feel cured as long as I stick to my maintenance regimen) I believe that lichen simplex is not for life and can be cured, but perhaps you may have certain triggers that cause it to return at any point. Just speaking out loud, but sounds like you will be able to stop at some point but may take you just as long to find relief Tapering is actually pretty straight forward, once the skin seems reasonably healed halve your dose every few weeks or month. If you have made progress you wont want to lose it, so tapering is pretty natural.", "Does clob suppress the immune system? I have heard mixed things and need to know if I am higher risk for COVID for a job. \ud83d\ude2c Found this online.\nClobetasol works by decreasing your body\u2019s response to inflammation. It also reduces the activity of your immune system. This prevents inflammation and itching and treats your skin condition. I was told by my dermatologist that is only suppressed in the area is it applied. So the skin affected by LS is at greater risk of infection, but not the entire immune system. Likely different if you were using it is a big/exposed area. I would check with your doctor though for sure.", "The white patches can go away? Hi! I am 22 yo female with diabetes type 1. I wasnt diagnosed, but my gynecologist thinks I have diabetic vulvovaginitis or yeast infection. Second one is really doubtful because 2 gynecologists said that they dont see it and tests showed the same. So my fear is that I have LS. My endocrinologist said that it could be either LS, oncology (which I dont have because I got my tests for it too) or allergic dermatitis (I am very sensitive and have been like this ever since I was a child) So i have burning sensation and like pulsation for 2 months now, but no itching. It gets worse when it is hot down there, also I am kind of dry. I have redness under my clit and all over labia minora too. Also after like month and 3 weeks I got some kind of not very smooth skin that looks like I have been scratching on it but I did not. Plus like blisters or bumps of skin which is pink as well and feels like burning when I am touching it (its located near vaginal opening) But the thing is I kind of had the barely pink color skin on my vaginal opening for 2-4 days and it just disappeared when I started to moisturize my vulva. Plus I have started advantan ointment 4 days ago. It got better but this ointment was prescribed to me to help with inflammation. Anything you can say on my case will be appreciated! Thank you! Did you have a biopsy done? If you do have LS it does not go away it can be under control and that is why the redness and irritation goes away. No. They have not offered to do it and I did not know that it can be done :( also in my country we dont have enough good specialists Yes that is the only way to really know if you have it or not. But do you know if white patches from LS can go away at some point? They do settle down yes after going on some medications In my case (male, i have LS on the glans) the patches started getting smaller after applying a corticosteroids creme for a few weeks and regularly using a skin balm. They are not completely gone but there is a noticable difference. Thank you for the answer! I was scrolling this entire forum to understand whether I have the symptoms or not, but my patch (I would not even call it that way just entire anatomical structure has changed color) and it got better after applying antiseptic+antibacterial cream with E vitamins and then steroid ointment helped too with it and with redness Mine was a classic figure 8 and it is completely back to normal!\n\n\nEdit to add - I got diagnosed about a year or so ago? It is a blur lol. But I barely have to use clob now bc it is in remission. Congrats! That is awesome! Have you been diagnosed by biopsy? Yup! He said we caught mine at the very early stages of it. I have not gotten a biopsy done. My ob/gyn said that it can be diagnosed with a visual assessment. I have started a medium grade steroid 2 weeks ago. Is a biopsy necessary? It can be but it gives you more of definitive answer", "Please can anyone help, i am losing the will to live Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this.

Took a tablet for possible pinworms, no luck either. \n\nThe itching makes me want to pull my hair out, it drives me crazy and wakes me up in the night. \n\nToday I have properly looked and noticed a definite whitening around the vaginal and anal opening. it is not one specific white spot, but more a general white ring. \n\nI have tried everything to help and at this point i am so fed up. i feel like it is never going to end and is ruining my life. doctors seem to be pretty hopeless, so i would appreciate if anyone can help me :( Have you been diagnosed with LS? If you have, I am surprised you have not been prescribed Clobetasol. Using that religiously really, truly helps. The treatment has long term down sides, but when you experience itching the way we do, the trade-off is absolutely worth it. If you have not been diagnosed, tell them you want a biopsy of that skin done and tested for LS asap. I am so sorry you have not been supported or cared for properly! Dermatologist!! I recommend calling a few places and asking if they do skin biopsies for lichen scleroses testing. Just give them a general outline of your symptoms, and they should be able to confirm or deny if they do the procedure/redirect you to someone who can. Lichen scleroses is a skin condition, which is why dermatologists are better suited to help you, and it can only be diagnosed via biopsy. However, if you convey the severity of your symptoms and unrest, you might be able to get prescribed the steroid cream. The steroid cream is a LIFE SAVER. It strengthens the skin and stops the itching, so you might be able to secure a prescription before/without a biopsy based on the account of your symptoms. \n\nPlease stay strong! I hope you are able to ease your suffering soon. I wish you the best! Agree with this also, you need to get a biopsy down but in the meantime do not use soaps on your genitals when showering and get this cream to help with healing and stops itching:  Your story really resonates with me. I had several months of extreme itching and brush offs by medical types, until I got to a dermatologist who properly diagnosed LS. You may want to consider asking for a course of oral prednisone , as a way to break the cycle of irritation and damage. You should not do much oral prednisone, but I wonder if one course would help you. Please do not give up. I will be thinking of you and hoping for a good outcome. How are you now? I am doing great. My LS is fully under control. I also have lichen planus in my mouth, and I have to have dental work done soon, not going to lie, I am not looking forward to that. Stretching my cheeks usually causes a flair up, so I am really hitting the oral topical steroids hard in hopes of avoiding the worst of it.\n\nI cannot stress enough the need for you to see a dermatologist who is experienced in LS. Do not beg for help, demand it! Demand a biopsy. Anything less is a brush off and you deserve better.\n\nAlso, stress management is a big part of this. I know it is tough, but it is a crucial part of calming your body's reactions. It is part of the package. Good luck, friend. Thank you so much for your reply, honestly sometimes it is a comfort in itself knowing someone else understands the same struggle. I feel so dramatic saying it is ruining my life but it genuinely is, I have literally been in tears with it for the last hour out of pure frustration. How did you know that it was LS/ to see a dermatologist as opposed to a different diagnosis? did you have the typical white spots? I am just really lost as to whether i have LS or not...thanks for the idea about the prednisone i will definitely look into that...did anything help your itching before you got LS medication prescribed? so glad to hear you are doing better now, thanks so much again for all the help. i was itching for two years before i got diagnosed, it is miserable No i have not been diagnosed with it! I have just been running out of options of what this could be, and I felt like I could relate to a lot of the LS symptoms...i have heard a lot about that cream working wonders so hopefully i can get some! Did you get yours after a biopsy was done? thank you so much for your help! Thank you sooo much for such great advice ! I was definitely thinking the same thing about the cream, I feel like when I go to the doctors again they are just going to brush it off and say there is not enough evidence to be given the cream...is it clobetasol you use? It sounds amazing - too good to be true! I desperately need something to ease the itchiness ... thank you so much for the kindness i really appreciate it X it is horrible is not it :( Are you feeling better now? Be firm with your desire for diagnosis! Doctors have a tendency to disbelieve women about symptoms. You have to be persistent, because if something is causing you distress, it cannot be ignored. Also, yes! I use clobetasol cream. It is a godsend, and I hope you are able to get prescribed the right medication. Tell me about it...it is unbelievable how much your problems can get brushed under the carpet as something simple or whatever\u2019s the easiest diagnosis! Were you able to get clobetasol only after a biopsy? I am just concerned it is going to take me a while to get passed from a GP to a dermatologist and eventually to get a diagnosis but i cannot go on like this! I was diagnosed recently, been dealing with symptoms for over a year... it was extremely frustrating doctors kept saying it was a yeast infection than kept saying everything was fine (test would always come back negative). I saw a different doctor and as soon as she did a physical exam she diagnosed me with LS...You should go see a dermatologist to get a proper diagnosis. There is a few doctors that are not familiar with this condition and may not give you the proper diagnosis. I saw over 5 doctors and they were all telling me that everything was fine until I eventually got a doctor that knew about LS.  I hope things get better for you\u2764\ufe0fDo not give up! It gets better trust me!:) I was actually given the prescription a couple weeks before I had the biopsy. They only gave me prescription refill permission after the diagnosis. However, I did not go to a dermatologist, so they might have a different procedure to follow. Ahhh I see, so did you get diagnosed at a GP then? What was your experience with the biopsy? I would feel really anxious about having one...but it is good to know you managed to get a prescription beforehand Yes, I did! Although I must admit, I occasionally borrowed some from my mom, pre-diagnosis. I have had it since childhood. I am 22 and as soon as I started birth control I was itching from my vulva to my anus like crazy for 7 months, and same thing kept getting brushed off as yeast infections. I went to FOUR specialists which led to no diagnosis, but LS was my last option. I have not been officially diagnosed, but I went to a walk in clinic and demanded clobetrasol(the ointment for LS) because I could not take the itch anymore and I was so certain. I did a ton of research about the ointment beforehand and a typical treatment plan because I know it is such a strong steroid cream, but I am already feeling relief after a week. I have an appointment with a vulvar disorder gyno in a month and a LS specialist in 3 months to really confirm everything yes i felt better after two days of using clob I went to planned parenthood, because I assumed I had an infection or STD due to the itch. Luckily, they understood what the issue was, and they had someone able to perform the biopsy. The biopsy itself was not too bad. They inject a local anesthetic, and the procedure is over within minutes. The pain is not bad at all. The aftercare is pretty grueling, as you have to keep the site very clean and avoid any chemicals  (like soap or antibiotics) as it heals. It heals pretty quick, though, and the scarring is very minimal. I can only find the scar on myself because I know where the biopsy took place. I still thought it was a skin infection, but after 2 different treatment for staph (that I tested negative for BTW), I took myself to my dermo, who looked and described it to me, and took a biopsy. Yes, there are white spots, in my mouth, too. \n\nI do not know about where you are, but getting in to see specialist around here is a nightmare. I would strongly suggest that to emphasize the extreme nature of your problem and that you will take any cancelation. Here is some short term things to help until you can get the clobetasol.\n\nAt bedtime, take Benadryl to help you forget about the itching.\n\nGet borax powder ( usually at Home Depot I am cleaning aisle, or a drugstore, sometimes at a grocery store). Dissolve 1 tablespoon in a hot bath of about two inches of water. Sit sideways in the bath, cross cross, everything spread out. Pat dry afterwards. Eventually increase to 2 tablespoons of needed\n\nTry diaper rash cream\n\nUse \u201cWater wipes\u201d instead of TP. You can find them In The baby section\n\nGo without underwear at bedtime and whenever convenient\n\nSwitch to all cotton panties, check out Jockey brand on amazon\n\nUse  a laundry detergent like All Free and Clear. Do not use fabric softener or sheets \n\nHopefully this will take the edge off until you can see a doc. If they are not familiar with it, ask them right there and then to look it up. Hugs! Did you stop the birth control? Any improvement after stopping? It is so annoying to keep having it brushed off as yeast infections!! I am so glad you have managed to have relief from such a horrible thing, maybe i need to demand some too!! You are amazing! thanks so much for such lovely words...it is unbelievably frustrating to keep having it brushed off as a yeast infection. I am so happy for you that you finally managed to get a diagnosis and are doing better, that gives me hope! lots of love \ud83d\udc9c I stopped the combo pill and switched to the mini pill. It is only been 2 months so it is hard to say but I think it is calming things down. It can take so long for the body to adjust again Curious to know how you are doing now? How did your doc visit go? thanks for asking, i am still struggling with this :( the doc visit was no help, just brushed it off as thrush. really fed up of it now! Try to push for a biopsy. Just getting the results takes 6 weeks. I went through the same experience as you, my gyno told me I have LS and I am waiting on biopsy results. Even after using the steroid ointment I am still having some symptoms that will not go away, no white patches though. Better go get a straight answer. I have also seen that skin yeast is a thing. Keep us updated and best of luck! Have you tried seeing a Physio therapist for pelvic floor dysfunction? This also causes vaginal burning. Try changing your diet i am not sure whether i think it is LS tbh as i have not got any discolouration now, everything looks \u2018normal\u2019 apart from some irritation so the doctor did not seem to think it could be LS. i have got no burning either just the itching, so it looks like i am back to square 1 again :/ thank you so much for all your advice...what is skin yeast ?? what kind of thing would i change it to? If you do not have discoloration, it is probably less likely skin yeast. (pityriasis versicolor) I also do not have any discoloration, and have itching as well. Anyway, best of luck and I really hope you can get down to the bottom of this! did you have white patches to start with before you started your medication? And thank you so much honestly, really kind of you! Nope \u2014 no white patches, even before the ointment. Dairy, and anything gluten triggered an autoimmune response in my body, which then resulted in lichen (which itself is an autoimmune disease). Get a food allergy test / allergy test and see what you are sensitive to and avoid it. In general, just try to eat more healthy and avoid processed foods, and using soaps that can irritate your skin. Honestly what you change your diet to depends on you and what foods your body reacts negatively to. You are what you eat", "How did you figure out your VLS triggers? I cannot pinpoint mine\u2026  By experimenting with one variable at a time. It is always spinach and dairy for me Great question. Most folks with vulvar LS tend to fall into three main trigger categories: hormones, stress, and diet.\n\nMy recommendation is to track your symptoms and lifestyle for a bit. Hopefully, when you have enough data, you can start to better understand what is a trigger for you as we are all so individualized.\n\nSome are triggered by foods, but I can eat anything and it does not cause a flare.  \n\nIf you have never done symptom tracking, try this free symptom tracker: ( \\- you can DL it as an Excel file or Google sheet and then modify it to add your own custom columns.  Hope this helps! Wow ty so much!!!!! I am convinced I have had this since i was 6\u2026always complaining of burning It is very possible. Children can get it and when they do it is often present before puberty then goes away a bit and rears its head in adulthood. Not drinking enough water for me. Urine is more concentrated and burns when I wee. Basic right? I am guilty of this. Good tip. Ty Hormones are definitely the biggest thing because I flare before my period. Intense stress does not help either. I do not think I am hugely sensitive to any one food but eating junk or boozing too much does not help. Do you think if I go back on hormonal BC to stop my period it would help? Might be worth asking your GP! I am not on hormonal BC as I find it can mess with my mental health a bit but other posters might have more experience? Me too, that is why I am not on anything lol Food and hormones are huge for me. Specifically dairy and Chinese Food. I try to eat out as little as possible. Keeping a diary of when you have a flare up and writing down what you would eaten within the past 48 hours may help you see a pattern. I use the Flo app to track my period and that is helpful when having a flare up I can look and see what point in my cycle I am at and I usually flare up around the same time in my cycle Yes, i use that app! Very helpful! Anyone find sitting for long periods of time does it?", "If this does not affect the vagina, why does sex (PIV) hurt? Hi! Im 31, F, and I suspect I have lichen sclerosus. I have had symptoms for about four years, and the first time I went to the gyno (in 2018) she told me she thought it was herpes (even though I did not have itching or blisters). After a negative result, I brought up LS and she said I was too young to have it.\n\nMy main symptoms are pain (burning, dry sensations) during sex. Immediately afterwards, I get tiny cuts on my vulva and near my clit. I also noticed my vulva was pretty pale and I was not sure if that was normal. If I am not having sex, I do not feel any symptoms other than bleeding after pooping which I think could be LS.\n\nI am wondering why sex hurts for me with penetration if the LS should not affect the inside of the vagina?\n\nAlso, how soon after starting the ointment can I have sex? I am already planning on using lube and taking it easy.\n\nI have an appointment with the gyno tomorrow and hopefully she will take me seriously and prescribe me the ointment, since it seems like I have a classic case.\n\nThank you all! Are you experiencing pain inside or just the burning and tearing on your vulva? Are you having internal pain during sex then? As that could be linked to something else rather than LS (endo, ovarian cysts etc)\n\nIf you are talking about pain in general, when I first had LS symptoms sex was excruciating, it felt like down there was being cut open with glass whenever penetration happened. The perineal area was most affected with my LS (including the bottom of the entrance to my vagina) so the area was rubbed during penetration which caused friction and tears/bleeding. From your symptoms a similar thing could be happening if the pain feels external/shallow inside rather than deeper inside.\n\nAlso, you are certainly not too young to have it! I would suggest getting a second opinion if the gyno says a similar thing (hopefully not) because I was diagnosed at 19, and have heard from other 20 year olds on this sub too. It is certainly less common in younger people but it is not impossible. The earlier you get it treated the better. \n\nIn my personal case sex got totally back to normal a few months after using the ointment, but I started doing stuff a few weeks after using it and I did experience pain upon entry but once the skin had stretched it was okay, certain positions were a no-go but once we found what worked we could do stuff and it was not painful, sometimes it would feel friction-ish but not as bad as before. Then once it healed more I have pretty much no problems, I will get the occasional time where in a position i feel more friction so will move etc but it is amazing how much better it is compared to the start. I would also recommend whilst you treat yourself with the ointment doing perineal massage because this prevents the tissue getting too stiff and risking tearing when you try to have sex again, I will do it every few days in the shower and have been since the start and think it really helps. It is honestly hard to tell because the comment below got me thinking that I could have LS near the opening, which would make sense as to why it hurts with the friction! I definitely have burning and tearing on my vulva too, because oral sex felt uncomfortable after penetration. Thank you so much for your response!\n\nI was diagnosed with PCOS as a teenager, but I thought it was under control. I am going to ask her to check it out too.\n\nI took a bunch of pictures the day after I had sex and I see that below the entrance of my vagina is pale and had those \u201cpaper cuts\u201d, so I could also be experiencing LS.\n\nI do not experience any pain when putting in tampons or menstrual cups, so I am thinking it is the friction too.\n\nDo you find LS makes you more dry? I cannot tell if it is the pain or if that was a problem on its own. Either way, I will use more lube next time. Thanks again for your help. I was terrified when I realized I could have this, but it seems treatable. I cannot wait to have painless sex again. Of course!\n\nMakes sense, I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 18 but then undiagnosed and told I have cystic ovaries so Ik I have problems in that department too but am not too sure haha\n\nTaking pictures is a really good idea! Mine was very similar - the paper cuts which bled, the skin getting really sore etc. Now those are all gone and I do have a patch of skin that is white now but I would rather that than the cuts, it is just a different texture now (not much of it, a few cm) but it does not hurt or anything! But yeah, I would recommend taking pictures every month or so minimum just to keep track of what everything looks like so you can spot any drastic changes. \n\nBut yeah it could be the friction then, to be honest I have surprisingly not had problems with dryness, I think because me and my partner do a lot of foreplay beforehand etc, if we did not then I imagine that I would have issues. At the start if I did want to try and have sex to see how things were feeling then I would still use lube just in case. Either way lube is always a good option!\n\nAnd yeah ;-; I do still get upset about it sometimes, having to apply ointment every day etc is inconvenient but then I am also like it could be worse I suppose. I think the lack of solid knowledge I have been able to get from doctors made it very scary too but speaking to others going through the same thing does help a lot and is reassuring! It is really horrible to not be able to have sex/enjoy stuff like that, it honestly made me reconsider having kids in the future because it made me realise how much I enjoy being able to have sex without pain/issues! Still pretty sure I want them haha but not being able to pee without it stinging made me feel so sorry for those who have had to have stitches down there etc This happens to me as well. My doc said the skin affected by LS gets less supple and less flexible, so is prone to tearing. My body has started to associate sex with pain so I also get very tense and that can cause the burning pain too. It is a hell of a disease. I did get prescribed estrogen cream to help with the condition of my skin, it makes it more normal and elastic. You should ask your doctor about that option too! You are not too young to have LS. I am close to your age and I have it. It is less common in our age group but it absolutely happens. My first derm said something similar- \"this is something old ladies get, so it is very unlikely and we have to do a biopsy.\" I refused the biopsy and I saw a different derm, and she said there was no doubt it was LS as soon as she saw it. (I am not against biopsies per se, but I felt my case was pretty obvious on sight and I wanted to avoid biopsy if I could.)\n\nAs others said, the pain could be from your vulva, especially the entrance to your vagina, getting friction or stretching with penetration. (That is the case for me.) But if you do have pain and itching inside the vagina, you could have lichen planus, which is a similar condition that usually affects the vagina itself along with the vulva. (And of course many more common things cause vaginal symptoms, like yeast infections.)\n\nThe bleeding after bowel movements could be LS-related. I get that sometimes, too, since childhood. Check with your doc but if your perianal area is affected, you should probably be putting the ointment there, too. But if it was actually hemorrhoids or something than I could imagine steroids maybe making it worse, so definitely ask. \n\nAs for when you can have sex, you just have to listen to your body. If on a given day penetration feels fine, go for it. If it hurts, pursue alternatives (oral, outercourse, whatever else you like). Either way, be generous with the lube. You are describing my symptoms perfectly. I was not dry to begin with, so I was confused as to why I was still getting these cuts and bruising after sex.\n\nHonestly, as long as the ointment works and it does not give me long-term side effects, I am okay with it!\n\nI felt the same way about having kids, but I saw a few posts here of women who gave birth without any issues since they were treated properly. It made me feel so much better! I will bring up the estrogen cream too! Does it have any long-term bad side effects? Is it okay to take if I am not menopausal? I will check with my doc too. My doctor did not mention any - it is just a topical medication so the hormonal effect apparently stays pretty localized and it is not a high dose of estrogen either. I am only 29 so it is definitely okay for non-menopausal people! Thanks for sharing! The inside of my vagina does not hurt after sex. I am totally fine as long as there is no penetration, so I am thinking it is LS.  I also do not get yeast infections. Thanks again for your reply. Awesome, thanks! It really does help me feel so much better knowing it affects other people around my age range. And that is great to know that it is a low dose! Yeah ;-; it honestly sucks and I am sorry you are having to go through it! At least I can tell you that there is hope. To be fair that did make me remember that at the start I would not have dryness issues but I think from a mental standpoint because I was so anxious that it was going to be painful/sad that I did not get to enjoy it anymore it did affect me physically and meant I would be less relaxed/less likely to get wet etc. So it could be some similar if you feel the same way, Ik for myself when I am not 100% mentally my body does not cooperate. \n\nYeah! I have been using it for almost a year now and it is done so much good for me, from what I have researched any side affects are minimal compared to the symptoms when they are not treated. \n\nSame here, it is definitely nice knowing that it is something that is possible. I even read a study that said that some people\u2019s symptoms can go into remission during pregnancy so maybe that is something to look forward to! Obviously may not happen to everyone but it would definitely be nice. If you have facebook there is a super active, super supportive private group on there that has TONS of young people like us with LS. It is helped answer so many of my questions. If you are curious it is called Lichen Sclerosis/Sclerosus - A Five-Star LS Support Group Thank you! I will look into it! Probably near the opening, still vulva tissue. Just popping in to mention some other possibilities, frequently if you have one disorder down below you will also have another. Pelvic Floor Dysfunction can cause internal pain during sex, sometimes a condition like LS that causes pain on the exterior can make your muscles become chronically tense and clench up on contact, causing internal pain. Also if it is more like a burning/friction pain inside and you also have a lot of discharge it could be desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. I have all three of these if you have more questions. Thanks! I do not experience any odd discharge, thankfully. I honestly never experience any issues with my vagina unless I am having sex, so I am thinking it is more of the vulva that is being affected. \n\nAlso, my doctor prescribed me with clobetasol! She wanted to do an official biopsy to confirm it, but I want to see if the ointment works first Good luck, hope you feel better soon!", "Anyone mistaken LS for a long term fungal/yeast infection?  Yeah. Locally I could not see any obgyns- they had gatekeeper nurse practitioners, all the practices did. I saw each of them. Each said it is yeast, each was a horrible human being in how dismissive she was. They all accused me of lying, exaggerating, and all told me it is yeast and no big deal and there is definitely nothing else wrong. The only thing that varied was the additional insult. One thought I should take up marathon running like she did. Another, that I should quit working to take care of my kid. Etc. And NONE of them would \u201clet\u201d me through to see the doctor. \n\nOne day I sat down and had an enormous split. I thought my baby tear had ripped open (fifteen months after he was born). I called the obgyn again. They tried to book me with the nurse practitioner in 18 months and I lost it crying and screaming, I have never done that before or since but I could not handle it. \n\nThey got me in that week with a real doctor, who took one look and yelled at me - why had I not come sooner! It is so obvious, it is awful, it is so wrong, classic figure eight, etc.  \n\nI had been trying for a long time, I did not think it was yeast, but I could not get anyone to believe me until it was horrific. \n\nThank goodness clobetasol was very effective. Years of cruelty at the hands of nurse practitioners, ended in two weeks. \n\nEvery time somebody tells me nurse practitioners are as good as doctors I get very very very angry. I am so sorry.    I guess I was just BLESSED .. BECAUSE I had a nurse practitioner.   She had me see the DOCTOR, HE HAD ME GET A BIOPSY BY the Gynecologist ..she said she has been a gyno for 30 yrs.  And yes this definitely looks like LS. WORST CASE she has ever seen. (The only comfort in that knowledge was that it validated what was feeling) . so bad that Gyno had me see a DERMATOLOGIST TO confirm it in and around my rectum too....i saw him... It was humiliating.... But it was all confirmed. \nRecently, I had a massive YEAST INFECTION ALONG WITH A BAD FLARE UP OF LS. DR. prescribed : \"FLUCONAZOLE TABLET USP\" \nOMG.....OMG....OMG....THE MIRACLE PILL... I ONLY TOOK ONE PILL FOR 3 DAYS. IT NOT ONLY HELPED THE YEAST INFECTION ON MY PANTY LINE AND BOOB AREA, BUT IT TOTALLY HELPED MY LS. \nTWO days after I took those everything flared up. I told how that worked...so she prescribed 1/day for 3days...and 1 a week for 12 weeks. I will go back for a follow up to see how IT is working with one PILL a week. So far, I have NOT HAD TO PUT THE NASTY CLOB..OR NIASTATIN, ETC. IM IN TEARS THINKING ABOUT IT. ADK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT IT. Omg I know exactly what you mean about dismissive medical employees.  I have dealt with that for years! Its the most frustrating thing ever to be told everything is normal or its just in your head when you know something is wrong.  Our healthcare system is such a mess. Yes. Unfortunately, it is because I also had BV and yeast happening too and they did not care to look any further. I changed doctors.\n\nDemand a biopsy if you have not already, or find a dermatologist who is specialized in LS and other vulvar skin conditions and hopefully they can diagnose without. Wow funny you say that I am about to order 30 flucozanole tablets and going to try 7 days to see if its really a yeast issue! Hopefully that is the case. Thanks for the response \ud83d\udc4d Thanks It is extremely strong stuff. But it was meant to clear up the yeast issue, but in my case it totally helped with the LS. THE 2nd does of it 72 hours after the first cleared up EVERYTHING ...PLUS caused me to itch on my face and neck. So monitor extremely close.   But it is the first time since Oct.2020 that I have not had to wear the nasty feeling CLOB. Three days of free and clear of all. I did not even rake the 3rd dose after 72hrs of the second. And I will monitor it, before I take the weekly 1 PILL dose. Talk to your doctor. Did you feel any die off symptoms? Glad you found the solution and I will definitely be trying this The ONLY SIDE EFFECT WAS AFTER THE SECOND DOSE when it was 80% cleared up....i got a rashy/ itchy feeling on my face and neck. I think it wad only because it was only 20% infected. One PILL healed up 80% of it. So far i have taken 1 PILL each Tues night...and I have gone 2 weeks ( first time since Oct.2020) that I have NOT HAD TO use CLOB, NYASYATIN, DESITAN.... Glad to hear you are making progress, I will need to try get my hands on these pills", "Experience with first using clobetasol Just a bit of background first: I am 30 and have what I think is a classic experience with LS, in that it because it was mild it was mistaken for dermatitis for a few years before eventually worsening after I got the second covid vaccine for some reason. (No criticism of the vaccine, I am assuming it was either immune system or hormone fluctuations.) My GP strongly suspects LS and has given me clobestatol. I do have pale areas, although the main thing is a red rawness around the opening of my vagina. I was also suffering from terrible annoying itching which got worse before my periods.\n\nAnyway, my question is: I have been using the clob now for about 12 days, and the itching vanished very quickly. Did people find the soreness or rawness took longer to go in that first treatment phase? Obviously it is the usual prescribed three month plan so it is relatively early days for me, just wondered what others' experiences were. I had horrible LS - purple and torn-tissue-paper-white figure-eight - before diagnosis. Within two weeks in clobetasol it cleared up entirely for a solid decade. \n\nHaving a seriously nasty problem now with sudden changes that are shocking, and also wondering if related to vaccine, and I wish we could ask the question and learn an honest answer without it being equivalent to declaring oneself anti-vaccine. Hoping it is effective as it was when I was thirty. \n\nWhen I was thirty? Yeah. Clob absolutely cleared me up totally within two weeks. Utter misery to completely fine. This is a very reassuring response, thanks! My period's due at the moment but hopefully after that and another week of the clob I will be feeling better.\n\nAnd yes, I agree, it is difficult, I did not want to seem like a vaccine sceptic or anything but I also really do think this is related to the changes that have happened to lots of womens periods etc (including mine) for a few months after. I started experiencing my first LS symptoms after getting a flu shot years ago. I am not anti vaccine either, but there could be a correlation. Nice to see I am not alone.\n \nJust want to add, coconut oil really helps with minor flare ups. My LS was awful in the early stages too. I used clobetasol in the beginning but never looked back after about a month or two. Thanks! I think given that vaccines boost the immune system, it does make sense that if this is autoimmune then it could be a catalyst. That is what I thought about also. LS was going to show its self eventually for me. Maybe this just helped bring it out a tiny bit sooner? \n\nHope you get some relief soon. I have gotten to the point where I only have little flare ups before my period and really nothing else. It should get better from here! Great to hear! The clob has really been helping, it is mainly my period being due that is holding me back from getting things totally under control, I think. Really glad I joined this group, you have both given me hope! I think both vaccines and infections can be immune triggers, with the latter tending to be a bigger risk. Guillain-Barre syndrome is a good example of an autoimmune disease that sometimes happens after a vaccine, but more often happens after a regular infection. I cannot speak from experience since I never had much itching, but it makes sense to me that the itching might clear up faster than the rawness. For itching to stop, the cause just has to clear out, but for rawness to go away, the skin has to actually heal. It may also help to moisturize at the times when you are not applying clob (especially when you go down from the twice daily.) \n\nRegardless, I hope you do feel better soon in that respect! I was only prescribed once daily for the first month, actually, as I am waiting to see a specialist at the hospital, so I am assuming that is also why movement is slower! I have been using either V Magic or Hydromol ointment in between applications, which seems to help. And thank you!", "I think I might have cured this \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb I do not know how but I will share what I have done. I was hesitant to post this but I have observed a reduction in the white scarring but this is a great subreddit and I would like to give back. I am a 31yo male, I have had this approx 3-5 years and it developed after a very stressful time in life. Im prone to auto immune problems such as Cold Induced Urticaria. My case of LS involved Minimal irritation or rash but progressive white scarring. Started as a tight phimosis ring on my foreskin and moved up the frenulum until the white scarring/dots appeared around the urethra. Now I cant see any on the penis head, the frenulum is no longer white or discoloured and there are less white spots. The phimosis ring is still there but doesnt look as bad. \n\nWhat did i do? \n\nIn July I went to my Dr and he prescribed Mometasone cream. I have not been very good at applying this. Maybe 10-20 times in total. \nIt made the skin very dry and I found that the foreskin and glans were needing peeled apart because of it. \n\nAt the same time I started a new supplement regime. Mainly for general health and my hormones. This included:\n\nMorning\nZinc picolinate 22mg\nBoron 6-9mg\n\nWith dinner\nVit E 400IU\nVit D3 2000-5000IU\n\nBefore bed\nVit B6 in P5P form 100mg\n\nI also started Finasteride in July. This is a hair loss drug that reduced DHT. I thought this was worth mentioning in case there is an androgen or hormonal component to it. \n\nFeel free to message me. I will do an update in the near future incase anything changes. Please keep us updated Will do. It seems to correlate with these changes I have made which I never would have expected. But I have had a similar experience many years ago where I added a high dose of zinc daily and in a short time eradicated lots of hand warts that I would had for 7 years. \n\nIt is just that the reversal of my LS is quite drastic. I wouldnt rule out the cream that I used. However I was so bad at doing it I felt it would have no effect. I see, I had something so strange happen to me similar to that. I had a wart under my foot for maybe 5+ years, one day I took a swim in a river while hiking and the next couple days the foot wart was gone. Going To go back and visit that place again soon. \n\nI have not been diagnosed with LS but I have white patches down there for years that I thought were just birth marks but now it is becoming itchy. I have been fasting for a couple weeks now but I need to fix my diet like yours.", "Biopsy done by a gynecologist? Sorry if my English is weird, it is not my first language. \n\nI just went to a gynecologist and he said we will do a biopsy to see if what I have is lichen sclerosus, he searched for a pretty long time for a place he could take some skin from that would not cause much bleeding and also said they will put me into anesthesia.\n\nSo I want to ask, is it such a small procedure that a gynecologist can do it on me? And is it normal that I would have it done under anesthesia? In my experience it was a local anaesthetic to the area and then a punch biopsy with a few stitches which dissolved on their own. A gynaecologist or dermatologist both perform this procedure but you would not need to go under general anaesthetic unless there are other medical reasons for why they would need to do that? Not a doctor so only speaking from my own experience as someone with LS. In my case it was a dermatologist who performed the biopsy in hospital, it was very quick only took a few minutes - my mistake was not bringing pads as I had to put loads of tissue paper on my underwear after because there is a little bit of bleeding. They do them often, and oftentimes when it really is not necessary.\n\nAre you a member of our FBook group?   The spots I have are really right on my clitoris so I was thinking that maybe he would want to put me under the general one because it may hurt more there? I have no idea and I was also surprised when he said that because it seems like a very small procedure.\n\nThank you for suggesting me to bring some pads with me, I will make sure to do that I was diagnosed by having a biopsy done by my gynecologist. They did not put me under with anesthesia though...?", "Covid vaccine Hi guys,\n20(f) here, I have had covid (April 2020) before I was diagnosed with LS (August 2020) and had it quite bad - I was bedridden for 3 weeks, had multiple home visits and am still not 100%.\n\nThis is probably really unlikely but part of me wonders if having covid possibly is linked to my case of LS as no one in my family has had it and it was a surprise. Obviously I do not have the scientific knowledge to back any of that up and it probably sounds really silly so please ignore that idea as it is quite profound but I do also wonder about it with the lack of info we have on covid and it is after effects.\n\nAnyway, with how badly I reacted to covid I am seriously considering getting vaccinated however I am also scared of it making my LS worse. However I am also scared of possibly getting covid a second time making my LS worse than what the vaccine would have made it.\n\nTl;dr: have any of you experiencing LS had a covid vaccine and if so how did it affect your LS? I have LS and am fully vaccinated. There has been no change in my LS since vaccination. That is great! This gives me hope I also have LS and am fully vaccinated (I had the Pfizer vaccine) and have experienced no changes in relation to getting vaccinated.  \n\n\n\nAlso, while the current thinking is that LS may be genetic, we do not really have the research to confirm it, so no known occurrence of it in your family might not be relevant.  Also, it is commonly misdiagnosed and is sometimes asymptomatic, so it is possible that others in your family have had it but just do not know. I WILL NOT BE GETTING THE Va\u00a9\u00a9INE. Religious beliefs. My SPIRIT and my gut is strongly against it. Besides, I am not sick, except for LS, I DONT want to take any chances. If I are not broke, I dont need to be fixed. Fully vaccinated with Pfizer. No change in LS here either. I thought I might flare with the vaccine, as I did really bad both times I have had COVID, but I did not have any issues! I have had the Moderna vaccine and experienced no changes either. I had moderna, stopped using my clob just to be safe (as it is a steroid) and I had no changes and no flares related to the vaccine Astra Zeneca vaccine - no changes to my LS. Thank you for you are response it is really appreciated! I am not worried about getting the vaccine now Thank you for your response! It is really appreciated Makes sense! That is good you had no changes, thank you for your reply That is good! Ty for your response\nAh okay that does make sense! I did not know it could be asymptomatic Ty for your reply! That is good, I feel a lot more confident abt getting the vaccine now Ty for your reply! Interestingly enough I did have a flare up post vaccination, however sometimes I have flare ups as a reaction to stress and I hate needles so that could have been it. Why did you use copyright symbols instead of just writing out vaccine?\n\n\n\n&gt;I DONT want to take any chances.\n\n\n\nHas it not occurred to you that not getting the vaccine is taking a chance? Some sites tag you and delete posts if they are written outright...so as a precaution I use the \u00a9 in the words in place of the c. Not taking it could also technically be \"taking a chance\" so I would rather take my chances NATURALLY.  without changing my DNA. . no offense to all who choose to take their chances with the DNA alterations. Either way...is a chance you take. :) Btw: I am new to this reddit... What are the numbers next to a person's post.... And the -9 next to my post,?? I did not realize you had responded to me.  You have to hit the \"reply\" button under the comment you are responding to in order for that person to get it.  I just happened to check the post and saw this comment.\n\n\n\nYou can say vaccine here without your comment getting removed.\n\n\n\nThe vaccines are not capable of altering DNA. The numbers are votes.  The -9 means that your post has been downvoted 10 times (you always start with a 1, so that includes getting downvoted once to zero and then nine more downvotes to get to -9). And does that mean 10 people hated my post? \nThank you for explaining that to me...:D So the aarow up is the same as saying thumbs up and aarow down means dislike....correct....??? Yes, but you still are not replying correctly.  In order to respond directly to me in our conversation, you have to use the \"reply\" at the bottom of my comment. It means 10 people downvoted your comment.  They may have hated it or disagreed with it or maybe they just felt it was not appropriate or relevant to the conversation.  There are many reasons people downvote comments.  \n\n\n\nNo problem, I do not mind explaining. I am 20 and got diagnosed this year too and I am also wondering if it was from covid. I never got tested but my whole family got really sick in jan/Feb 2020. I have a lot of auotimmune systems since. I just got my first dose of Moderna on the 5th and so far so good! &gt;I would rather take my chances NATURALLY. without changing my DNA.\n\n\n\nI want you to know some things so that you can make an informed decision regardless of what decision you make.  \n\n\n\nThere are diseases, such as chicken pox, by which exposure to the illness fully activates an immune response and you are then protected from getting it again.  Not all diseases work this way.  Covid-19 is one of the diseases that does not work this way.  Simply having Covid-19 does not mean you are protected from getting it again.  In order to induce an immune response, your body needs an explanation of what to look out for and how to fight it.  \n\n\n\nThat is where the mRNA vaccines come in.  The \"m\" in mRNA means messenger.  It is essentially a message that tells your body how to protect itself from the virus.  It cannot alter your DNA.  \n\n\n\nTaking your chances naturally has three potential results:  \n1. Get lucky and never get it.  \n2. Get it and survive it with the chance to get it again.  \n3. Get it and die from it.\n\n\n\nGetting Covid-19 has a lot of risks.  Not only is death a possibility, but many sufferers experience long-term debilitating effects, so not only does getting Covid-19 not protect you from getting it again, it can give you respiratory dysfunction, chronic pain, and other ailments that can last at least months.\n\n\n\nThe risks associated with the vaccine are far less than the risks associated with getting Covid-19. I also had the Moderna vaccine and experienced no LS complications. Taking any medication or vaccine is scary because research is not typically done on on folks with compromised immune systems, but it is worth it to me to protect my health. \n\nI would also encourage everyone here to talk to their doctor about the HPV vaccine. LS puts you at an increased risk of developing vulvar/vaginal/other cancer, which is often caused by HPV. One less worry! Same. Fully vaccinated, no flare or pain.", "Tattoos Any of you guys with tattoos noticed more inflammation? I want a few tats but I am afraid it may trigger this disease more. I have been wanting to get another one and holding off myself. I was reading this site called healing the nether regions and I actually bought the book where she was talking about metal toxicity also possible from tattoos being a possible cause. If you do get another tattoo, please let me know how it turns out", "Can Lichen Sclerosus cause muscle aching? So I was diagnosed with Lichen Sclerosus on my genitals I am a guy. I have also noticed lighter skin patches on my arm. My arms have been aching extremely bad for no reason. Can this aching be cause by LS or is that not one of the symptoms? LS is a skin disease. It is not likely to be related. \n\nAching arms - first thing to do is make sure you are drinking enough water.  \n\n(Assumes you have no symptoms of heart trouble and have not helped anyone move lately, of course.)\n\nIf rest and water do not help, that is a question for the doc. But it is not going to be related to LS, says Random Internet Person. As a second random internet person, I agree. It *should not* be related. If you make sure you are hydrated and stuff and it does not go away, definitely go see your doc. Check out a diagram of the nerves that innervate the arms and see if you can correlate any of them with the areas where you feel pain.", "maybe lichen sclerosus? a couple months ago i had something that seemed like a milium cyst pop up on the bottom of my inner labia (which later on disappeared or took the form of raised skin bc the inner labia just looks a bit swollen now) and maybe a week later i had a what i thought was a blister show up near it on my perineum area- i thought it may have been cause by the friction from wearing a pad. but it still has not gone away and it seems to just be a raised bit of skin. i had another smaller one show up on the opposite side. and then a couple more milium cysts on my perineum. it is not painful or itchy but it can be a bit uncomfortable. i am going to see a doctor tomorrow but i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on what it could be? \nthanks LS is usually intensely itchy and painful. I would not worry that is what is going on with you, and hopefully whatever you have got is curable!! okay, thank you! From my understanding - after dealing with symptoms for approx 8-10 years before being diagnosed - doctors (and sometimes for good reason) try to hold off in diagnosing you with LS until they have exhausted other options unless you are in the middle of a super obvious flare up (i.e. often meaning white lacy patches over significant areas). LS requires a biopsy, which is very invasive and incredibly painful (worth it if it means it can confirm and give you answers) and while you might want answers right away, testing other options are significantly less painful and important to rule out regardless. It took me so many years until I found a doctor though who actually listened and looked through my medical history and was horrified about all the things I had been treated for without ever actually confirming the cause. She then referred me to a specialized gynaecologist who then got me to see an even more specialized gynaecologist/dermatologist. That whole process SUCKED but it I feel comfortable knowing this is for sure what is happening to my body. I would recommend you make sure you have a doctor you trust and can talk to. Explain your concerns and what you think it may be. Do not be surprised if your doctor wants to explore other options first - I strongly recommend going with that. Just maybe try to set a timeline with them - if there are not answers by a certain point, will your doctor consider that option? Sorry - I am rambling and trying to be clear. Strongly strongly advise listening to your doctor first. Also strongly recommend finding a doctor you believe you can trust and listen to but who will also listen to you.", "Any effective treatment without corticosteroid? I am supposed not to take any kind of corticosteroid because of an unrelated condition. Is there any effective treatment not involving corticosteroids? I think it depends on sex, to an extent. I have seen posts from several females on here state their symptoms went into remission after starting immune spreading drugs like humira for other autoimmune conditions. For males, the immune connection is not as strong, so It is possible that taking an immunosuppressant is not as effective, in that case. Are you cut or uncut? What are your symptoms? Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are almost as effective as steroids Cut or uncut? What that means?\n\n&gt; What are your symptoms?\n\nMy perianal region is wounded 24/7 on the past years. It is like permanent wounds around the area that never go away. It hurts and itches. \n\n&gt; Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus\n\nThanks!! I use tac for another condition in a similar area (perianal psoriasis). It does burn the first time or two I apply it, but it goes away after a few minutes, and it is not a problem once the flare improves and the skin is not as sensitive. I imagine if one had a lot of cuts, tac could be pretty uncomfortable at first, but I think it also varies person by person. I used the Ginny book \"curing lichen sclerosus\" on amazon and my symptoms are 90% gone. It use to be so bad even one round of sex hurt, now I can do 3x a day no problem Hi OP, \n\nHave you discussed this with the doctor who prescribed the steroid? I have heard it is really important to taper off and not stop taking them abruptly. Maybe you could taper off the steroid and taper on to an alternative. There are several alternatives, like calcineurin inhibitors like people mentioned (tac and pim). Retinoids are also used sometimes, but they can have worse side effects. And there are experimental treatments. There are definitely options. You and your doctor should figure out what is best for you in regard to your other condition. He told me I should not tell him how to treat me, that corticosteroids are the best treatment, and that it is highly unlikely that it has caused my eye issues and that I am just speculating. I just had the most intense itch inside of vagina that brought me to tears.\n\nI know sticking my fingers inside would make it feel better but possible cause damage.\n\nEven though this was a bt of a shocker I slid an ice cube in and out of my vigina and it helped with the itchy...just a thought that some of you might want to try Yikes. What does the eye doctor say? That serous central is one of the most likely explanations since everything fits, but that topical corticosteroids should not be a problem. Which goes against literally against what every reputable medical site says. For example, Mayo Clinic's article clearly lists topical corticosteroids as a trigger. So fuck me, right? Sorry to hear about your pain! Thanks for the comments / advice. I never tried ice, will give it a go Could not find that book, is that the exact name? Looking around, it seems like there are several case reports and some associations of topical steroids with CSR, but it is not as well proven as for systemic steroids. Regardless, the blanket conclusion that it \"should not be a problem\" is pretty obnoxious. Can you see a different doctor for the LS and try to get a different prescription? Lots of doctors are scared of steroids so they will try to give you something else anyway. It is kind of ironic that you are in the opposite position. \n\nHonestly if you are firmly not comfortable taking a steroid, regardless of your reasons, a doctor should find an alternative for you or refer you to someone who can. I screwed up the title lol here is a link\n\n If that link does not work it is called lichen sclerosus: beating the disease &gt; Honestly if you are firmly not comfortable taking a steroid, regardless of your reasons, a doctor should find an alternative for you or refer you to someone who can.\n\nExactly.\n\n&gt; it seems like there are several case reports and some associations of topical steroids with CSR ... Regardless, the blanket conclusion that it \"should not be a problem\" is pretty obnoxious.\n\nI am not very comfortable taking the risk of becoming blind because doctors think it \"yea it did happen, but it should not happen, so, idk, just shut take your meds lol\". id like to add that in general it is considered to be a really bad idea to take immune supression drugs for comparatively minor inconveniences like LS. such drugs are usually taken if you recieved a donated organ etc and can be overdosed disturbingly easy. I went to the pharmacist and asked what I can do about the itchiness and she suggested Canesten internal cream Could you please share some of the most important tips for those of us that cannot buy the book? Hello -\n\nI have spent a few days thinking about your question. \n\nI am sorry; I do not believe I can do justice as Ginny has done.\n\nLove yourself - save up the money - and buy this book and read it. It is 100000000% worth it. Agree to looking into all of this. My skin got steroid addicted from clob and I used tac to reduce my clob usage. It burned and itched badly the first 2 uses and since then has not been an issue at all. I use it 2 times a week every week and my dermatologist said that this amount is not enough for it to be a problem as far as overdosing or negative effects; however if you are using it twice a day every day or something, it is definitely worth looking into that. Overall, very luckily, the Tacrolimus provides pretty good symptom relief for me, so maybe ask if it is possible for you!", "Tacrolimus Does anyone have experience with Tacrolimus as a cure for lichen sclerosus? Not really a cure, but I was prescribed Clobetasol and Tacrolimus by my doctor. I rotate them and it seems to have helped me. It causes me to itch a bit though when I apply it. Same, minus the itching. I get a minty burn if I have not applied it recently but nothing major I use tac! I do tac 1-2x a week and steroid once a week (or twice if I am having a flare) for a total of 2-3x medication per week total. Sometimes during flares I will use tac every day for about a week. It seems to have helped a lot but it was so itchy the first night I used it, I was up all night. However, that did subside! I am a male that uses only tacrolimus. It seems to keep the LS calm and under control but it has not gotten rid of any white spots. I read an online study citing tremendous success with tacrolimus but some cases required 10-12 months of use before white spots went away.

Seeing a dermatologist is probably a good idea. Many will list LS as part of the conditions they treat. I am sorry that you are having to wrestle with this.

I have seen two doctors who say visually, it looks like I could have LS. The first doctor was an nurse practitioner who I scheduled a yearly check up with because my regular gynecologist was too booked out to see me. After seeing her I was able to get in with my gynecologist for a second opinion. \n\nI do not have any symptoms except for some whiting of my labia majora. I also do not really have any labia minora (I am not sure I ever have though) but the doctors both said it looks like possible atrophy because you can see lines where it looks like my labia minora used to be? \n\nThe original NP said to start using the steroid cream a couple times a day for a week, once every day for a week, and then eventually two days a week as maintenance. My gynecologist  said to not start the steroid cream unless I develop symptoms like itching because it is for management of symptoms. I am not currently using the clobetasol because I do not know if I am suppose to. \n\nI do not know what to do. I am scared and am worried I will eventually atrophy completely or it will progress quickly and I will be sad I did not do something sooner. Any advice would be helpful! \n\nAlso, how do I differentiate between a flare up and a yeast infection? Hi! \n\nFrom what I have been told. You NEED to use the steroid twice a week about 3 days apart for life. I have been researching for the past hour. My labia is white, but also gone almost completely. I was told that constant steroid use can really help in stopping progression! But it is crucial to use an ointment as opposed to a cream. Please listen to this podcast episode. It helped me SO MUCH! ( Awesome thank you so much!", "(24M) Does this sound familiar to anyone? Hi everyone. \n\nSo my situation is this - had a mild case of phimosis my whole life, did not cause any pain or functional problems. Finally decided to sort it out for aesthetic reasons. Did stretching exercises and used betamethasone cream. Great results, foreskin became much looser and retracts much easier when erect. \n\nHowever, around the time I was satisfied that phimosis was fixed and stopped using the cream and doing stretches, I noticed some small, painless, areas of dry white skin around the foreskin - on the frenulum and around the 'phimotic band\u2019, i.e. the areas I stretched. \n\nThese little patches of skin are mostly visibly white, sometimes paler. Dryer than the surrounding skin and kind of bumpy and raised. Sometimes slightly flaky, but not extremely so. Changes day to day and even in the course of a day, e.g, usually whiter in the morning.\n\nI have never had any bleeding, itching, noticeable tearing, pain of any kind. The phimosis has not come back, foreskin is still loose.\n\nGP said it cannot be LS because it affects the glans and is itchy. sent me to a urologist, who said he did not know what it was, told me i do not need a circumcision, and did not help beyond that. \n\nI suppose as a result of the stretching I did, it could be stretch marks/scarring/dead skin replaced by new underneath? but i have seen others on here report that their LS started similarly to mine. \n\nNo tightening, no itching, no pain, just weird small patches of skin on the frenulum and in a ring around the foreskin, which are whiter, drier, and slightly bumpy compared to the surrounding skin. Does this sound familiar to anyone? any other ideas or advice? \n\nthanks very much in advance. i have another Dr\u2019s appointment by phone in a month (with the same guy who was not much help before). then it will probably be a long wait for a dermatologist, which is probably what should have happened before instead of a urologist. extremely frustrating trying to get this diagnosed and treated. if it was an STD there is free walk in clinics everywhere constantly, doctors seem to not know much about this issue and also dismissive and nonchalant about it. \n\nthanks for reading if anyone has any advice or similar experience let me know! I can definitely second that doctors, in my experience, have been less than helpful. It took *years* to get a real diagnosis.\n\nI would suggest popping along to a sexual health clinic anyway, get some tests while you are there cause it never hurts to be safe and mention it to the nurse or doctor you see. They will be a lot more experienced with genital related stuff than your GP and might be able to offer you some advice or follow-up. &gt;GP said it cannot be LS because it affects the glans and is itchy.\n\nPretty sure that is incorrect; LS may or may not be itchy and can affect lots of different areas. Appt with the derm sounds like a worthwhile option, although it sucks to have to wait a long time. Sadly not many doctors are well-informed about LS.\n\nIf it is LS, can you go back to using the betamethasone at a maintenance frequency? On the other hand, could it be a skin reaction to the betamethasone? Steroids can cause weakened skin and stretch marks, and if you had an inflammatory issue to start with, it could be a rebound/withdrawal effect after stopping a steroid. It also sounds a bit like dry skin. Has moisturizing helped?\n\nThe flakiness makes me think of psoriasis. Do you have any skin conditions anywhere else on your body? Family history?", "List of foods, drinks that cause a flare. I cannot find if this is on here, but I am really interested in things others think caused a flare. \n\nMy 2 flares were a yr apart, I noticed this time that I ran out of root beer (drink) and had Dr.Pepper for a week, boom I had my second flare. I started drinking water because I thought I had a UTI, I had no idea this was for life. This time it was not just itching, there was pain. I take pain medication for autoimmune disease and this pain broke through it. I really want to avoid this. So I would like to know list of things that cause a flare. Also stress does it to me.\n\nSo far: Dr. Pepper and stress. For me it is sugar, every single time. Even if it is a tiny bite of something sugary. This goes for fruit too, but not as badly. Bread products make it worse as well, and alcohol (which may be tied to the sugar problem). \nStress, too. Sugar is by far my worst flare cause. Keep in mind that a trigger for one person might not be a trigger for another person, so do not feel like you necessarily have to cut something out of your diet if you read someone had a problem with it. I have not seen any reputable info on food triggers in LS, so it probably varies a lot person-to-person I just want to see if there is anything similar to everyone and also figure out if these things work for me. I got a lifetime of this might as well try. I quit dairy months ago, but recently ate something that had cheese in it and now I am waking up in the middle of the night itching my vulva and anus. I have not had a flare up in a long time. So dairy I guess.", "Feeling extremely suicidal I am waiting for biopsy results but I am convinced it is LS.

I do not know what to do I know it is frustrating. I hope you are seeing a competent GYN. Are you using the cream twice a day or once a day? I have have not seen a gynaecologist yet. My doctor is waiting for the biopsy to come back and then referring me to the gyn which will be another 6 week wait time. I have mostly been using the clobetasol twice a day, with a few weeks where I went once a day. I have not had a single day without clobetasol. I have been trying to get back to just once a day because I am scared of how much I have been using it.\n\nEdit : I am also terrified that my biopsy will not get the right results because she never told me to stop the clobetasol before the biopsy.

I do ice cold baths with colloidal oatmeal and baking soda twice a day. I have thought about cold compresses, but not cold sitz baths. Thank you. I also have cervical cancer and need a hysterectomy. I am so scared that the hysterectomy will make my vulva 100x worse than it is. \n\nI just got some lidocaine. Do you know if I can apply to the inner labia minora? Stay. This is not forever. We care about you. Just because we have the same condition does not mean we all understand but we are here to support you thru this! I hope you get good medical care. I have used dermplast at times to help with the itching/pain before I was prescribed stronger medication. I highly recommend the ice cold baths if you can do it. It is the only thing that gives me relief sometimes. Just got to breath out when you lower yourself in and keep occupied on your phone or something while in it. The cold compresses irritate me further because of the fabric pressing against my skin. That is a lot on your plate, then let me say again you are doing so well. I am not sure about the Lidocaine, does it say anything on a label anywhere? I have just done a quick google search and have seen it is to treat pain so my only advice is not to use it too often or your body might become reliant on it. If you are looking to soothe your labia, perhaps a cold flannel and def some oil of some sort. Are you wearing cotton underwear/shorts etc to allow breathing? I will have to give it a try sometime. Thanks. Says nothing on the label. I know the doctor said I could use it on the labia majora area because I had a huge herpes outbreak after my biopsy and was in extreme pain. So I got it for that initially. I just went and applied it to the labia minora anyways because I could not handle this anymore. \n\nI have not worn underwear in 4 months, no pants only skirts. Take ice cold baking soda baths every morning and night. Applying clobetasol 1-2x daily. Applying Vaseline 3x a day. Taking Claritin when it gets really bad but it only works for the first 6-8 hours. Thank you. I am feeling like this is forever right now. I am so scared. I cannot do anything I enjoyed before. I cannot even go for a walk anymore. I miss being intimate with my partner or even myself. I am so depressed. You are welcome. Thank you for the support. I do not mean this in a rude way, but why are you taking baking soda baths every night? Surely that is damaging your skin more? Baking soda is acidic and will be drying out your skin, you would be better off bathing in oat meal as oats have zinc in which helps to repair broken skin, I personally have ever heard of baking soda baths for LS Additionally Vaseline is terrible as it also dries or the skin and causes the skin to not be able to self- moisturise Please keep talking on here or with a hotline number or a friend/anyone caring.  It all sounds so overwhelming. It can help to release some of these powerful feelings thru talking.   You have a lot at one time and that can feel sooo heavy.  Please remember, life really will not remain so hard.  It will ebb and flow.  You will get relief.  It may take more time but I promise, there are things to ease your pain.  Keep pushing at the Drs, even see a different Dr, if you can. Some docs are compassionate and helpful, others are not.  \n\nI am so terribly sorry that you are feeling so low.  I know how scary that can be.  Its utterly draining.  Try to focus on healing vs giving up.  Even if you are just faking it.  It is going to continue to be scary and frustrating and depressing at times.  But it will not remain Soo intensely overpowering forever.  Hang on.  That point will arrive.  You can get better from all of these issues.  \n\nThere is a FANTASTIC group on Facebook just for women with LS.  They r compassionate, knowledgeable and eager to help.  My Dr told me zero about this condition.  I learned the rest on this group.  Sharing Is Caring at Lichen Sclerosis Et Al.  Facebook.  Pls try joining and feel the love, learn the proper way of caring for LS and talk freely.  \n\nThere are many of us with you.  Hold steady.  Please.  You are loved.  You can get through this.  Keep pushing.  Love and care, Ann I read about baking soda baths to reduce itching and irritation for many different vulvar issues including LS. But maybe I should not do it every day? I do use colloidal oatmeal in the bath as well. I did ask my doctor about the BS baths and she said it was fine. Oh I did not know that. It really helps to reduce the friction when I move around. Why does most of the information I have found recommend it after washing? I have tried coconut oil but I found that it does nothing. I have tried a crisis hotline and the responder was just silent and did not offer me any help at all. I ended up hanging up because it was so painfully awkward. It was terrible. I have been talking to my mom every day but she happens to have lichen planus and other health issues so I do not want to overwhelm her too much. Not sure who to talk to anymore. \n\nI am seeing a gynecologist in 6 weeks and am going to ask for a referral to a vulvar specialist too. I hope I can get in to see the specialist soon as the non urgent wait time is 6-7 months. \n\nWill it get more manageable eventually? I miss walking my dog, going swimming, being intimate with my partner. I am so tired of watching tv and playing video games day after day. I am only 30. \n\nThank you. I joined two other groups but just asked to join that group too. Hang in there! It is manageable. Talk, talk and research what works for others and for you. I found heat and humidity are bad for me. I use the clobetasol , also use hyaluronic acid supositories. And I recently started the Mona Lisa Treatment. This combination works for me. Also, I had stopped having sex regularly, a big mistake! Have you tried an an anti fungal treatment on top of the clobetasol? It might be a comorbid yeast infection. Also are you using clobetasol ointment or cream? Crisis hotline can be a huge disappointment for many people. I really feel for you. You are dealing with a tremendous amount of stress and discomfort. It might be worth telling your doctor that you are feeling suicidal about this and see if they can get you in to the gynaecologist sooner than in six weeks. We have got you, I promise it is worth sticking around for. I strongly suggest joining \u201csharing is caring about lichen sclerosus\u201d on Facebook (link below)- transformed my life. I am 35 now, diagnosed at 31. It went from sheer misery to very manageable. I promise, it gets better. I walk, I run, I have sex, and for the most part I do not have to think about it. Vs when I was diagnosed I was wretched. My biopsy was inconclusive and turns out that it does not matter that much. I just tell my doctor that is what I have, and I never have a problem getting my meds. \n\nMy best advice is to try the borax baths. Sounds real crazy, but the stuff works. I have been doing sitz baths for the last 2 years and I basically never itch anymore. It is what I wish I had known about earlier. I found out about it early but my boyfriend at the time talked me out of it, saying it was dangerous. Boy, do I wish I had ignored that - I would have gotten 2 years of my life back. \n\n(\n\nHang in there. You are worth it. You are more than a diagnosis. I am so sorry the crisis hotline sucked, just know that it is worth finding someone else to talk to. Even us internet strangers. \u2665\ufe0f My Geno-oncologist said Vaseline was ok, but he preferred A&amp;D ointment from the baby section I agree with the borax bath. It calmed my itch down. Two tablespoons in hot water in my tub, just filled to above my bikini area. Sit turned sideways so you can sit cross cross applesauce. Borax is sold in the cleaning aisle of Target, Lowe\u2019s, some grocery store. On the side of the box it has a million uses. I told my specialist I did it and he was not upset. He said if it made me feel better it is fine. Hugs to you! Baking soda has a pH of 8.3, not acidic. It can be very soothing for a variety of skin conditions. I am so sorry you are going through this. I have felt suicidal due to this condition too. You are just at the beginning, it will get so much better. It took me many months of using clobetasol to see improvement, so it takes patience. Soaking in borax can also be helpful. I agree with joining the fb group others suggested as well I have had one yeast infection test and it was negative. Just requested another one last week and am waiting for results, but the doctor said they are sure I do not have one. \n\nI am using ointment. I am soooooooo incredibly scared of having sex. I am worried it will undo all the progress I have made. I have not been intimate with my partner in about 5 months. I tried a sucking vibrator thing about a month ago and everything turned bright red. I am so worried. Ok, I will consider mentioning it. I feel like she will just up my dose of sertraline and send me on my way, though. That seems to be her answer to all of my anxiety and depression. I am just feeling so done with life. Ever since I became sexually active at 17 it is been non-stop genital issues every 4-5 years. Herpes, then warts, resistant yeast, cervical cancer, and now this. \n\nI have read about the borax, I think I will try it soon. Ok, good to know. I will get some of that. Just jumping in\u2014I had a hysterectomy last November and it did not impact my LS at all.\n\nHugs to you. That is beyond upsetting about the crisis hotline.  I always have hopes that services like that will be helpful.  You must have felt so badly after.  I am very sorry that the person you spoke with was not able to provide comfort.   I truly am.  \n\nI understand not wanting to overwhelm your mom. As a mom myself, I absolutely want to hear my child's truth as often as they will share it.  It makes me feel connected, useful and motherly.  I have loads of physical  and emotional issues myself.  I still want and need to be a part of the good and the bad.  My daughter and I ask each other, \"Is it ok if I share some heavy things rn?\". And if it is too much to handle, we say so.  Then we talk a little later.  Maybe tell your mom ur worried ur overwhelming her.  See how she feels about it.  Work out a system that works for you both.  I just know, for me, how important it is to share my truth with family.  You are at a critical point.  Pls consider leaning on your mom or continuing to lean on her.  That is what loved ones do(if we are lucky).  And she sounds like a great person to share with.  She loves you and she understands pain.  \n\nYes, it will absolutely get more manageable!!  You will get a routine going that will help.  You have to keep going and get through these next few weeks.  Make list of questions and concerns for the Drs.  Keep reaching out to others in these groups.  Focus on doing the little things that you can rn for yourself.  Pat your dog, watch the birds out your window, read what you can about your conditions so you are armed with knowledge.  Rest when you need to.  Days will pass.  You can do this. Thank you. I joined the group today. \n\nThat is good to know that you can do all that stuff again. I have been miserable not being able to workout or have sex or even masturbate. I feel like I have had my life stripped away. \n\nI will try the borax baths. I had read about them a few weeks ago. \n\nI hope things get better. I just have hardly any gas left in my tank. Thank you. I will try the borax. Another suggestion is to soak in a warm bath for twenty minutes, pat dry, THEN apply the clob ointment, massaging it in for two minutes. Thank you. \n\nI will ask my mom about overwhelming her. She is really the only reason I am still here. \n\nI hope it gets better. I am so tired. I can hardly get out of bed at the moment. \n\nI really appreciate the support. Thank you. Oh, that is really reassuring. I want to get the hysterectomy so that I no longer have periods which I feel would help the irritation from tampons and the blood. But this all started two days after my last colposcopy so I have been terrified to have anything like that happen again to my genitals since it ruined me last time I was in. I always apply the clobetasol after an ice cold bath. I have not had any warm water on my genitals though, I assumed warm water is the enemy. I even put ice cubes in the bath. It did help me with irritation related to my period. Treat yourself well and take diligent care leading up to your surgery. Go very easy on yourself during recovery too. You will get this all figured out, you will be ok. I got that info from this podcast episode. It was posted to this group before and I found it very helpful. Dr. Krapf is a leading specialist/researcher.\n\n im really sorry you are going through all of this. i was diagnosed a few months ago and was using clob.. after a few weeks i was concerned about the efficacy. it really only got better after i started soaking in warm water for 20 minutes and massaging it in. I tried borax and baking soda sitz baths but after a week i just did warm water and had a lot of improvements. I think it is worth a shot to try the warm water. Also i follow some pages on IG, dr. Jill krapf. If you are on the east coast and can see her she is a vulvar specialist. \n\n If she tries that, tell her you suspect that will only increase your suicidal feelings. Tell her that you do not want to just increase your sertraline. If she insists then let us know and also look for a new doctor maybe. Have you tried seeing a psychologist for counselling? Hmm\u2026 that seems really odd for her to be sure it is not one, when you are having all of the symptoms of one. Having sex increases blood flow and circulation. I can say it worked for me and I have also read it. Use lots of lube! And try other toys Well, all those symptoms could be due to LS, right? They could be, but considering the clob is not helping and normal LS treatments are not either\u2026 it just seems like bad practice to just rule out yeast. Especially when we know that clob treatment can cause yeast infection. I can talk to my other doctor if she insists. I sort of have two doctors at the moment, so I can ask the other one if things do not go well with her. \n\nI have done two self-help programs but it was really difficult to stay with it. It helped a bit but not a lot. I have wanted to see a psychologist but I am in Canada and you have to pay out of pocket, I do not have any coverage and I am really broke. I have wanted to do BetterHelp online but it is just so expensive. Yeah that is exactly why I requested another test. It was my other doctor who did the second test, and he agreed that the clob could cause a yeast infection and why not test again. But then when he visually examined me he said \u201cI am sure it will not come back positive\u201d but did a swab anyways. I am glad I pushed for it at least. The clob has helped but I am so confused as to why it just keeps flaring up randomly. Or when I drop down to once a day it seems to flare like crazy. Should not it be under more control after 11 weeks of clobetasol every day? Okay, I will maybe try next week. I am not on birth control and we usually just use condoms. Do you think condoms are going to irritate me? I am scared to just do the pull out method but also scared of condoms. Ahh. I found that water based lubes do not work, they dry out too soon. So use a different type like Uber lube which is a silicone based lube and use a lot, it is fun to use and feels good. After sex I wash well, Pat dry. Yea I would think there would be more relief by now and I hate that you are still suffering so much. I read some of your other comments and I too wonder if the way you are applying it is maybe part of the issue. I agree with others to try having a warm sits bath once a day and then massage the clob in while the skin is still soft. Spend around a minute massaging it in. Then see if that makes a difference after another week of trying that method. I am fortunate in that the clob was quickly effective for me, so it breaks my heart to hear that you have not experienced that success yet! I remember the feelings when I first learned this was going to be a lifelong issue and felt like I would never have a normal sex life. I can only imagine the stress of that going on for months \ud83d\ude29 and also I suppose it is still possible that it is not even LS which could be why you have not found relief yet. Anyways I feel that you are so beautiful and strong and resilient and you will get through this! I hope you can get the right treatment sooner rather than later. I am in Canada too and honestly I think the availability for psychology is very bad here. But my parents were able to pay so I have gone to several (shopping around) for my depression, before my LS diagnosis and I never found them very useful. I only asked about that because I know they can be super helpful for a lot of people. But do not be discouraged that you have not found success there either. But I think you might be able to get free services though, I am not sure if that depends on the province though. it is just a long wait list, and that was my first experience with a shitty one who basically laughed at me when I described my issues lol. \n\nAnother thing I have found in Canada is that doctors are extremely frustrating and try to chalk everything up as normal and nothing to worry about. Like they avoid treating things. I do not get why but it is really annoying. So Idk if that helps at all but it is possibly adding to your depression if your doctor does not take your issue seriously. And it is like hard to get referrals to any specialist which just makes it worse. \n\nKeep your head up, you are going to have normal sex again! This will get better. Thank you for caring and showing sympathy to a stranger, it means a lot to me. I do try and apply only after I have soaked in a bath, but do you think I should try warm water and no baking soda instead? I have tried the massaging it in for a minute but I almost felt like that upset my skin. I literally cannot even pull the hood of my clitoris back without the skin turning red the next day. It does not hurt though and I do not have any fusing or adhesions. \n\nI miss my partner sooooooo incredibly much. It is breaking my heart and making me so sad to not be intimate with him. He is so incredibly understanding and would be with me even if we never had sex again which is amazing, I am very lucky. But god do I ever miss him. \n\nI hope I can get the right treatment soon as well. I am going to ask my doctor(s) to refer me to a speciality clinic that deals with this stuff. But their non-urgent wait time is 6-7 months (wtf!). I am considering asking my parents for assistance or taking the money out of my LOC. I am just so desperate to find a way to cope with this (and my hysterectomy). It is all so much and I am scared I might go through with suicide one day. I find it disgusting how the Canadian government does not think that mental health should be covered under health care. Like where the fuck is the support for people like us or other people with chronic health issues? Why does not that matter? I would pay extra every month to ensure that there is mental health support available to all Canadians. People do not realize how important it is until they are in our shoes either.\n\nThat is crazy that you say that about doctors brushing things off. That is been my experience 100%. They just are like yeah that is how it is good luck. I have even been told to not bother trying to fix health issues and just \u201clive with it\u201d. My dad, mom and my partner have all had the same treatment too. I feel like they are told to do that because they are paid by the government and the government wants to pay the least amount possible. That is my theory anyways. \n\nThanks for the reassurance. I have got a bit more hope since talking with you (and other commenters). No worries at all. I am really glad you decided to post here and get support from others who have experienced this unusual situation. But yah that is like the worst part is feeling totally cut off from intimacy \ud83d\ude29 I am so glad your partner is so wonderful about it all. I would say yes it is probably worth a try to skip the baking soda and just do plain warm water before the clob. Also you should ask the doctor to give you an urgent referral to that specialist! Another 6-7 months of this crap is so not cool!! I would mention the suicidal feelings when asking it be an urgent referral. It is possible they will reject that and undermine the relationship between your mental health and physical health but hopefully not. Yea it literally makes no sense and frustrates the shit outta me! I feel like the medical community is just so corrupt and it is causing a lot of unnecessary suffering and it sucks so much. But I am really glad that you are feeling more hopeful that this will get better \u2764\ufe0f the people on the internet has seriously saved me from suicide way better than any \u201cprofessional\u201d ever has lol. And yah I totally agree there needs to be more emphasis on public access to mental health care! It is quite bad how it currently is. Hello,\nI have Lichen Sclerosus and just found out I am in remission. What that means is that my skin texture looks less like scar tissue and more like healthy vulvar skin, and my color is not white anymore. \n\nI saw Dr. Krapf in Washington DC. She told me a few things that were helpful. I will talk about them here. First of all, LS is not going to dictate your life. I am going to tell you that straight up. It sucks to have it, I know, I have cried and I wanted to die myself. But it is possible to get to a point where you have no active symptoms or flares. Sometimes the flares will come, and you will get itchy, or something sore, but that is just what happens with an auto immune disease. It goes silent and randomly comes up but there are ways to make that happen LESS and make them less painful. \n\nI was like you and my skin was red, sore, itchy, and irritated. I was using clobetasol cream. DO NOT USE THE CREAM. Use OINTMENT. Studies show that ointment is not only more potent but easier on skin that is agitated. Baths are a must. LS means thickened skin, and when you soak for 15 min, the skin gets soft and the ointment can penetrate the skin deeper. So I recommend applying ointment after baths or showers. This is what my LS specialist told me to do. \nAlso be careful you are not applying too much. You really only need a pea sized amount and you have to rub it in for 90 seconds. \n\nThe protocol for LS treatment is every night for one month, every other night for one month, and then twice a week forever to make sure that the inflammation stays down. \n\nUsually it takes 6 months to get to remission, and a few weeks to get a relief of symptoms. \n\nTrust me, LS will get to a point where it is just like eczema or acne. It is not going to dictate your life. Also, I recommend that you join the Lichen Sclerosus Support Network! Kathy &amp; Jaclyn are amazing and there are tons of us on there who can give you great tips from itch relief, to which undies fit the coziest! You have got an army of people in your corner! One step at a time. Do not try to do everything all at once when you are feeling overwhelmed. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nLet me know how the baths go after a week. I probably use 1/4 cup in an oversized kitty litter box (sadly no bathtub at my current house), but I am not precise about it. When I first started I used like 2 tablespoons and also saw improvement. Just depends on your body. \n\nI have faith in you! Thanks for chiming in. I appreciate it, and I do everything you have mentioned. \n\nI am using clobetasol ointment, I have never had the cream. I have always applied after soaking in a bath, and rub it in for a few minutes. Always use a pea sized amount, I am careful to not use too much. I have gotten some relief, but my symptoms always creep back and get worse again. I go through cycles every month (possibly related to hormones and my period). \n\nI appreciate you trying to give advice, but I have not been able to follow the \u201cusual\u201d protocol that you mentioned. I have had to use it every day for 11 weeks now, often two times a day. If I skip a day my symptoms come back with a vengeance. I would rather listen to my doctor and do what she recommends than to change my applications to every other day. That is not what works for me. I have been consulting with her every single week, and she has had me applying every day. I am seeing her tomorrow and we will re-asses the situation again. I trust my doctor. \n\nI hope that I get to remission soon. I am so exhausted from having this dictate my life. Everything I do right now revolves around it and it sucks so much. Thank you.  I did join that support group and two others a week ago or so. I did not know what application schedule you were on, so I just mentioned the protocol. Medication is personalized, and the protocol does not work for everyone. You are not a rare case. I know women in my support group who experienced the same thing you are going through. LS does worsen with hormones for many women. They find that the week before their period things get worse. \n\nSorry if I came across like an ass. Just trying to help because I know how hopeless this can feel. \n\nAll the best xx O3 brand triple ozonated olive oil is fantastic. I am about to try castor oil too. Check my above post \u2018the topic of topicals\u2019 This is all new to me too and I have felt some of the same feelings as you no doubt. Hold fast to the knowing that you have everything you need to heal. Do not let other people\u2019s experiences determine what you expect your experience to be. Make \u2018impossible\u2019 goals. Hope can be medicine \ud83d\udc9b Was just officially diagnosed with LS today. Feeling terrible, super scared. I want to start the borax baths. I have a bathtub\u2026 how much should I use in a 3/4 full bathtub? No worries. I appreciate you trying to help me. My period definitely seems to make things flare up. \n\nI just got my official diagnosis today, definitely LS. I feel pretty devastated. :( I really hope I can get into remission eventually. Blah. 1/4 cup or so! I got my official diagnosis today\u2026 definitely LS. Feeling pretty crap about it. Part of me definitely had some hope that maybe it was not LS. She did not want to refer me to the gynecologist as she thinks we can manage it ourselves since clobetasol is the treatment standard. I did go up on my sertraline upon her recommendation. I did not have the guts to tell her about the suicidal feelings but I am meeting again with her in three weeks. I am not sure if I should get a referral to the specialist or not\u2026 not sure what they could do for me if I am already doing all that I can. Fuck I hate this shit. Thank you. It is definitely possible to go into remission but it may take months. It did for me. I was cut up all over and I had massive blisters. It was hell but keep with the treatment you are given &amp; also try to manage stress. It is ironic bc LS was my main stressor and stress aggravates it Ugh I so understand feeling shy to speak truths to the doctor. They are so dismissive and you already know they are going to argue you. But hey I think it is good you have an official diagnosis! So you at least do not have to wonder. I can understand that she feels like she can manage it without a specialist but that pisses me off too. Like, she said she would refer you if the results were positive\u2026 and they are so\u2026? Wth. That is disappointing. I think you should push for the referral because you have been using the clob and have still been dealing with constant recurrence and that is not completely normal as far as I am concerned. If she refuses to give a referral then I think you should ask another doctor for one. The reason being is that the treatment is not providing complete relief and you need more specialized care. When the treatment is working, the condition should be not even noticeable anymore. You are still dealing with major discomfort from it after months of the \u201cstandard\u201d treatment. I feel triggered lol I hate the medical gatekeeping in this country. Ugh I am mad at your doctor. Also I have heard of people seeing dermatologist for this condition, so maybe see if she would be more comfortable referring to a dermatologist? Yeah I do not like how they are so dismissive of everything. She just said it is like having sensitive skin and you will have flare ups here and there. Did not even mention the fusing etc and possible risk for vulvar cancer. Like I feel like that is something you should tell the patient?! Luckily I already knew all about that from reading online. I might ask her next appointment to refer me to the gyno. I did not realize that it should be a lot more manageable right now. Fortunately I do have an appointment to see a dermatologist (for something else) in September so I will ask them about this as well. She also called it lichen sclerosus chronicus\u2026 I have never heard it with chronicus at the end.. have you?", "How to find a Vulvar Specialist ? While I have not been formally diagnosed with Lichen Sclerosus, I was told from my biopsy, I could be in the early stages. What concerns me is the lack of knowledge the local Doctors have on this disease. \n\nHow do I find a Vulvar Specialist or a Dermatologist that is well versed in this?\n\nI have been contemplating going to see Dr Goldstein at the CVVD but it is expensive, they dont take insurance and I am NO WHERE near DC. If they could help me it would be well worth it but I have heard good and bad and im just not sure what to do. \n\nMy derm said \"dont worry about lichen, you cant stop it so even if its early there is nothing you can do about it, just keep using the hydrocortisone when you are itchy.\" I DONT FIND THAT COMFORTING! \n\nWhile I understand there is no way to stop it, I would like to make sure I am doing my part to slow it or have it not progress rapidly by not treating it correctly. \n\nAny thoughts or advice? I wish I could give you some advice, but know that you are not alone :/ I am in the UK so the most I can really see are gynaecologists (which are hard to see here if you do not pay privately anyway) and even those seem to have very limited knowledge.\n\nMy only other choice is to pay for a private gyno but then I am gambling on if they will know more.\n\nHope that you can find help soon, my gynaecologist said similar things about it being unpreventable and it is scary. They have no empathy about it either. Such a shame that this seems to be the norm! I started therapy over all this, it is mentally draining. Thank you for your response. Glad there is a community, at least we have each other :) It really is ;-; the first doctor I saw about it gave me numbing cream and said that everyone gets pain during sex sometimes.. what!? I am so glad I got a second opinion, it took some time but I finally found doctors who listen.. but even they have limited knowledge.\n\nSame here, it really is draining. I booked tickets for a festival awhile back and cried right after because I did not know how I could shower/apply ointments etc, same with stuff like swimming.. I have not done anything much with LS because I developed it during my country\u2019s lockdown and we are still locked down ;-; I have started health anxiety therapy but I am waiting for them to get back to me.\n\nOf course! I am so grateful for it too, it is so nice to be able to talk to people with similar experiences. :,) It is awful! My in laws want to know why I dont want to go swimming with the nieces and nephews and its not like I dont but CANT. I dont exactly want to explain my vaginal issues to everyone. We have hot springs where I live and again cant go and so I always say no and people want to know why. Same thing with not drinking alcohol when we go out to the bar again its not that I dont want to but I dont want to risk making my symptoms worse or flare! I was crying everyday before I got into therapy. I am on lexapro now and it has helped me a lot even just being on 10mg. Do not listen to what he says\n\nMany people have had for decades and it is under control\nAlso read about many here who have had years of remission with and without steroids\n\nTry to ride out the clob itch maybe it will bother first before helping? It is the mainstay treatment\n\nMaybe you dont even have LS and just some form of dermatitis that will settle either with clob or by itself just keep hopeful and i pray for your mind to ease. \n\nBest wishes Thank you so much! I am not going to settle for the derms outlook/advice on this. Just as you pointed out, I have read about people in remission too. I will continue to search and get answers! Hi, responding as you are from the UK. Have you been to any of the hospital/clinics on the list here? \n\n\n\nAlso, there is a VERY helpful group on Facebook for Uk people. \"Lichen Sclerosus UK\".\n\nYou can ask people which gynocologist/vulvar dermatologist they have seen, depending on which area you are from and you can be given good recommendations. OP, I know you are not from the UK but see if you can join the Lichen Sclerosus UK group on Facebook. The ladies there are all very helpful and I have learnt a lot since joining. Also, see if you can use Google to find a vulvar dermatologist next to you. \n\nType in the keywords \nVulvar dermatologist lichen sclerosus \nVulvar dermatologist \n\nSee whether you can get a dermatologist who specialises in this area.\n\nAlso the following video by Dr.Goldstein is very helpful:\n\n Thank you!! Thank you so much! Yes, I watched this last week it was very informative! Not sure where you are in the UK but I am going to see a private gyno in London who specializes in vulva disease (have been being treated by a private dermatologist) and preforms stem cell treatment for LS. I can let you know how it goes. LS is not my first autoimmune disease and one thing I have learned is that autoimmune diseases are progressive. And they can progress really fast at times. I will pay just about anything to keep this one at bay as long as I can. This. I found a dermatology clinic that specifically has a vulvar dermatologist. She also has students observing during appointments as it is a teaching clinic. I have not unfortunately ;-; my GP will not refer me to any hospitals because my case is not severe, I have seen a gynaecologist but the clinic I saw them at is not on the list.\n\nThank you! I will have a look at that group soon then! I do not usually use Facebook but i will for that I feel that! Mine progressed really fast recently but because I saw my gyno a week before I noticed the progression she said it was inappropriate for me to contact them so much ;-;\n\nYes please! Let me know how it goes/please post about it if you get stem cell treatment done! I am 20/still a student so I do not have the money for private treatments but it is definitely something I want to look into in the future. Wow - what a reply from that gyno. Not only is it appropriate for you to contact them when things progress, but it can be urgent that you are examples because LS can lead to skin cancer and they need to look at it. BMA guideline say you need an immediate referral if SCC is suspected and the only way for them to determine if it is suspected is to examine you. Every time I have had a flaire up or progression my dermatologist has insisted on seeing me right away to rule it out. :( I am sorry.\n\nCan you change Gps? \n\nI do understand where you are coming from. I have to really push with my GP for referrals. I was misdiagnosed for years on two other auto immune conditions by my previous gp.\n\nIf your gp refuses after you insisting for a referral to one of the above clinics, say you want it on your record that she refused to send you to another clinic, despite your continual suffering. Ty ;-; \n\nThe thing is, I have been applying clob every day since the start of this flare up and it is helped and made things go back to normal, the white patch I had has just gotten a bit bigger so I am not sure. \n\nWhen I saw it had got bigger/I was experiencing symptoms again (I still get itching I did not before but no pain thankfully) I did freak out \n\nSo I was very worried when the white patch grew but now because I am not in pain I do not want to appear over-dramatic to them, but then I am not sure if I am being dramatic or my concern is reasonable because the way the GP reacted made me feel bad for bothering them \n\nIf I do get to the point where I am in pain again I definitely will ask her to note down the refusal for referral \n\nI am moving house soon so I may change GP then ;-; but I am also very scared that I would end up with even less knowledgeable GPs, with this one I managed to get a diagnosis within a few months rather than ages so I considered them quite knowledgeable compared to my old GP (who did not even bother to check it out and just offered numbing cream) Yeah ;-;  ngl it did really upset me, I tried to get a referral to that better gyno because I had an appointment with my current one because my white patch had increased considerably in size within a matter of days/the architecture had changed and it felt like she really brushed me off (id been waiting weeks for the appointment too) \n\nBecause of that I tried to call to set up an appointment with this better gyno but they told me I had to ask my GP for an urgent referral (I was crying on the phone tbh because I was so upset about it, so I think because of that that is why they said urgent)\n\nSo after I tried to set that up she called me saying that it is inappropriate for me to try and get an urgent referral because that is only for suspected cancer/emergencies and to trust her on this \n\nWhich I do understand.. but when you are told you have a condition that has little research, is incurable and progresses over time, any progress is very concerning.. \n\nI never knew about those guidelines ;-; I have been seen irl for my LS three times since June 2020 because of covid, all the other discussions have been phone calls Sorry I am in Ireland so I cannot help much. I was lucky that my GP (general practitioner) knew a dermatologist who specialised in dermatological issues \u2018down below\u2019. Maybe contact the local society/institute for dermatologists and see if they know of anyone who specialises in gynaecological skin disorders? Hydrocortisone??\n\nIf you do have LS, hydrocortisone is probably not strong enough to treat it. That is like hammering a nail with a flyswatter. I guess if they are not sure if you have LS, they are hesitant to prescribe strong steroids that come with potentially unjustified risks. But if you are itchy and they have ruled out all infectious and neoplastic causes, it is probably LS or another skin disease that is also treated with ultra-potent steroids anyway.\n\nAnd you are right, LS is not usually curable in adult women but the progression can absolutely be stopped, and stopping it in the early stage is exactly right. I think getting another opinion is a good plan, but you do not necessarily need to go across country. You might get lucky with an experienced dermatologist or gyn. The first derm I saw was an idiot but the second one was much more experienced and knew about LS. Sometimes you just have to keep looking. Suggestions on this thread for Googling look good. The Facebook LS groups also have lists of providers people have seen, grouped by location. This is really just shocking. But at the same time not, if you know what I mean. I am so sorry you are going through this. How they have treated you is unacceptable. Sadly, all too common. My advice, fwiw, is to keep being pushy. If a doctor says \u201ctrust me on this\u201d retort back that while you appreciate her medical expertise, you are the expert on your own body. You have after all been living in it your entire life, and no one knows it better. Something is different and cause for concern, and can she please \u201ctrust you on this\u201d. It is also 100% acceptable for you to ask for a referral for a second opinion. I have found on the NHS (which I love for many reasons but also has serious issues when it comes to patient care IMO) you have to be pushy AF to get what you need. I have accepted that means some (many) people will not like me, and I have also accepted that I will never accept no for an answer when my health is on the line. I just keep asking, sometimes different people, sometimes the same people, again and again and again until I get what I need.  I often go into appointments with stacks of research (a lot of doctors often hate it when you research, I do not really know why as long as the research is sound) and I do not trust them to have reviewed any of my previous records so I always bring a copy of all of that too. Now I have private medical insurance which has helped enormously, but I still often have to push. When it comes to LS, my go to lines to any doctor  trying to brush me off is, \u201cI know your main concern is cancer, and I am concerned about that too. But let us put that aside for just one moment. Imagine your clitorus (or tip of your penis, if it is a man), disappearing beneath a thick white plaque. Imagine you might never have another orgasm. Imagine sex is painful and you never want to have it again. Imagine what that will do to your most intimate relationships, to your vitality, to your spirit as a human being. Imagine you are me for just one second and tell me, would you be fine to just hang tight and see just how bad things can get over the next several months, or would you go ahead and take some affirmative action to see if you could salvage your identity as a woman - and maybe get ahead of the cancer too? Please do not recommend treatment for me that is less aggressive than what you would seek for yourself or your wife or your husband. And even if you would be A-OK to chill while your vulva becomes a white, senseless blob of its former self, please respect that I am not okay with that, and I do require more aggressive treatment.\u201d\n\nUltimately, you deserve to be treated by physicians that will partner *with* you on your care, not patronise you, gaslight you and pretend that they could not possibly make a mistake or miss something. Thank you! I am definitely planning to find someone who knows a bit more about this. I found a website of LS providers so fingers crossed! You can search for a provider on NVA.org! \n\n\nIt is the national vulvodynia association so many of these providers have experience with rare vulvar disorders. The list is not perfect, so research any doctor you find beforehand but it will definitely narrow down your search to a list of reliable providers in your area. Also google \u201cvulvar clinics\u201d in your area... this tends to search for gynos specialized in rare conditions as opposed to your regular gyn", "Diagnosed after 8 months?

There were no visible scratches, but there was pain and slight redness. Recently, I noticed a raised light line of skin in the area, almost forming a quarter/half ring around the foreskin. It does not look too far off from how a visible vein might appear, but I know that it is not (I think maybe it is scar tissue). Would this raised skin potentially be a sign of LS? I am planning on calling my doctor tomorrow but I was curious. Hi I do not know but if there are changes in our bodies then it is definately worthwhile to get a GP to check it out. Good Luck! I would recommend a dermatologist, GP's dont have much experience with this. It could be LS but hard to say like this. It is very important that you go check a dermatologist who knows LS, as said previously here. Many GPS do not know about LS and hence this delays proper treatment.", "Is this lichen sclerosus on my urethral opening?  MARK NSFW. MARK NSFW. MARK NSFW", "Flare ups Hello! I have LS and also alopecia areata, both autoimmune conditions. I was having a tough time with the LS when several new bald spots popped up, making me wonder if there was some food or other factor causing me a long flare up. \n\nHave you discovered what gives you a LS flare up? Heat, chlorine, dye from jeans, sex, soaps can all be triggers for my flare ups Heat, sweat, sex, and wet wipes cause mine. I have to wear my underwear inside out because the slight rubbing of the seam can instigate a flare for me. For me, it is hormones. I had issues with estrogen being high in my cycle when it would be normal to have high progesterone, and my endocrinologist treated my condition by going after my insulin resistance. I had a lot of bad issues because of this hormonal imbalance. At that time, I had mild discomfort with my skin being \u201csensitive\u201d and itchy before my period and sometimes after sex. Basically, it felt like I am about to get a yeast infection.\nWeirdly enough, my endocrinologist was right and insulin resistance meds helped my hormones to balance out. But now - I have wild flare ups  and am developing white patches as never before, so I guess my LS prefers higher estrogen. Flare ups are now happening before period as well, but not like mild discomfort - more like debilitating condition which is making me crazy and putting stress in every aspect of my life. I seriously wish for my endocrinologist to put things back as they were Oh I am so sorry to hear that it is worse for you. I got so heopeful at the beginning of your post, talking about an endocrinologist! I tried talking to my gp before about hormones, but she kind of cut me off and said that they will only look at hormones when I was through menopause! I hope you can get back to a more comfortable level. Thanks for replying Thank you :) I had to pay for my hormones to be analyzed, but as I am in Europe - it was not an expensive as it would be in other parts of the world, so I did it. \n\nHope that we both find best ways to manage LS!", "LS outside genital area Is it possible to have LS outside of the genital area?I am male and I have been noticing a few small transparent and white patches on both my hands, and I am really worried, seems like it is spreading. I cannot even sleep. is there even a treatment for this like tablets or injections? I do not think the cream would be beneficial outside of the genitals?? Please help lol I believe you can get LS elsewhere but it may also be mistaken for eczema or Psoriasis. You could check with your doctor or dermatologist as I think it is supposed to be more common for psoriasis and eczema to affect the hands. All of which are autoimmune conditions so it is not unlikely that you might have another skin condition (I also have psoriasis as well as LS but the Psoriasis affects my scalp and behind my ears. Try not to worry too much and maybe go see your dr about it just to ease your mind! Ls certainly can occur outside the genitals.  Topical steroids are used to treat LS, psoriasis, vitiligo as well as many other related conditions.  Talk to your doc, but the treatment for what you describe will probably be the same regardless of the words they choose to describe your diagnosis.  And try to stay positve, stress does not help.  Good luck dude! Came here to say the same thing. While LS most commonly affects the genitals, it can occur on other areas of the body (chest, arms, thighs are all common). Definitely agree, steroids are the main treatment of choice for all these skin conditions.\n\nOP if you are worries about autoimmunity, you could also request a blood panel and depending on the results, you could look into different diets and supplements in addition to steroids. There are drugs that can be considered like low dose Naltrexon that are prescribed for certain autoimmune disease. I know of a handle of people that take it for their LS. Note that while current studies suggest LDN can be helpful with autoimmunity and reducing inflammation, steroids are still the gold standard and most effective, according to current science. Further things to consider, the steroid does not affect the whole body systematically whereas an oral drug will. Just something to consider. As with any drug, we have to look at the science and weight out the pros and cons for our lives. \n\nDefinitely talk to your doctor about it. And good luck, this disease is not easy and can really cause a lot of distress (I have been there and it sucks). You can get LS on other places. I know for women it is most commonly seen under the breasts, on the back, and at the waist. I am not as familiar with male LS (I have just been diagnosed, and as a woman I have been reading a lot about female LS). \n\nIt could also be psoriasis. Like someone else mentioned, I also have psoriasis on the back of my neck and behind my ears within my hair line. I treat it with a clobetasol spray (as opposed to the ointment used on the genitals), but I would think you could use a cream on your hands. I would start by seeing a doctor to get a real diagnosis, but be sure to keep your hands well moisturized! Psoriasis (if that is what it is) can cause your skin to get very dry and crack if you do not use a gentle lotion. Old thread but I am a 44 yo Male. Started on my neck and now I have it on my back, knee and other areas. I purchased a 500 dollar phototherapy light to help. So far no change. Seeing dermatologist in new state. Yes.    I am male and was late 40s/early 50s when I was diagnosed.  Mine presents in my armpits.  After reading just a little bit on it at the time, I soon became very thankful for this, as regardless of how bad it was for me, I do not even like to think about how much worse it is for everyone else.  I am not that strong.", "Just diagnosed 25F I was just diagnosed becuase I have it on my stomach so I googled what it was and to my horror I saw all the pictures and depressing stories. I started examining myself and yes I do have white patches on the sides of my clitoris and a little bit on my anus. I never got them checked out becuase I never felt anything. I have had them for about a year.  I am really scared for my marriage and I am scared to think what my life will be. This has made me very suicidal. I know everyone is case is different and I guess mine has been very mild but I am still extremely scared. Some stories here give me hope and I pray I can be pain free. It might take quite some time, but you too will find relief. I know it is hard to come to terms with.

I am glad some of the stories here have at least freaked you out less than google. I was 29 when I was diagnosed and I was absolutely devastated and terrified, but I was also grateful to have an explanation for the symptoms I was experiencing. I know it is a lot to take in, but it is manageable, and being diagnosed early is the best way to avoid the the worst case scenarios because now you can find a treatment that works for you.

I have lost the entirety of my inner labia and any kind of forceful exposure (sex, managing periods, wearing irritating clothing, pooping) causes tears that take weeks to heal. It sounds like yours has just began though, so I urge you to take good care of your privates ASAP. I use a couple prescribed steroid creams throughout the week but I also recommend aloe Vera gel and Vaseline. Sex is still possible, just use lots of lube and do not go too rough! I would also recommend staying away from tight clothing, I constantly wear loose pants and women\u2019s boxers (from TomboyX, they are amazing). \nI have also used extra gentle washing detergent for my underwear and only use gentle, dye-free soaps for down there.\nAlso! Do not use Vagisil! It is terrible for your lady parts regardless of the condition. I recommend getting it officially diagnosed so that you can receive creams that will genuinely help, and maybe even stop the process of yours while you have caught it early!\nI know it is scary to think about how this will affect your future but it will really be okay as long as you treat your body right! And I know it is hard not to be self conscious about how it looks, but let us be real here, if anyone is lucky enough to get down there, they are not going to care what it looks like, they are just going to be happy they are in your pants haha. \nGood luck, and do not be afraid to reach out to me or anyone on this page if you need someone to talk to.", "Anyone knows if this is LICHEN SCLEROSUS? ", "Update: it was both LS and HPV! Tips? Hello, I posted a few weeks ago concerned if I had been misdiagnosed with LS because I had all these white bumps showing up at the entrance of my vagina. The community here was convinced it was HPV warts. My dermatologist confirmed, she thinks the clobetasol ointment affected an HPV infection I already had since it immunosuppressed the area and thus fueled the virus. \n\nThe bad news is now I had to stop the clobetasol and start taking Aldara, which is magnifying the itching and burning and inflammation I already had after stopping the clobetasol for 2 weeks... and the entrance to my vagina is all red and so sore. I do not know if anyone here has had a similar experience and has any tips? \n\nCannot go back on the clobetasol until I clear this infection :( I am so so sorry. \nHard Won Tips:\nI have gone to bed with a frozen water bottle between my legs. It helps the itch subside enough for me to fall asleep. I can drop it off the side of the bed before I actually fall asleep.\nAlso I am sure to keep my nails trim. I am newly diagnosed so if anyone registers bad advice here PLEASE let me know, this is just what worked for me pre-diagnosis!\n\n-keep your nails trimmed\n\n-if you have not already, grab some flushable wipes. Sometimes they help and sometimes they do not, but they were way more soothing for me when regular toilet paper exacerbated my symptoms.\n\n-Target sells HoneyPot vulva cream and it was a godsend for me. It is just coconut oil, cocoa butter, and some essential oils (and, because coconut oil, it does harden up a bit so you may want to run the bottle under warm water for a minute), but it is a decent soothing cream that really helped me when I had failed to resist the urge to rub/scratch!\n\n-Lanolin. It is sticky, it is pricier, and it smells like an old bandaid, but it WORKED. Mostly it just helped close up any tears I got from rubbing too much at a quicker pace than just letting it heal on its own. I definitely do not recommend it for internal use, I tried to keep it external only. I was lucky enough to already have some on hand too when my flare up started.\n\nThat is about it, I hope the infection clears up soon! Thanks for the tip! I had not thought of that! Thanks for the tips- I did buy some baby wipes to avoid irritation from toilet paper. I wish we had Target in France :D but I do have coconut oil which I could try. The thing is that the Aldara cream caused ulcers at the entrance of my vagina. The cream has side effects like burning and itching so add lichen to the mix and everything is exacerbated... I need to do everything I can to reduce the burning and itching and pain so that I can continue using the Aldara cream for the warts... it is a give and take battle. I started using a vagisil equivalent for the itching and Vaseline. I will see if I can find the 2 products you recommended to see if that makes a difference !

Three doctors later .. being treated for yeast infections/BV/one doctor even told me I had genital herpes (try explaining how that could have happened to your boyfriend of 4 years... all tests came back negative btw .. doc said she was 99% sure... idiot) .. I was tested for every strain of yeast three times .. stds .. ALL NEGATIVE .. I suggested LS years ago .. they said I was too young and it is so rare that it is highly unlikely..Still this unbearable itching .. driving me mad .. painful tears .. lack of sex drive .. so frustrating and depressing .. finally I found a great doctor .. assured me it is def not herpes but with the LS not showing just chalked it up to some women just have this itching problem .. and prescribed me Clomatrizole .. it gave me the \u201clongest temporary relief\u201d .. I was ecstatic .. it was better than nothing .. finally as of yesterday I saw the face of LS ... the itching was the most unbearable and painful .. I summed up the courage to take a mirror down there and one side of my vaginas skin was white .. I was mortified ... made a doctor appointment.. my gyno took one look and said I know exactly what that is ... LS ... finally an answer !! Some relief .. finally a route of healing I can start making with confidence that though there is no cure I can find some balance in level of comfort... \n\n\nSo I spoke to my doctor about it and he was very informative.. but I feel like the people of this thread that live with it and it is frustrations every day can be much more insightful than a doctor with textbook suggestions and prescription for clobetasol ....\n\n\nSo I ask of you ... fellow LS sufferers ... now what?  \n\nWhat has given you the most comfort?\n\nShould I get my thyroid checked out?

I got my vulvar biopsy done today. Going into it, I was incredibly nervous, but the nurse and doctor were both reassuring. The actual numbing injection stung for a couple seconds (no more than a dentist injection into the mouth, maybe even less to be honest), and I barely felt the actual biopsy and stitches (I got 1 or 2). They put pressure, gauze, and some Vaseline on the spot and told me that the stitches should eventually dissolve on their own. \n\nI\u2019l keep you updated on how it heals up over the next couple of days but wanted to share my experience in case there is anyone out there who might find it helpful! So nice to see others sharing their biopsy experience. I had mine about 8 weeks ago. The most painful part was after the numbing wears off. I used polysporin to help the healing process.

Hello :) I have my biopsy scheduled for 3 weeks time and am a bit nervous!! What was the healing like? Did it leave a scar? Good luck with your biopsy! I have a pretty great dermatologist, who is a specialist in LS, so she made the process pretty smooth. I used some lidocaine before the biopsy and did not feel anything during the actual procedure/stitches. I was pretty sore day 1 and 2 after the biopsy, so I took ibuprofen to manage the pain and Vaseline to keep the area protected. I experienced minimal bleeding and have a small scar but nothing too extreme, I think. Everything healed within 3 weeks. \n\nHope your procedure goes well! \u2764\ufe0f", "Any luck with oral immunosuppressants? I have LS, diagnosed in 2017 with a punch biopsy, in the beginning it was awful but changing my diet and using emu oil have helped more than anything, my main issue rn is that Clob is not working, I have tried three topical steroids and none work long term, my OB recently suggested an oral medication for lichen planus, I do not remember the name but she mentioned that some of her patients with LS have had sucsess with a few different ones, if anyone has had success with oral immunosuppressants and would be willing to share your experience it would be greatly appreciated. A bit nervous to start on an oral medication. I take short (usually 5 days, sometimes a bit longer) courses of prednisone when I am having a flare up. I do not love it either, but sometimes a fast progression needs to be stopped in its tracks. I have also found that fasting for a few days can completely mute a flare. Try talking to a naturopath about low dose naltrexone. Most conventional GP's do not know what it is. It has really changed my life. I am almost symptom free 24/7. It is useful for other inflammatory conditions as well.   \n\n\n( Thankyou for this response, I will definitely look into it, Ive never seen a naturopath but I am open to the idea. It is reassuring to know I might not need to constantly take something, taking it on an \u201cas needed basis\u201d is less daunting for whatever reason. \n\nThanks for this response. I am on oral immunosupressants for a separate disease (rheumatoid arthritis). It helps me live my life but it has not had any noticeable effect on my LS. \n\nIf you are looking for alternatives, please look into steroid shots!! I had one last week and I have had incredible results. My new dermatologist took one look and shot me up. I have my vagina back!! For one month anyways. I am also looking into the very expensive laser treatment. Which laser treatment?", "Anyone suffering from Balanitis Obliterans Xerotica (BXO) in here? I am tryna find someone likeminded.  I had a circumcision due to it 5 years ago, have scaring on the head of the penis still which does not seem to be progressing much (maybe very slowly).\n\nWhat is your experience with the disease?", "I have been on clobetasol for 3 weeks yet still have a constant itch. Is that normal? I have been on clobetasol for 3 weeks yet still have a constant itch. Is that normal? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: I have had itching for about 3 months, and I started clobetasol 3 weeks ago. First two weeks were twice a day and now I am on doing once a day (I have 1.5 weeks left of doing so). Is that normal? My second big flare took over a month to resolve with clobetasol. Dermoplast was the only thing that got me through it. If your flair is pretty bad it will take longer for it to go away. If your still having an issue call your doctor and see if they have anything else that can go with it until the itching goes away. How are you feeling now? I have been in clob for 8 weeks and I feel a bit better but at the same time the itching still come back. I am losing my mind! Hope you are finding some relief!", "Is this lichen sclerosus  It does not matter what any of us think.\nIf you have suspicions and symptoms, please go to a doctor and get a biopsy. Even if one of us was a doctor, you cannot really diagnose on sight &amp; you give no other information than pictures. There are thousands of skin issues/diseases/problems out there and the skin down there is very different than skin elsewhere on your body. Please go to a doctor, it is the best thing you can do for yourself! I am waiting on my gyno. I came here for an opinion that would all :) Good! I hope that did not come across as bitchy, that really was not my intent! I am sorry if it did. I wish I had some advice, but I did not pay attention to mine until it was well into its..stages? Transformation? Whatever, anyway I do not know what it looks like at it is baby stages. Very glad you are going to your doctor! Hopefully someone else here is more helpful than I was, lol Any pain or crazy itchiness? i understand that when you have a condition its very annoying for people to be asking oh is this it??? and not going to a doctor. I did take it as bitchy but i understand why it could have been bitchy lool. I have went to the doctor twice after waiting months and all they did was test me for basic shit so i still have 0 answer. and my gyno app was in a month and a half so i called to make it sooner. bascially begged! but since i have MAD anxiety, i just wanted people who have the condition i am worried about to take a look and maybe reassure me it is not that, or reassure me it is but there are fixes :) that is all not constant itch but there is discomfrt when i move a certain way and i need to relieve it or sometimes just itches. and ive also had some cracks in the skin too. but there is a big change in what my vulva looks like from only a year difference. Pain during sex sometimes too if you could also tell me what your symptoms were and what changed your vagina or even if you have any treatmentnow that is going well id behappy to hear it Okay I can certainly do that! \n\nI did not really notice any symptoms which is why I think I did not catch it until later in the progression of it. I actually felt it while wiping (raised patch of skin) and had my now husband go investigate lol I am not the type to frequently look at my own genitals (well, I am NOW). It was a raised, white patch, like an inch long scratch on my labia minora. It was tight, it itches sometimes &amp; I think that is when it gets too dry. It sometimes bleeds a little if it is too dry. It sometimes hurts if it is especially irritated and I get urine anywhere near it. Usually this condition appears in a \u201cfigure 8\u201d pattern. I have that figure 8, but not entirely filled in is the best way to put it.\n\nI have like an obsession with wiping &amp; being dry (\ud83d\ude44), so I always assumed the irritation was from that. I also had irritation on my perineum, which I thought was from wiping or just being sensitive. That area looks more like thin skin, or healing old skin \u201ctears\u201d. I do not know any other way to describe it. I currently use clobetasol ointment which is the one that is worked the best for me. I have tried MANY ointments and I just use the one that works the best and does not irritate or burn me. \n\nNow that I have the diagnosis, I have been able to see the correlation to other symptoms. Like vaginal tightness and occasional painful sex. It also is always painful after sex for me, but not to the point where I avoid sex. Lube is your friend! Just keeping the area moist generally will help too. I have seen people talking about using coconut oil and other topicals to help. Vaseline offers relief too, but is an occlusive, which means it does not moisturize on its own, but locks in moisture. \n\nMy gyno sucks for this and I have gone thru 3 HORRIBLE dermatologists, so I need to find a new doctor. Mine is more mild than others\u2019 from what I have read, so my doctor search is slow (and my insurance sucks).\n\nSorry for the novel, but that is my extent  of experience with this. I do not have any other social media but I have read that there is a good support group on Facebook for this too. I feelYou on NOW being obsessed to look at my genitals. I did not even know what they rlly looked like before. So you did not notice until you had a specific white patch. Do you itch? Also do you mind me asking your age. And I guess I am asking do you think what I have looks like the figure 8? It is rlly hard to find stuff online like pictures but I feel dry and scaly and I am noticing changes in my skin if you want to look at my post history. I am really scared of the atrophy! Does the clob prevent that? And can you have pain free sex now? Okay, I am NOT a doctor, so...not sure if I can comment on the figure 8 thing, I mean the places you took pictures of are similar areas to where a lot of people experience it. \n\nI do itch, it does not itch all the time. It is more of an irritation. I have switched to all cotton undies or no undies when you can (like summer time, in a long maxi dress). I work out a lot and have noticed it is worse when I wear tighter clothing/pants/tights and especially after a workout bc it is all sweaty and tight against my skin.\n\nI am currently 34, almost 35. I think I got this diagnosis around....29? I am pretty sure I had symptoms but did not pay attention to them until I felt that patch. I am sure I had it for years prior. The clob helps with my symptoms. I do not know if there is anything that helps with progression. \n\nI have tried making diet changes and stuff but I have not noticed a difference. I do notice mine is worse with stress. I also have a migraine condition which constantly stresses me out so I have more flares than I would like. I think the idea is if you keep your flares in check, the progression may slow down. If you leave it untreated and just throw caution to the wind constantly living in flare status, I am sure it gets worse faster. \n\nNot everyone progresses the same. You may never have fusion or atrophy, some people never do, some do sooner than others. My case is mild from what I understand and I have admittedly been lax with my treatment bc my migraines are consuming my life. \n\nI can have pain free sex, lube helps and foreplay is a must. I always have pain afterwards, but it is light pain and it is not enough to turn me off of sex (and I am not into pain or anything). You just have to get a biopsy to confirm and manage your symptoms and health, be open and honest with your partner too. And do not be afraid to advocate for yourself @ the doctor. I have noticed a lot of docs do not have the slightest idea about this condition. \n\nWhat is your age? Do you have any other skin or autoimmune issues? The figure of 8 is having it on your vulva, Perineum and anus.", "Lyme disease and lichen sclerosis When I was diagnosed with both lichen sclerosis and lichen planus, I started reading everything I could get my hands on.\n\nI found an interesting association between the lichen diseases and Lyme disease. I have tested positive for the antibodies to the Lyme spirochete, Borrelia. I do not remember anything like Lyme disease happening in my life, but I was in the right place at the right time to have gotten it, and could have been taking antibiotics for other reasons about then. \n\nI am curious to hear if anyone else on this sub has the same correlation. Upvoted to see if anything comes up here.  I also tested positive for Lyme and have LS.  I am now going to go back and think about the timing. How did you get tested for Lyme disease? Did you read something online about the correlation and then went and had the Lyme test done? Where do you even go to have that done? I have had LS for like 4 years now but i do not recall ever getting super sick and then it just appearing. This is really interesting. I wonder if there is anyone else here with this experience! I had already been tested for the antibodies (IGH) for borrellia before the onset of LS/LP, because I had a suite of symptoms that kind of added up to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. My doc wanted to check for post Lyme. I am going to have the definitive DNA test this summer. Neither of those tests were/are covered under my health insurance. ", "Swimming with LS My bfs birthday is coming up and I am really thinking of booking us a spa getaway since things like that are open again in my country\n\nBut I have not been swimming since being diagnosed with LS since everything has been closed due to covid\n\nDo you guys think that one day of swimming/sitting in a hot tub etc will do much damage? I do not know much about how pool water affects LS, I have a doctors appointment soon so I will ask then too It will be interesting to see what your doc says.\nMy LS didnt like water based lubricant my dermatologist told me to use to stop foreskin sticking to the glans. I use vaseline or the ointment prescribed. \nSo I would advise making sure you dry and apply ointment or vaseline after ! I hope you get other replies with more information than I can provide! I have been in many different bodies of water as of late; fresh, spring, salt. None of them have been bothersome to me. Thank you! Yeah I was prescribed this emollient ointment that reminds me a bit of Vaseline, I have not tried anything water based yet I think. I will definitely do something like that, I did have a search in other online forums and some people recommended applying Vaseline/whatever ointment you use before getting in the water but I am not too sure about that. That is good! That reassured me, I am hoping mine is the same. For me personally I just like to make sure I change into something dry immediately upon ending the activity. A wet crotch is an unhappy crotch for many reasons. I use a sprayer to rinse off every time I use the toilet to reduce symptoms of LS.  I would not think being in water would be a problem.  \n\n\n\nIf you have a problem with water on affected skin generally speaking, try applying vaseline prior to swimming to have a protective barrier between you and the water. Same here! Regular water is okay for me (I will use a bidet etc each time I go to the toilet at home) I was just concerned about water treated with chlorine, I might use the emollient ointment I have before I go in. Home tap water is typically chlorine treated unless you are on a well. Ah okay makes sense, this is in the UK right? Both the UK and the US chlorine treat municipal water supplies.", "27M - Newly diagnosed, I am distraught. Need advice. After noticing redness and white patches for a year I visited a derm who diagnosed me with LS and told me it is for life. I am in a really bad mental state now. I get an allergic type reaction to every condom known to man and now I have a permanently disfigured dick.  \n\nHow can I ever have a girlfriend or wife with this condition? The physical aspects are bad enough - I do not think sex will ever be an option. But mentally I am just so defeated. I took a lot of risks and worked so hard in my life and it was FINALLY paying off and now I have this and nobody to talk to. I cannot stop thinking about this. \n\nHow does one cope?", "Laser hair removal with LS? \nI have not had a flare up in months now (thank you baby Jesus), which is why I came to the uneducated decision it was fine for me to get full Brazilian laser hair removal. As I was reading up on the procedure, I saw that a possible side effect of laser is hypo-pigmentation, which some of you know is a trait that many people with LS experience.\n\nPersonally, I do not have any hypo-pigmentation, but I am wondering if maybe anyone here that is a bit more educated on this ~wonderful~ disorder knows if laser treatments would cause/trigger it? \n\nI am more so curious than worried, I actually think it is kind of pretty looking having lighter patches/areas on your bits ( it ads character! channeling Winnie Harlow). Plus, I just got my first session today and I am already locked in for another 4 sessions, so too late for me to worry at this point! \n\nTl:dr; Will laser hair removal with LS end up in a free anal-bleaching?? I have considered doing this because shaving causes a lot of irritation for me..and hair does too. If you have time to post an update on how your treatments went, I would really appreciate it! Unfortunately I am not helpful when it comes to your question. I hope everything continues to go well! same! i would love to know! Laser hair removal did not result in any extra skin discoloration for me and I found a lot of relief in the lesser amount of hair growth. The only real downside is that it hurt A LOT. The technician told me that the area is very sensitive normally, but I am not sure if the areas with LS were extra painful. Same here!! I have asked my OB about it, was completely blown off with an eye roll when I told her that shaving was difficult and caused flareups for me! If I had the right colour hair I would absolutely want to look into this. Like others, hair seems to bring on more irritating but I have yet to find a method for removal that does not also cause irritation. I am so sorry you were blown off, that is unacceptable. I feel like a lot of doctors do not really have answers. Hopefully OP can update us on how treatment went for her", "Where to start Hey everyone - I just found out what LS is and I am not sure if I have it - my outside labias are very itchy and have white patches from scratching that look like scars - does that sound like LS to anyone? If so, where should I go to get diagnosed - dermatologist? Or GYNO? Thank you!! Those are definitely two very common LS systems, it is hard to tell you for sure though...\n\nI brought it up to my Gyn while getting my annual check up and she prescribed a steroid ointment that helped alleviate my issues. LS is not very known/cared about with all doctors unfortunately so do not give up finding someone until you feel confident in them! It is definitely a good thing to be proactive, so do not wait for worsening symptoms :) If you have a gyno or a derm already that you like, I would go to them. Otherwise, my personal experience has given me a preference for derms, but I think either one is fine as long as you can get an experienced one. Those sound like lichens symptoms, but theres tons of different issues that could be causing your symptoms. Have you ruled out infections? \nI had the best luck when I saw a gyn-derm specialist (vulvar specialists are also good). I would research the best specialist near you and book an appt now, it takes months usually. You deserve the best care, so do not settle for a doctor who does not really understand LS or how to treat it. That said, I saw a local gyn  first, she did not know anything so after months of treating a yeast infection that didnt exist, I went to see another gyn at a major hospital in the city. He immediately diagnosed me, but knew nothing about disease management, so that is where the gyn derm specialist came in. In general, derms will know more about the skin and it is disorders, but they do not have the equipment (eg stirrups) and do not always feel comfortable working with genitals. Gyns generally know less about the disease but have more equipment and experience with the anatomy. Both are a good place to start, you could even book with each. It might help to call and ask if they treat vulvar skin issues prior to booking. Hoping it all works out! I would honestly skip the gyno and go straight to a dermatologist, speaking from personal experience, I would have saved a lot of money, time, and stress. Sounds like LS. I thought i had a scar too. Oddly enough, i thought the scar was from the skin always tearing and i did not give ant thought as to why this skin would tear sooooo easily so often. \ud83d\ude11 i tried to make an appointment with my dermatologist when i noticed the skin was so pale, but the office told me to see a gyno. I guess you could call whatever offices you want to go to and ask them if they are familiar with this condition. My first gyn definitely was not! A midwife at my on office found LS on me during a IUD check up!", "Penis pigmentation and redness  \n\nHello everyone,\n\nI am 18 years old (male) and I have already posted on this subreddit once. The upper part of my glans has thinner whitened skin with brown spots and some red discoloration around the hole. There is a white ring around the lower part of my foreskin with brown spots and a lot of red and dry skin around my frenulum. The white skin on my glans and around my foreskin seems to be thinner and also has a slightly different texture which becomes very noticeable after an erection because it is more wrinkled. The condition does not cause much discomfort, and it is a mainly cosmetic issue right now. The redness around the frenulum bothers me a lot though, because of the way it looks and the fact that it gets even worse every time I masturbate.\n\nI have now seen another dermatologist a month ago, and she told me that she does not think it is lichen sclerosus because people who have it usually experience more discomfort. She speculated about some other conditions of which I do not remember the names (something with hyperpigmentation) and prescribed me protopic 0.1% (to use once a day) and gave me a soap. After two weeks of using the cream I have not seen much of a difference. I then decided to additionally use a moisturizer and the texture of the skin improved. Also made the redness look a little lighter. Now I have been using protopic for almost a month and the moisturizer for about a week and the skin does not seem to further improve. Even after using the cream and moisturizing every day the shape of the redness seems to stay exactly the same. (It became a little lighter but will not change its shape at all).\n\nMy dermatologist told me to come back after three months to check the white and brown spots, but I have read on the Internet that you should consult your dermatologist in case protopic does not make visible results after the first two weeks of use.\n\nEven though my dermatologist does not think it is LS I still suspect it might be because it looks very similar to some images of LS I saw on the internet and because none of the creams previous dermatologists and urologists prescribed solved the issue. \n\nCould the fact that I masturbate frequently be the reason I do not see much improvement? Should I make a new appointment and tell that the cream did not work or should I continue using it? If protopic does not work is there a good chance a cortisone cream might do the job? If your dermatologist suggests a steroid ask about betamethasone,  it is a bit milder than clobetasol and I had good results. You dont say how often you masterbate, but I suspect you are probably in normal range. Good luck. Thanks for the response. I will ask about the cream. I asked about masturbation because I thought it might be damaging the skin and preventing it from healing. I do not think masturbation is a problem. I have LS and I usually do not feel any itching as well. Only sometimes after heavy masturbation session or when I have retracted my foreskin for a long period of time. I am uncircumsized. So even if you do not feel itching it could be LS. No creams or ointments/steroids have really helped me. Only when I retract my foreskin for couple of hours, the LS seems to lessen. I am thinking of getting cirmumsision. Although I am a bit worried, that by being cirmumsized the itching might increase and it will not solve my problem completely. There is this white shin around the pee hole that seems to be permanently damaged, kida athrophic. My dermatologist also said, that this part probably is going to stay like that no matter what. Hey man, thanks for the reply. Have you been diagnosed with LS? I heard you need to do a biopsy for that. I also thought about circumcision but decided to first try everything else to heal that redness I talked about in my text. The issue with circumcision for me is that it has to be radical to remove all the skin that is red and also I thought it might be problematic for the white skin on top of my penis, since it would probably not harden as usual  and the constant rubbing would damage it in the future.\nRight now I have not tried the most recommended ointments for ls yet and I am still hoping to solve the problem that way. Still need to talk with my dermatologist about that though. I have been diagnosed with LS from examination only, have not done biopsy. If you want to know, how it is going to be with circumcision, pull back your foreskin and walk like that for couple of days. At first it will be very irritating, but if you do it for some time, you will get used to it and even forget about it. Then you can see if being circumsized would even help you. One of the things is that when I have my foreskin on, the LS shows up because the penis tip is always in moisture. When I pull foreskin back, it dries up and the LS kind of dissapears around 70%, only the permanently damaged skin I wrote about before remains. I have also had some redness, that got me really worried, but it just went away on it is own after some time. I do not know If you also have LS, only doctor can diagnose that, if you have an option to do biopsy, it might be a good thing to do. Also switching doctors is a good idea, if the one you are going to does not seem to help. Because LS is rare in males, many dermatologists will diagnose you incorrectly, you need to find someone experienced. As for treatment \n\nI still have not found anything, that would heal me though. The only alternative treatment I have found online is this \"Tulip\" method. There is this doctor from US explaining how he has developed this new method of treating women from LS with a laser or something. He says, that he has good results, but he has not performed this treatment on males. It also seems to be expensive and you have to go to US to do it. But if it was a possibility, I would do it in a heartbeat. Have made some money from crypto, so I have some extra funds. Their clinic is called \"Coyle Institute\" and they also have info on youtube, that is where I heard about them from. Hope you now have atleast some info, but first you have to get diagnosed properly and see what is your actual condition. Stay safe man and find a experienced dermatologist. I had a thick white layer, the dermatologist called scar tissue, on the underside of glans. I would only itch after applying the ointment several days later, and the thick skin would shed. So 18 months later it is gone. But there is no frenulum! Now I rarely get itching. BTW I believe I have had this since preteen. I still have some adhesions but getting better slowly. I was told by my urologist a circumcision was not appropriate for me.\nI can remember going to my GP with a painful torn adhesion 35 yrs ago. Of course no help and no diagnosis till 18 months ago. What have you done to get rid of scar tissue ? Did you get the LS diagnosis ? Did they do a biopsy? How is it looking so far? My dermatologist diagnosed, did not need biopsy.  Urologist agreed with diagnosis. \nI use  betamethasone augmented ointment per instructions. Once a day for two weeks them twice per week.\n\n18 months and scar tissue is gone, natural color returned. Some adhesions opened up that I didnt know existed. Still have area that is sore where a bad adhesion has given me trouble for  40 years. Urologist says to pull down and tear it open and keep doing this daily to stop reattaching. \nGood luck ! Thank you for your fast reply. You are making me hopes that I might be lucky as well and can restore some of the discolouration. How long did it take that you saw visual improvements regarding the white discolouration? The thick white layer on the underside came off layer by layer as dead skin. This took about a year. The only itching I have had was 2 or 3 days after applying ointment,  and dead skin would come off on my fingers by gently massaging. That has stopped now. I had a red line appear, an opened adhesion, both across in line with  the ridge and vertically from urethra to near the other line. These took a few weeks to heal up and stop giving me discomfort. I had no idea I had adhesions there ! If you have adhesions try to pull apart and keep pulling apart so it doesnt reattach. I may be repeating myself ! Sorry !", "What professional helps best? I have a Gyno who has only given me clobestrol ointment but I feel I need more treatment options. Does anyone know if their are specialized doctors for LS? There are but they are few and far between.

You might try looking around the resources on \n\nDisclosure: I am just starting to help the owners of the site with some content on a volunteer basis, but I am not compensated for it.

Professor Christopher Bunker\nDr Victoria Swale Thank you so much!!! I am seeing a female-only urologist who practices in a women's reproductive health clinic. She is fabulous. She is also treating my oral lichen planus. Gynecologist just got me as far as a biopsy, which I also got from a dermatologist. Dermatologist was a go-to for the past few years but it is impossible to book an appointment right now and they only gave me steroid ointments. Just went to a PA who focuses on dermatology, but also has a masters in integrative medicine . She looked more into the causes and recommended non-steroid treatments. \n\nShe suggested monitoring my diet and adjusting if I see foods that trigger more flare ups (like foods that are high in oxalates), and suggested some other proactive treatments - both chemical and natural. See where it goes from there I have seen a vulvar specialist, a gyno who did a second skin biopsy and then requested a dermatologist appointment as well. They put me on tacrolimis since yrs on clobetisol and estrogen have not helped. I am due to see a different vulvar specialist soon. I wish you luck!", "How much does vulvar itching affect your daily life? I am asking to you all suffering from this plague...

When me and my boyfriend have sex, he ends up with little white chunks on \u2018him\u2019... it only ever happens when im having a bit of a flare up going on, but I have no clue what it is and was wondering if any of you did! I think it is like a layer of paper thin skin that gets rubbed off and dries up a bit with the friction of intercourse. I feel like I know what you are talking about and have experienced the same thing! Might be from a yeast infection. Hard to say though since the description could be a lot of things. My mind went to yeast as well. I feel like I have more trouble w/yeast levels and get mild infections whenever my lichen flares up. If it is a yeast flare up would it not smell bad?", "Moisturizing? Hi everyone! A while ago my doctor told me to stop using Clobetasol and to just apply lube when I feel dry. The lube dries up incredibly fast so I wanted to try emu oil. There is an alternative (vegan) version called gremu oil, has anyone ever tried that?\nOr any other good moisturizers out there? How about vaseline? I think it is similar to the ointment base that the clob is made up in. \n\nA lot of people here seem to like coconut oil, but I am not sure it is safe especially for inside the vagina. Shea butter is extremely moisturizing but I do not know if it is safe for the vagina either. \n\nAlso, maybe they meant when you feel dry (during sex)? Water-based lubes dry very quickly. Silicone and maybe oil-based ones hold up longer. But using one as a moisturizer still strikes me as an odd choice. But I am no expert. My doctor knows I am not sexually active yet so I also thought it was weird to recommend lube lol. I will try vaseline, thank you! Hi not sexually active yet so i also thought it was weird to recommend lube lol, I am dad. I have no idea why they recommend lube it doesnt work at all lol. Vaseline is great. If you do not love it, vitamin E oil is also worth a try, I am not sure why but it seems to last on the skin much longer than coconut oil.\n\nEdit: oh and if you do need something for actually inside the vagina, like the person above was saying, you can get vitamin e suppositories. Hi not sure why but it seems to last on the skin much longer than coconut oil, I am dad. Thank you! I will give those a try Why stop clob? Are you in remission? I am not sure, I had been using clob for 5 years with yearly doctor visits and each visit she would just look at my vagina and say \u201cperfect, see you next year\u201d my last visit I told her that I noticed my labia minora shrinking which she explained steroid creams can do that so she just told me I did not have to use clob anymore. I am noticing symptoms come back so I might have to go back on clob I use Aquaphor. It seems to work great for me. Also not sexually active. But during the five years of using clob u had no symptoms? Thank you! When I first went my skin was extremely dry, I started to get rough dry patches on my clitoris area (almost felt like reptile skin is the best way I can describe it) my skin had no color it just looked grey and I was veryyy itchy and my skin would tear easily. Once I started using clob within 3-6 months my skin got so much better. coconut oil!! the honey pot company's is so great and I seriously cannot recc it enough. Does it stain your clothes? I have never experienced staining, cannot see why it would! Thank you!", "What are you allergic to? I would like to know, if we have certain allergies in common. Maybe I am missing something that functions as a trigger. My LS definitely gets worse when I consume wine or casein. I am severely allergic to guinea pigs (of all the things!). Also some types pollen and mold. I have not seen any effect on my lichen sclerosus. ", "I think my creams have reached the end of its life. I have been using clobetosal and estrace cream for over 10 years and I had a bad allergic reaction to some new pants omg was that so bad my doctor was scared by the picture I sent her of my vagina. She prescribed me a allergy med to take every night because I so sensitive to everything. Then a like a week I breakout again in a allergic like reaction. With it red bumps and painful and itchy. The medication seems to help. I go see see someone on Monday to see what they want to do. This is so werid. I hope you are having some relief now Unfortunately not yet it feels like sun burn but I have to off my creams for two weeks and just take the allergy pill.", "Can you get LS in the pubic area? Google is not throwing up any answers on this, and any images online seem to end at the line of the pubic hair! It is generally said to affect only the skin where hair does not grow. It is not supposed to be under public hair. \n\nFar as I am concerned, it should also stop eating my vulva, I \u201cshould\u201d have my anatomy :-( . So, not sure how much stock we give \u201cshould\u201d. \n\nBut everyone seems to agree that it stops where hair grows. This it what I thought, but then it feels itchy and sore there! The doc did say people who have one skin condition often have others, so maybe it is a bit of added eczema or dermatitis or something as an extra treat... Extra lucky, then? Sorry, that does not sound fun. :-(\n\nI do know you should not treat regular, hair-growing skin with clobetasol as freely as you can  where there is no hair. It might be that a steroid is appropriate for what is irritating you there, but probably not the clob. Doc would have to say. Technically, yes it can, although it is less common. I know many folks whose primary symptoms appear on the mons pubis, which for some, has hair. If possible, I would see a specialist for a differential diagnosis to make sure it is not something else. LS can show up most anywhere, even in your mouth. But from what I understand, LS outside the genitals tends to be less severe. It is not as common. Thought I had it there, turns out I just applied the ointment on my pubic region and it irritated my skin. Stopped applying it there &amp; I am all good", "Wondering if anybody experienced this - clitoris splitting/separating I have not been officially diagnosed but I (31-F) know I have LS. Never been able to have sex, hardly get a tampon in at times, my clitoral hood is pure white and I have a lot of other scarring and blood blisters. Never had a pap done because I could not, hurts too much. After that appointment my doctor gave me the steroid cream but I never understood what was going on so I never used it and that was.. 6 years or so ago? So since then I just accepted whatever itchiness and unpleasant symptoms as whatever as my mental health was more of a pressing concern and coming to terms with being a lesbian meant penetrative sex was no longer as issue. \n\nSometimes it will feel like my clitoris splits or separates on one side. It is painful and it physically looks and feels different. After awhile it fuses back together basically. After totally shaving everything for the first time in a long time today, I examined everything close and wow, it looks pretty fucked down there. Blood blisters and more shiny scarred skin (recently had a night with a women where fingering happened so I wonder if that caused the blood blisters) Anyways. I looked closely at my clitoris and one side looks more closed off and I see white skin. So I am wondering if that weird splitting thing I get is because of this. \n\nDoes anyone else experience that? Those seem like very progressed symptoms that are not worth the trouble... why would you not use the steroid cream? Definitely start using the ointment! Do not be afraid of it. Half a pea size to your doctors directions since your case sounds more extreme and I am not sure of the dosing you would need. Also coconut oil is a life saver!!! It moisturizes the area and helps with pain. Id also recommend once you get your symptoms under control to use dilators. Get a kit and start with the smallest one... even if you have to work up from a cotton swab - and lube those bad boys up before with more coconut oil. Do not give up!! I did not know back then why it was needed and the prescription expired. My doc never explained or I did not understand. I do not even have the cream anymore. My mental health took precedence, I have been an alcoholic for over ten years, got diagnosed borderline personality and have not been intimate with anyone for years except recently. I guess I attributed the symptoms I had with not taking care of myself because of the alcohol and also with only being concerned with drinking I did not care about anything else nor was I as aware of my body when I was either drunk or hungover all the time.  I am now 130 days sober and finally getting my health under control and started googling stuff today and found this sub. Thank you. I will make an appointment with my doctor and see if I can get a new prescription for the cream since I have not had a prescription for it for years. I had dilators at one point because I thought my sex issue was vaginusmus but did not stick with them and I got rid of them. I appreciate the words of encouragement. I have lichen but I have to use dilators because my vaginal opening is becoming too narrow. So I have to use them daily... kind of like an exercise. That paired with coconut oil has slowly stretched my vagina so that I can have sex pretty regularly, but it is still something I worry about. That is good to hear that you can have sex now! It is encouraging to hear but I can understand the worry about it. I will keep the tip about coconut oil in mind. Great!! That and emu oil... coconut oil can be messy at times and emu oil is a bit more solid. I definitely recommend obtaining that prescription again. Those symptoms sound horrible :-( \nI really wish you the best Thank you Definitely get the clobetasol and use it religiously until symptoms subside.\n\nI had a white patch at the top of my clitoral hood - the hood had fused to the clit and was painful for me when touched and definitely uncomfortable when anything rubbed against it like jeans seams, underwear, pads at night during TOM.\n\nI got on clobetasol and the fusing has gone and the hood pulls off the clit again - thank god! The white coloring has turned light pink again so its not as noticeable to anyone but me and the gynecologist. Clobetasol helped me within 2 months I think. \n\nNow I use it when I feel any tenderness in that area or tiny tears. \n\nGood luck! \ud83d\ude42 Thank you for sharing, glad I am not the only one with that white patch and I am glad to hear that it darkened over time cause it stands out quite strongly. This is exactly where my LS is primarily focused! Your comment here gives me so much hope so thank you! The doc, when she first saw me, said \u201coh your clit is just disappearing under there!\u201d Ugh... I have been using the clob 2x daily for about 10 days and I am already hopeful with how much sensitivity I have regained down there! Applying the cream is even kind of fun \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 Yes! You are not alone! A vertical split right at 12 of the clock. Pretty much every flare up. Preventing them in the first place is key. I hope you can get back on the ointment, clobestesol works like magic for me. Start with 2x a day, morning and night. Get a hand mirror and sit on the floor and massage the ointment in very well. Take a good 5 minutes to massage it in. As it starts to clear up you can switch to once a day, then every other day, then 2x a week. A lot of doctors prescribe it and say to use a small amount or the pharmacy warnings scare you off of it- been there! But when used properly it really does work. Use a pea sized amount (I use a pea sized amount at 12 of the clock and another pea sized amount at 6 of the clock when I am flared up). As my specialist says \u201cif it is burning you are using too much, if it is itchy you are not using enough!\u201d You have got to find your own balance. \n\nIf left untreated LS can do a lot of permanent damage and can even cause cancer, so please take the advice everyone has given and get it under control ASAP. You do not have to live like this, you can start feeling better very soon! I am glad to know I am not alone, thanks for the tips :) Yes, my clitoris was splitting and it was terrible. I did not realize it was LS until I was diagnosed. Please use the prescription. It will change your life! Yes, this is exactly how my split was. Vertical and at 12 of the clock is such a good description! I am making an appointment with my doc to get a new prescription. Thanks for sharing, makes me feel less alone. I am so glad I found this subreddit. It is validating to see other people share their experiences and know we are not alone! No one in my life knows or understands LS so this has been a great resource for me. So true! Especially the splitting thing. Like how do you even describe that to someone else? Lol. All I can say is I am so glad you found this board!! I got diagnosed a year ago, very stable, but it is such an isolating diagnosis. Glad we are not alone in this! As others have said, get to the GP and get the crem/ointment. It will start heal and you will feel so much better. Manage it by checking every few days or so to look for any changes and if so let the Gynecologist know. I have not experienced the splitting but my clit hood has fused over. It is so weird as looks different! I am considering getting the hood opened through surgery and been advised to moisture alot. I used a hydromol thick vaseline type cream and it soothes and protects me when I need to pee. When your hood splits how long does it take to heal? As I am not sure that the surgery will work for me. It is usually a few days of it split before it starts to merge back again. It might resplit at times as it starts to heal back. I have not paid attention enough to notice if it maybe happens more around my period because of more action in the area at that time with cleaning and whatnot. I am going to pay more attention now. I hope the surgery works for you if you decide to go with it", "Lichens Sclerosus in Urethra I am a 25 year old male. I just recently had an issue with voiding, pressure, and some burning. I went through several antibiotics. Finally, I had a positive mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma test, and went through all treatment for that. I then was retested and tested negative. \n\nI was still having issues, so my urologist did a cystoscopy. He stated I had multiple blanched patches with ulceration in my urethra and a small stricture. He dilated the stricture, but said my family practice doctor would need to provide treatment for lichens Sclerosus. \n\nHe said he even reached out to a larger healthcare system to make sure that it was lichens Sclerosus. However, he did not do any biopsies. \n\nMy family doctor is questioning it because I have never had any issues with the skin on my penis, but only internally throughout my urethra. \n\nHas anybody else had a similar experience? If so, what did you have for treatment? Yeah, I had issues with my urethra that preceded pruritus, depigmentation, early stages of phimosis, and other symptoms that developed on my foreskin and glans. I also had LS symtoms on my anal region for years before any of the symptoms in the front, but i wasnt diagnosed untill i had fairly obvious symptoms on my foreskin and glans.  You should probably consider yourself lucky that your Drs figured this out and got you diagnosed as soon as they did. The myself and my family doctor are confused is lichens Sclerosus usually starts on the outside and moves to the inside rather than starting on the inside. I have had no external skin changes.\n\nMost of what I have read states that usually urethral involvement happens when diagnosis is delayed. I am curious if anybody else has had a similar experience. The disease doesnt have to start in any kind of order or at any kind of age.  My pigment change and stuff happened after the changes to the inside of my urethra. Thank you for the information! That is good to know. I am glad I am not the only one. This is not something I have ever heard of. I have a similar case\u2026 although I had phimosis and got circumcised when I was 10 probably because of LS I never had any other issues until this year.. I am 36 now and it came back right into my meatus almost closing it. After some weeks I started to see some pigment loss on my glands (mild) \u2026 now I am waiting to do some exams and later surgery \ud83d\ude14", "Got lichen sclerosus as a 20 year old man. It killed all my confidence. From being a confident good looking guy I am now sitting here really depressed. I dont know how to move on. The tip of my penis looks disgusting and I cant see how I can get with girls anymore. Any way to get rid of white areas?  As a 20 year old woman I cannot relate to having male LS but can relate to the loss in confidence :( down there does not look the way it used to and at such a young age I am scared of judgement for it. Thankfully I have found someone who is very supportive and is not bothered by the changes in appearance and I know words likely will not help make you feel better but you will someday too. Any woman who cannot see past a skin condition on your penis purely due to how it looks is not worth being with, imo.  You are far more than just a penis.  You should get a therapist to help you through the mental aspects of this.  You do not have to do it on your own. Have you seen a doctor? While not curable, it can be managed. There are steroid creams that can be used. Although I am a woman it still got rid of the white patches. If you are on fb, there is a male LS support group. Find out from them what works. Get to a doctor ASAP. It does not have to be like this forever. Apart from the appearance of white areas, does it give you crazy pain or itchiness? Not crazy pain or itchiness. It hurts a little if I touch the area tho. Thank you! I am just scared the white areas are scars that wont go away It is not clear if you have had treatment or if you are undergoing treatment. What is your current situation?  Most men report some improvement in skin colour with steroids once the disease is in remission. Is it only the colour which is a problem or do you have scarring, phimosis or ongoing tearing? Scarring phimosis. In februar I had bad blisters and couldnt pull the foreskin back. Thought it was balanitis and that it should go over. I was at the doctor yesterday, unfortunately very late, and he gave me protipic that I am going to use. I was at the doctor yesterday but was very late because I thought it was balanitis and that the white areas were bruises for months. He gave me protopic Thanks for supportive words! If I was a 60 year old and got diagnosed I wouldnt think so much about it. But suffering from it the rest of my life from a very young age that should be the best years, that is hard to accept. You are right! Just hard for me to accept, it makes me insecure. I have always had a lot of confidence and been the midpoint in social gatherings (sounds weird I know) but that changed fast when I got diagnosed. I feel that for sure :( when I first got diagnosed I heard (in the case of female LS) it is most common in women that tend to have gone through menopause, after joining this community I know now more younger people do have it but it is super disheartening to learn we will likely be dealing with this for life. I still get very upset about it at times and wonder how I will do things like travel etc (I booked tickets for a festival last month and cried after because I did not know how I would manage during it). I do try to be grateful that it is not a worse medical condition or something but the way there is so little research and doctors so casually told me this is something to keep managing for life is hard to wrap my head around. Especially being so young and wanting to enjoy life/sex etc and being able to be care free before I get too old for all of that. Having to deal with this every day is mentally exhausting. \n\nPart of me hopes that better treatments or maybe even a cure will come about during our lifetimes, but I have doubts. :/ It is hard not to think negatively about the whole thing yknow?\n\n(Edit to add: also having issues that impact sex at this young age also feels really embarrassing and makes me feel insecure sometimes. ) Tacrolimus/protopic is not the first choice to treat LS. It would typically be used where steroids were not tolerated or had failed. Did you doctor discuss using dermovate?  Did he actually diagnose LS?  If you already have phimosis as a result of scarring, a steroid will both treat the LS and start relaxing thr phimosis. I saw significant relaxation in a similar situation whilst using dermovate. A weaker steroid will also be helpful in assisting the stretching of the foreskin once LS is in remission. That is understandable and your feelings are a normal response to what you are experiencing physically.  It is just a lot to deal with. The doctor said that the inflammation seemed to be over and therefore I should use protopic instead. Still there is some bleeding and sores left tho. I am going to use protopic for 3 weeks. Interesting what you say, I think I will send a message to him next week and ask Is that a steroid? Have you been officially diagnosed with LS? I agree with what you say. I think it is strange that they have not found a treatment that completely solves the problem, especially when it comes to the genitals, which is one of the most important organs we have. We must hope that they will find a treatment, such as some form of laser or other treatments, that can remove all discolored areas and make the skin as good as new. I didnt think it could be LS because it is so extremely rare for a man of 20 to get. Thus, it was extra difficult to get the message. I am down right now, but I think it is natural and normal at first. Waiting and seeing how the effect of protopic has before we possibly consider trying another treatment. I think it becomes difficult to go to parties etc, because you constantly think \"I am the one with LS among this group\" which makes you feel insecure and unable to let go. We must try to look at the other good qualities we have and pray that they will find a method that solves the problem eventually. It is at least good to have an LS group like this, where you can discuss and support each other. If you are reporting the doctor\u2019s comment accurately, I would seriously suggest getting a second opinion. I wish you all the best. Yes I have been  diagnosed with LS. I used dermovat for a week but after I was at the doctor at thursday  and had a check, he said I should use protopic for 3 weeks cause the worst inflammation happened 2 months before I got to the doctor, cause I thought for a long time it was a combination of balanitis and tears from sex. I had two weeks with very ill blisters on glans where I couldnt pull the foreskin back. Unfortunately I had no idea that it could be LS so I didnt do anything and thought it would go over by itself. That was a big mistake. It has formed scars (white areas) on glans and the doctor said I was late and that  I couldnt anything with the white colour, so protopic was the best solution. (Btw: english is not my native language, tell me if theres something you dont understand\") And its not a steroid. Its new compared to dermovat Same. 40/M. It is demoralizing. My penis is a total monstrosity. I have even considered getting a penectomy so I do not have 2 live with this shit. Hope you can find a solution my friend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe It sucks brother, but together we are stronger. A penectomy and then a reconstruction you considering? Yup. Hoping it can look normal again. Hi! woman in her 20s here. I promise, the good ones will not care. I have vulvar LS and it completely changed my anatomy, my labia are neat non-existent tbh, and its a weird colorful mess. But I had an ex who really did not care! I promise you will be alright in finding a woman who does not care either. The white areas can fade over time with the steroid ointment. It is recommended to take a bath for 15-20 minutes before application and rub it in reaaaalllllly well because the skin needs to be reached at the basement level! Wishing for your peace my friend! Borax baths. 1/4 C in bath daily for 6 months and skin will go back to normal. Then he is leaky gut. \nHi sir,\n\n\nIs your issue mainly an appearance issue or do you have crazy pain and burning?\n\nWhat treatment have you tried consistently so far with no improvement? \n\nWhat is the doctors opinion? I am going to see a dermatologist Friday morning. My issue is mainly appearance. It is embarrassing! I used to use a steroid ointment but stopped after practically no results.. huge mistake.", "Diagnosed with LS - Male - 24   \n\nHello, \n\nSeeing as there is not a great deal of information or support for men with LS, I thought I would chime in on my experience having recently been diagnosed with this auto-immune disease. \n\nAfter ending a long-term relationship at the start of the year, I was concerned I had some sort of issue with my penis (I knew this was not an STD). \n\nI went to multiple sexual health clinics, who carried out plenty of tests to check if I had an STD, which all returned negative. \n\n***Symptoms: Brown and White Patches on Penis Head***\n\nSo as you can imagine, I was worried.\n\nI ignored having the head of my penis biopsied, and all information about it was concerning men, in their late 50's with penile cancer, which ended up worrying me even more. \n\nEventually I came around to the idea, as I wanted to know what the hell was going on. The biopsy was painful but necessary. Shortly after, I was diagnosed with LS. \n\n***Medicine for Lichen Sclerosis:***\n\nRecommended by my dermatologist, I have a shower emollient cream called 'Dermol 500'. \n\nThis is to help dry skin, and for use as a soap substitute. I also have a moisture barrier application (vaseline), to ensure that the area stays clear of irritation. \n\nI have been prescribed Elocon, a potent corticosteroid that I no longer use, as it irritates my skin. \n\n***Treatments:*** \n\nI have been treated by a leading dermatologist in the UK, who has advised against PRP or 'P' Shot in order to 'rejuvenate' the skin of my penis. I have been advised that it can lead to numbing, which is something I do not wish to have. \n\nI have been living a healthier lifestyle since diagnosis, trying to remove major stressors as I believe that this can bring on symptoms. \n\n\\- Low GI diet (less white carbs)\n\n\\- Regular exercise \n\n\\- Vitamin D supplements \n\nI do not think it is the end of the world, I did ask about why this skin condition had been so rarely researched, to which my doctor replied something along the lines of:\n\n\"Pharmaceutical manufacturers do not see a great profit in treating conditions like LS, and therefore it is hard to get funding behind new medicine to adequately treat the condition\". \n\n***Main Concerns:*** \n\nCosmetically, my penis does not look 'regular' and having to explain that I have what is essentially vitiligo on my penis (with a new partner), is daunting. \n\nI do not want women assuming I have some sort of crazy STD that is turning my penis brown and white. This is probably my biggest insecurity at present, and is stopping me from even dating at this point (depressing me out). \n\nRe-assurance would be cool\\*. \n\n***Would be happy to answer any questions about:*** \n\n\\- Penile biopsy. \n\n\\- Corticosteroid efficacy. \n\n\\- Timeframe. \n\n\\- Pain associated. Betnovate (betamethasone valerate 0.1%) twice daily cleared it up for me after a few months (prescribed by urologist). I am 29. I only had thickened white skin, no dark or brown.\n\nThe first bout around age 25 was cleared up by hydrocortisone 1%, which did not work the second time around.\n\nAlthough the urologist initially said it is lichen planus, and when I mentioned it matches the penile LS pictures online he said LS and LP are the same thing. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f His treatment worked anyway so I was not fussed. Hey, thanks for taking the time to respond.\n\nI will look into Betnovate as it is documented to be similar to Elocon. It is probably best I find some non-irratable medication for medium to long term use. \n\nIf I may ask the question, when you applied this, cosmetically did your skin return to normal? Physically, did you suffer less discomfort with LS? Yes, my skin is normal now after the Betnovate. You cannot tell I had LS/LP.\n\nI only had some mild pain/discomfort during sex or masturbation, which is gone now. Hey, thought i would give an update. \n\nJust been prescribed Clobatesol and seeing remission in all cosmetic marks! Only on day 2 though, so will probably make a new post after my prescribed 2 weeks of treatment. Can you tell us how the treatement went? Can you please explain how you treated yourself, please? Does biospy hurt?", "If you went into remission/healed up to be closer to normal: how long did it take? Self-explanatory post title. Been in treatment for about four months, starting with clobetasol which was too strong, then mometasone, and then finally being tried on trimovate as all the white lichen has cleared up but I have some raw pink patches remaining that do not seem to want to shift. (Sorry to repeat what I have said in other posts, just adding for context.) Only 5 days into trimovate now but it would be really helpful to know how much of the raw parts not being healed is the fact I still need to find the right treatment, and how much of it is simply that I need to give things more time. Thanks!", "Help - anyone receive a penis skin graft? Hi, 39m, have had lichen sclerosis for about 15 years now. I had a circumcision 8 years ago (I also had one as a child) and it took away most of my shaft skin and left me with a hurried penis. It came back after the surgery, so now I need to have all the shaft skin removed and a skin graft from my thigh. \n\nI am pretty terrified about this. Has anyone had this before that can share their experience with me? \n\nAlso, I am dying to know what it looks like in the end. Has anyone had it that can share pictures? Anything I look up online either shows the surgery itself or phalloplasty (transgendered constructed penis\u2019).", "Steroid cream, is it working or making things worse? To be brief - I have been having symptoms of vaginal burning for over a year now. It was accompanied by the frequent need to urinate but a urologist has since helped clear that portion up. Still left with burning. My first gyno visit told me she saw evidence of lichen sclerosus so wanted me to use a steroid cream and follow up in a couple months.\n\nBeen using it now for over 2 weeks and I cannot help but feel it isnt really working. In fact, what used to be only a handful of burning days a month, now I seem to be burning now more than not. It does seem to be in the general area she pointed out (it was hard to pin point where the burning was if it was outside or inside). I do not even know what I am looking for because I cannot really tell if I am seeing white patches or it is just shiny. It does look like I am a bit red down there. All she told me was to put it on the hairless part once a day for a month at first.\n\nSo I guess I am just not really sure if it is supposed to be like this or not? Like does it get worse before it gets better? Should I give it more time? Maybe putting it on agitates it and its in fact working overall if I just be patient? Or maybe the burn I am feeling is something else and LS is not what is causing it after all... I dont seem to be itching, just burning.\n\nI am using Clobetasol Propionate Ointment. Any info is appreciated! Oof.  You probably want to follow up with the doc.  Clobetasol is really potent -- if it is not helping in two weeks, you should check on whether you should continue using it.  Steroid ointments also thin skin -- I would not use it blindly and just hope for several months if I was not pretty darn sure it was lichen sclerosus.  (Also, I am not your doctor, so I could be wrong.  My doc also said hairless part, but twice a day for two weeks, not once a day for ONE month. In the end, that is the same amount of applications.)\n\nIt does not get worse before it gets better, in my experience.  The only sudden \"worse\" is a tear in the skin, where a several inches long section of skin will just ... gap.  Then it will hurt horribly until it scars over, tightening everything down, because LS is BS.  But I went from crazy obvious awful LS to \"completely fine\" in a couple of weeks with clobetasol.\n\nI have never had burning caused by the application of this ointment. I assume you are putting it on gently, and not using, say, exfoliating gloves. :-)  The ointment itself *should not* burn, in my experience.\n\nAre you familiar with Interstitial Cystitis? Ruled that out?  Vaginal pain plus bladder issues are a giant red flag for that.\n\nSafe to assume you already tried a course of yeast treatment?  I know you said \"burning\" rather than \"itching\", but man, those two sensations are REALLY hard to separate sometimes.  I would not discount yeast just because you are not itching. Sometimes I cannot tell the difference between yeast and LS flares at first.\n\nSafe to assume your doc considered more-common STIs before jumping to less-common LS, I hope?? Some of them can hang out a long time before causing pain.\n\nAre you on birth control? Hormonal changes can wreak havoc with LS -- if this became an issue after going on BC, or going off it, or whatever, that is worth a look.\n\nAre you using any other creams or ointments?  Some of them can cause irritation. Using nothing but water is good.  \n\nCotton undies, no thongs is standard advice as well. Thongs rub and irritate and spread bacteria where you do not want it.\n\nI am only one example, so this is just my personal experience.  Clobetasol does not burn me on application, and two weeks was enough to notice a life-fixing dramatic improvement. There is no standard to say \"this is definitely how it is for everyone\", unfortunately. \n\nHope you can find some relief soon.  Do not be afraid to keep getting opinions or to be precise in what you are experiencing - docs are not super great at respecting what women say they feel. If you know what you feel, write it down, keep a record, and maybe bring it with you to future appointments so they do not railroad you into a diagnosis they think fits their models.  If your current doc does not have anything else to try, keep looking!  Good luck. Thank you for all the good info. :) I guess it is *almost* been two weeks of using it, (just over two since the appointment) I will give it til then and then consider making a call. I would not say the cream itself burns - but close to two weeks and it feels rather sensitive to burn even more so. :( Probably not good!\n\nUTI is what is started out \"feeling\" like. 3 urine cultures said I had no infection. I did also treat for yeast with the pill.\n\nIC was what my urologist intially considered. After doing a scope that found nothing and trying out the diet and Pyridium (aka AZO) pain meds that did not seem to make a difference, he figured it might be more gynocology related since the bladder issue of having to pee all the time was solved with OAB meds (life changer!). I also discovered that yes, it did seem to be worse around my period (not exclusive to then, but my chances of discomfort were much higher). I have switch BC during this once, without too much difference other than this one is monophasic so less hormone changes and I am trying (by 2 doctors recommendations) to take it continously to see if that helps.\n\nIf it helps, the gyno is going to check my cervix in 2 months since it bled easily during the pelvic exam (otherwise no abonormalities found). I think she said she would check for STIs then, apparently the swabs are also used for COVID? Unsure if this could be the actual cause of burning or what. I did a pap test as well. I will also add, sex has been hard accomplish now for a number of months. Too tight and hard inside me, hurts both me and my partner. It is hard to imagine it would be an STI only because we have only ever been with each other but certainly I want to rule it out.\n\nI am glad to hear it worked out for you! Here is hoping I find my solution too soon! How are your symptoms? Any improvement? Interesting you should ask now! In the morning I will finally be getting my colposcopy but also I will be getting a vulvar biopsy to confirm whether or not I do have lichen schelorus. I will have to update again when I get results.\n\nBut I DID go back to my doctor about my cream, who told me to stop it since it increased symptoms. A week later I was back to \"normal\" - for me that is only experiencing symptoms about a few times a month rather than a few times a week as I was on that cream. I think too taking BC continuously is helping maybe a small amount, since my hormones are staying more consistent. Only flares I got this month were related to urinating, not clothing, since its summer and I have exclusively worn dresses all throughout. No shorts this summer again for me.\n\nSo all in all - much better than I was on the cream! I will post again once I find out my results! Might not be LS after all. Thanks for asking!! Curious to know how your colposcopy went? Thank you for asking! I still am awaiting results, my next appointment is mid October since they wanted a solid 6 weeks before bringing me back in, for me to heal completely before beginning whatever treatment I need. Sadly I was unable to find out via the receptionist. But I can assume it is not serious, if they found anything at all?\n\nAs for the colposcopy, it was really an unpleasant experience and far more painful than I thought it would be. I suppose after being unable to have intercourse for so long, have that tool shoved way up there in that manner really shocked my system and hurt, and it continued to hurt the whole time. They grabbed some biopsies, which in general was not super painful but VERY uncomfortable, as I felt the squeezing along with being in pain from the tool insertion.\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to learn much then from the doctor, if anything I might have irritation there that I may or may not need to fix but she couldnt confirm? Hoping the biopsies can give a more solid answer on that end.\n\nAfterwards I also had a vulvar biopsy which I dont think I was fully frozen for, but at that point of being in pain first from the colposcopy and then from the sharp needle, I just wanted to get it over with. It was a rough day ahead, and the vulvar site hurt for a solid week and a half after, but I am feeling pretty good now finally.\n\nEven if it all comes back negative my doc has a plan apparently so that is good. Hoping something will work. Been dealing with issues in general since May 2019 and unable to have intercourse comfortably now since Dec 2019... that and this process of elimination is really taking its toll. Once I know results I can make another post! Thank you for the update! I am going through the exact same thing. I have seen multiple urogyno/urologists and now I have finally seen a gynaecologist that told me it really looks like I have LS. I also do not have any white patches. Just painful urination and vulvar burning.I Am on the same steroid cream as you mention. It has only been a few days but I actually feel like I am in more pain from the cream. Typically the burning comes and goes and now it is just constantly there since I started the cream. I have an appointment for a colposcopy next week. The detailed description of your appointment has helped me understand what to expect. Please keep us up to date on your final diagnoses. I know it is not easy, hang in there! It certainly sounds like you share a similar experience to me, very sorry to hear. Precisely how I reacted to the cream and, while I personally have not spotted any white patches on me, my gyno claimed I looked \"pale\". \n\nWishing you well as you have your colposcopy and quick healing! I hope you take it better than I do (seems to be the majority who say it \"should\" be virtually pain-free, but that was not my experience). I guess at least the colposcopy portion healed up far quicker than the vulvar biopsy I had in addition. Anything to get answers, huh? I sure will update once I know. Take care too! :)", "Was supposed to have my biopsy today But as my gyno was explaining LS to me, I burst into tears. I have been battling endometriosis and I am on my period, so the thought of even someone touching my today made me squirm. She gave me a steroid prescription, she is sure it is LS but needs to do the biopsy for a diagnosis.\n\nI do wish I had just done it, but I know that I made the right choice for myself in the moment. I am booked again for three weeks time. Hang in there. Hopefully the steroids bring some relief I have heard that sometimes steroid treatment prior to biopsy can mess up the results. Maybe look into that first? You do not want to go thru the biopsy just for it to be inconclusive! Thanks I will look into that. I suppose I could hold off for another 3 weeks. Just what I read when I was doing research on LS. Not sure why someone downvoted me lol biopsies are not fun. Good luck though\ud83d\udc95 Your choice is totally valid. Some doctors feel that every case should be confirmed with biopsy, but many feel that if the case is clear enough from appearance/symptoms it does not need a biopsy. Either way, it is your body and totally your right to refuse or postpone. If your insurance covers the treatment, and the treatment works, I believe the diagnosis is not that important anyway. Especially since most of the conditions that are differential diagnoses for LS are also treated with steroids. That makes sense, but I do not know if I would hold off treatment over it. I think sometimes biopsies are inconclusive without treatment, too. I have not had one yet, but I have a family member who had many of them over the years for suspected LS and they were all inconclusive. Now they are saying it is Zoon's (plasma cell) vulvitis instead but the treatment is similar anyway, and the biopsies made her super miserable. Anyway I totally agree OP should not go through a biopsy at 3 weeks if it is likely to be inconclusive, especially if her gyno is \"sure\" it is LS. Maybe OP can skip it altogether? Agree. Whatever her and her doctor thinks is best for her! Thanks for the kind words. Luckily Medicare in my country covers most of the costs.", "Just diagnosed today out of the blue, relief but questions for those with treatment experience So glad I found this group.  F29, just diagnosed today after making a preconception appointment.  My OBGYN knew immediately what it was; I had no clue anything was wrong.  I literally just thought pain after/during sex was normal.  I have been dealing with tearing for a while and my husband does not say much, but I think he too thought it was normal?\n\nQuestion.  I was prescribed a steroid cream.  OBGYN said I could put it on twice a week for 10 days, not a lot is needed.  After reading some of these posts it sounds like if you do not keep up with it, it will come back.  I know everyone is different, but what are your experiences?  Do you have flare ups/how often?  What the hell is reabsorption all about!?  What are your favorite websites for more in depth information... all I am finding is surface level info. I get flare ups when I stop using it, they come over the next couple days. Also, for me personally, I am heavily affected by the side affect that the cream induces yeast infections. It definitely helps with the scarring and pain, but it causes other problems as well.  Yeah both the doc and the pharmacist were like\u2014 only use a little bit, just a little...   so I am assuming that is to avoid the yeast infections.  I am just floored that I actually have something and I thought it was normal. I probably use it a few times a month now and often if I have a yeast infection. My doctor says it is fine to use while pregnant and I have used it through both my pregnancies.  I never knew it was linked to yeast infections. I had chronic yeast infections before I got diagnosed and still get them. I have not noticed more since I started the cream but I also get them often so it is hard to tell.  That is good info to know.  I was going to call and ask about pregnancy in a few months if it did not clear up or if I needed to apply it more frequently. My doc had me use the steroid cream every day for two weeks (it does not take much). Now it is three times a week, and it is under control. If a miss a few days, though, I start to get symptoms again.  I have never gotten a yeast infection from it.  Also, I use coconut oil and Young Living lavender down there.  I used it for years to control the itch before I found out what I had. You just want to use a natural lavender and not synthetic stuff\u2014natural lavender has anti inflammatory properties!  I also have a moisture barrier (similar to Vaseline in a tube) that I will put on if I will be wearing skinny jeans or leggings to protect my skin. \n\nAs soon as you feel heat, pain, or itch, treat it!\n\nAlso, my diet greatly affects it.  If I am eating a carb high diet, I get flare ups.  I am about to start Keto because it reduces inflammation internally, which in theory should reduce inflammation there and my immune response. Might be worth trying! I would not recommend Keto unless you are very overweight and need a complete lifestyle change.  Husband is a nurse at a children\u2019s hospital and when they have kids go on it to reduce seizures, they have very strict measures in place to make sure their kidneys are protected.  You have to drink a lot of water to make it somewhat safer.  Overall, yes you will lose weight, but at what cost to your body long term.  \u2014off soapbox now\u2014 Hormones seem to determine flareups, for me. I have reabsorption and that is how my LS was diagnosed. Basically, the inner labia were partially absorbed into/fused with the outer labia.", "Information series on remission and flares Hey, all!\n\nJust wanted to let you all know I just uploaded a new video in my LS general information/terminology fundamentals series. \n\nIn this video, I discuss what remission is, what flares are, and give tons of examples to help better understand these terms.\n\nHope you find it helpful.\n\nCheck out the video here: (\n\nor you can always watch the videos straight from my website (", "Anyone have this but barely notices? Is anyone living a normal life with this? Or had a progressed case that was halted by the creams and now feels normal? Looking for inspiration There is some success stories with the right diet, creams and luck. Underwear type and general management can assist Mine is very well managed with the clob. I barely notice it most of the time and before I was diagnosed it would literally wake me up at night. Good luck to you! That makes me feel better! Any fusion? Or atrophy? And how did you know you had it Me. Idk why but I come here and feel guilty bc I feel like I should be struggling as much as everyone else bc it is so crappy. I had three solid years of scratching for hours throughout the night until I bled, I was unable to sleep at night because of it. I was on anxiety and depression meds bc it was making me feel mentally awful. Sex became non existent. My GP kept saying I was imagining it because you could not see anything every time I went to an appt which was like every 4-6 months. It is like the flare up would disappear for 5 minutes when it came time for my exam. After three years I finally saw a dermatologist after doing research on my own (googling, blogs, podcasts) and after just 2 minutes of talking to my derm, he knew exactly what it was- even before looking at my skin. After about 2 solid months of following his regimen plan using clob, it basically went away. No more itching, no more tears, no more painful sex, I actually got an entire full night of undisturbed sleep, was able to go off of my anxiety and depression meds. \n\nBUT after a lot of time--- I think I have pieced together what triggered the LS. It started the same time I started taking the Depo shot. Which has no estrogen in it. Once I stopped taking that (same time I went to my derm appt) everything went 98 percent back to normal. I went on birth control pills and was fine for years, a flare up here and there but it was because of drastic weather change or sweating excessively at night. I would just put on the tiniest amount of clob and it would be gone within hours. Recently (4 months ago) I started taking a new birth control pill that is very low in estrogen and now I am getting flare ups again, more often. I am starting to notice a pattern that when my estrogen is low, it is causing flare ups. I have a doc appt in March coming up and I am going to talk about a new birth control that is considered a medium pill to see if a bit more estrogen will help keep the flare ups from popping up.\n\nGood luck\ud83d\udc9c I know not everyone is case is so mild. I know this can be super frustrating. If I have any tips to share- it would be to stop using wet wipes of any kind, use CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser as a feminine wash (the foaming one has alcohol and will make things wayyy worse), change your underwear before bed, wash you lady bits with water only, do not use feminine washes, using menstrual cups during flare ups is a game changer. I really hipe this ends up being my case since it is been less than a year that I have struggled but not gyno wants to diagnose me so I am currently waiting for. A dermatologist appointment. I use bethamethadone rn and estrogen xream. Went off bc to see if I would have less issues A dermatologist may be able to give you some better advice, different meds, and regimen. I hope the best for you. It is hard figuring out what is triggering it. If it is the birth control, it is unfortunate. Like with my case, I am allergic to latex. That is why I have always used birth control pills/shot. I ran out of pills this week so until March I will not be having sex so I am curious to see how my LS will be affected, if at all No fusion or atrophy that I am aware of. I found out because I was literally itching SO BADLY it would wake me up at night. The itching was the worst itch I have ever experienced. Then I contacted my doc and she did a punch biopsy to confirm. Clobetasol has worked for me. Reasonably normal life most of the time. i also come here &amp; feel pretty guilty bc i do not struggle as much as others. who knows tho, maybe things will change for me as i get older. i am only 30 &amp; i was just diagnosed a few days ago. literally the only thing i have is some white spots. maybe i have an itch here or there but it is never rly anything i feel like i need to scratch. Well managed and generally not an issue, but it does require some weekly maintenance. Was it caught early? Are you maintaining it with cream And now you have it under control? Any atrophy? Was it caught early Mine has been pretty much cleared up through using clob. I am on a maintenance schedule for treatment now and I still get some burning and rawness, but it is sooooooo much better than when I first started on the steroid. It did take quite a while to clear up though, so be patient!! No, I was 30. Mid forties now. i am on a low dose steroid ointment. at least for now until i see my doctor again in march I am waiting to be diagnosed idk what I have yet :( I am still waiting for my diagnosis :( are you able to have sex Are you getting a biopsy? I had one a few weeks ago so it was nice to get my diagnosis. \nAnd honestly that is still a work in progress. I can, but not for very long. I think my body has become conditioned to associate sex with pain, so I get really tense, which is my biggest problem right now, not the actual LS aspect of it. It is lame but I am slowly getting back to normal. what are your symptoms? i know i do not have many but i have been non stop reading &amp; researching for a few weeks now. \n\nat my last annual in 2019 the doctor mentioned something about my pigmentation being off &amp; asked if it was itchy. i said no &amp; then that was it, i did not even think of it as being anything concerning at all. then this last year right before my annual i started not feeling right &amp; had what i thought was a yeast infection that cleared up pretty quickly with some probiotics. but i have some crazy health anxiety that landed me in the ER like 5 or 6 times in december. one of the docs there mentioned lichen so of course i immediately got in with my doctor the next morning. she said to her it just looks like vitiligo but we will start this steriod &amp; talk about a biopsy in march. but with my anxiety i was like nah &amp; after a week on the ointment i called &amp; was like let us just do this now so i know. so i stopped the steroid for 2 weeks, went in for a punch biopsy &amp; a few days later they confirmed lichen. \n\nhopefully yours is not lichens but it is better to know as soon as you can than go years &amp; never now. i am in a facebook group &amp; a lot of those women went soooo many years misdiagnosed &amp; just suffered. i feel so awful. i hope mine never progresses! So is your skin just Paler? You can look at my post history and see all my pictures of my vagina getting paler and idk why... not crazy itchy. I am using a steroid now but will I have to stop it for a biopsy? My clitoris is dry and flaky I am trying to calm that down. I do not really tear but my skin has gotten very pale. Please look and see if it resembles yours And has the clob make the paleness go away? i just looked through some of the pictures you posted &amp; truthfully i cannot tell. every picture that i see of lichens looks different &amp; im not a doctor. i am not using clob, i am actually on a lower potent steriod for now until i see my doctor again in march. i just started it again &amp; only using it on 1 side until my biopsy site heals so i cannot comment on that just yet. \n\nwhat does your doctor say? do they think it could be lichens? Sorry has it made your paler areas back to pink? Using the steroids? My doctor says no white patches so no lichen and will not do a biopsy. Currently\nTrying to see a derm. I just do not want shit to progress.... like I am\nTrying to get on top of it quick Do not think so.  Not really sure. I ended up self diagnosing and self treating and only recently had it confirmed by a doc.  He just told me whatever I was doing seemed to be working, keep at it. Do you wear the steroid daily? surely does not hurt to get a second opinion. just keep an eye on it &amp; see if you continue to get paler. it is good that you are on top of it! good luck! After two years undiagnosed and ten months of treatment with Clob I am now on week 4 of ZERO symptoms. Just woke up one morning and it was gone. Still managing with some diet changes, clothing changes and skin care regime, but the pain and itch part (obviously the bad part) is gone. It is such a relief. For the first time in almost three years I can do things without consequence, like have sex, go to the washroom or get a weggie. It is a dream come true \ud83d\ude1d Props to you on ur patience and perseverance. Hope I get tot his point hehe. Did the skin become healthier? And how often do y apply clob Thank you! Cannot day there were not several meltdowns along the way. The skin seems pretty much normal now. I have a few scars from reoccurring tears but I only see them cause I am looking. I have one little area of fusing on my clit that I am watching very carefully but it does not seem to be changing. Now I am not using Clob at all. Just moisturizer twice a day and Vaseline overtop to reduce any friction. I think my clit is fusing. How do we stop that and if you were not using moisturizer would you split more often? I have no idea what to do about it to be honest. A doctor would be the pure to go for that. I am watching mine to collect satay to take back to my gp. For moisturizer 100%. I find that if I do not moisturize my skin just does not have the elasticity it needs. I moisturizer twice a day and lock it in with Vaseline overtop.  Does this sort of thing happen to you? I have been using estrogen cream, my steroid and aquaphor on it for anything to make her better lol Still have not even been diagnosed yet cuz doctors suxk Ummm, kind of. Hard to tell cause everyone is different. That is sucks about the diagnosis, took me two years to get a diagnosis. Weekly?  Every other week? I am on elocon, I was diagnosed this year and have a progressed case at 21 years old (loss of labia, clitoral fusing). I have not had a flare up in months after changing my diet and wearing only cotton or bamboo underwear. I barely even notice it now, other than having to use the ointment every other night. The fusing has seemed to stop as well, thank god. My sex life has completely gone back to normal, I just make sure to be hygienic afterwards otherwise I know I will have a flare up again. I choose to use dilators every now and then just to make sex comfortable. But no itching or pain at all! Does the clitoris still work?? I am worried that will affect my libido if it keeps fusing Surprisingly it is 100% fine, I have full sensation still and my boyfriend and I have good sex almost everyday! Try not to stress out too much, I know it is scary at first. I know I was really upset when I was first diagnosed, but the ointment should help it from getting worse (if it does not, or if it makes things worse go back to your doctor). There is a Facebook group that is been really helpful for support and tips that I would be happy to link you (although most of the women are 50+ years old which sometimes sucks because I feel like I am the youngest person who has it) but even if you want to chat about it feel free to message me. I am relatively ok.\nThat is said I made some changes in my life after diagnosis.\nFirst at time of diagnosis I was pregnant so very very hormonal.\nI no longer take oral hormones and not being pregnant helps \nI stopped wearing underwear this was a massive contribution . I wear skirts stockings no pants\nI only use paraben free SLS free hair shampoos I figure whatever I was putting on my my hair to wash was either sitting in water in a bath or was moving further down if I showered\nAlso incidentally I I started taking hydroxychloroquine after my third and final child I am taking this for another suspected auto immune disorder", "Has anyone used this cream?? Any thoughts??  Yeah I have, but I did not keep up with it properly. It did not feel like it did much for me honestly Initially helped with mine. Used twice daily Yes, it helped with my case! It is a very popular starting point, as I understand it. I have been using it for 2 years. It is the only thing I have been using and it works well. Sometimes I will feel a flare up where I get a fissure, put that stuff on and the next day it is gone. I have used this as well as the ointment version.  This does not feel as greasy/oily - but I do not think it works as well. What is the active ingredient in it? What is the steroid?", "Will this go away? Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with vulvar lichen sclerosus early this year (22F), after months and months of a constant itching accompanied by a burning sensation after itching around my vulva. After being told I had a yeast infection for many months, and the antibiotics I was prescribed not working, I finally decided to visit an OBGYN instead of planned parenthood/my college health center. As soon as the OBGYN examined me, she immediately noticed white patches between my labia majora and minora (in that crevice) - she diagnosed me with LS and prescribed me with clobetasol. This steroid cream eliminated the white patch along my labia and clit, and I thought everything would be fine now, since the white patches and itchiness were gone. Fast forward months later, I realized the LS white patches are still on my clit, as it tears very easily during sex and leaves me with a burning sensation when I urinate. I actually thought I had a UTI but my PCP said the test came back negative. My question is, although the white patches on my labia have disappeared, will the white patch on my clit ever disappear? Why did the cream help my LS on my labia and not my clit? I am so scared to have any friction or rubbing occur on my clit because I know the lichen will cause the skin to tear leaving me in so much pain. Has anyone had a similar experience as mine? Any advice or information would be so so greatly appreciated!! Are you continuing to to treat your skin with clobetasol? \nUnfortunately, this is a life- long, chronic condition. That is not to say you will always be in pain and will not have symptom free periods/remission, but you will need to treat it continuously. The first gyn that diagnosed me did not tell me that either, and I had kept having the same issues come back over and over. \nIt depends on case severity, but most people use the steroid daily or twice a day for at least a month (I was told to use it for 3), and then, once your symptoms clear up, you begin to taper the steroid down to once a day, every other day until you reach a maintenance dose of 2x week steroid applications. Since this is a long term issue, if you are not happy with the current care from your doctor, I highly recommend finding one you trust. Best of luck \ud83d\udc95 Btw I am 23 and was diagnosed at 22 too, so feel free to pm me if you want to vent or anything \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 I will!! Thank you so so much!! \u2764\ufe0f Adult vulvar LS is generally accepted to be a lifelong disease that needs ongoing treatment in order to stay in remission. In other words, the symptoms and even signs can go away, but they need continuing treatment or they will probably bounce back. For some people this means using clob once or twice a week, or even less, after they get things under control with the twice-daily dose and then taper down. \n\nAs for why the clob worked better on your labia, maybe the skin is thicker at your clit, maybe the inflammation was stronger there, who knows. Hopefully with more treatment, that patch may go away, too. You could also try another treatment like tacrolimus. I know that for my psoriasis, tacrolimus works well in some areas and clob works well in others, so I would not be surprised if the same were true for your LS. I am currently using tac and clob both for my LS (my dermatologist said I could). Was it itchy all the time? I definitely agree that the inflammation was likely stronger on my clit. That is where my itchy symptoms began. That specific area was so itchy for so many months and I think from constant scratching, the inflammation probably built up there, which makes sense why it is harder for the clob to treat. My labia was never really that itchy - I did not even know there was a problem there until my OBGYN moved my skin and noticed it. I will definitely follow up with my gyno/dermatologist, thank you for your advice!! It is just a bummer because I wish the LS would clear up as easily as it did on my labia Before getting diagnosed, yes!!! It was specifically just my clit that was so beyond itchy. The only time I would get relief was probably immediately after showering - I would not be itchy for probably an hour max but the itchyness returned very soon after that. Because it was so itchy, I would constantly scratch at it which would make the pain worse, and my clit area literally became swollen. So many healthcare providers just said it was a yeast infection, which I also thought it might be. I even thought there might be build up of secretion or bacteria or something (I was googling and reading every possible cause). After using the clob cream, my itchyness subsided literally after the second day of using it. I was finally given some relief. Now it is just a bummer because when having sex I have to be very careful that my boyfriend does not rub my clit too harshly (he has to be VERY gentle) otherwise I will tear and I get the sharpest knife-like pain. Even now, when I apply the clob (or hydrocortisone cream) on my clit, I will get a tingling sensation with a tiny bit of itchyness which will subside after a few minutes. Thank you for replying \ud83d\udc31 I use the clob on my labia probably 1x every week, however since my clit still is experiencing the itchyness and white spot (after months of using clob) I will use clob a couple times a week on that area. It just sucks bc I am not sure how I even got this - no one in my family has it. The only thing that I can think of is I was on birth control since I was 17, and stopped my birth control for about a year, and during this time I suddenly had this issue come up. Maybe there was a hormonal issue that triggered this? No idea lol but this is definitely so frustrating I am so sorry. It took me forever to get through the initial flare up- it takes a long long time of consistent steroid use for it to go away. Once a week is low amount of clobetasol even for maintenance after symptom control has been achieved. I would be using a pea size amount of it at least daily (no more than 2x/day) in the area with the white spots/symptoms or all over if you cannot tell where the pain is coming from. If your doctor is recommending the once a week application, I urge you to find someone else because that is not the standard of care for this condition. It takes several months of daily clob even up to a year, to get it under control for the majority of patients. Soaking in baking soda or borax prior to application can improve symptoms and the absorption of the medication. They also recommend rubbing it in for 60-90 seconds, but tbh I do not lol.  I also really like emuaid or v magic to smooth the pain. Emuaid is great for itching as well \n\n\nAnd same here!!! No one in my family has these issues whatsoever, I was so caught off guard Im still recovering from the shock. I was on the pill too and it made my symptoms worse so I came off but the pain did not go away, and I got diagnosed. It is so unfair and frustrating, words cannot describe. But it can be managed and I hope you are able to reach a more comfortable place soon. Definitely not fun to go through this in your 20s\ud83e\udd7a First, I would ask to switch to clobetasol in ointment form. Creams are not potent. When ointment is rubbed in, it will resist being washed away from urine, water, vaginas mucus, or rubbing. This is a lifelong condition, so lifelong treatment is a must! Usual protocol is once at night for one month, once every other night for another month, and then twice a week indefinitely. This is not my personal recommendation. LS has not been studied very much, but recent studies show the importance of treatment. It reduces inflammation, could reverse skin color changes (sometimes the pigment loss is irreversible), steroid also slows progression of anymore symptoms, and also constant steroid use prevents progression to vulvar cancer. This is obviously rare, but important to avoid. I use my steroid once Monday night, and Thursday night (clob lasts in your system for 3 days). It is best to take a bath before application, but after a shower, or after applying a wet cloth to soften the skin of the area. Dilators help with painful sex. Take it slow though! Listen to your body Almost forgot, LUBE LUBE LUBE! My OBGYN loves coconut oil as a natural lubricant. It makes sex much easier Ohhh ok thank you!!! This may be a stupid question but if the coconut oil goes into my vagina (if using it as lube) I will not get a yeast infection right? Even if I shower right after? My bad, I have the clob in the ointment form, I just accidentally wrote cream \ud83d\ude05 ok I will definitely up my usage!! I just got nervous that if I use it too much it might cause my skin to become thin? I read that somewhere on google but I will definitely take your advice. Also, are there certain foods you avoid? Lastly, since my LS is present more on my clit (if I lift up my hood I can see a small white patch) should I rub in the ointment or just glob it on? I have been globbing it on ever since I starting using it. I have been lucky that I was diagnosed just at the right time - I have not experienced any physical changes (no color change, no \u2018mutilation\u2019. I look pretty normal except for the small white spot) so sex is not painful unless my clit gets rubbed harshly, which is when my skin tears. I just hope I can get this white spot to go away soon \ud83e\udd7a thank you so much for your help, I really really appreciate it!! If you do not mind me asking, how long did it take you to get rid of your initial flare up? And I know, having this in your early 20s is so awful, but I am glad we got it diagnosed in time before it progressed into the more worse stages!! Thank you \u2764\ufe0f it is so nice to get advice from someone who is actually going through the same thing as me Additionally, are there any vitamin supplements that you guys are taking that you think have helped keep your symptoms low/in remission? Since this is an autoimmune condition, I was considering taking a daily immune system support vitamin (the one from one a day brand specifically) but was not sure if there is any others that seem to work for you guys You should not, but oil could break down the condom. So be careful if that is what you are using for protection. That is a huge myth. With LS, your vulva has loads of inflammation. There is a significant amount that is needed for pigment loss to take place. I have been applying ointment on my vulva for months and even the skin on my fingertips is fine! But keep in mind that LS skin is not normal skin. So if you put it on your stomach, for example, you will definitely get irritation. The twice weekly should not irritate you. But listen to your body! There is a study that is going out about the ties between gluten and LS. Keep an eye out on this forum bc it is getting published this fall. I will share the results when they are posted. But there are not really any triggers food wise as a whole that people notice. It is so individualized. You reeeeaalally need to rub in the ointment. Set a timer for 60-90 seconds and rub it all over the vulva. Ointments need to be rubbed in. So I have actually been treatment hopping quite a bit, so I think that if I had stuck to just one thing and waited, things would have gotten under control a lot sooner. But when I was first diagnosed, it took several months of clobetasol and borax to get to a place where sex was not painful, and a few more to get the symptoms under control. It is the slowest thing ever. And I agree! I also was caught early and am fortunate to not be that bad off. Hoping this thing dies off after a few years of vigilance\ud83d\ude02", "website with evidence based info &amp; mental/sexual health for Lichen Sclerosus  \n\nHi all.\n\nI wanted to announce that I have launched my official website for The Lost Labia Chronicles. I have spent the last few weeks working on this late into the evenings (when I am not working my day job or volunteering for a Lichen Sclerosus not-for-profit). My content centers around disseminating evidence-based information (and explaining the medical jargon that dominates the scientific literature), sexual health, and mental health.\n\nWhen you have a minute, please check it out by going to ( or clicking (\n\nThis website will house my blog, The Grief Project (wherein different people share their experience with grief and LS), and my YouTube videos. I have a few other goodies planned to go up at the end of the year and for 2022, so stay tuned and subscribe at lostlabia.com/subscribe.\n\nIf you have any feedback, I am all ears! Also, always down for content requests. I have a spreadsheet where I store all questions or topic requests. I have seen you on instagram before! Thank you for all the work on this. When I was first diagnosed, I did not know anyone who had LS or knew anything about it. Having a community that can relate and validate is so helpful Honestly, same here. I spent the first year after being diagnosed feeling completely isolated. Through virtual support meetups I have met hundreds of people with LS, get about 10 Dms a day form newly diagnosed folks, and know I actually know people in my personal life with LS. That is awesome! Thank u so much Good! As a partner of someone with LS it is great to see this information so well presented. I will be sharing this with her. Wow. Amazing - thank you so much. And props to you for being here; you are clearly an excellent partner!", "I am afraid to be told I have LS I am 20 (F) and I noticed a scar on my inner labia a few days back. It is whitish-blue in colour and seems roughly textured and elongated. There are a few minute tears due ro itching. I noticed a smaller one some weeks back but ignored it because I thought it was a reaction to itching which does not seem like a symptom because it only happens when I have not trimmed my pubic hair for some time. There is no discharge or pain. I am scared to tell my mother about it because idk how to start the conversation. Before taking all that stress, I thought it would be nice to know from people who actually have experienced it. Do these symptoms seem legit? I keep telling myself it is just due to itching and will heal but idk why it is white. Google really scares you, I did not even know it was a term before this It is best to get to a dermatologist or a gynecologist before worrying too much about it. There are a couple things that can be similar in presentation to LS. And even if it is LS, there is a lot you can do to ameliorate the symptoms. The photos online are fairly gruesome, but for some reason many are photos of pretty advanced cases. But not everyone with LS looks like that or will ever look like that. That definitely freaked me out when I first looked into what the heck these white plaques were, but then my dermatologist reassured me that I will not end up looking like that, as long as I stick to my treatment regimen. And he was right - I was diagnosed in 2019 and I have only seen an improvement with treatment. The white areas are gone and I have almost no symptoms these days. I lost very little of my inner labia before I started treatment and the steroid stopped the progression of any atrophy. \n\nDefinitely make an appointment with a doctor who is knowledgeable about LS as soon as you can. That way you can get it ruled out or, if it turns out it is LS, then you can start treatment ASAP. What a warm reaction! I am a 41 year old male. Diagnosed a year ago. Treatment stopped progression for me too. It is barely noticable now.\n\nGood luck to both of you! Thank you! I did contact a doc and they said it might be a yeast infection so I am hoping the medication works and it goes away. :) Update: It was a fungal infection, it is getting better now. Thanks.", "Devasted by white patches and need help! I was recently diagnosed with Lichen Simplex Chronicus (LSC confirmed via biopsy) and my OBGYN said that Clobetosol will help prevent it from progressing to Lichen Sclerosis. It is not even fully progressed (her words) and has taken my confidence and sanity. Well here is the issue: the **white patches**. I have absolutely no other symptoms - no itching, burning, tearing, or fusing or anything else. The white patches take up about 40% of my vaginal area. An important thing to note is that I am black, so the contrast is extremely jarring and makes me cry every time. I have not been able to find any research on vaginal skin hypopigmentation in relation to LS. I have been using the steroid for 28 days and now I am starting an every other day regimen per my doctor\u2019s instructions. I have been taking pictures every day and noticed that the skin around the white patches is starting to lighten too. I do not know what to do and cannot tell if it is helping. Can someone *please* just tell me about their experiences with discoloring? Did it ever go away? Do I have to get use to this or worse expect more in the future? I am just so broken over it and I am afraid that I will never look \u201cnormal\u201d again. I am personally lucky enough to not have discoloration (though that is about the only thing I do not have), but I hope others who have had it find this post and can tell you more. \n\nI think I heard someone say their patches went away, but I could be mis-remembering. Ultimately, it can take a while for clobetasol to start really getting into the skin and working correctly. It is a steroid and that could be why your normal skin is also changing color. If you can, I would call or message your doctor and ask if the normal skin changing color is expected. It is normal for you just want to make sure a side effect is expected. \n\nUltimately, as someone who is LS has progressed, (and might be a little salty about it) the visual is less important than the function, you know? Most people will not care what your vagina looks like - everyone is looks different anyway! I know that is not very reassuring. But know that no matter how many white patches you have, you are beautiful and worthwhile! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c I am so sorry to hear that this is causing you so much distress! That really sucks, much like this whole family of diseases. \n\nI actually thought that white patches were already a hallmark sign of LS, and biopsies are not always correct so I do wonder. It actually doesnt matter for you though since it is the same treatment. I would say a month on clobetasol should have cleared up these patches at least somewhat, so I would definitely ask your doctor. \n\nIt might also be worth asking about something called vitiligo. It can occur in the vulvar area too, and the skin lightening sounds like what you are talking about. \n\nI agree with the other reply too, because I also might be slightly salty that my LS is not as kind, that you are beautiful and worthwhile even with a fun colored vagina! And I can almost guarantee no guy or girl that goes down there is going to care! If they do they should not be down there anyway! ;) it does not make your suffering less valid, and again I am so sorry you have to go through this, but we are in it together and you are not alone! Oh I forgot to mention! My white patches got better with steroid treatment, but they were not very severe I think. \n\nYou might also want to look into joining the large Facebook group for LS aannnnnd read up there on borax baths. It might sound crazy, but there is many women there that have talked about their skin coloration improving from this. I am not endorsing as I have yet to try it, but it could be worth reading about at least! You are right. I am thankful that function has not changed, not everyone is so \u201clucky\u201d. It is good to hear that the ointment takes a while to show results - I think I am just anxious. Thanks for your insight I really appreciate it. It is interesting that you say biopsies are not always right. I had a biopsy some time ago and my pediatrician told me it was just eczema. So I ignore the discoloration because it happens from time to time with eczema. I only went to the OBGYN when the area grew really fast. Live and learn I guess. I am assuming LS and vitiligo are not mutually exclusive, so I will see if I have symptoms of that too. Thinking of having a fun colored vagina might be the only thing that gets me through this. Thanks for that insight! Because mine are so severe I expect it to take waaaayyyy longer than most people. I do not have a Facebook, but I will try to look up borax baths and see what they can do to help. Thanks for the suggestion! I have had severe discoloration from LS and yes! It did go away! It took many months of using clobetosol and getting it under control for it to look \u201cnormal\u201d again. When I flare up it is all white again but then goes back to \u201cnormal\u201d when it is back under control. I am white skinned and the area goes back to a healthy looking pink color. I hope that helps. If it is LS ... one piece of advice I got from a gyno was to make sure to massage it in very well. Spend a lot of time massaging clobetosol into the skin/patches. Otherwise it just comes off on your underwear. The massaging helps with the blood circulation to the area as well. This was really helpful! I am hoping my white patches go away with time again. It happened once when they were smaller but now my vaginal opening is pretty white. That was a really great point that it is function over the look. And also the feel. The steroid ointment can help restore the texture of your skin even tho it takes a while and something the lichen has already progressed enough by that point. I feel the same way about my vulva and hymen ring/vaginal opening turning white. I am just using my steroids and having positive thoughts! It really does take some time. When I was first diagnosed I had silvery white stripes up and down my labia minora and with two years on steroid ointment I saw they went away even though I had developed white on the edges of my vulva and vaginal opening. Good luck to you and just have positive thoughts... easier said than done. But stress hurt me so much worse than the reality of how my lichen was actually progressed. To ensure further function, consider dilators to keep you vagina stretched out. Also think about your diet. Maybe try an elimination diet. I found that dairy is a trigger for me. I still have phases where I consume it but the phases where I keep it out of my diet I feel much better. I also got off birth control as it triggered all of my symptoms. A daily moisturizer like coconut oil or emu oil might help soothe the area if you have other symptoms. I would also stay as hydrated as possible. Good luck!!! You have a whole support group right here!!!", "Crossposting here after no response in r/womenshealth  My doctor insisted that I stop taking oral birth control when I was diagnosed, however doing so did not change my symptoms at all. I had been on them for a number of years before diagnosed (also have endometriosis, and BC gave me my life). I am pretty sure I would always had LS, just did not get diagnosed until thirty. \n\nI went off to have kids. I went on progesterone-only pills while breastfeeding. I went back on monophasic pills after that. And now in my forties I have stopped them altogether. \n\nDoes not seem to really affect LS. My case is not terribly severe. I need the clob a few times a year. If I let it get out of hand I will crack open (terribly painful) and scar and pull everything tighter and more wrong... hate it ... but if I am in touch with things, I can stop it with a day or two of clob. That is really all it seems to take for me now. But getting off the pill did not fix it all up, no. Thanks for the breakdown! I was on BC prior to diagnosis and came off it in the past year. I have noticed less tearing of skin but I suspect that is down to my body naturally producing more lubrication instead of the hormones impacting on skin. Www.facebook.com/groups/lichensclerosislichenplanusskindisordersupport Long before I knew I had LS, I started experiencing severe burning and pain after intercourse. I went to so many doctors and gyns, and was only diagnosed with infections despite many clean cultures. Eventually I noticed that I felt better during my placebo week, and went off the pill entirely. My burning and painful sex disappeared in 24 hours. I was left with super irritated skin,  which was still extremely bothersome so I pursued answers. I finally got diagnosed, but the doctor did not know much about LS other than to identify it. He put me on 6 wks of clob and said the LS \u201cwould go away\u201d after that, did not schedule a follow up or show me how to use the medication. I slathered myself in clob for 6 weeks and sure enough, I was 90% symptom free at 6 weeks. I stopped, felt amazing and was so happy! 2 weeks later the pain with sex/burning returned, but not to the degree that it was while using birth control. I have since found better doctors and have made good progress in treating my LS. I also use estrogen cream 3x per week.  I do believe, that for me, BC is a trigger. I have heard from other women that BC has no affect on their LS, and I have heard from some that it helps control flares by regulating hormone/cycles. Some also use it minimize their number of periods since periods can trigger flares. LS is very individual.", "Itchiness and swelling Just today I got quite noticeable, but not too bad itching on one of my labia (along the scar where my labia minora used to be). \n\nI applied moisturiser in case it was just a bit dry but the itching did not ease at all and this evening I had a look and the side that was itching appears red and swollen but the other side is not. \n\nI was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if so, what came of it and how did you ease the symptoms? \n\nI have taken ibuprofen for the inflammation to see if it helps and applied my Clobetasol as prescribed. It is just weird because I have not made any changes to what I am doing and I have never experienced this before. For the itch, ice packs may help. If the itch is really bad, you could always try and OTC allergy pill. \n\nHow are you currently treating and for how long (this will help me give better advice)? I am just about to enter the third stage of the intensive Clobetasol treatment so applying once daily at the moment for the next week or so then it is down to the twice a week routine Gotcha. In that case, hard to say for certain what is going on. Typically, folks with LS fall Into one of the following 3 categories: folks triggered by hormones, diet, or stress. Since you have not changed your diet, you may fall in hormones and or stress. If stress, you would want to apply strategies that help you distress. Hormones can be tricky, but I would you can identify when in your cycle you flare, you can talk to your doctor about potentially controlling it by altering your steroid schedule or strategically using birth control to manage flare ups. Also, there is a possibility you have developed a vulvar yeast infection (which is different from typical candida which is accompanied by discharge). Vulvar yeast infections do not have discharge but do have itch and inflammation. Therefore, it might be helpful to get checked out and make sure it is LS causing the symptoms and not something else. There is a small subset of folks that are more prone to these infections with the use of steroids (see Dr. Gayle Fischers research) and this is typically controlled with a preventative anti fungal protocol such as nystatin and or my reducing the frequency with which you use the steroids or reduce the potency of the steroid. Beep. Boop. I am a robot.\nHere is a copy of \n\n###( \n\nWas I a good bot? | ( | ( Thank you so much for your reply, it is really informative! I will probably get my dr to help me figure out what it is then as I do not have any discharge but a few days ago I had a thrush like appearance all over but it cleared up almost immediately with clotrimazole so it could be the vulvar yeast infection! Would make a lot of sense Yes that is very possible, especially since you did not change anything lifestyle and diet wise. In the meantime, allergy meds, warm bath or sitz baths, and, ice packs can help reduce the itch a bit. Hope you feel some relief soon.", "PRP shots? Has anyone here ever received PRP shots. I am about to have my first session in about a week and I am nervous. I have heard great things about the procedure and it is supposed to rejuvenate the vulvar skin, but I would like to know if anyone has had any personal success with it or has any tips or suggestions.\n\nI have also been using a moisturizer, clobetasol steroid ointment, and estrogen cream and my NP said I will still have to keep using them after the PRP sessions in order to maintain and prevent the lichen sclerosis from coming back. Following - I am curious about this too, but have not tried this before. I just got my first session of PRP shots two and a half weeks ago!! Message me if you have any questions. I would be more than happy to share my experience with you or anyone else who is interested! I am very interested in how it went!  It is something I have been discussing with doctors for a while now but I have been holding off on actually doing it.", "does the internet make ls seem worse than it really is? obviously, some cases are quite bad, but i have surprisingly seen a LOT of people say that it is nowhere near as bad as google makes it seem. is that true? Mine has been god awful. When I get a bad flair up I cannot even sleep I am in so much pain. Piper medication makes a huge difference but I do not think I will ever be able to have sex without some sort of pain. I have not googled it in twelve years so I guess I will not start now. \n\nIn a flare, it sucks. Outside of that, my life is normal. Take care of yourself and you will have fewer flares. It is extra special bullshit that when life throws you difficult changes and stress that your body reacts by splitting cracks wide open in your vulva. Thank you, body, THAT IS NOT HELPFUL.\n\nDifferent for everybody. But it CAN be okay. It is not awesome. But it can be okay. lol, definitely. i heard that if detected before any breakage of the skin, it can be treated fairly easily. is that also true? It heals up quicker if you catch it before you split open, yeah.  But it will heal. And come back later. Then heal. And come back later. \n\nCatching it as things are just starting to flare and getting on the clobetasol right away is the best thing to do. is sex completely out the window? that is what i fear losing most, lmao. that and orgasms. Where is this information coming from? I have not googled LS in a super long time (diagnosed 15 years ago). \nYes it sucked initially, I had crazy itching and had trouble sleeping and pain from cracking skin - but it is certainly not a death sentence of your sex life.  Use creams, go see a pelvic floor physio if you are able to. Listen to your body on autoimmune flares, etc. Not trying to be dismissive, but also not fear mongering!! yeah! i have seen a few people on here say stuff like this, how google sometimes makes it seem so much worse than it is, sometimes. Not out the window. When not in a flare, everything is fine.  Like seriously fine. Do not do things that hurt. Make sure you are getting plenty lubricated. I recommend avoiding dry pounding. But I would recommend avoiding that anyway!\n\nIt is all about the lubrication and the readiness. A partner that takes their time and listens and is not selfish. If you are afraid of annoying them if you need to dial back for a few minutes or switch things up, then that is a bad partner for LS. Maybe a bad partner for anybody, but there is a fuckton of selfish people out there. \n\nMy constant advice is that everybody get damn good at enjoying giving and receiving some oral. Does not hurt and everybody likes it. And it makes it easier day for you to have penetrative sex if it makes you damn wet AND it shortens the length of practical time in penetrative sex. If, ya know, you even GET to that part. Nothing wrong with everybody getting happy orally and collapsing in a happy heap of noodle for a while. If a flare threatens, that works well. \n\nBut for me, the treatment is effective. No flare? I do what I want 80-90% of the time. oh god. even without ls, why would one WANT to do dry pounding? i cringe at the thought of it...but thank you. i just read so many horror stories about ls that i am like \"well fuck :)\" and cry...like an idiot. It is different for everybody. I think everyone getting a new diagnosis has a major adjustment to make - it is pretty tough. And sometimes, it is awful. And maybe after menopause I will revise my opinion. But diagnosis was the best thing in the world for me because it made the pain and itching and torture STOP after so many horrible years. My horror stories are from the before-time, so far. \n\nWhen it does flare up one of the worst parts is how socially unacceptable it is to tell people. What is wrong? Uh, cramps? Because I cannot say I HAVE A RIP IN MY VULVA AND EVERY TIME I MOVE IT BURNS AND PEEING IS TORTURE. MY VAGINA SUCKS RIGHT NOOOOOOWWWWW\u201d. People would think I am a weirdo. But dammit I want the sympathy! \n\nBut that is the worst because I am still out and doing things and living. Not fucking that week. But living. All of this is accurate. I imagine coming to this sub can be scary because at least half the posts are terrified \u201cIS THIS LS????\u201d posts, while the other half is those of us who have LS sharing tips and tricks to avoid scary-sounding symptoms, but the truth is that everyone is going to handle the pain differently, and part of living with LS is accepting and living with the pain rather than letting it control you... this is the truth that we must learn to live with when experiencing any type of chronic pain. Yes, it hurts sometimes. Yes, it will decrease your quality of life and make you feel very unsexy sometimes. You will learn to use clobetasol and ice packs and underwear-free days. The thing I recommend most highly for anyone newly diagnosed beyond the medication is THERAPY if you can manage it. As hard as this disease is on the body, I would say it is harder on the mind. Sending lots of hugs to all and feel free to send me a DM if you need. \ud83d\udc95", "Post punch biopsy blood loss  When I got mine done, I made the mistake of looking at the little table the doctor had put all the biopsy supplies on. Almost fainted from seeing HOW MUCH BLOOD THERE WAS. I had to lay back down reaaaaaal quick. At least it is painless :) I fucking hated getting the biopsy. The first couple of days after are the worst. Do not be afraid to call the doctor's office if you continue to have bleeding that is concerning. Omg \ud83d\ude2d I am supposed to get one. Absolutely terrified do not be scared. it is the best way to get a diagnosis! i did not bleed at all Why is all the blood *under* the pad? I guess j was not positioned on top of it Been there You will be okay! The lidocaine shot is the worst part Oh man I am getting a biopsy in a few weeks\u2019 time and I was not prepared to see this \ud83d\ude02", "LS and low estrogen I just got the results from my biopsy back - I do have lichen sclerosus :( but my doctor also thinks I have low estrogen due to my Mirena IUD. So right now I am using topical estrogen cream while using clobetasol. I have been on clob for 3 weeks now with no real changes. I am getting frustrated with it because I just want my skin to feel better. Has anyone else had both low estrogen and LS? Did one resolve the other once treated? I am hoping the the estrogen cream will help my LS since the steroid does not seem to be. I am only in my late 20s and I am so sad my body has failed me like this. Just wanted to ask- are you using the clobetasol cream, or the ointment? The ointment is kind of like the consistency of petroleum jelly. I have heard the ointment is more effective. \n\nBut do not give upon your body yet! You can try a low o slate diet, or low inflammation diet, and see if you can determine triggers Yes I have to take estrogen cream and clobetasol ointment. It can take longer but it will get there The ointment! I hate the vaseline consistency - so hard to wash off my fingers. What is the low o slate diet? Oh so good to know I am not alone! Have you found that they mostly clear things up? Probably meant oxalate, I think If the clobetasol is not working you can ask for alternatives that are not so harsh. Also be sure to moisturize while using any steroid, I highly recommend aquaphor. Moisturizing throughout the day should help! I am newly diagnosed with LS through biopsy.  I used the Clobetasol and Estradiol.  After 2 weeks, I weaned off the Clobetasol and I moisturized with Moringa oil several times a day. Had some slight itching that subsided within 2 weeks. My color is returning.  I also kept urine off of the area by urinating in a large plastic measuring cup and and rinsing afterwards. I hope this helps. Sorry, autocorrect... meant Oxalate. It is a diet typically more for elimination gout inflammation, but it is somewhere to start. No potatoes, spinach, nuts. Just concentrate on not eating the ones rated \u201chigh\u201d.\n\nAlso, a qtip makes for easier application of the ointment. I know some people think that it is wasting what is still on the qtip when you throw it out, but it lets you be a lot more quicker and precise I was on the depo shot when I had (?) LS. Once I stopped taking it, LS went away. I get flare ups once in a while but it is usually due to excess sweating or drastic change in weather. I have been on the pill for years now and I have not had any real issues with my LS. Hey as long as I can still drink coffee, I will try anything :) thanks! And wow I cannot believe I didnt think about using a qtip lmao, you have just saved me a ton of unnecessary handwashing :) Are you on the combined pill? That is a great idea! Clob honestly scares me because of how potent it is. and my doctor has me putting it on like, constantly. I did not think about a moisturizer, thanks! That is awesome that it is finally going away for you! I asked my  doctor about urine possibly hurting it more and she kind of rolled her eyes at me. Is estradiol an estrogen cream? Yes. It is an estrogen cream. I think it is important to listen to your inner spirit. I felt like keeping the urine off as much as possible so as not to upset the ointment or oil. It helps get under control but I right now I am having an unexplained issue that the doctor is trying to figure out I mean it makes sense! My doc did not even take me seriously a few months back when I mentioned I was worried about my skin down there. I had to practically beg her to even look at it. Super frustrating. Ahh I am sorry, that is so frustrating. It always feels like there is something wrong :( Yes, it is a 'medium' pill with a little bit of estrogen. Glad to finally see someone else get prescribed an estrogen cream! My dr did not prescribe me a steroid though. I am wondering if both is even effective? I have only been using the estrogen cream for 2 weeks. I cannot tell if it is actually helping or if the biopsy itself got rid of the scar tissue and fusing. I have a super mild case at the moment. How did they check your estrogen levels? I got it while on the depo as well. Did your dr say it could have been a cause? No but I had read lots of blogs where other women stated it happened when they started birth control and like 70 percent of the time it was depo. I had already put two and two together because the LS started right when I started Depo. It is just I was so stupid in letting it go on for 3 years before stopping the Depo \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f They did not check my levels! They just assumed. I actually had to stop taking the estrogen cream because I got an ocular migraine while using it :( so I cannot say if it actually helped or not. Super lame. I was hoping it would make a difference Wow.. I had a feeling mine could have been caused by birth control but was not sure. Bc I was on depo for 3 years, took a break and then got back on it for another 2 and it just started after that. How horrible \ud83d\ude29 Dang.. I hope you find something that helps!! Yeah I am on a new pill I started about 3 months ago, it is low in estrogen and I have had 2 flare ups in these 3 months which is kind of uncommon. I am thinking about taking a break from birth control to see if things improve even more. Yeah I just decided to get off of it completely. It is not even worth it at this point.", "Diagnosed Today...

I learned over the 15 years of having this. It is definitely not your fault it is an autoimmune disorder. If you want to talk please reach out. You definitely did not do anything wrong. It is an autoimmune problem, and you did not cause it. It is hard to say how bad it will be for you, because there is huge variation between individuals.

I do not understand how this develops out of nowhere or how no one (doctors) seems to know what causes it or how to treat it or anything. I am sorry. It really is not your fault. It is definitely not because you did not clean enough. And yeah, the name sucks. \n\nYou can test for LS by taking a biopsy, but many doctors do not think its necessary to further injure damaged skin if they can identify LS visually. It sounds like the doc already said that it looks like LS, so you probably do not need a biopsy unless you are not responding to treatment a couple months down the road. Pap smears would not detect LS. Have you started treatment yet?\n\nI have no idea how common LS is, and neither does anyone else. If you google it, it is classified as a Rare Disease (&lt;200,000 cases per year) but it sure seems like it is way more common than that. I would guess that the vast majority of people with LS never get a diagnosis or treatment, so we underestimate how many people have it. It is infuriating how few scientific studies have been conducted, and as a result our doctors know very little and have a very limited menu of treatments. \n\nWhen you feel overwhelmed, or start blaming yourself, take a moment to acknowledge how complicated and difficult this is. You are not stupid, you are being forced to learn complicated things because your doctor does not have the knowledge or the time to educate you. I know it is big and scary sometimes, but it will get better and I promise it is exactly 0% your fault. Keep your head up, and feel free to ask me any questions you have, I will do my best to help. Thank you.  \ud83e\udd7a I too was diagnosed today.  I was told vulvar dermatoses - either Lichen Sclerosus or Lichen Planus or a mix.  My clitorial hood is fused 90%.  My labia is starting to shrink which I did not even notice. I also have cervicitis which I was unaware of.  I have noticed bleeding/spotting before my periods and sometimes after sex so I thought it was just changes in my period due to aging.  I am NOT EVEN 40 years old yet.  I have to get a vulva biopsy Thursday to check for cancer which he does not think I have but he \"has to check\".  He said they will give me triple creams for the dermatosis (steroid, estrogen and testosterone). It should help improve about 60%.  He recommended using a bidet (funny part is that I just installed one last week) to clean after using the bathroom and pat dry with cotton cloth - no more toilet paper and flushable wipes when possible.  I also was told to get Curad brand A&amp;D ointment to apply to my anus and labia/clitorus daily.  He offers PRP laser therapy but it is not covered by insurance and it takes 3 sessions at $2000 per session.  I do not have $6000 so I will not be going that route.  I will beg my insurance company to see if they can assist somehow but I doubt they will.  I do have an autoimmune disease (hashimoto's hypothyroidism) that I have taken medicine for since 2008.  Supposedly, it has something to do with that.  I hope my story helps.  I will update if I can remember and tell you if I have cancer or not. The steroid cream is not like the yeast infection good. First you use it pretty sparingly and second it actually works. This is a great sub for info, and on fb there are several support groups. Some have had great success with Clob (the steroid) and Borax (of all things). Lots of good first hand advice in both places. Not a a lot of doctors know about it. It is rare condition that cause changes for me I have fusion and some atrophy of the skin and it is been ups and downs. It is auto immune disorder they do not know where it comes from Thank you Oh my gosh, I am so so sorry to hear of all that you are going through.  I really hope you get at least -some- good news and it is not cancer.  Good luck with your insurance company too.  I would also been kicking around the bidet idea.  I suppose it is a better idea than not for both of us at this point.  You will be in my thoughts Thursday.  Good luck to you. Thank you for your kind words.  I am nervous about the biopsy tomorrow.", "Discouraged, anyone else have this? So I have LS. It mainly affected my vulva. But I am losing pigment around the anus and bikini line. I noticed once I got on the Mirena IUD, my symptoms worsened. Anyone else have discoloration further out from the vulva? Look into Thymosin Alpha. It is a peptide for Auto Immune Function. It fixes and heals your immune system. It is pricey but it cured my LS. I took 20 units 2x day for 10 days. Injected.  It honestly cured me. If you need any info or names let me know. P.M me. Hello, can I PM you please? I have got some questions about Thymosin Alpha. In newly diagnosed with LS Absolutely. Talk to your gynecologist. Ask about clobetsol propionate ointment. It worked wonders! I have it on my perineum. You should probably apply your ointment in the anal area too, if it is affected.", "Has anyone tried CBD oil for their LS? I am wondering if CBD oil might be useful in controlling inflammation, itching or pain.  If you have tried it, do you apply it directly to the active areas?  Does it sting at all?  Do you also put some under your tongue?  \n\n\n ( I have heard it helps, I would like to try it actually I just want to make sure I get mine from a good repeatable company. Some people use it topically and ingest it. Yes, I think you are right about getting it from a reputable company.  I will be interested if you ever decide to try it and what you think.", "LS on vaginal opening Hi, 31F diagnosed with LS. Went to a dermatologist specialist yesterday and he said that it was mild &amp; skin looked quite healthy. But I had sex last night &amp; it just completely rips me. I do not get itching, it is more the intense pain of that first contact and leaves me with real pain and burning after. During sex it is fine, it is just getting it in, that causes the damage. I am using steroid cream and have used lube for sex but it still really hurts because my vaginal opening is so tight. I am worried that things in my new relationship are going to go south if I can only have sex once and then have to wait weeks for the cuts to heal. Any advice? I am so worried it causes me so much anxiety. I have an issue with sex too. It is quite painful, I do not know if you have told your partner about your LS or not, if you have not, maybe you should share it with him so he can be understanding. Normally I take some Advil before sex, we take things extremely slow to help stretch the skin, and after sex I will actually make an ice bag and put it between my legs lol it helps the pain. In the beginning, we did not have much sex, but after using the steroid gels and the CeraVe hydrating cleanser (dont know if your derm told you about this), sex became tolerable and not as painful but there are times where I still tear a little. Thank you for your reply. I am sorry you are also going through this! My partner does know- but as it is the beginning of the relationship I still find it quite difficult to come to terms with, though he is very understanding, but I know he shares the same concerns as me, especially if it is to get worse over time. I will look into your tips on Advil and the hydrating cleanser. Thank you :) I do use an emollient wash and have started using coconut oil also which I have heard helps some people. Will just have to play is by ear. So far though the tearing is quite intense and every time I have sex it seems to happen :-/ And that may continue to happen sadly. It is been almost four years for me and I still tear a little bit but taking things slowly helps a lot. Avoid using wet wipes for clean up bc that makes it worse. Something in them dries your skin and it can spread the LS to other areas like your butthole. Also check your nipples and the corners of your mouth for it. It can appear in those areas. I hope you find something that helps ASAP. It takes a little while to figure out what helps and what is triggering. Also, if you are on Birth control that could be another reason why you may have LS. A lot of women have reported that they got LS as soon as they started BC or a new brand. Which that was my case- the Depo shot. Good luck, hope it gets better! theThank you so much. That is interesting about the birth control as I am currently on the depo shot. Eventhough I had  LS before this, it my be making it worse. I will speak to my doctor about this! Thanks again x Your welcome- just so you know, once I went off of depo 95 percent of my symptoms went away. Sex just hurts a little and I only get flare ups when I do something dumb like use a wet wipe. Have you looked into dilators? They can help a lot with getting your vagina comfortable with sex. I used a small one for 45 mins-1 hour/day and worked my way up, and it is been a game changer for my sex life. Soooo much easier/less painful. Thank you! No I have not but I will look into now. Thanks for your advice x Also I would suggest finding a pelvic physical therapist - mine was incredible! If you are in the Bay Area, look up Miracle Physical Therapy. Liz Miracle enables me to have pain free sex, she is a literal miracle worker.", "If circumcision is curative for LS, why do not doctors recommend permanently retracting the foreskin (auto-circumcision)? I have been recommended by my dermatologist to get a circumcision to cure my LS. Apparently the removal of the foreskin has a good chance of permanently curing the condition.\n\nIf this is the case, could I not just try and permanently retract my foreskin? I believe this is sometimes known as auto-circumcision. The idea behind circumcision is that it is prevents the occlusion of urine within the foreskin which is the mostly widely accepted theory as to the cause of penile LS in susceptible men. As part of my treatment with the steroids, the consultant said that a number of his patients had tried that in conjunction with steroids. No studies to demonstrate the impact on outcome of steroid treatment but as part of the whole washing, wiping, removing  urine traces and using barrier creams regime it may play a beneficial role. The assumption that this will cure LS is false. There are  numerous people on here with LS that are circumcised  and circumcised at birth with LS.\nPersonally I prefer to keep my foreskin and up my personal care.  I am on treatment regimen of steroids. This reduces penile cancer risk to normal from high risk. \n\nAs for why they do not recommend auto- circumcision I have no idea. I do not like the sensitivity when my foreskin is retracted during the day. I have tried it but do not know how they recommend you do this. I think as normal medical people the nuances of medical usage ie. curative v. cure can be a bit irritating. I have understood from my dermatologist,  who is viewed as being very highly rated within Uk /Europe that steroid treatment is C.60% + effective in curing LS and circumcision has a higher cure rate/is curative in 90% + cases.  I do believe there is an assumption that only circumcision is required whereas continued use of steroids is also required to completely clear disease in many cases . My dermatologist  has also used the expression \u201cvanishingly low\u201d in terms of circumcised men having LS. Yet a number of RIC men report LS type symptoms. I will follow up with him on this point. I am seeing him on Tuesday for a check up. Circumcision cures LS in 90% of cases, I can quote the study this is based on if you like. The \"numerous people\" on here are most likely part of the 10%. Saying circumcision does not cure LS is false, in 90% of cases it does. What does the study say about alternative treatment cure rate ? I would rather use a pea size blob of ointment twice a week that be cut, thankyou.\nAnd posters question is still valid, what about the auto circumcision alternative ?\nYou also ignore the downsides to circumcision. \nSuch as loss of sensitivity,  and 10% cannot ejectulate during PIV. The study said steroid creams help in 60% of cases. I do not know about auto circumcision. If you are not comfortable about circumcision you do not have to do it, but for a lot of people it is viable thing to do and many are happy with it. I does not really cure it (I was cut because of ls) but it can stop the progression of the disease. So you will still have some ls possibly or a lot of discoloration but hopefully drying out the area with a circumcision will stop the progression I was recently cut because of ls. It is almost curative, I still have some of it and some discoloration but the pain/itching and stuff is gone. Because I am in America circumcision is a non issue to many.\n\nWould reccomend, but also not. Really depends on your case it is a painful process If there is been enough time since your circumcision, can you comment on how masturbation/sex feels before vs. after? I would almost like to get circumcised just so I can stop having to deal with this, but it is so hard for me to imagine how sex can be nearly as pleasurable if there is not the foreskin moving back and forth. I have been keeping my foreskin retracted (auto circimscision) for 2-3 months now, certainly looks better than it did prior, seems to have lost alot of inflamation and now its only the white ish patches bothering me. I seen a guy post on here that he kept his retracted 30% of the time and cured the LS - I am attempting the same. I do not like the idea of being circumscised, especially being circumscised for nothing, what if the procedure does not work? I think it is as pleasurable, but it does make things harder. For when I do things alone, I need to use lube now which has made it difficult to find privacy/time for anything. My understanding is LS is an Autoimmune disorder and as such cannot be cured with circumcision or steroid ointment. Controlling the symptoms is not a cure. \nIf it is Autoimmune it would take a DNA type treatment like marrow transplant for blood cancers. I am not a medical professional, I am a Physicist and Semiconductor Engineering specialist.", "46M, LS post-circumcision. New to the community. I have recently been diagnosed with LS. Originally I was told by my urologist that I had balanitis/phimosis so I had been using topical steroids long term for a year. I finally made the decision to get circumcised over a month ago and healing was slowly progressing but I made an unfortunate mistake of taking a hot bath which resulted in second degree burn on my glans. The wound has been recovering slowly but now dermatology hit me with LS. Feel so deflated and keep thinking what else is can go wrong. A month ago I was in high spirits and expecting to get back to normal.\n\nDue to the slow healing wound, the doctor decided not to start with topical steroids. I have been given a short course of anti-infectives and a 30 day cyclosporine treatment. Here is to hoping the skin will regress to a more normal state. \n\nI will say that I am glad I have a super supportive partner but it would be good to meet friends that are also going through the same challenges. \n\nThanks for listening and support.", "Does this look like LS?  NSFW!!!!!! Sorry I have marked it now It does look similar to the fusing I have with LS, but obviously you would need a biopsy to confirm for sure. There are other things that can look like LS but are not. It does not look like you have white patches, but not everyone who has LS does. Try to find a dermatologist who knows what LS is and see if you can get in for a biopsy. Thank you! Going to the doctors today so hopefully they can shed some light on it!", "For emuaid users Did it work? How often do you apply? How long did the 2oz container last for you. I have been using emu oil and Vaseline, clob. I am still experiencing tearing with sex, it heals alot quicker and is not super bad at all at this point but I am hoping the emuaid can give me enough relief to dail back my clob usage- and help prevent and heal the tears. Any info is helpful. Thanks Ive had severe eczema all my life.  Emuaid is the ONLY product ive found that stops the breakout and heals it.  The breakouts are not nearly as dry or damaging when i use it.  I love it! The strong smell is 100% worth it How often do you have to use it? Just in a flair or?", "Finally diagnosed after 1 year with no answers I (30F) was just diagnosed today with LS. I started having painful sex exactly 1 year ago and never had any issues before that. I saw multiple doctors and gynecologists, all who told me they had no idea why I was feeling pain. I even saw a pelvic floor physical therapist for 9 months with no luck. The physical therapist referred me to a specialist about 6 months into our sessions since my condition was not improving. I had to wait 5 months to see the specialist and I felt so discouraged and like this was just something I was going to have to live with. I finally saw that specialist today and within the first minute of the exam she was able to diagnose me. I feel so much relief finally having an answer and a treatment plan. \n\nNow that I know what I am dealing with,  I would love to hear more about how others deal with this condition. What helps? How long has it taken to feel some relief? Ups? Downs? Anything to expect. Thank you in advance! Relief for me was in less than two weeks with clobetasol.\n\nUps and downs happen. I do not use clobetasol all the time, just when it flares, so a flare would be a \"down\".  \n\nFor me, those come with other inflammatory swings - trouble with asthma, eyes are dry, knees, hurt, gut is unhappy.  I do not think there is any proof that this is true in general, but it is my experience.\n\nWhen things are stable, I forget it exists.  I guess that is an \"up\", but it is hard to identify it that way. But lack of pain is always good.\n\nWorst thing is a sudden crack or split that I was not expecting.  Had not noticed that things were getting bad, and then suddenly - OW. Going To hurt for a few days.  Will not die.  Just sucks.  \n\nI sleep with no underwear when possible. \n\nFor the most part, clobetasol was the magic item.  I had pain for many years before getting through to someone who diagnosed it in an instant.  Since then, I have had another kid, and it does not seem worse.  Over the years, I suspect there is been alterations to the labia, but it is not horrific.  I was diagnosed when I was thirty.  41 now. For the most part, it is a non-event, punctuated by a day or two of angry pain a couple times a year.  It sucks when it flares. It sucks to have to baby a split for a few days. It sucks wondering whether I am doing different damage to my skin, either labia or fingers, using this potent steroid.  But the ratio of suck-time to not-suck-time is very favorable. \n\nI am sorry you had to wait for relief but good for you following through until you got an answer. Not easy!  If the clobetasol fixes you right up, you can be sure you are in the right place.  You will have to learn to notice a flare-up and treat it immediately in order to avoid it getting worse.  You will have to be able to communicate on flares with your partner.  And that is pretty much it, from my perspective! Thank you for your response! I am definitely going to need to start paying attention to the ups and downs for myself and figuring out what causes flare ups for me.\n\nI am using the clobetastol and it sounds that helps most people. My doctor mentioned we might need to add in estrogen therapy but I am hoping we will not need to consider that anymore after using the clobetastol for awhile.\n\nHave you changed your diet at all? I have been reading mixed things about how diet can affect LS. Yes on diet, but no magic bullet.  When my gallbladder went sideways I tried to keep it.  One doc recommended a diet that was effectively paleo, so I did that.  Felt amazing.  Was awesome.  No headaches, no knee pain, no flares.  For months.  Then some stuff happened and the gallbladder died anyway, and it has not been quite as good since.\n\nI know people tend to fall into two camps - either wheat is a bogeyman, or people who think wheat is a bogeyman are stupid idiots.  Ugh.  But, there is something there.  If I eat it, I flare.  I flare for other things too (stress, and maybe tomatoes?, lack of sleep, kid stress, but mostly relationship stress).  But bread is a thing.\n\nSo I try to eat basic food - meats and fruits and veggies -- I am already lactose intolerant so I avoid that -- and I avoid most grains.  I do not know if it is right or not, just that when I tried saying \"fuckit\" and eating bread, hooooooooooooooly cow.  I cannot explain to people what happens to my gut and I sure cannot say what happens to the vulva.  But it does. It soooooo does.  It is like a damn voodoo doll.  Eyes. Knees. Gut. Vulva. Lungs.  Piss off the body, that is where it takes me out.\n\nIs not a bad thing to be familiar with an anti-inflammatory diet and give it a try if time and space allow.  But there is no proof it fixes it at this point.", "Could this be lichen sclerosus? A doctor diagnosed me back in 2020 but then said it was a misdiagnosis and will not see my again. Especially referring to the white around the entrance to vagina and white around the anal area - not sure whether this is just normal or not!  It does not look like it to me I mean, it can be... do you have any symptoms? I also do not have the typical white patches and was diagnose with it. I would get a second professional opinion. Did you get a biopsy for the first diagnosis? Are you managed now and be able to have pain free sex? Do you go about life normally? Maybe? It is hard to tell with that kind of picture. \n\nWhat kind of doctor did you see? Tbh that is a difficult question to answer for me because I also have mental health problems so thinking about treatment everyday is difficult because of my executive dysfunction. But I think if you use the creams regularly and use lube during sex it is possible to experience good sex again. Hey yeah, I have symptoms of itching that comes and goes, and quite a lot of pain all the time really - masturbation/urinating both difficult and painful You should ask for a biopsy, that is the only way to be sure. I had it for a year and it only got worse, if I could go back I would ask for one sooner.", "I need help, Helping as a partner. My wife was diagnosed with Lichensclerosus a few months ago. I am not asking for sympathy for myself or her. I am not asking to figure out what sexual positions are best or how to be involved. \n\nI will apologize in advanced for the rambling. I am just a bit distraught as I can tell this is now effecting our relationship. I am hoping to help others find support in my position.\n\nI am more concerned about our relationship health. I have been lurking on reddit and a few other sites since her diagnoses and waited to start asking more specific questions after her biopsy was preformed. \n\nI am looking for someone who is in a relationship, where their partner has the condition. It is a perspective I am struggling to find.\n\nI love my wife. Shes my world. We have been together for several years now. I am used to being a very protective, understanding and supportive husband. I have zero wish to leave her over this at all.\n\nIn the beginning our sex life was pretty fun, adventurous and kinky. Its definitely died down now (it was coming to a stop due to the pain).\n\nWe have a couple of dogs, we initially thought it was their dandruff or hair that was causing the problem as they went from non-sleeping on bed, to sleeping on the bed with us. With a new dog too, we figured it might have just been the breed.\n\nNow that we have the confirmation of what is going on, I can say this for certain.\n\nI am sexually frustrated. I am depressed in the bedroom. I do not bring it up though. I am usually very open with communication, however I hate the thought of telling her. Shes in pain and very sexually frustrated too. I feel like what I am feeling must be a fraction of what she is.\n\nWhen also stressed it will kill our relationship despite what I am saying. Shes worried if I go no one will want her. I am not wanting or planning to go. The statement made me very upset.\n\nShes hurting and I feel helpless. I am (like many in my profession) a protector. I would die for her. I am tormented that I cannot help or provide a solution. \n\nI am struggling to have sex even if shes willing or ready for it... I cannot get off on the knowledge that she is hurting. I cannot seem to get my mind off that fact I do not think shes enjoying it. She is mentioned how Lichensclerosus makes her feel like less of a women because she cannot make her man feel good. I think that has eaten me alive more than anything. I get off on knowing she does.\n\nI am sorry for the rant. I just need to know the perspectives of others in my situation. I am at a loss on what I need to do. Leaving is not an option to me.\n\nWhat can I do to be more helpful?\n\nTl:dr?\n\nI am struggling to help my wife. Shes my world but I feel guilty when we try to have sex. I also struggle knowing I cannot help her. I want to reach out to people who have good strategies or experiance I  what I am dealing with. I feel alone and I do not want to burden her with my struggles when it is harder for her.\n\n The initial shock was difficult for my relationship as well. My biggest need was space away from my partner. I was so sexually frustrated and aroused that being around him was agony. I needed space to mentally deal with the issues. Even a hug was a problem and considering we touched all the time constantly I had to talk to him about touching me in non sexual ways or I would simply have to not be near him at all.\n\nIt is gotten better. He is very understanding and communication went a long way. There has been significantly less tearing after I went on an immunosuppressant Humira for AS.  It had the side benefit of reducing LS symptoms. There is a gel immunosuppressant my derm prescribed as well that might be an option for her.\n\nWe have a very good communication for sex. I let him know if I am uncertain before hand and that if it does hurt we will stop. I have stopped sex on multiple occasions and it is always been ok and he never makes me feel bad about it.  After sex he always checks in on how I felt and I never lie to save his feelings. Sometimes it will hurt at the start then be fine, sometimes not till the end. Whatever happened I will express it to him so he never has to wonder or guess.\n\nOh irony, I thought it was flea bites from the cat so you are dog dander story resonates for me. I hope for the best for you. Seeking help from others on this means a lot. Communication has to be number one going forward.  When I received the diagnosis I was not in a relationship, thankfully. So you need to give her time to process and to figure out how to deal with this condition - mentally and medically as well. The steroid cream is god send. If she is in pain so much when you are having sex, shell probably need to start treatment with dilators, at least I read that is the recommended thing. But those things are best discussed with her doctor. What is important is that you let her come to you for sex. Let her discover being sexual together again. I am sorry I do not have any better advice; my situation is very different but I wanted to leave a few words. Good luck to you two. I am only recently diagnosed with LS... after a year of sex already being painful and the doctors prescribing cream after cream and saying, \u201cjust wait and see...\u201d my partner and I were always very sexual for the first two years of our relationship and this year has been tough. The last few months have been the worst. I got biopsied a month and a half ago, with a scar taken out and stitched back up. It is taken about that much time for me to even feel any kind of excitement for any kind of sexual activity. My depression came back with a vengeance last week after keeping it treated and under control for the most part of 4 years. It is not just the being unable to satisfy my partner that makes me feel less like a woman, but the constant examining and poking at the doctors and the being told it might all be in my head this last year. My partner has been nothing but patient. He has stressed the importance of communication. He wants me to feel happy and make it clear how wanted I am, but is afraid of applying any kind of pressure that may result in immediate pain and longterm consequences. I have been starting to feel more like my old self but I get frustrated I cannot get into or enjoy all the things we used to do.. yet. But sharing my frustration and voicing how much I still want him seems to have helped. Simple things like holding hands or snuggling on the couch make a huge difference because I did not realize how much I was pulling away. Sorry if that does not exactly help you, but the thought process explained of someone going through it might help your approach?  I was relieved in a weird sense when I found out it wasnt me (or the dog) that was causing the issues. However now I kind of wish it was one of those factors. I would not want to wish this on anyone.\n\nI think the lack of contact being done right know is a stage that has started and is progressing. The issue is, we are finding it very difficult on the relationship. I have been very respectful. I cant imagine what it feels like. It breaks my heart to know shes in that pain. Shes one of the strongest people I know. My husband is the protector type as well(he is prior military). Even now that I can have pain free sex he is still worried that he is hurting me. I think its a process that you will have to work through but just know that as long as shes getting treatment then things will get better. I talk to a lot of women who have this and almost every one of them feel like they will never have sex again or that they feel like they have lost a part of themselves. I have had active LS since I was 5. It is wrecked down there. lol. But, trust me, things do get better with treatment so just keep reminding yourself that this is just a temporary stage that you are in. In terms of support, I think the best way you can support her is to just be there for her. I think one thing that hurt my relationship is that my husband would take a simple hug as a cue that I was initiating sex. I knew he was sexually starved for a while so I cannot blame him but def made me shy away from getting close to him. It got to the point that I would flinch when he touched me.  Im a woman with LS so I am not sure I can help you but I can tell you abit about me. I am in a very loving and stable relationship, we had a great sex life and still mostly do even if we have to sometimes modify our activities. I have develop other skills sets in the process! ;) \n \nI can tell you that your love and caring attitude is helping. I for one needed that at first. I felt like I could no longer be the partner my husband needed but he quickly reassured me that we would be ok.  It is not going to be easy. Flare up are difficult and they will occur. Sometimes out of no where. But with time we adjust, we live and we love. I wish you both the best of luck.  You are a beautiful man. I hope I am so lucky to meet a man like you. I know you are not perfect, but you are heart is gorgeous. Good luck to you and your wife. \n\nBe patient. Give her space. Give yourself space (to mourn and feel your feelings too). Continue to communicate. Respect her wishes, but be mindful of any self-destructive tendencies popping up on her end. ", "Does this look like LS? Awaiting doc visit, considering biopsy  I already discussed this on a video visit with my sexual medicine MD and she think\u2019s\nit is plausible that I have LS but her office is considered \u201cnon-essential\u201d so I cannot do an office visit yet. I am just wondering if my skin looks like other people\u2019s LS because I cannot find any early stage photos online. Are the white patches ever subtle? I have had problems with sex pain for 2.5 years and recently realized I have been getting small tears on my vulva during sex (see arrow in linked photo). I suspect they have been happening for a while. The last 3 times it is been in the same spot. My vaginal immune system has had a rough couple years so it could have triggered an autoimmune reaction like LS. I still get itchy a lot and when I see my gyno I am usually negative for yeast/bc/trich. Today I am noticing some peeling on the lower vestibular area and the skin seems ready to crack. I have so many issues with sex pain that I only want to do a punch biopsy if it is really necessary. Looks consistent to me. Obviously a rando on the internet cannot diagnose, but yeah, that looks familiar. If it is NOT LS, I would love a follow up for education on other things to consider as a differential. \n\nB\n\nI am sorry you are having the pain! I would only try less potent steroids if nothing else brings relief \u2014 if it turns out not to be, you do not want to be using steroid creams there. \n\nI hope you can get some relief soon. mine started with small tears as well, and it was in an area where the white patches were not as visible. \n\nit seems likely it is LS - would definitely get the biopsy. It is painful but the peace of mind of having a diagnosis is worth it IMO That is what mine looked like. I did not get white patches but my skin looked glossy like it was a scar and I got fissures a lot Mine actually got worse after taking the initial steroid cream prescribed. I used it twice, and it made my vulva swell consequently inflaming my clitoris. One thing though, do any of you experience issues with the follicles of your hair. They peel constantly and it makes it impossible to even have a good sex life.", "I am under the impression that my treatment may work, but the side effects are worse than if it would not work. My doctor advised me to treat my LS with a cortisone cream. I am to apply it daily during the first month, every second day during the second month and twice a week from there on. On the days where I do not apply the cream I am to apply cold pressed almond oil. I am currently in the beginning of the second month and I feel like the cortisone is making my skin extremely thin and it rips apart very easily. I had issues with my skin ripping before being diagnosed, but that was only when I was not careful during sex. Now I even rip when I wipe after peeing. The almond oil seems to dry out my skin instead of helping. My doctor is on holiday right now so I do not know what to do. Does/Did anyone have similar experiences?  \n\nThis is a side effect of the cream I have not heard before. I also am curious about the almond oil? I have heard people talk about various oils to help keep the area from drying out. But almond oil is new and I have not heard of a doctor prescribing it as part of the maintenance regimen either. \n\nHonestly? I am not a doctor. But if the side effects are worse, I would stop for now. Let your Dr know how bad it was. I highly doubt they will be bothered, as their goal is to make you feel better, and you obviously do not. I do think that for science, I would stop doing one or the other, maybe just the cortisone and see if the almond oil helps or vice versa. I understand your pain. I was on 2 creams. One was to control the itch and the other was an immuno suppressant. The itch cream burned like hell and made my symptoms even worse, which caused me to stop taking it. I substituted with ice packs but it did not help much. Unfortunately LS will not get better by itself and will only get worse without treatment so I do not recommend stopping any prescribed meds. LS is a pre cancerous autoimmune skin condition that must be managed to prevent it from developing into cancer. I suggest you continue as prescribed and then discuss your reactions with the doctor when able. Mine developed into cancer after many years of not following my care plan properly so you do not want to take that risk. Ya, I agree with what was said above here.  Your doctor may want to have you try a different form of treatment if this is not working well for you.  Leaving this kind of disease untreated in the long run is a bad idea, but taking a short break until you talk to your dr about different treatment options sounds like a decent plan.  Hope you find something that works! \n\nIve heard and read some amazing things about thymosin alpha.  One LS patient here took that for an unrelated health issue and it put her LS into full remission.  May be something you want to look into a bit. The standard treatment for LS is either  clobetasol or betamethasone steroid ointment.  I suggest you see a dermatologist asap. Steroids can cause skin thinning and weakening, but so does LS. Either way, if the meds were working it should not be getting worse. You could ask to switch to something else like tacrolimus. It is an immunosuppressant but not a steroid, and it sometimes works for people who do not get results with clobetasol.  \n\nI have never heard of using almond oil for LS, but whatever the goal of it was, I am sure there is an alternative. Maybe vaseline?\n\nMaybe call your doctor's office, even though she is not there, and a colleague could fill in for her? I feel uncomfortable about going to anyone else, since it has taken me so long to find a gyno I trust. I have some psychological issues due to rape in my past, so it is really difficult for me to build up the trust needed to let someone examine me. Also, to worse that, I have just had a lap because of my endo, during which they cut away some scar tissue and basically sewed my labiae together. The stiches hurt so much that they tried to remove them, but that hurt even more and only a week ago the stitches finally dissolved, so I am emotionally scarred now by that as well. I will just try and endure the skin ripping until my gyno is back. I already have an appointment in two weeks, so it is not that long of a time to wait. But thanks for your recommendation and advise! That is good that you have an appointment soon. I was going to say you should call them anyway to get an appointment as soon as she is back. I understand about the difficulties having another person examine you. I was thinking it might be possible they could recommend a stopgap over the phone, or at least tell you whether to stop using the steroid ointment until your next appointment. I have heard of this happening. I do not know the full science, but the steroid can cause atrophy and skin thinning while it works to control the inflammation. Once you are using the steroid at a maintenance dose it should be much better. You should talk to your derm or doctor about starting an estrogen topical. It will help plump the skin and improve elasticity so you are not tearing so much. \nAlso, almond oil is not a treatment for LS, so if you find it drying you can use any other oil or moisturizer you like. Some like olive oil, coconut oil, aquaphor, v magic, and emuaid/emu oil are other popular options If you mean hydrocortisone, that is too weak of a steroid to be used for LS. You should be using an ultra potent steroid like clobetasol. The reason you are tearing I suspect is because the LS is getting worse. There is an abnormal amount of inflammation in LS and weak steroids do not cut it. Also, a steroid would not thin your skin within 3 months, it usually takes longer. Your skin is tearing because it is thickened from the LS. In fact, if the steroid WAS thinning your skin, it would be a good thing because the reason our skin cracks because of LS is that the skin has become too thick kind of like concrete (prone to cracking), we want it to be more flexible. \n\nI would suspect if you get put on a stronger steroid you should start to notice positive differences in 6 weeks. \n\nI also do not know why a doctor would advise to use almond oil. Most people get suggested to use something like Vaseline on off days. This is common for women who try steroid creams instead of ointments. Also, you really only need to rub in a pea sized amount. \n\nMy doctor told me that ointment is crucial because is does not have alcohol in the base, cream does. It also irritates the skin more. Ointment is more potent, and because of this, just make sure you only apply a pea size! \n\nI have an appointment tomorrow, I am going to ask my doctor about A+D ointment. It is for diaper rashes lol but I want to use it for my sensitive spots.", "just woke up and my labia all of a sudden is white is this ls???  It is hard to tell with just a picture, what are your symptoms? It could possibly be a yeast infection idk? You can find a treatment for yeast infection at any pharmacy, they sell them on the shelves, no need for a prescription. Although, I am not a professional, I could  be wrong and so I would definitely go check that out! Take care\ud83d\udc95 Looks like a yeast infection to me. Lichen is more of small white patches not bumpy", "Tips to decrease pain in the bathroom? Hello everyone! First post and I am just going to jump right in :) I am a 22yo (F) &amp; have had lichen sclerosus since I was probably 14 that was most likely triggered by psoriasis. I was diagnosed at 19 or 20 I believe w/ a punch biopsy. I use clobetasol ointment to treat it but, will admit, I slack on regular treatment sometimes. I get flares right at the top of my clit (PAINFULLY itchy!), a little bit at my vaginal opening, and then alllll over each crevice in my backside and IN my anus (also PAINFULLY itchy). As you can imagine, this makes pooping a nightmare as I tear open all the little cuts. :( I bleed every. single. time. Sometimes it is just a tiny bit, and sometimes the toilet paper is soaked in my blood, but nevertheless, always painful. Every time I get the urge to go, I am genuinely terrified, and when I was younger, I even used to just hold it in fear (which then led to extreme constipation lol, woohoo!). Besides sticking to a regular routine w/ my clobetasol in order to maintain it better, does anyone have any tips on how to prepare for this battle pretty much everyday? I have some CeraVe Healing Ointment that I use as the last step of my nightly skincare and I eyed it today but decided not to use it. Would a skin protectant such as CHO or Vaseline be beneficial? I do have a bidet but rarely use it - would that better to use than TP? TIA you all! Sending you all some love &amp; healing - LS is a bitch and a half. Well I cannot really advise on that but bidet is definitely better than toilet paper, like there is no friction.Coconut oil gives immediate relief from burning sensation after peeing (tho do not insert it inside vagina,I just use it externally). I have probable LS, waiting for an official diagnosis. I feel you on this 100%. It is the absolute worst. A long time ago my doctor recommended A&amp;D ointment which is basically diaper rash ointment. I kind of hate the smell, but it helps. I have also used lanolin because it has a similar consistency. I always wipe with flushable aloe infused wipes. They feel way better on the cuts than regular toilet paper and help to heal the wounds. \n\nI would also recommend a warm sitz bath soak with sea salts or even some of your ointment. Putting vaseline on the area right before going to the bathroom is a godsend for me. It keeps the pee from burning the open wounds and lowers the friction when wiping. Also eat plenty of fiber.. My case is in the same areas, so I know exactly what you are talking about and it fucking sucks. The bleeding is terrible. My doctor encouraged me to use Miralax every day to get a certain \"consistency.\" I did not care for that AT ALL but a good takeaway is to make sure you are eating a healthy diet that makes it easier to go. Personal wipes can help - opt for sensitive ones or those with extra moisturizers. Drink lots of water. \n\nA diaper rash cream can be soothing. I have been using the Emily's Hot Skin Soother ( for years after a recommendation from my acupuncturist. It is not only calming but I feel like it helps the fissures heal more quickly. Emu oil is another product that can help in that area.\n\nIt is SO validating to read these posts and know that there are other people who know what it is like living with LS Okay yeah.  30F here.  This summer has been brutal on my LS especially the backside.  I have never had it quite this bad before.  I have an 8 month old and in a moment of desperation and pain I used his diaper cream.  We have the butt paste brand.  It is amazing for the burning/itching on the bum.  It is become a secret thing that I \u201cborrow\u201d his butt paste.  I will say that if there are a lot of tears it does sting.  Once it heals enough I go back to using the clobetasol.\n\nWe have a bidet and honestly the water stings like a bitch on all the little cuts,  however it does keep it clean and I like the water spraying instead of the scraping of toilet paper. i am a guy with LS and besides using steroid creams what I have found that works best for the itchyness and relief is a first aid cream with 12 500 UI of vitamin E (the brand is Webber first aid cream but its canadian afaik). I apply that all the time. I use a tube per week. I am so sorry, I am about the same age as you  but I have LS near the \"back\" of my vag and has spread to spots more towards my anus I guess. And I am terribly sorry yours has been so awful, I cannot even imagine! Idk if this helps but I am still constantly learning about ls and how to take care of it. But for me what has worked, which seems so obvious is just to keep the area clean!! When showering I am cleaning my vag with water only. And clean my butt with scent free baby wash. I use baby wipes after bms. I heard they are really bad for you but I feel like it helps me. \nI am very curious if bidets have been helpful at all for you or anyone else as I really would like to try it. I have definitely heard sitz soaks help and have yet to try. That will have to be the next thing I try. Thank you! Thanks so much! Before I was officially diagnosed with LS, I was also told to use Miralax all the time. Problem is, I am also blessed with IBS so that never seemed to help!! I have been seeing Emu oil everywhere in this thread so I will have to give that a try + check out diaper rash cream as well. &amp; yes. It is so, so validating to read through this subreddit &amp; even just this post. LS is a literal fuckin lifesucker sometimes &amp; besides the pain and insecurities, it is really difficult to live with because NO ONE knows what it is. Nice to know there is support even if it is on the internet :) Thank you! I am sorry that the both of us have to suffer through this at a young age (and honestly, sorry for everyone who has LS in general). I have noticed mine flares up bad when I wear underwear (specifically thongs) so I honestly do not even wear underwear very often anymore LOL. Cleanliness is absolutely helpful tho - I feel less sensitive after a shower even. Also I *love* my bidet but have not been using it because it can be painful during a pretty bad flare up. It does make all the little cuts sting, but you really cannot beat the cleanliness of it. It is basically like a little butt shower (haha) which is, I think, a little relieving for those of us whose LS is more localized to the back. I think it is well worth it though, and I myself should go back to it. I say give it a try! I am curious to know if you have taken a look at your backside to see how it looks. I also have similar symptoms in similar areas, but my anus is more of an inflamed purple as apposed to white and ashy as some describe. I have even noticed a darker purple bump which made me feel like it could have been hemorrhoids. Unfortunately I am still waiting for biopsy results and suffering. My vaginal area seems to feel better, but I cannot tell if it is the clob or changing my laundry detergent. My anus is still very itchy though. I am curious to know how treat this in multiple areas when I will only be allowed to use the clob a few times a week. What if things flare at different times? It is awful. Hope you are feeling better these days! Agh just saw this\u2014sorry! I definitely have thin, white skin back there. In fact, I was diagnosed because I went to the GI for a hemorrhoid follow up and she took one look and was like \u201cSweetie, this is LS.\u201d I got lucky (and biopsy results came back in my favor as my gyno did not think it could have possibly been that)\u2014likely would not have ever known without my GI. As for different flare ups, I am curious why you can only use clob a few times a week? When I flare, I use clob every other day for a week or two, and slowly reduce until I am only using it a couple times a week. And, if I happen to flare say in my clitoral area and not my anal area, then I just use clob more often in my clitoral area. It is not pleasant that is for sure, and my skin feels weaker from constant steroids, but it is so much better than all the pain &amp; itching. Anyway, hope those biopsy results helped and that you too are feeling better! Thanks for sharing! I am actually in the initial stage of using the clob every day for 3 months still, I am supposed to taper to 1-2x a week. I am just afraid of using the clob incorrectly as it is very dangerous to use continuously and my pharmacy told me after my 3 months I will absolutely need to taper. I have seen people say that during a flare they treat for 2 weeks every day, but if I have it on my anal and vulvar area, what if my Vulva flares one week and my anus the next? Maybe I am just worrying too much. \ud83d\ude02 I am still waiting on my vulvar biopsy results but my gyno said it is probably the cause of my itchy anus as well. Though the club has made my anus far more itchy than it was before! I even tried a new steroid that is a little less strong and it is not really helping. Anyway, sorry for the rant. \ud83d\ude02 Ehhh, I have started taking what pharmacists &amp; derms say with a grain of salt when it comes to clob consistency. None of us asked to use clob to the point where it is harsh for our skin, but if you ask me, I would rather slather clob on my bits than be left with skin that is cracked/bruised/itchy/fusing/quite literally falling apart! I have used it consistently, anywhere from everyday to 1-2x a week, for about 3 years and I am doing just fine. (Like so consistently that my partner refers to my clob as \u201cass cream\u201d lol.) My derm gave me a less strong steroid as well because the other one was \u201cdangerous\u201d and I ended up going right back to the clob that my GI/gyno prescribed because the other one was doing nothing for me. Trust your gut!!! And do not ever worry about ranting :) Ehhh, I have started taking what pharmacists &amp; derms say with a grain of salt when it comes to clob consistency.

Trust your gut!!! And do not ever worry about ranting :) I have seen that too much use of steroid can lead to adrenal problems. The clob works to an extent for me but not really, throughout the day I get itchy again, it is been almost 3 months that I am using it. The itching stops on my period. The nurse from my biopsy actually called me and told it I do not have LS and it looks more like eczema. But either way a steroid should do the trick if it is eczema. The nurse suggested eucerin aquaphor. I am starting to think I am dealing more with cytolytic vaginosis at this point. Maybe even a combo of eczema and Cv. Ruling things out backwards apparently. I cannot imagine tearing and having cuts, I really hope you can find something that helps. I also find using baby zinc cream helps. Maybe try moisturizer before using the washroom. Hope someone has some decent suggestions. Hugs", "Hi all \ud83d\udc4b . I am 42 and have suffered LS most of my adult life. I had surgery in 2005 and am now discussing PRP and laser. I wanted to ask about something my doctor said today - that I was at 60% chance of vulva cancer.... wtf?? I thought it was more like 6.... did I miss hear???  Is this a rhetorical question? How should we know your diagnosis? You can always call the doctor back and ask for clarification. I am asking her. I meant a generalized risk for ladies with lichen sclerosis.  Thanks for the warm\nWelcome.. It was not coming from a sarcastic place. I was just asking if you were actually asking us about your diagnosis bc we would not know what the doc actually said lol sorry. But I guess it could be a generalized risk for women as it affects our vulva area. But I think if you catch it early on and start treatment, the risk is not as high. Did you go a long time without treatment? I went three years without because my gyno was telling me \"the symptoms are not visible, I really believe this is a mental thing you are having\" eventually I go so angry I googled it myself and took a chance at what it told me and saw a dermatologist. \n\nCan you explain what PRP is? PRP- the injection of platelet-rich-plasma. If you put that and lichen sclerosis into google you\u2018ll be able to see it is a new method that has high success at controlling LS. The doc wants to object PRP and use lasers.\nMy LS is pretty far advanced, I have had treatment on and off for 15 years but have not been as on the ball as i should have been. Mostly because it is been a nightmare finding a doc who is close and understands the disease. And when I was diagnosed in 2004 it was already so advanced that I would closed up so much that sexual inter course just was not possible. I have read that it is more like a 4% increased chance. It is possible that your specific situation is different, but that does seem awfully high. Better to give your doctor a call and likely put your mind at ease! \nSorry to hear about your diagnosis but I am glad you found your way here! This page brought me a lot of comfort when I was first diagnosed a couple of months ago. Holy. That is rough, I am really sorry. Are you going to do the prp and laser treatment? Yea that is what I thought when I was driving home... like why did not I ask when I was there?? I will call her. Lol I do that all the time. I think in the moment my instinct is just to nod and say okay to whatever the doctor says. My brain usually kicks in on the way home. Hope you get a good answer to your question! I might... depends on this risk.. and money, it is not covered by insurance :( I know... it is annoying. I did say \u201cwow that is high\u201d... and she agreed. but I guess that could be relevant even if it was 6 or 16.... \nI have messaged her and wait and wonder...", "UK Dermatologist Recommendations Im at my wits end with the NHS, I have been pushed around from department to department for years and I just need some answers. Im thinking of booking a private Dermatology appointment but I want to ensure I go to someone with expertise in this area. Does anyone UK based have any recommendations of consultants? Preferably around London area I saw Dr. Farhana Ravat on the NHS, I was referred and they did the biopsy the same day. She is either in Mount Vernon or Hillingdon hospital. Best of luck to you! Mr Usama Abuzoda in Peterborough is both NHS and Private. \n\nHe is excellent and genuinely cares about his Patients. He is a Gynaecologist as opposed a dermatologist, but we would recommend that route for women from experience.\n\nIn London Dr Anthony Bewley was good as a dermatologist. He is at the Royal London hospital in Whitecapel and has private consultations. Professor Christopher Bunker. Google him. He is the top dog. I disagree with Anthony Bewley, i found him to be very unempathetic. I have heard Fiona Lewis is supposed to be the best of the best.", "How I got my LS under control I have been diagnosed with LS a few years back. At first it was quite devastating and it was almost constant outbreaks. It was also very hard to get any information from my doctor. It affected my self esteem and my life in general. I decided to change a few things and it made a world of difference.  The first thing was getting rid of all my fancy underwear and switching to all 100% cotton white underwear. Just that made a huge difference..it can be 90% sometimes because the other 10% will be elastane(waist band). Then I started washing them separately with very mild soap that contained no dies or perfumes and did not use fabric softener. I do not wipe myself anymore after using the washroom...instead I gently pat dry with the softest possible toilet paper. Since doing that, I have not used my clobetasol, it has now been 4 month's. My boyfriend is very aware o my disease and he is very respectful when we are having sex. He is careful and he check is in with me to make sure I am fine. Do not hesitate to talk about it with your partner and you guys can find ways to have a healthy sex life together. Anyway these tips changed my life so I thought I would share and hopefully help some if you feel better. What are some of your helpful tips? Nice! I do not wear underwear often when I am at home which is freeing.\n\nFor me personally if I have been off the wagon not eating properly like junk food that is when I will have more flare ups. It is helped since I have cut out dairy a couple years ago which can cause inflammation. That is interesting, I have never thought that it could be related to what we eat. I use a bidet, wear loose boxers most of the time, and I use aloe even when not having symptoms. Everything you mentioned above + avoid fake sweeteners. Last week my doctor told me that estrogen cream as maintenance in between outbreaks can be really effective. That way, the steroids do not need to be used unless you have a flare-up. How do you get estrogen cream, is it over the counter or on the shelves? It is a prescription from my OB What tests did they do in order to diagnose you? Biopsy on my clitoris. It was quite painful for the next few days after. I can also vouch for cutting out dairy as a solution!! Truly I felt so much better but it took a little time to notice... probably 2 ish weeks!", "Should I just three doctors saying I have no signs of inflammation or LS/LP? I had a gyno, GP, and derm all say it looks normal. The derm said she does biopsies everyday and is positive mine would come back as normal and did not see a point. Should I trust this? I am worried cuz my clitoris is really dry and nothing is fixing it Have you tried topical creams as of yet? Any progress?", "Meatal + fossa navicularis stenosis. Anybody here in the same situation as me ? Or that have gone through that?  Do you have a buring sensation when peeing?  Pee coming out sideways from peehole?  I had both of those symptoms but luckily they went away after I began treatment. I had burning sensation for a few days at the tip when peeing, also coming sideways too but this is rare to happen. Lately I am peeing alright, no pain or weird directions. What treatment did you go through? Im glad to hear your situation is improving.  The treatmemt I used is not exactly FDA approved or anything right now, so I cant say much about it yet.  Hopefully I can come back and share info about it with people here soon though. Cool. Would love to know what you did to manage it.", "weak orgasm with LS Hi there, I am 29 M with LS. Just wondering if anyone has issues with weak orgasm/ sensitivity with LS as I have been struggling with this for the past few years. Also if anyone gained the sensitivity back when they beat LS? Hi there. I am a F in my early 50's and it had not even occurred to me that a weak orgasm and LS might be related somehow. I am interested to see if other people have had this issue as well. I am still battling LS.", "The topic of topicals I am quite new to LS (38,F) but no stranger to autoimmune (psoriasis for most of my life and recent rosacea ) I believe that my prior experience is helping put me in the best possible place right now, so I want to share w anyone who is feeling hopeless. I am really surprised to see so many young ppl on this thread, especially in recent months. So for all, young and old, here is the list of helpful topicals. \n\nI have not used conventional treatments for psoriasis since my late teens. My experience has shown me that for me, the steroids and immunosuppressants actually cover up symptoms (usually making worse in long run) but do not get to the true cause. I found explanations on the \u201chealing the nether regions\u201d (great site for LS!!!) site that also confirm this in regard to LS. My logic tells me that if the skin is already thin, then I would not want to put something on that causes it to thin in the long run. Of course we all have to determine what is best for us as an individual. I am going to multiple practitioners in multiple disciplines in order to find my answers. Taking what I need and leaving what will not work. Without further adieu: topicals I rotate and why:\n\n1: hyaluronic acid: this stuff feels great I mean what a relief to the pain! It helps the collagen grow, so hopefully helps skin to grow back healthy\n\n2: Rick Simpson Oil dissolved in fractionated coconut oil (or any pure oil medical marijuana tincture make sure no flavors just oil and herb concentrate) This stuff is great both topically and internally. The pain killing and lubricating effect is very soothing. If you are feeling anxiety about your situation, take it internally instead of Xanax or whatever(benzos can actually cause some autoimmune flares). You will be calming your system and keeping the harmful chemicals out. \n\n3. Lavender oil. You will see this one listed on multiple websites as being helpful. The scent is calming. The oil is cooling. Great for taking down the burn. \n\n4. O3 oil: it is triple ozonated olive oil (easy to find online): long lasting moisture, protection, clean feeling. Good before you sweat it will protect. \n\nI am only a couple weeks into this leg of my autoimmune journey, so this is only the beginning of what I am going to be sharing with you. Please let me know your results trying these topicals\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b While I know that people are hesitant to venture into long-term steroid use, in some cases, the only way to treat a severe flare is by using clobetasol. Clob is not intended to be a forever therapeutic, and a good doctor will taper usage once the skin begins to heal. \n\nI am fully supportive of people recommending and trying other remedies, but as someone who has the worst case of LS that my gyno has ever seen, there is no substitute for something like clob. Same with psoriasis - some people do fine with OTC remedies. Others require biologics. \n\nDoctors have not determined what causes LS. It is thought to be autoimmune, but it can also be related to trauma to the area. **There is no cure for LS; it is about managing symptoms.** \n\nI am 8 years into my LS journey and 35+ years into my psoriasis journey, for what it is worth. Thank you so much for sharing. I may order some up and do light experimentation although I definitely want to avoid long-term side effects or a feeling of dependency. As far as the psoriasis is concerned, I can only speak for my 20+ years of experience when I say that the prescribed and over the counter medication\u2018s have not helped me nearly as much as lifestyle and natural topicals. I have not tried any of the Biologics because I have been able to manage so well without them and I fear the side effects. Of course, the conditions are different and I am sure that things vary according to an individual as far as what works and what we need. I really appreciate your perspective and perhaps adding some allopathic medicine into the mix could help me round things out Or you could listen to the doctors, and follow their advice as well as the directions for the medication they prescribe.  Your 20 years of (I am guessing untrained) experimenting with random things with fancy sounding names is not going to match the collective experience of doctors and researchers who have conducted actual controlled experiments to zero in on effective treatments that have demonstrated efficacy through peer reviewed research.  \n\nThen again, last year I had an electrical problem in my house, and I replaced the wires in my room with all natural, vegan, soy based strands infused with onion and lavender.  I have done TONS of internet research and know that onion can energize, so I am convinced that if I get the saturation correct, despite what the electrical industrial complex WANTS me to believe, the holistic energy transmission approach will work for me.  YMMV. \n\nJust my perspective. Attacking another person on this board tongue in cheek like that is not going to help any of us get any better. Save the keyboard warrior life for some other site. I cannot wait to show you my own proven results. Much love\ud83d\udc9b Agreed. LS is an autoimmune disease. Your body is being attacked by your immune system, the only thing to stop this are drugs that target your immune system. \n\nThe only evidence that shows slowing of the disease are immunosuppressants. \n\nI welcome everybody to do whatever they want with their body, or use whatever natural products they want if approved by their prescribers.

I do not know maybe this forum is not the right place for me LOL. Somehow it is OK for another person to verbally attack me but it is not OK for me to share my experience\u2026And it is OK all day long for people to repeat the same gloom and doom without looking for any new solutions. Do you have any idea how hopeless that makes a new person feel when they come on this board and they see nothing but people crying about their use of clobetasol? Maybe the board could be more open to people talking about alternatives. I have been reading through searching for a success stories and now I am wondering if those were deleted as well because people were using something other than a steroid to produce said results. As somebody who is new to this horrific situation I came here seeking community; I came here to learn and share at this point I am feeling pretty unwelcome. I am sure I will find my LS tribe somewhere out here! Wishing you all the best on this board!

Your post was removed because we have a specific rule about alternative therapies. You are welcome to share your experience while following the rules. I definitely do not want you or anyone to feel alienated. \n\nIf you edit the post to abide by the rules, (I think) I can reverse the removal. Or, you can make a new post.

For example, this page gives list of warnings with lavender, such as drug interactions and risk of skin irritation: (  \n\nYou would also need to mention the risks of *not* using a proven treatment for LS, such as progression of the disease and elevated risk for genital skin cancer. \n\nI am not saying that the risks outweigh the benefits; everyone has to weigh that for themselves, of course, with the supervision of an expert, like you mentioned. But with prescription treatments, it is the prescriber's job to tell the patient about the risks, and the risks are also stated in the leaflet that comes with the medication. With alternatives, people can mistakenly think that natural equals safe. So, when we discuss alternatives (especially ones available over the counter or for different indications) we have the responsibility to research and mention the potential risks along with the potential benefits. \n\nI am not aware of any other \"success stories\" that were deleted. But I have only been a mod for about a month. \n\nSide note- you mentioned concerns about skin thinning with steroid treatments. Tacrolimus is a non-steroid treatment that has a moderately good success profile (not quite as good as clob, so it is a second-line treatment, but without the risk of skin thinning.) Tac can also cause a burning sensation, but in my case it was mild, and it tends to go away after a few uses.", "New Diagnosis, Lost Creating a reddit account just for this. \n\nI am a 28 year old female and have had issues since my daughter was born 17 months ago. I thought it was low estrogen related to breastfeeding but I have been done breastfeeding for 2 months and am still having painful sex and some tearing.\n\nMy OB prescribed me a steroid cream and said based on what I am telling her: painful sex, tearing around my lower labia near my perineum and above my clitoris, some itching that I likely have lichen sclerosus. I did not think anything of it until my hubs and I had sex yesterday and it burned so badly after that I was almost in tears. I decided to google it and am horrified. \n\nSo I am reading through these posts and people are saying how they manage it but I do not see any about how exactly do you manage it? I do not have any white spots or fusing and I do not have any tearing or redness now so how do you anticipate sex being painful still? \n\nI also have had an anal fissure since shortly after giving birth and am wondering if this is why it never healed properly. Maybe all my skin in my genital region is thin and weak. \n\nI guess I am just looking for insight as to how you know when it may be okay to have sex? Are white spots a requirement of the diagnosis? What does it mean to \"manage\" the condition aside from steroid cream?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHANK YOU. For me, I was okay for sex when all my cuts and fissures were healed! For me it was possible to feel how much I had healed, but my derm also confirmed that I was pretty well-healed and good to go.\n\nFrom what I gather (and for myself as well), once healed, it is possible to keep the fissures, flakes, and other effects at bay by using clob when needed. I apply some at the first sign of itchiness, and it is usually gone by the next morning. For me, this is every month or two, for others it may be more environmental or frequent. Hi, welcome to the shitty club!!\n\nIn my case, \u201cmanaging\u201d means using the steroid ointment twice a day when there is a flare up. You know it is a flare when it sucks: tears, itching, burning, pain. Hopefully, those things get quickly and dramatically better with a couple weeks of steroid. \n\nThen, hopefully, the pain and tearing and all is a a memory for a while. Feeling good. Feeling better. And you are getting better sleep - daughter is older, you are not waking up in burning itchy hell. Eating good food. Drinking your water. Doing your yoga or whatever you for you. Stay gentle in sex but it is not something to bring you to tears. \n\nAnd then the kid starts teething. Just as one or both of you are busy at work. Kid does not sleep. You are not sleeping. More takeout to pick up the slack. Bad week or two. Aaaaaand then one day - RIP!! Pain! Itching! Burning! Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhgghggh!\n\nBack to the steroid cream for a few days. Ice and rest and stuff. It sucks. \n\nAnd next time you try to catch it before it gets that bad. Try to check in and make sure you are not getting thinner tearing skin when things are getting rough in life. Maybe you catch it and patch it with some proactive steroid. Maybe you do not, and suffer a bit more. \n\nI know people knock gluten-free as a fad, but I found that LS is WAY less bad now. My hands and knees do not hurt so much either. If I eat wheat, my knees start hurting, my hands claw up, I get bad headaches, and LS goes bonkers. I have repeated that shitty experiment three times now. Not doing it again. I suspect LS is related to autoimmune stuff and inflammatory stuff and it is probably pretty personal - whatever sets your body off. That does not mean gluten necessarily. Could be a cat allergy, sleep deprivation, chronic unpleasant intensity with a partner, a different food intolerance, a medication ... we dunno. Best you can do is live your healthiest life and pay attention to your body. And use the steroid for a bit when you feel the burn getting started. \n\nFor me the steroid took me from constant pain and itching, so much I could not care for my toddler, to totally-fine most of the time. The tears heal, though it is clear that it is trying to absorb all the features; everything gets smaller after a tear and the healing. But I am in my forties now and it is livable and okay. Shitty card to draw, but very much livable once you get it under control. \n\nThe non-negotiable thing is your health. It tends to come last when you have young kids. Try so hard not to let that happen. That is how you manage it. \n\nAs far as when to have sex? When it does not hurt. When you are not cracking and bleeding. When you can touch however you like and it does not hurt even a little. Even then, start slow, and stop the second it hurts at all, because it is going to hurt a whole lot more later once you are not in the groove anymore. Make sure partner is on board with this plan. It can happen to anybody. Eventually he will run into a day his parts do not work the same either. Everybody can be gracious and accommodating. \n\nKeep working with the steroid and the doc. I hope it helps fix you up and you can be on a good maintenance healthy level for most of the time going forward! I think managing it means finding what works for your body. There are a lot of lifestyle changes you can make like not wearing tights pants and leggings, wearing only cotton/silk underwear or no underwear, using gentle or no soap, gentle sex with lots of lube or non-penetrative sex, etc. I think with sex you just have to listen to your body and hit the brakes on anything that hurts. And of course staying on top of your treatment, whether that is steroid ointment or something else like tacrolimus. Many people achieve total remission of symptoms. \n\nTo your other question, I think it is possible to have LS without any white patches, but they are the \"classic\" sign. But they are not necessarily splotches; they can be white regions that follow the shape of your anatomy. Maybe you do have some pale areas your doctor noticed? Did they do a biopsy? Biopsy is the best \"proof\" of the diagnosis, but it can be skipped, especially when the appearance and symptoms are very typical. I assume your OB tested for all the common things like yeast infections? This is extremely helpful. How long ago did you get diagnosed? I read last night about how the vagina can just completely fuse together and it freaked me tf out. Is that possible? I have another doctor appointment tomorrow and will get more information about care I hope. I definitely agree about having a tendency to put myself last with a little one running around and being in a pandemic has made it difficult to do any self care. I am going to get on an anti anxiety medicine I think. I hope that helps and does not mess up anything more.\n\nAgain, thank you so much. How long would you say it took for your cuts and fissures to heal? Thank you for responding. I do not have any skin discoloration at all. It was very dry above my clitoris and felt almost like a skinned knee and that has went away mostly with the steroid cream. My next appointment with my OB is next month and then depending on if the cream works we will go from there whether to biopsy and I have an appointment tomorrow with my general doctor.\n\nI did not get tested for a yeast infection but I have had them in the past and this does not feel like that at all. When I would get a yeast infection it was just a constant itchy feeling but this is only occasional sharp itchy pain almost. If that makes sense at all.\n\nShe said based on what I was describing she would have thought low estrogen if I was still breastfeeding but because I have stopped that the next thing based on my symptoms she would say maybe lichen sclerosus. I was 30 and now I am 42. I have no signs of a full fuse; only the labia want to shrink, I get tears in the crease against my body and when they heal there is just a bit less free lip than there was before. Very subtle, I may not have noticed if I was not looking. Happening, slowly. But nothing actually changes for me vaginally. I would tear vaginally and rectally before treatment and in a flare. I do not when things are good.  Definitely not trying to close up.  I had another child a few years after diagnosis. \n\nThere really is not a heck of a lot of good information out there. It used to be a disease for little old ladies, who did not as a rule talk about their vulva anyway, and nobody cared. Maybe as we better understand the role of inflammation and the immune system, and understand that this is not some disease of old women only (not that we should have been ignoring it if only old women are suffering ... but ... yay culture), we will understand it better going forward. But at 42 there is zero sign of a vagina closing up shop permanently. I hope. \n\nAllow me to be the first annoying person to suggest meditation. Which, of course, is near-impossible with a baby in the house, so I am not going to knock meds. I used the Headspace app for a while and it was very helpful. \n\nYour hormones may bounce back still too. Bodies are weird. You may find that you treat this for a couple weeks, your body remembers what skin is supposed to be like, and it keeps humming along fine for decades more with no worries! I have a tendency to journal, meditate, and do yoga when things are good. I drink decaffeinated tea.\nBut when I am stressed? Bahaha. All of those things go out the window. Bring on the coffee. I really do need to get better about regularly doing yoga, meditation and drinking more tea and less coffee. \nMy OB did mention that this was something she saw more with menopausal women. \nThat is comforting to me that you have had to for 12 years and have still lived a regular life from the sounds of it. I really appreciate you taking the time to comment and answer my questions, thank you again. Mine took 3-4 weeks to fully heal, but they were not super bad to begin with! I think this really depends on your age and the severity of it. I had the fissures till recently. I did a 10 day injections of Thymosin Alpha. I have finished them now.. it got rid of my itching from Lichen and the fissures. It was so bad it was bleeding.\nThymosin Alpha is used for Auto Immune support. Helps you heal quickly too. Honeatly I have not felt this good with no itching or fissures in a long while. No clue if it is going to last and thr 10 day supply was $450. But so far my Lichen had gone. I am sorry you are going through this. I am 6 months postpartum and just got diagnosed, also 28 years old. My symptoms are similar to yours and I am still learning as well. Just validating your pain and confusion and whatnot. Can I ask, do you have urinary symptoms? Burning with urination? Is this injected to the affected areas, like the vulva itself? Hi there, \n\nI know if can be extremely scary, especially when you are so young, I am 22 and also recently diagnosed. I agree with what everyone else said, so I am not going to repeat it, but you got some very good advice so far. I just have a couple things to add. Things I wish people would have told me! \n\n1. There is a lot of really good support groups out there, which can help you feel less alone and give you a place to vent your frustration. They can also provide a lot of really good advice, such pre and post sex tips, creams that help, new treatments, etc. I regularly see people post about how the support group tips helped them into remission and pain free sex. Seeing as you already found one, you may know this already, but I personally find the Facebook groups to be better than this one. There is a lot more activity and people on those. The one with 12,000+ people is my favorite. Just search \u201clichen sclerosus support group\u201d and a few will pop up. There is also one called \u201cVulvodynia Support\u201d which covers all sorts of vulva issues and you can relate to people there too. \n\n2. Along with the support groups, please do not make the same mistake as me and go crazy with them. I made an ugly habit of reading all the posts all day long, freaking myself the fuck out, and then falling into depression that nearly destroyed my family and relationships. You have to remember that the people posting are usually in a flare or have not gotten their treatment to work yet, because when you feel good you are out there living your life not posting on a support group. So just remember, you are reading about their worst days not their average day. This same advice applies to Google, you are going to see the images and stories of the WORST cases, because again those are the interesting ones that result in pictures online and crazy stories. This disease is poorly understood and many women are misdiagnosed or ignored by doctors for many years allowing it to progress, and that is where you get the cases of vaginas sealing up. Steroids suppress it, and prevent that from happening to you. You seem to be in good hands and to have one of the few OB/GYNs that knows about LS and caught it early, which is extremely good.\n\n3. I am just going to share some general tips that I have found can help. \n- For the clob/steroid, make sure you only use a pea size amount and make sure to massage it in. It is important to keep the area moisturized, but make sure to apply the moisturizers at different times during the day than the steroid/clob because you do not want to dilute it and reduce absorption. Some people also find that estrogen cream helps the skin be more supple and healthy too. Just because you are not breastfeeding, your levels may not have bounced back locally at the vulva so it could help you. You can also try DHEA suppositories, which help your body make more estrogen. \n\n-  many people find relief from using aquaphor, coconut oil, V-magic moisturizer (on amazon), aloe Vera, Emuaid, Perrins complete, vitamin E oil topical and suppository, CBD oil and many more. The challenge is finding what works best for you. \n- for sex, make sure you use lots of lube! I love slippery stuff since it is extremely non-irritating, but Uber lube and coconut oil are also supposed to be good, they just do not work with condoms if you use those. Finding a lube that works for you is a challenge too, for some of us many of them burn but slippery stuff is consistently considered the most none irritating. \n\n- dilators can help a ton with painful sex, and they can help prevent narrowing of the vagina which can happen in LS. They helped make sex pain free for me but since I am still early in treatment I have a lot of pain after. But dilators helped me so much!!! Some people also find that pelvic floor physical therapy helps, as the pain can result in you tightening your pelvic muscles making the pain even worse! \n\n- ice can help with the pain after sex, but I prefer to take a bath! Helps a ton. A lot of people also find relief from sex pain by using topical CBD, like the foria products before sex to reduce the inflammation and pain after. \n\n- borax, the laundry booster. Sounds crazy, but bathing in small amounts 2tbsp-1/4 cup does crazy things for some people\u2019s symptoms. Add baking soda for further itch relief and coconut oil for moisture. Some people literally find borax to un fuse them and heal them better than steroids! It is crazy, definitely do some research on it! Start slow and build up to prevent irritation. There is also a cotton ball method to applying if you do not have time or a bath, Google that or ask and I can send you the directions for that. Some people also drink small amounts of it, but a boron supplement is probably safer. Some people also find relief from adding Epsom salts or the aveeno oatmeal bath soaks. Baths are your best friend now, find ways to make them even better!  If you do not have a tub, a sitz bath can also do the trick and goes over your toilet. \n\n- dab with toilet paper, do not rub, and try to find one that is unbleached or soft if that helps you. If peeing causes you pain, spray cool water on afterwards \n\n- switch to All Clear and Free detergent, as laundry detergent can irritate you. \n\n- only wear cotton white underwear, not thongs and try to not wear any when possible, like at night or if you are home. \n\n- some people also find relief from supplements that lower inflammation like fish oil or tumeric, or low oxalate diets, Google these. \n\n4. There is some really promising treatments out now that have completely cured women from their symptoms. One of them is by using stem cells and/or PRP, which people get done at Fox Valley or Nathan Newman, and more places , Google them. These trigger healing, reduce inflammation, and stop the body from attacking itself. Some people need more than one, but since you caught it early one might be enough! I am getting one in April by Dr. Newman. You should call their office and talk to Misty, she will give a load of info. Some women have seriously gone into lengthy remissions and gotten their lives back fully from it. Price per treatment: $6200 USD.\nAnother is known as the TULIP procedure and is only done at the Coyle Institute in Florida. It is a one time procedure that has also cured many women from their symptoms by using personalized laser technology. current cost: $4000 \nThere is also Mona Lisa laser treatments, which require many laser treatments because they do not go as deep as TULIP, also costly but varies by practitioner. It is more accessible though, since many more providers can do it, and you may not have to travel at all. \nI know these procedures are expensive, but it is something to think about saving towards. I know when you have a kid, spending that much money on yourself sounds impossible, but by getting your health back you can be there more for your kid. It is totally possible to find remission without these treatments, but I want you to have the information in case it is something you can afford or could save towards. Insurance does not cover them, but some have been able to get insurance to cover some by advocating strongly. \n\nI wish you the very best, it sounds like you were caught early and will be okay. If you ever want to talk to someone who gets it, my inbox is open. It helps to talk, do not let this isolate you and make you suffer in silence. There is a community for you, and this subreddit is one of them. Sorry if this was overwhelming all at once, but I hope some of this is helpful to you. \ud83d\udc97 No its injected into your stomach. I was not prescribed this for Lichen. It was a Hormone Clinic that suggested I try it for an Immune Boost. It was not until 3 days in when I noticed my Lichen disappearing that I looked into what Thymosin Alpha does and it basically is used to repair the immune system. Considering Lichen is an Auto Immune Disease I guess it makes sense. When I did a search I found an article that stated it was used in a trial for Lichen with success. This is very helpful and I will keep that in mind and look into it. Thank you &gt;Reddit \n\nThis is extremely, extremely comforting and helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to type this out. I actually do not have a Facebook and I think I would also be constantly refreshing it and reading every post if I did have one so this group may be more helpful if its slightly less frequented than a large Facebook group. Thank you for telling me about the possible treatments, I will look into those this weekend. I hope they work well for you! No problem! And that is good that you know your limits and hope you find relief from your symptoms soon! Another thing I should mention, if you are interested in Nathan Newman he offers 10% off during your birthday month, so if you can, try to schedule then, you can do the procedure whenever but as long as you schedule (and I think pay) during your birthday month the discount applies. Good luck with your healing journey, and remember you always have us to come back to when you have a bad day and or set back! Teaching your partner about this and having him  understand can also help, since many women seem to keep it to themselves and it seems to make them a lot more miserable. Do not worry too much, you will be okay! My derm also told me that the condition heals super slow, so if it takes months for the steroid to improve your condition, do not be discouraged. At the same time, it works really fast for  others, and you may feel better in a couple weeks. Regardless, you should use a maintenance dose (once or twice a week) for the rest of your life to prevent it from coming back or becoming cancerous (low risk, but it is good to protect yourself).  A lot of the negative information about steroid usage out there is false, so always go to your doctor first. Best wishes \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Congrats on the little one. I am so amazed at all of the changes that have happened to my body since and I am disappointed at how unprepared I have been. \n\nI have not had any urinary symptoms. The weirdest thing that has happened in that regard is sometimes I can see my urethra very clearly and I have never been able to see it before. But other times I do not see it at all. Is that similar to you at all? \n\nI did have horrible horrible burning while I peed early postpartum for about 2 weeks but I have not had any sense.  Oh very interesting, thank you for the information! Happy to hear you are well! \ud83d\udc95 My GYN was surprised I waited so many years without diagnosis. I had a biopsy 10 years ago which proved it.  I am fused and find the clobatesol a wonder ointment for the pain, itching. When there is a tear, especially perineum I use a bidet that I had installed and it is the best advice I can give everyone. I bought mine at Costco Do you go weeks or months without symptoms? I need the reassurance I use the med daily yet there are times that I tear if I am swimming daily in my pool I must rinse off right away. Also wearing 100% cotton underwear  or none if wearing a skirt around home really helps me.  Do not let fear bring you down. I am here for you Have you tried Estrace cream yet? This really worked for me after a post pregnancy flare-up. Doctors do not think to prescribe it to young people (I think it is normally for menopausal women/ not really normally prescribed for LS so you may have to push for it), but I really think it would have helped earlier flare-ups I had in my twenties. I use it in combination with the clobetasol for flare-ups. I have not heard of that but I will definitely ask my OB at our next appointment. Thank you! If you have visited the doctor recently, you may be able to just call your doctor\u2019s office and request for them to call it into the pharmacy without a new visit. I think with LS, there is a lot of trial and error. What works for you may not work for someone else, but it is worth a try. Estrace treats vaginal atrophy, which is usually associated with older women. The symptoms of LS are similar. I have had 2 biopsies confirming LS, and the Estrace really helped me. Just diagnosed and 28 as well, and just to add that I also have UTI like symptoms. No UTI or infection. Just an LS diagnosis. Ugh! I am sorry. Are you on clobetasol now? Same to you! And yes, I am. On my 5th day or so but have not known if I should put clob near my urethra and no one has given me clear information on it, so I have just been kind of hoping general treatment will make the burning sensation go away anyway. How about you? I am on it yes. It helps some but never 100%. I have some days with no UTI symptoms but most days the clobetasol just takes things down 5 notches. My derm said it was ok to get all around the urethra! Just make sure you have freshly washed hands (with non scented gentle soap that was completely washed off)", "Mona Lisa Laser for LS clinical trial We are actively recruiting for our Mona Lisa for LS study in NYC. We are  also actively recruiting for our genetics study (if you have at least  two family members with biopsy proven LS- all that is necessary is to  have blood drawn). Go to my website ( and click on the research tab or email us at   Without YOUR participation we can never find the cause of this disease  or alternative treatments!", "should i schedule a dermatologist appt? \nin june i went to my gyno because for months prior  i was experiencing, itching that would turns to sores, irritation, redness, stinging when i went to the bathroom, the itching  was worse at night. I was having these problems on and off for a couple months and. now looking back i had flares maybe even two years ago. never had unusual odor or discharge just itching and sores and dryness \n\n i got a pabst smear and my doctor told me that it could be a yeast infection and he prescribed me a cream and told me it could also be dryness and to use coconut oil.\n\ni went back to the gyno a couple months later and got another pabst smear and he told me the same thing. since then, i have  still been having these issues with flare ups. \n\nas the months went by, i have tried probably 6 months worth of otc probiotics, prescribed cream, making sure to wear cotton underwear, drying off properly, all that stuff they tell you!! check soaps, toilet paper! nothing helps like i am not thn constant lain i would say i am always a 3 and then my flares are a 7. Sex/ masturbation is almost always uncomfortable:(\n\nI have been reading about LS and relate to the itching and sores and other things like pain during sex: i do not think i have lichen spots but there is discoloration like pale/ whitish parts. should i go forward with a dermatologist appt or go to the gyno ? In my experience, dermatologists are much better equipped to diagnose and treat LS. LS is, first and foremost, a dermatologic disease. Its location on the genitals is secondary and irrelevant. I would definitely recommend trying a derm. Switching from a gyno to a derm for management of my LS was the best decision I made. My gynecologist was not bad, but he was not as knowledgeable about LS. Good luck! Feel free to message with any questions!! The whitish/pale parts sound like LS spots, and LS could fit with your symptoms, too. Yeast infections can be recurrent, but generally, if they do not improve with treatment they probably just are not yeast infections. Also, I have read that coconut oil can be a bad idea if you are prone to yeast infections. But, I have heard people recommend it also. \n\nSome people have better luck with derms than gynos, but I think the specialty is not as important as them being knowledgeable about LS. \n\nBy the way, a pap smear is not a good test for a yeast infection. Maybe your doctor did the other tests too, like a wet prep, but if not you may want to find a new gyno. thanks for responding :) i have experimented with using coconut oil and not and honestly i do not notice much of a difference.\ni do feel like i was not listened to at my second or first gyno appt and was just pushed into doing another pabst smear. i do not know if he did a specific test for yeast infection but it is the main reason i went in so i would hope so!!! i did not get any follow up call or anything just prescribed the ointment on the first appt and then was left to my own type of care..\ni guess my biggest question are could i have this ongoing yeast infection. like almost 1 year plus . or could it be LS without that much white spots ... i made a appt to get the ls biopsy but do not know if i should have just went to a different gyno :(( thanks :)) i messages you Did it feel better after the yeast cream, and then come back? Or did it not respond at all? If the latter, I think it is very unlikely to be yeast. Lots of conditions get misdiagnosed as yeast because the classic thinking is \"itching=yeast\" and that is not true. \n\nI think making your derm appointment was a good choice. Sometimes, an experienced doctor can even diagnosis it from appearance, and you do not need a biopsy.  \n\n&gt;i made a appt to get the ls biopsy but do not know if i should have just went to a different gyno\n\nI think you might want to establish a relationship with both- a good dermatologist, and a different gyno that actually listens to you and follows standard of care. I wish it were easier to find the right doctor!", "Another meme for those of us diagnosed as young adults or children  Not to discount being nervous on the first one!

Between the last appointment I had with them and this upcoming appointment, I have done more research into Lichen Sclerosus and learned about the top researcher in LS right now, Andrew Goldstein. He has great videos and resources. \n\nHere is the thing: my dermatologist has told me things that directly contradict what Andrew Goldstein emphasizes. \n\nSpecifically, that there should be no gaps in treatment, that LS is lifelong, and they just are not as diligent about treatment as I think they should be - like they have not spoken to me about the possibility of cancer at all or even checked me for it from what I can tell, beyond the initial biopsy for diagnosis\n\n\nSo I guess my question is: how do I bring these issues up to my dermatologist in order to be heard?\n\nI am sure all of us can attest at some point or another that our doctors do not want to listen to us when we say we are having a problem. I may be biased, but I want to raise these concerns in a way that they will not be brushed off. Do you as a community have any suggestions for this? \n\nThanks and happy healing! My dermatologist, aside from the biopsy, was also vague about treatment options, the condition itself etc. I found out through an iud removal appointment (in an effort to stem the itchiness) that the gynecologist knew more about ls. He referred me to a gynecologist that specializes in vulvar diseases and I received a prescription that helped tremendously and IMMEDIATELY. I wanted to cry - i was suffering for so long without relief and this one doctor just flipped it upside down. My recommendations is to bring in the paperwork and info you have found, and ask if there is anyone that has worked with this issue in the past. Sometimes finding the right doctor is key. You have to fight for your right to be listened to and receive the treatment you need. Good luck!  Curious, what was the prescription they gave you? Was just diagnosed a few hours ago and was given clobetasol. Just used it for the first time and unfortunately did not experience immediate relief. I am quite jealous lol! \n\nMost importantly, I am happy for you that you found relief. Did you end up getting your IUD replaced? I am going to get one put in and hope that there are no known complications. My GYNO did not seem phased but just wanted to hear your thoughts. Thanks for sharing!  The prescription they gave me was triamcinolone acetonide. Prior to that when the itching was really bad I would just put lidocaine to numb it. I went back to the specialist that they referred me to recently and just for full disclosure she changed my diagnosis to Lichens Symplex chronicus. I am now on an ointment that includes nystatin and triamcinolone, I am taking boric acid suppositories twice a week, and fluconazole for the next month. Hope this helps.  Tell your doctor that you only get one body and one lifetime, and you would like to treat your condition with the most up to date information available. ", "How bad does the biopsy hurt? \ud83d\ude30 (Female) I have to get a biopsy for LS right by my urethra... has anyone experienced this? How bad does this hurt? What is the procedure? I have had a few punch biopsies on the lady bits now. For LS and for a cervical cancer thing. They are never pleasant, but the majority of the pain is over after day one. Expect day one to be rather unpleasant, and make sure to bring a pad to the office for the bleeding. My office had one each time, but it was a really gross uncomfortable weird medical brand lol. Try and take the day off if you work so you can take it easy and do not have to move around a bunch. Day two minor discomfort and by day three pretty much normal. I hope this helps! I had one. It was not bad at all. The worst part was the needle they put in to numb the area, and that was mostly just a small poke and momentary sting. My doctor put silver nitrate on my biopsy site so it did not bleed at all after the procedure. It healed within a week with minimal pain. No stitches or anything. You will be totally fine! i had 2 and thought the numbing shot was the worst part! still was not too bad though because it is so quick. punch biopsies and just a stitch or 2 each time. good luck! Schedule it at the beginning of your weekend and plan for a three day if you can. Lidocaine can help with the pain. Have a bottle of wine ready. :/ The needle prick was uncomfortable and hurt a bit but was great since I felt nothing during the procedure. It was when that wore off I had fire crotch. Took some Tylenol and sat on a cold wet washcloth and that helped. Did not hurt the next day. I just felt like it took forever to heal.  But I guess not surprised since I bruise like a peach and the bruises linger for weeks.", "Feeling helpless I was diagnosed six months ago after demanding a biopsy because my dr said I was way too young to have lichen sclerosis, and I most definitely do. I started clobastesal immediately but if I even miss one night I am in extreme discomfort. I cannot imagine being intimate with someone, and I am feeling so depressed about it. Any helpful advice or tips would be so greatly appreciated.   :( Did you start using it six months ago, or just now? Also: are you using the cream, or the ointment? Some people on here have said that they have a reaction to the cream version because it contains more chemicals. If it is the ointment, I think there is another steroid doctors can sub in instead, if the clobetasol does not work for you. Others here might be more knowledgeable about that, but I think it begins with a T... I am so sorry you are feeling this way but just hang in there! Clobetasol is the most common treatment I believe for LS but it is not the only one and it is all about finding what works for you! There are various other creams/ointments they can prescribe you if you feel Clobetasol is not working. \n\nClobetasol can help the condition a lot but it is important to do as much as you can to help it work to it is absolute best potential. Changing aspects of your lifestyle or soaps and your cleaning routine, wearing sensible underwear that is breathable cotton and not too tight. \n\nTry not to worry about being intimate with someone as when you get to that stage there are lots of things you can do to make yourself more comfortable and enjoy intimacy far more. There are various posts that share tips on how to decrease discomfort during sex and intimacy and again you will find what works for you.\n\nYou are doing really well whether you feel it or not and we are in this together and you will get to a stage where LS will be at the back of your mind! Thankyou so much for the support!  I am going to start with the basics of taking better care of myself , I have been feeling called to eat more Whole Foods and cut out processed foods and I think now would be a good time to start. Clobastesol has definitely helped a lot I have to remind myself that when I started treatment I had cracked bleeding skin and I do not have that anymore. I guess it is just the thought of having something that never goes away.    I will look into different underwear fabric and also make a journal for triggers. I have definitely noticed that the week prior to my period is the most uncomfortable. !!!!  Again Thankyou for your positive comment. \u2764\ufe0f I started six months ago. I am using the ointment. I would not worry too much about the \"never going away part\". The goal is to get the issue into a manageable state. If a problem is manageable it becomes a daily routine but rarely becomes the focus of your daily attention.\n\nI had some concerns about the intimacy part as well, but when the mood hits you it is really not a high priority item. If the skin condition has improved it wont split or cause pain. After poking around on here a bit it seems tacrolimus is the alternative steroid people are being given. Might be worth asking about trying that instead of the clob? Okay Thankyou!  I will ask. I appreciate you finding this answer for me", "Just Got Diagnosed, I feel .. So today I 28F after a year of struggling with LS but now that I know what it is much longer probably, received my diagnosis after a biopsy.  This was my second biopsy in 10 days because they lost my tissue sample the first time and I had to have it redone! I feel like it is definitely causing me to flare up more as I am extremely itching/in pain. And the whiteness has spread. My Dr is ordering me some steroid cream. I am currently breastfeeding a toddler and she thinks the extended breastfeeding could be causing it to flare up. I do not know... does anyone have any experience with LS and breastfeeding? I honestly just feel really sad right now thinking of having to stop and do not want to. Also what do you do after you get diagnosed...like I just feel lost. And how do you tell people ? Do you even tell people? It is such an akward disease. I wish could be something easier to explain... ugh...I do not know. Anything helps from anyone who is also diagnosed . I am also NEW to this. After biopsies.   Vaginal area AND ANAL Area..  It was confirmd that I had it. I also have vitiligo, which my fairly new family doctor and new gynecologist said is probably why it was not diagnosed sooner. The gynecologist told me that I was THE WORST case that she has seen in 35years... And she kept apologizing to me...gues what that did was validate my I hurt and I do not want to have sex. ..ii have been using the CLOR... EVER SINCE Oct.2020 when I was diagnosed. \nOne thing that I DO NOTICE IS...I CANNOT SKIP A BATH.... LONG DAY OR NOT....SLEEPY TIRED? DONT MATTER....IF I DOBT TAKE ONE...I WILL FLARE UP.....BADLY. I KIND OF suspected that semen  may cause FLARE ups..so to test my little theory....I took a bath afterwards, and I did not have one...well....the one I have had since my biopsy in October 2020 has NEVER been cleared up. I just have LEVEL 4 pain/itch days to 10 and crying pain days.. . I talked to my immediate family about my diagnosis because I saw some sources which say 10-15% of people with LS report having a family member with the condition.  Plus it sounds like peole often take a long time to get diagnosed so I figured its doesnt hurt for people to know what it is, in case they ever experience LS or something like it themselves. So sorry \ud83d\ude22 this condition sucks but you can definitely learn to live with this and steroids do help, a lot. Long periods of remission is also possible. As for the connection with breastfeeding, I guess everyone is different. I breastfed my daughter for 3 years and 7 months ( we just finished because I am pregnant now with my second one) and it did not make my symptoms worse, they have gotten better, so not sure if there is a connection.\nI hope that helps. Take care \u2764\ufe0f Wow I am so sorry to hear that. I feel your pain! I think I definitely feel scared for what this will mean for sex life. I feel the same not wanting to and I hate it because I do want to. But I am afraid. Thank you so much! My daughter is going to be 2 next month and I never planned to stop until she was ready. My Dr seemed shocked to find out I was still bf and told me it is not recommended past 6 mo \ud83d\ude44! New Dr because I moved and I was having this issue. She thinks it can be from bf but I disagree. You do not know how much it has helped me and made me feel better to know you bf for so long!!! Many strategies have been proposed for reducing energy intake (diets, drugs, and  bariatric  surgery) and for increasing energy output (exercise and non-exercise movement), but even though there may exist a general  agreement  about the fundamental conceptual basis\u2014changing energy intake and physical activity levels\u2014how to achieve these goals is less clear. Hi there! I was diagnosed at age 24ish and that was around 10 years ago. I have since had a child and breastfed. For me, symptoms are very affected by hormonal fluctuation and were worse during breastfeeding. I have even had my Mirena IUD removed recently by my doctor, because it affects localized hormone levels around the vulva (apparently?). My symptoms have improved greatly since having I removed and starting an estrogen cream. After my diagnosis, I searched for a specialist anywhere on the west coast, and was lucky enough to find one two hours from me. My doc is part of a specialty clinic for vulvar disorders, and it has been seriously amazing being able to see her. I highly recommend finding a good doctor, even if you have to travel for occasional check ups. I did talk to my husband about my diagnosis- he was a bit confused at first but mostly just concerned for me. My mother also has is, so she is the only family I have spoken to about it. Good luck! It will all be okay! if you do not mind me asking, i am on the west coast as well, what specialist do you go to? and also, how often do you use your clob cream? also this is funny because i was considering getting my mirena out! the only thing that is stopping me is the fact that my period are super light! it is a breeze lol Just curious, do you mean you have vitiligo outside the anogenital region? That sure would complicate Wow thanks so much!!! I am also on the west coast I definitely am looking for a good Dr. Do you have the practice name? I wonder if it is close to me...thanks so much for your insights...my dr did not want to give me estrogen cream but I think it should be looked into as breastfeeding does lower estrogen levels. Huh, I have been thinking about getting my Mirena out too. But I also had such terrible periods that I was essentially anemic, which I think also contributes to LS. AND I am on the west coast so would also love to know the clinic/dr you are seeing! Huh, I have been thinking about getting my Mirena out too. But I also had such terrible periods that I was essentially anemic, which I think also contributes to LS. AND I am on the west coast so would also love to know the clinic/dr you are seeing! I am 54 years old, and I got my first white vitiligo spot when I was 20. I noticed is spread The most when I was under intense stress...losing my daughter when I was 33yrs old...it spread..when I lost my father in law 6 years later...it spread. I have had white patches ALL OVER, PRIVATE areas and not private areas.\nI believe I  have had LS. FOR 14 YRS..CUZI REMEMBER HAVING A Pap smear a year after he was born...asking about a couple if area down there.  They gave me Nyostatin and called it. Day. As long as you are open and honest with him. I EVEN had my husband come in the bathroom and look at it WHEN I HAD A HUGE FLARE UP...showing him where it hurt and asked him what it looked like .( I partly did this because so many years of me being hard to get, I basically wanted him to SEE, SO it would BE REAL, And not just \"her declining\" again.  He is super understanding NOW and as long as I use LUBE... AND HE Must take it slow until I say go .. So as long as you discuss and share your condition. You really wont have huge issues. Oh sure! Dr. LeClair at OHSU in Portland, OR. The clinic is called the Vulvar Health Center and it is part of the center for women\u2019s health. I am actually not using clob anymore. She had me switch to a less potent steroid (Triamcinolone) because I had actually been causing excessive skin thinning by using clob for so many years. So I use that a few times a week, the estrogen cream daily, and aquaphor on top of it all nightly. Sure! my doc is Catherine LeClair at OHSU in Portland, OR. The clinic is the Vulvar Health Center and I would bet any doc there would be good. See reply to OP for name of doc! Hi! Sorry you are in this club, but I would suggest finding a new doctor. Because this is a chronic condition, you are going to want someone who is very knowledgable, understanding and compassionate. In my humble opinion, if they do not directly talk about/inquire about your sexual pleasure, they are out! \n\nI think that there is a link in breastfeeding, but it is not so direct. It is simply in the fact that LS does not love hormonal fluctuations. So, our skin and symptoms can flare with all things hormonal - menstrual cycle, pregnancy, breastfeeding. In the effort of full disclosure, I breastfed my first to 2 days after her 5th(!) birthday, and my second is 3 yrs and 4 months, and still going. I did not see any direct correlation to extended breastfeeding, as my symptoms flared and went into remission periodically throughout.\n\nI personally would recommend doing an elimination diet and seeing what foods you react to, and seeking out a functional medical practitioner to help you manage the condition. They are the best for LS. \n\nI was diagnosed at 26 and am now 41. I have had more horrendous doctors than good ones, and I think it is necessary to find one that gets it. I unfortunately am in the 20% of patients who are non-responsive to steroid treatment. If the steroids cause any side effects for you or do not provide relief, discontinue them and find alternatives. Steroid treatment did more damage to me in the long run. I will be doing some newish therapies (PRP, CO2 laser, ozone therapy) in the coming 3 months and can report back on how it all goes. And, if you are worried about using high-potency corticosteroids during breastfeeding/pregnancy, find a functional practitioner and see if they can find you medical grade ozone oil. It works really well for me. \n\nAs for telling people, do whatever makes you feel good. I am pretty open and have said, if contextually appropriate, that I have an autoimmune condition that effects the skin of my vulva. No one has ever had any strange type of reaction. Everyone has something. Breastfed April 2018-April 2019 for my first daughter. Currently breastfeeding since May 2020 (hopefully weaning this May). I had LS symptoms 6 months after giving birth to my first when my period returned. Diagnosed last month. It is so sad that in our society breastfeeding past the first year is somehow considered shameful. My doctor also told me that my daughter does not need it anymore and my  milk is empty by now \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f as if it is only about nutrition. Actually world health organization recommends breastfeeding until at least 2. Anyway, mama you know what is best for your child! I never planned to breastfeed for such a long time but then it just happens like that and I could see that my daughter needed it, but when she was ready the weaning went so smooth, no tears or anything. LS being relatively rare is not well understood, so blindly linking it to breastfeeding is premature at the very least. Thank you! Ugh I am so mad I am not close! Still on to searching...that is so great you have a center like that near you. Perhaps I will call and see if they have any colleagues in my area thank you it is a start! Thank you so much really really from the bottom of my heart. I feel like crying. I DO NOT want to stop bf my girl...I want to go until she decides to stop. I also am worried about the steroids. Thank you so much, I am looking for a Dr now, it is really hard to find one! So much good information. Definitely my sexual function is something I am so scared to lose and I want a Dr who respects that. My Dr just told me over the phone oh you have LS prob from BF...I will send you some steroid cream just use it when you feel like you need it. From what I am hearing from everyone that is not good. I think she prescribed something called clob-something I cannot remember the rest Wow you sound just like me except I had my first May 2019 and have been BF since then until now. Had LS symptoms about 12Mos after giving birth....and then another 11 months until diagnosis. I feel so much less alone now. \u2764\ufe0f Yes thank you I agree! I actually told my Dr WHO rec'ds until 2. And she said who?? Recommends ? Who? It was a really akward back and forth until I said. WHO, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. \ud83d\ude16  I am looking for a better dr now and Im leary to start treatment with my dr at all. Thank you so much for my first award \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17 honestly it seems I have been dealing with LS for a long time because your experience sounds just like my and my husband sex life from the start. So many things are becoming so much clearer now that I have a diagnosis. I remember having sex when first married very young and feeling so scratchy even with lube and like tiny knives I had to stop. Then afterwards I went to the bathroom and my skin ripped on my perineum. I thought this was all normal.  My husband and I just got used to it and yes the same he has to start very slow until I say go, and we have to use Soo much lubricant. I always thought this was just normal sex. I see now how it should never have been painful. my cream is beginning to irritate me. my dr. is ordering me that exact medication you are using! so it is nice to know that works for you. Yes, clobetasol is pretty standard treatment. It can help and can put the condition into remission, but for many of us, we are either intolerant to the steroids, non-responsive or it just makes everything take a quick downward trajectory. I cannot say for certain where you will fall on that spectrum, but you might want to get your hands on the ozone oil, and see if that helps with your symptoms before trying the steroids. Specifically mine is called Ozonid, and is manufactured in Italy. (I am located in Spain.) \n\nI was just like you - wanted my daughters to leave BF on their own terms, and I would not change my decision about that. BF \\*may\\* be causing some flaring of the LS, but I do not think it is necessary to stop, rather manage those symptoms as you will likely do from now on.\n\nI also have had a decade+ long journey to find a doctor who really gets it, and I know how frustrating it can be! The doctor who will be performing the regenerative treatments I mentioned above uses the title of \"Expert in Functional and Regenerative Aesthetic Gynecology\" - I am not sure if that can be helpful in your search. He is the first person who specifically asked and examined me with respect to sexual function - looking at how my skin pulls during penetration. At first it threw me off, but then he told me he views it as a core anatomical function - like urination, passing stool, birthing - and believes that any treatment must strive to return, stabilize or prevent damage to these core functions. Only he and my acupuncturist in the States ever cared (and I got a lot of healing from acupuncture, too)! \n\nFeel free to shoot me a message with any questions if you think I can help with anything!", "Period nightmare! Hello everyone, what do you use on your period? Pads were nightmare for me and tampons increase itchiness. Now I use cups but it is also not good for tearing.... so what about you? What do you recommend? I have had similar issues with pads and tampons. I have settled on period panties currently and they are working well, no added irritation. I found the softest pad recently!! It has some sort of breathable foam or something underneath the soft outter part. They are called Always Infinity Flexfoam. These are unscented. I find that getting the right size helps too. I would give them a try or see if Always can send you a sample. I got a Mirena iud that stopped menses completely. Solved that problem. I do not miss my periods one bit. I have always found pads irritating and tampons painful. I use period underwear, which is probably still not good for my skin (since it is not breathable) but it is way, way better than scratchy pads. Some of the cotton reusable pads also look nice; I would try them out if I had more periods, but I am lucky that my periods got much shorter and less frequent after going on the minipill. I use organic cotton pads the brand is RAEL. Definitely helps. I also cannot you tampon or cups because of tearing pain. So I have to use pads. And period underwear are just too expensive for me right now Could ypu share the brand with me? I live in Turkey so I am not sure if I can find it Yess exactly. Tampons usually dont end with tearing for me but the cotton robe cause rash and pain on my skin later the day. I usually use cups and don ger tearing also however after sex when tearing happened then it isnearly impossible to use cups without pain The brand is called \"Always\" and the product is called Infinity Flex. I got size 1. The brand itself is not anything special, but that specific type, Infinity Flex, is very comfortable for me. \"Always\" is a popular pad name here in the USA. I recently had a verrry long, heavy period, and it gave the chance to try all the brands! \ud83d\ude43I ended up really liking NatraCare ultra pads with organic cotton cover. \n\nThey are dry and breathable (no plastic) while also having a really smooth surface. Sometimes the really \u201csoft\u201d pads (or TP) are actually incredibly irritating for me, because of the fluff or lint. \n\nI agree, finding the right size is important, too, so you do not have edges irritating your skin. Oh thank you! I got diagnosted recently and kind of hate this all need for adjustment situation but started at somewhere I know, it sucks! I am recently diagnosed, too, and still figuring it out. Hang in there! I use cups and backup washable pads on heavy days, but the biggest lifesaver for me was adding a hand-held sprayer ( to my toilet.  There are cheaper ones that are made of plastic, I chose this one because it is metal.  \n\n\n\nI spray every time I use the toilet and pat dry with tp or a soft rag.  When I do not need a pad, I wear loose men's boxers, not panties.   Spraying every time has reduced my overall symptoms even better than just using aloe or coconut oil between clob doses, thus making it easier to use period products. Wow i have never know about the spray thankypu. I hate wearing panties too. Another one here for period panties. I have quite heavy periods and have found that not all brands of period underwear are created equal. I had a TON of leakage with Thinx (although I will forever be grateful to them for introducing me to the concept of period panties). The one I use now is Modibodi, and they have absolutely changed my life. I have never tried period panties. Are they comfortable with sports and what is their princible to work? Again, not all created equal. Some I found felt just like wearing a pad. But the ones I use now are extremely thin and basically just feel like wearing snuggly fit underwear and are as comfy as any other pair of undies. They do a great job of wicking away moisture so you feel dry. Even the most absorbant ones you are meant to change 8 hours for optimal health but I have regularly gotten stuck at work, or accidentally fallen asleep and used them for 12+ hours and never had a problem. Are they breathable? Do you have ithcy feeling after using? Omg that is incredible what you describe actually, thank you No itchiness and quite breathable considering. Sort of depends which ones you get:\n\nThese:  are incredible for how long they last even on my heaviest days. They have a sort of spandex fee.\n\nI also use these:  which have never failed me and have a more cotton feel. I use fabric reusable pads because normal pads irritate me and do not want to use other methods, they seem to be a lot gentler and can hold the same as a heavy pad if not more. Also saves money because I have long/heavy periods so I do not have to keep stocking up on pads. Omg following this", "Does this look like lichen sclerosis? (\n\nI noticed my vulva is taking on this white purplish hue a few weeks ago. It is a little itchy sometimes but nothing terrible and no pain. \n\nHowever. A few weeks ago this weird, white gray patch showed up that was really itchy and hurt. It cleared up but I am worried about the discoloration. Does it look like possible lichen sclerosis? I am new to my area and searching for a doctor to see but freaking out in the mean time. it does not look like LS to me based on that photo. the discoloration with LS is very white, almost like a total loss of pigmentation white. ", "Is it possible to get to a point where this is manageable? Hi guys, I posted a couple weeks ago asking for advice on itching. I have tried all the suggestions from before and while I get a little bit of temporary relief, I cannot sit on an ice pack all day etc. My question is, with the topical steroid creams, once we use them as prescribed, does everything tone itself down and then we can just manage day to day life by applying moisturizer? I have been so itchy and red that I literally can not focus on anything. \n\nThank you I am advance. I am losing my mind. You need to use the steroid creams to get it under control strait away, I left mine too long and one of my inner labia shrunk and thinned out quite a lot, and your clitoris hood can harden which you defs do not want! Use the cream every other day over all the problem areas, then you can start just using it once a week\u2026 but you cannot really stop. There is no sure for it but it can be maintained without much hassle once your on top of it. Good luck and act now. That is the info I need! My doc just gave me the steroid ointment with no further direction. How long should I do every other day, then move to once a week etc? I swear I am not dumb, I just need some direction with this \ud83d\ude05 this itching is just out of control and I want to be comfortable again :( Just keep using the steroid liberally and the itching will calm down!\n\nI had mine under control for years before a sudden flare caused some dramatic changes \ud83d\ude22 Saw a new doc who is all mad about the fear to use clobetasol forever every day, they insist we need to do it every day every day forever. Dunno - I wish I could be certain what brought on the horrible advancement I experienced this summer (I suspect it is cutting my inhaled steroid for asthma back, though). \n\nAnyway, studies keep finding no bad effects from steroiding the heck out of the vulva. Inexplicable, but repeatedly okay, so \u2026 go for it. All the steroid. Until it calms down and you can sleep again! Note taken! I was not sure how much or how little to use. I just want my life back. Prior to this I dealt with a recurring yeast infection for 4 years and finally got that cleared up and now the doctor diagnosed me with LS. There is nothing worse than trying to go about your day to day life with an itchy crotch. I need a huge tub of steroid ointment so I do not run out \ud83d\ude2b I refuse to think that it is not! It just may take approaching it with a multitude of approaches such as the steroid, diet change, life style change, supplements, and procedures (stem cell, tulip, Mona Lisa touch) can all help maximize your success in treating this beast. That is not to say that your steroid alone will not be enough, but if it is not, there is more options out there than what your doctor may have shared. Alternative medical approaches are rather common for LS to either supplement or replace the life long steroid usage. Best of luck \ud83e\udd70 Thank you for your feedback! I had to Google a few of those things but at least there are options! Hoping the steroid works and gets me where I need to be. I would love to get to where I just have to maintain. Here is to hoping lol\n\nAs far as diet changes and lifestyle changes, do you have any recommendations? Feel free to ask any questions I have experience with them since my LS has been hard to get under control. \nAnd right! All I want is manageable but LS out of control is a completely unacceptable way to have to live imo.\nI went gluten free at first and it seemed to help with itching and later I took a FoodSafe food sensitivity test and found I needed to eliminate other things like dairy and eggs and it is clear I have a flare up if I eat those things and I ate them alllllll the time before (and sometimes still get so weak for dairy \ud83e\udd24) but I really do need to be avoiding them for optimal results. I also did a GI map with a naturopath and we found out my microbiome is jacked and that could be messing with my immune system (look up candida overgrowth) so im on a bunch of supplements for that. Im also doing stem cells but it is so expensive I do not reccomend unless clob fails you. Hi hi! I would recommend this video: \n\nIt is everything you will need to know about proper medication management :) i got to a good spot by moisturizing a bunch- aquafor, emuaid &amp; my steriod. i also will soak in borax almost everyday for about 20 min &amp; gave up underwear altogether! I see you mentioned candida overgrowth\u2026 I have been struggling with recurrent yeast infections for about 4 years. It took me four years and 3 doctors to convince one of them to test me for a resistant strain and that was it. I had not had a yeast infection for a little while until I just had to take antibiotics and I am battling one now. I swear I cannot get away from the itch I ordered myself an inexpensive bamboo squatty potty, a inexpensive bidet attachment and cut all high oxalate foods refined foods simple carbs and gluten foods out of my diet.\n\nI also ordered organic cotton underwear and stopped wearing underwear and tight fitting pants as much as possible. \n\nItching being stopped almost immediately, and the cracking and fissures healed. I used a salve called Lipsten in in between my prescribed treatments\n\nYou need to figure out what you are reacting to, it is possible for things to get better. Good luck! Omg you poor thing. That sucks I am glad you got it squared away. It is insane that we have to convince doctors to help us like they should really know better but unless it is super basic it is hell communicating with them. I actually do not get candida overgrowth vaginally, as I have only had a couple yeast infections in my life. But I have candida overgrowth in my gut which can mess with your immune system. Low sugar, flour, alcohol, in general is good for a low candida diet though. I try but I cannot give up booze if my vag is going to hurt. But trying those things plus maybe boric acid could help with yeast! \n\nHave you tried borax soaks? Those help me when I am feeling really itchy  Everything should tone down. If you do it as frequently as prescribed for the duration prescribed, it should get better. My doctor had told me to continue at the initial frequency until any major itching and irritation had resolved, and then taper down. \n\nJust do not forget that you will have to stay on the topical steroids even after you get it under control! I am not OP, but would it be alright if I asked a few questions? I was diagnosed a few weeks ago and have very minor LS but it is causing quite a bit of pain. Yes of course!  And I totally understand. If you look at my vulva and judge my LS, you would say it is extremely mild. Most my doctors look at like it is nbd compared to their other LS patients, but boy oh boy, mine is sooo painful when it is bad. I hope yours responds really well to treatment! Thank you so much!! So far it is going well, I started the topical steroids about 2 weeks ago, and I have definitely noticed a decrease in itching and irritation! \n\nDo you know anything about clitoral pain in regards to LS? I have clitorodynia, but I also have LS on my clitoral hood (doc said it is basically irretractable..) so I am wondering if there is any connection. \n\nAlso, maybe this is a stupid question, but is there any way to reverse the stuck together (for lack of a better word coming to mind) skin due to LS, besides surgery? \n\nIf you do not mind me asking, do you know why yours has been so hard to treat? Wow that is amazing that you are already noticing improvement! I think that is a great sign, mine took longer for sure \ud83d\ude02\n\nI believe LS is a known cause of clitorodynia, since it can inflame that area so much and cause a lot of pain! The steroid overtime should help heal that area. That said, if you have always had the clitoral pain (like way before you had other signs of LS), then there is a possibility that there is a nerve issue as well and that could be treated separately. Btw, if your clitoral hood not being retractable causes you issues, it can be corrected surgically\n\nAnd ok this one might sound a little weird, and I have not personally experienced since I do not have fusing, but borax. It is a mineral found in the laundry aisles of target/Walmart and can also be found on Amazon. You start by adding small amounts and building up once you know you are not sensitive to it and add to your bath. It is similar to a baking soda soak. It is extremely soothing and I do it all the time. But anyways, people swear that overtime borax reverses fusing, especially if you manipulate the skin while soaking. If you join the \u201cSharing is Caring Lichen Sclerosus\u201d FB group there is loads of info about borax. \n\nI am not quite sure, I think I have some underlying issues making it worse but so far my hormones are normal. I had some imbalances in my gut and had to change my diet. LS can be hard to treat for a lot of people, but I am trying loads of things. I actually have a stem cell procedure next week that I am hopeful will really help! \ud83e\udd1e But that is just it, he did not give me a frequency or duration. Just 3 little tubes of the ointment. So I had no idea how to use it properly. I guess I am going to try once a day and then once it starts to feel better, every other day and then move to once a week after that. Thank you so much \ud83d\ude2d I saw someone else mention borax soaks. I will have to do more research on that and see if it would do more harm than good. I usually try to avoid baths because of the yeast infection issues but I feel like a hot bath would do wonders for my skin down there. Ugh lol. Thank you so much for your advice. I am trying not to let frustration take over lol I have reversed mine in a matter of months and it is almost gone. I am a male so potentially different but its either the steroid cream or my supplement regime. I have had it 5 years so I am pretty sure it is something I have changed. I added some supplements that might have reversed mine Borax is boron isnt it? I started using 9mg of boron daily 5 months ago and my LS is almost gone. That being said I did a few other things too Omg what kind of supplements?! Can I ask are you female? It is just I am Male and I believe that may be something that could affect what treatments work. For eg. I have reason to believe that LS can be due to hormonal imbalances. I started to take supplements in july to address some of these hormonal problems that I discovered from.a blood test. High prolactin is something that may be linked to LS and mine was elevated for a man. So to combat this I started taking Vit E, p5p(vit b6) and boron and zinc. I am thinking that this has correlated with a reversal of my LS. I have to point out that I didnt suffer much itching. Mine was more a progression of the white spots/scarring. Boron is also considered as a treatment for LS. I took 9mg daily as this is known to regulate male hormones. Also 5000iu of D3. It is worth pointing out at the same time I akso started finasteride for my hair. This drug lowers dht so again could have had a downstream effect on hormones however this isnt prescribed to women. I will be doing more research into all this as there be a therapeutic treatment here that is easy to start and affordable. I never saw a specialist but it would be interesting to see if any of these have been used successfully to treat LS Yes I am female! It sounds like you have your dialed in pretty well. I am going to have to do a follow up visit with my doctor and see if maybe a biopsy is in order or if they could do a blood test and maybe go from there and see what I am lacking etc. Thank you for the insight!! Ah, that is not great. Can you call or email to ask him?\n\nWhat my doctor told me was: 2 times a day for 2 weeks (or until symptoms are better). Then switch to 3 times a week, indefinitely. But I am not sure if that is a common prescription, and either way you should not necessarily follow someone else's treatment plan. I know I know. I was just hoping to get some advice until I could make another appointment with him. I might end up switching doctors because I never seem to get anywhere with this one lol I agree here. Apply a thin amount to all the problem areas every morning after a shower. I usually use my hairdryer to dry out my vagina a little first. \nMaybe right now morning and night then once the itching stops just choose which end of the day works for you. I use it twice a week at this stage now\u2026 just to be safe and stop advancement. I hear you. It sucks to have to change doctors! But it is also important to have a doctor you are making progress with. Oh, that is so interesting!! I will definitely talk to my doctor about if it could be caused by LS. I do worry about surgical correction just because it is such a delicate area? \n\nThat is crazy! How exactly do you do a soak? (Like how long, what temp of water, etc... I have not ever done one before). \n\nAh, that makes sense! I do have gut issues so hopefully that does not contribute... I hope your stem cell procedure next week helps! :D\n\nThank you so much for all of this!! Lichen sclerosis- beating the disease by Ginny chandoha saved my life Yeah surgery always has the risk of it refusing unfortunately, but a lot of women have been able to maintain it by coating in Vaseline while it heals and borax haha. \nAnd I think any temp that is comfortable! I like mine on the warmer side \ud83d\ude0d and usually it is recommended to do it for 20 min at least! If you do not have a tub you can also make a saturated solution of borax and use cotton balls/makeup pads. It can take a bit to see unfusing but it can be really soothing immediately! \n\n And thank you! I hope you feel much better soon! Yes it is a mineral salt that contains boron! Some people also ingest it or take boron supplements and have reported great results. That is fantastic Yea I started 9mg as I was told it lowers shbg which helps testosterone. It is so affordable as well. I would say I have reversed my LS by 4 years, back to what it was like when it just started", "*Game changing toilet paper.* I had to share that this toilet paper has been really amazing. My LS gets very irritated whenever I use toilet paper. Since using this toilet paper I have had less flare ups in the last 2 weeks. I can actually wipe without pain.  Where did u get this? I ordered it from Amazon. I also just found it at my local grocery store today. Thank you! Thank you so much!  Just found this at a local store yesterday and I am already happy with the difference.", "Question for the one's who is had biopsy Hello everyone! I had my biopsy done around 2 months ago, it was really really small spots he took but it still made me swell a lot for like 2 weeks. At first the spots were tender to touch, later got better. I cannot even really see where the biopsy was taken, I cannot really see any scarring.\n\nRecently I discovered small bumps around the place where my biopsy was taken. Either one or two, I cannot really tell but they are 2 to 4 mm. Feel kind of like small granules or beads. But I do not think they are right on the skin, but a bit deeper. At first I did not think they were connected to biopsies, but I want to ask you if you noticed anything like that after the biopsy? It is really not noticeable by looking, only by touching.\n\nPlease help me. I am really scared it is some dangerous growth and I cannot really go to doctor because of corona. I would also be thankful for people saying they did not have anything like that after the biopsy. hadnt had anything like that. could be connected to biopsy, could be connected to something else. But I dont think its cancer or some dangerous tissue-growth since it developed in just a few weeks. cancer typically grows over months or years. No I actually noticed it even before the biopsy but my doctor said it was just my bidy not being symmetrical, but now it got a bit bigger :( thanks for your reply keep an eye on it and make an appointment with your doc. without a tactile examination i doubt anyone can determine what it is. Yeah I would go to the doctor but now it is really difficult because of corona so I am nervous and trying to find any information online, I was also considering that maybe it is just some normal glands I am feeling but nobody seems to have them too :( dont do online research. it only adds to anxiety as long as you dont know what it is. you dont hae enough reliable information. this problem can only be solved by a trained expert. a physician is needed. after that you can do online research could be genital warts (HPV) or any number of things. really best to have a doctor look! Im a virgin and havent relaly left home since march :/", "Question! There is a little information about dark skin about this disease. All the pics that i saw from google are all white skin. So i cant really compare mine(have brown skin) Can you describe how it looks on you?\nMine is like big purple/white (not patches) like the whole vulva and it 3x lighter than my skin. It is flaky and not that itchy. And i think it is spreading. Does yours spread to? And does the color turns back to normal? Thank you!", "How on earth do I go about finding a specialist with experience/knowledge about LS in males? 25, male, UK. \n\nI have had a diagnosis and I am currently using Clobetasol a few times a week, mostly to prevent things from getting any worse, as I feel like I have reached a point where it is not getting any better no matter how many months and years I continue,\n\nI want to try and find a specialist who actually has some experience with LS in males, who might be able to offer me any different treatment options, make some recommendations with diet or supplements or basically *anything* more than my GP has offered. But I cannot find anyone even vaguely close to my location in North East England :/\n\nAny suggestions or resources that I can use to try and find someone to help? Hey I am from the UK too and found my GP was absolutely useless and the best thing they did was refer me to the hospital. I would (if you have not already) go back to your GP and insist that they refer you to the hospital to see a urologist or something. Other than that, if you want to go private and not on NHS, try look for a private urologist that may be NHS accredited. \n\nNot sure if that is much help but it definitely sounds like the GP has run out of options and this goes far beyond their training I am afraid you will usually have real tough luck trying to talk to your doctors about diet, supplements, nutrition, or natural and alternative treatment options.  Drs usually stick to the standard procedures and stuff pretty strictly unless you are paying big bucks out of pocket for private docs that dont take insurance..\n\nYou would probably have better luck getting the type of info you are looking for from other patients here or anyone besides an actual \"doctor\".  If you would like, I can tell you about how I have treated my male genital LS using nothing but a salve that I prepare at home from a few medicinal plants. The results I got were amazing.  My pigment went back to normal, itch went away, bumps on my skin healed and disappeared, and my urine stream went from spraying erratically in every direction except forward, to being completely normal again.  Basically all my LS symptoms resolved.  \n\nAnd since you asked about supplements..\nOne LS patient on here also had great success treating her LS by doing a treatment with a peptide called thymosin alpha.  She used the thymosin for something unrelated to her LS, but it inadvertently put her symptoms into remission.  N\nTheres no research on treating LS with thymosin yet, but there has been some promising looking research into thymosin and its relationship with certain autoimmune disseases and stuff.  Based on the research that is been done on thymosin, it makes sense to me -conceptually at least- how thymosin could help a ton with diseases like LS..\n\nAnyway, there is a lot more I could share about diet and all kinds of other alternative treatments and stuff, but you were kind of asking more a out doctors who can handle that, and i am just a plant medecine nerd.  If you want to continue the discussion about this stuff I would be more than happy to do that though.  I was almost beginning to think that I was the only one here who cared about alternative treatment options and stuff like that. man you live in uk and cant find a good doctor? what should i say? I live in middle east and the dermatologists here still didnt hear or read anyrhing about LS. I wish i was in Uk there one very good doctor i heared he is the best doctor for LS his name is professor Bunker. Christopher Bunker is your man My experience is GP's are not trained to recognize or treat LS. You are lucky to have the success you have had with yours. \nMy dermatologist diagnosed my LS and I get some help from my urologist.  \nSo I agree ask your GP for a hospital referal for a urologist or dermatologist. Once you are in the hospital system they can move you to an appropriate consultant. \nI suggest you approach your GP saying you thank them for their help so far but are concerned about your progress and problems and would like further help. My son was recently diagnosed, and aside from Clobetasol treatment we will be getting him circumcised, as LS/BXO is exacerbated by urine trapped under the foreskin. This was recommended by both his Dermatologist as well as Urologist. We are hopeful this will help eliminate the remaining symptoms (whiteish skin on the glans). Something to discuss with your provider, assuming you are not circumcised yet. I was actually fairly lucky in that I saw a urologist fairly early on, though his help was restricted to 'get a circumcision' so that was not really of any use. That is the only treatment I have been offered that I have not taken. I think my symptoms would have to be a hell of a lot worse for me to consider going down that route - not to mention that it might not even cure the issue. It would absolutely destroy me if I would went through with a circumcision and then it just reoccurs. I think subreddits &amp; groups like this are great for conditions like this with relatively limited public knowledge about them, but I personally would not take anything not prescribed to me specifically or *widely* recognised as helpful &amp; safe. Whoops, my bad, a couple of people have mentioned urologists now. I should have said in the main post that I have actually seen a urologist who was not really helpful in the slightest. Well I am not surprised , my urologist told me I was her only male LS patient.  Do not forget far more women have this that men. Between my urologist and dermatologist I am doing well. Seems like urologist fills  in some gaps that dermatologist is not familiar with and visa versa. Well, it sounded like you had already been using clob for years and things were not getting better..  so as far as far as your other options.. I guess there is laser therapy or stem cell treatments but i dont know how \"widely recognized as helpful &amp; safe\" those are.  You probably knew about those options already also though. I would recommend Professor Christopher Bunker in the first case. He is probably the leading UK doctor on penile skin disease. You will need to be referred by another doctor to see him. He is based in London. \u00a3350 I think for first consultation and \u00a3180 thereafter. You should be able to use private medical insurance for initial diagnosis but probably not for ongoing treatment as it is considered a chronic condition. Sorry, whilst waiting to see a specialist, minimise contact with urine - shake, wipe/wash, use a bland moisturizer like Epaderm on the glans/inner foreskin and externally which will also act as a barrier to urine, replace soap with an emollient wash such as E45 Emollient Wash for all genital cleaning. These steps really help and improves the success rate of the clobetasol treatment. I would love to hear any conventional or alternative treatments you think might work. I have had partial success with AIP diet and sunlight. Have also been looking into biologic therapy for LS though specific biologic recommendations would be appreciated. You did well to get a clob prescription. I could not convince my doctor to give me one so I have ordered it myself and am going through the anxiety of self medicating. LS treatment here sucks, I am literally going to play poker at the casino tomorrow to see if I can earn the money to see a private specialist, it is pretty absurd! Tell me about it.

Could anyone give me recommendations on any diet/supplements that have worked? I have also been prescribed 0.1% mometasone ointment that I have not used yet and wondering if anyone has had any success with this. I have been using coconut oil and that has helped a bit! I am so worried that my symptoms are going to increase and i will never be able to have sex or feel okay down there ever again. If anyone has any recommendations or tips for managing this that would be really helpful, there is not much online and I feel so depressed (However I am really lucky to have a very understanding partner). I Suggest you read the threads on here.\nThe cream you have been prescribed is a corticosteroid and not the usual corticosteroid prescribed for LS. \nI use betamethasone others use clobetasol.\nGood luck ! There is a facebook group that has helped me a lot with some of these questions (biopsy results came back as positive for LS this week). I have been doing borax baths and the itchiness has decreased a bit (some people say it helps with the fusion also) \n\nMaybe check it out the facebook group if you can, as well as some threads in here. Good luck!! Thank you! I have joined the Facebook group. Do you know if it is possible to undo labial fusion with any ointments? I was prescribed mometasone at one point (was prescribed a bunch of ointments now sitting in my medicine cabinet) but mometasone causes some burning for me. Everyone is different. Eventually my doctor told me to use whatever worked best for me (I really do have like 6/7 ointments) and that is clobetasol. Definitely read thru the threads here! A lot of times it is trial and error to figure out what works with LS. Clobestol got me into \u201cremission\u201d!! Some girls can undo it with Borax or Clob, you should check it out! A study found mometasone cream 1x a day for a month then 3x a week for 2 months to be as effective as clob.\n\nI was prescribed mometasone ointment and it burned so bad I had to run to the shower. Mometasone cream pretty much cleared the itching up in a week.\n\nDoesnt make sense since I am allergic to almost everything down there and the cream has more ingredients but who knows \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI prefer cream as it washes off in the shower and doesnt get everywhere.

You may remember that I posted here a little over a week ago when I was Dx'd with LS (I would been using clob-cream as needed for a couple of years, but this was my first official diagnosis).\n\nWell, I was referred to GYN by my GP for a dark brown irregular lesion on my minor labia just outside my vaginal opening. I saw Gynecology last Monday (7/20) and was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus, which had already caused significant deconstruction to my labia minor. The Gynecologist had her intern and team with her and explained that while almost everything they saw was consistent with LS, the dark brown (black in some places) plaque was not typical for LS and she wanted to biopsy that to rule out melanoma. The plaque measured a little over 11mm from top to bottom and probably 6mm at the largest width. They did a 5mm biopsy on the edge of the plaque (lesion? spot?) and sent with the following: \"Concern for lichen sclerosus, ( malignancy\". They told me last Monday that results typically take a week, but sometimes lately have been taking longer. They said they would call either way. I got my written results today, but still have not received a phone call. When I got my written results, I tried calling, but they were closed. Tomorrow (being Friday) has strange hours and plans/meetings/whatever for them, so it looks like I will not be able to get in touch with them until Monday and I would really like some help understanding this. Here is what it says, verbatim.\n\n\\- Consistent with lichen sclerosus.\n\n\\- See comment.\n\nComments\n\nSections demonstrate tangientially sectioned skin and evaluation is limited by suboptimal orientation. There is sparse lichenoid inflammation with mild dermal sclerosis and pigment incontinence. No epidermal atypia or koilocytic changes is identified.

The findings are suggestive of lichen sclerosus, however correlation with clinical findings is required.

My long-time girlfriend has been dealing with her LS for quite some time now, and I wanted to check in with this community to see what I could do to better support her in the process. We are still pretty young, and were quite sexually active before the symptoms began. Flash forward to years later and LS has robbed her of her sex drive entirely, which I completely understand given the amount of pain associated with sex. I want her to feel wanted and attractive, and I have been working on switching up how I show my appreciation for her to more practical things instead of sexual. Is there anything else I could be doing to making this process as painless as possible? To reiterate, I am completely fine with the lack of sex, but I do not want her to feel any less attractive or any less like a woman because of LS. \n\nThank you for any input! Props to you for wanting advice on how to be a better partner! That is really admirable! I have been dealing with LS since I was 6 and I am now 21 so I hope my advice helps a bit. I would say definitely be considerate when addressing her sex drive, it sucks not being able to have sex all the time and it probably makes her feel bad. It makes me feel really shitty and sometimes even ugly/undesirable when I cannot have sex. But knowing that my boyfriend loves me and understands what I am going through has really helped ease those feelings. It is quite easy for it to spiral from feeling bad about not having sex to being depressed and sometimes anxious. Reassure her that you care for her regardless of the sex you all may or may not be having. BUT do not over do it, even if your intentions are good it is easy to go from consideration to unintentionally making her feel worse about not being able to have sex. And when you guys do have sex try to always use some kind of lube and do not skip the foreplay. You would think so but it makes a huge difference in how much pain she is in! If you guys tend to enjoy \u201crougher\u201d sex start off slower and gentle and ease into it. I have noticed that starting off slower tends to help avoid some of the pain during and after. When you guys do have sex maybe suggest a warm/hot bath right after or allow her to rest a bit. Consider going to the store for her and picking up pain meds, coconut oil, and/or aloe Vera (pure aloe Vera with no other ingredients) those two help a lot when dealing with even minor flare ups. Aloe Vera works for me the best but it is just trial and error. During flare ups there is all sorts of symptoms that she could be having from pain, chronic fatigue and more. Maybe research it as much as you can if you have not already to understand 1) what she is going through and 2) any symptoms she might experience besides pain. \nI have had a couple really horrible flare ups and could not go to the doctor right away. I was in so much pain I could hardly walk.  If that happens to her (or even minor flare ups) get her pain meds, draw a warm bath, let her sleep and rest. If you guys live together then do things like cleaning up the house, cooking, chores will show her you care. Those things make a big difference! Granted these are all based on my own personal experiences and I am sure other people here can offer more. If you have any specific questions you can always message me I am always willing to help. The thing about being in a relationship sometimes, especially as a woman with LS is that sometimes you really want a kiss, cuddle but that is it. Let her know that is okay and that you can both enjoy that without it always having to lead to sex. Support her in finding a way to treat her LS so that she is not in pain and not to pressure her. When she is ready for sex, use lube. It will make it a lot easier for her. Know that sometimes sex can cause a flare up so sometimes she might need a break from sex to heal. LS is strange and unpredictable so other times she might be okay but to be honest that is just my experience it is a funny condition and is affects people differently. My husband has been a great supporter.  He encourages me to use the steroid cream and relates it to if you have a headache you would take Tylenol, do not feel bad if you need the cream.  I feel some shame in using it which means I am usually not going to want to have sex and him reassuring me is helpful.\n\nUse lube, take it easy while it is healing or during a flare up.  Let her choose positions where she will \u201cbe in charge\u201d because personally for me there were certain angles/positions that were definite no goes, while others that were fine, but if he tried to take over it could often switch to an uncomfortable or painful position without him meaning it.  \n\nMy doctor also said that detergents with scents or fabric softeners can make it worse, so I have started washing my sheets and underwear with sensitive detergent or scent free detergent and no fabric softener, even the sheets in the dryer.  Maybe something to think about too. Thank you so much! I really appreciate your input! I will be doing what you suggested and researching it a bit more. I really appreciate the advice, thank you so much! I have been working on this but could always improve, thank you so much for the advice!  Witch hazel wipes work wonders", "Epaderm Ointment for LS Has anyone else in our small community tried epaderm in conjunction with clobestol?

Thanks! Nope! Was it prescribed though? It would nice to it the expensive stuff with something  Nope! It was not prescribed! I got 500g of it off of Amazon for like $17.00. It is an emollient that is a 3 in 1 that you can use as like a thick body cream or a cleanser. I just smear it all over my LS spots before a warm bath and soak, then I put clobestol on.

Hi all,\n\nSo my gyno diagnosed me with LS recently after many tests for yeast, BV, trich, and other infectious agents came back negative. I have had vulvar itching that is gotten progressively worse over the past 2 years. However, one thing that seems a bit off is that I sometimes (not always) have itching IN my vagina, and I do sometimes have whitish, stringy discharge. This does not seem to jive with LS, as far as I know-- which seems like it only affects the vulva. What do you think? Ive been meaning to ask here about the discharge thing myself.  Lots of people talk about the imortance of keeping bodily fluids off of the skin/genitals, but I have seen hardly any mention of discharge in relation to LS.\n\nI noticed some kind of discharge type things going on that coincided with the development of my LS symptoms.  Since developing LS, I usually will get one or two last drops of some kind of discharge about 1-5 min after I pee or ejaculate. The consistency and appearance of the discharge is a lot like clear precum.  I always have to either wait around in the bathroom after I finish peeing, or go back to wipe off that last drop or two.  \n\nDo other people with LS experience anything similar? Might consider that discharge is pretty normal. Bodies make stuff. It works its way out. People get upset about it, but we live in bodies. Snot, vaginal discharge, and all. Might just be sometimes normal for you. \n\nIf you could compare it to egg whites, it might be you are near ovulation. The color and texture does change through the month, and that is normal. This may sound like a dumb question, but are you drinking enough water? Sometimes dehydration can make the discharge \u201cstringy\u201d, hope you are ok and get answers soon!&lt;3 You are correct, LS is considered not to affect the vagina. Lichen planus (LP), on the other hand, usually does. If the itching is more than mild, LP might be a possibility worth considering. \n\nThe discharge sounds like it could be something normal, especially if it smells ok. If it shows up at a certain time in your cycle, or after a trigger like exercising in tight clothes, that is probably normal. I always notice extra discharge after I shave. If it shows up at the same time as the itching then I would be more concerned. Thanks for replying. This discharge is different from any I have gotten before, which is why I feel like it is weird. It does seem to be within the \"normal\" range, but it is not normal for me, which is why I am a bit wigged out.", "Biopsy being sent out for 2nd opinion. Anyone else? My preliminary diagnosis is eczema but my biopsy is being sent out to another lab for final diagnosis. Has this happened to someone else? Did you end up getting the same results as the preliminary?", "4 questions, 3 for males, 1 for females (I am doing research for a story and stumbled on this sub.)\n\n\nFor males:\n\n1. Is it possible to contract this disease with a short foreskin?\n\n\n2. Does it start because of diet and lifestyle? How?\n\n\n3. Is it something you heard of and were scared of getting?\n\n\nFor females:\n\n4. As a woman, I am a bit frightened now knowing we can get it too, thought it was a guy thing lol. What can I do to lower the risk of getting it aside from eating less carbs and drying really well down there to avoid fungal infections? D: It is an autoimmune thing so I am not sure how to deal with that. Exactly. They do not actually know what causes it, but \u2018they\u2019 suspect it is autoimmune which means people have a genetic predisposition for it which is triggered somehow. More common in women then men.  ( is a good place to start your research. You do not necessarily just \u201cget it\u201d that assumes it is contagious and we want to avoid that terminology, it is damaging enough having to explain to your partners why it looks like an STI or something when it is not.\n\nIt is mostly genetic and autoimmune so even if you try to avoid it you will probably get it if you just have a body like that I guess. Kind Of sucks but yea. Agreed with all other commenters - there is zero research that says \"eating less carbs\" or fungal infections have anything to do with Lichen Sclerosus. It is not an infectious disease or something you can \"get\". It is an autoimmune condition. You may be confusing tips for people who already have LS: some doctors recommend certain diets to reduce symptoms and taking extra precautions to keep the area clean to avoid infections.", "Should I make a YouTube channel about my condition? I was diagnosed in June 2018 and I have had PT and seen maybe different doctors with a lot of success although I still cannot fully have PIV sex. I also have lichen sclerosis which is an autoimmune condition that affects the skin around my vulva and labia. I am about to get PRP shots that will help regenerate healthy skin and make sex and dilation less painful. I was thinking about vlogging about my experience and at the same time shining more light on sexual/reproductive dysfunctions. Would this be something you would watch or enjoy learning about? Please let me know honestly before I say a lot of vulnerable stuff on the internet. I have this condition and I would not watch anything to do with it. This has three reasons: first of all, I have health anxiety. It does not help if I deal with this stuff all the time. Second, my condition is not severe and it is well managed for now, so I do not need outside opinions. Third, I prefer reading about medical stuff using serious sources. \n\nThat said: I am assuming you could raise awareness by doing what you think about. I believe many people do not know they have this issue because they are ashamed they have this issue. You would probably be doing a good thing. Just consider if you can deal with talking about this topic all the time, if it will not make your life worse constantly dealing with it. Thank you for the honest feedback. What I had in mind was similar to a video buzzfeed did that really humanized the condition and made it easier for me to deal with. I hope you are doing okay.   \n( I hope your new treatment will help and this condition will impact your life less. Good luck. Yessss not enough people are aware of this condition! Share your journey if you are comfortable \ud83d\udc95 I am leaning towards doing it on YouTube! Will keep you all updated :-) I am interested in this! I searched online and found a couple of people that have a video or two about it but not everyone is video style is to everyone else's taste. Plus it is always good to get the word out there! Best of luck - I know someone just posted asking about those shots so I am sure they are not the only one who will be interested to see how they work for you! Thanks for the feedback! I will be getting the shots in about a week. Not sure but I think I might have been the one who just posted about that haha. Haha that was indeed you! I hope you get more interest on that post, but I have personally never heard of them before. I hope it helps you!", "Help! I have tried everything. This is the worst breakout / tear I have had and it is SO persistent I have tried my clobetasol, Vaseline, and am going to try triple antibiotic cream.

Inguinal lymphadenopathy &amp; dermatopathic lymphadenopathy Anybody in the LS community have either of these two diagnoses?  I have had both for some time and have not had any luck finding an underlying cause.  I am wondering if LS could somehow be relevant to these diagnoses?  Anybody have anything similar? Or any thoughts?", "Do white spots flake or rub off? I am wondering if anyone ever has raised small white bumps that eventually rub off? I get them around my clitoris and on the clitoral hood, but they usually will flake or rub off after a week or so. I am currently waiting for biopsy results. I am very scared. My LS does not, but psoriasis does flake off like that A LS dx is terrifying and depressing so give yourself some space and time and know it can become manageable. I have white bumps on my groin on damaged skin and have been told they are milia (feels like sitting on cactus). Never heard of LS flaking or rubbing off so maybe it is something else. xo The steroid ointment causes my skin to slough off after 2 or 3 days. This process removed thick scar tissue on underside of glans. The thin white spots on glans come and go with the ointment.", "Will circumcision help? Hello, I am 24 and have had phimosis since the age of 19; which developed after an inflammation and multiple scars due to my rough and unlubricated masturbation habits back then.\n\nBeing in a very bad emotional state, I pourly handled the situation and continued masturbating even when the skin was red.\n\nIt was my only escape.\n\nUnaware and so \"depressed\", this unhealthy practice, (of masturbating with an unhealed foreskin) caused my phimosis and A LOT of pain.\n\nAfter a while, I used a steriod cream based on the doctor's recommendations who advised getting the cut. But my phimosis got better to the point where I can fully retract the foreskin when flaccid and right before the beginning of the corona when erect. Therefore I stopped worrying.\n\nI left things as they are, and now, almost a month ago I started feeling an itch around the phimotic ring, and that itch was not going away. So I booked an appointment, and the urologist told me that I have very early signs of lichen sclerosus. I think it started because the endless scar/heal process. The doctor suggested circumcision but I told him that I prefer not to. He did not argue and said that my foreskin looks fine/okay at the moment.\n\nHowever, reading about the condition (lichen sclerosus), I feel that it is better to remove that damaged foreskin for good and finally get circumcised after all those years. I honestly only kept it for the hopes that it might heal one day.\n\nAny advice? Has anyone been in the same situation? Pictures you find online tend to be of advanced cases, so if yours does not look like those, that does not necessarily mean it is not LS, especially since the doc said you have \"early signs.\" That said, it never hurts to get a second opinion. \n\nThe circumcision thing is a very personal choice, and I do not think there is a right or wrong choice, since circumcision is likely to be helpful, but steroids can also be effective for many people. I was in a somewhat similar situation in that both my GP &amp; a urologist suggested a circumcision with minimal other options on the table. Personally my symptoms were not/are not significant enough to want to go through a permanent change like that.\n\nA big part of my concern is that even with this drastic step (circumcision) it does not always work. I cannot think of anything more frustrating and disheartening than to have a circumcision and then *still* have LS to deal with.\n\nJust out of curiosity: what steroid were you using originally? &amp; what did the urologist prescribe?", "NSFW photo, is this LS?  On my inner labia and fold between the labia minora and majora? I have been suffering with vaginal discomfort for months and recurring yeast infections and I just want to know what is going on.\nI have treated the yeast infection 6 times, once with 10 days of fluconazole and most recently with 2 weeks of boric acid. my typical yeast symptoms are gone but this white stuff that does not come off is there and I am having discomfort on the side where the white patches are. For the past 6 months I have had some sort of discomfort or issue with my vagina and I am stressed about it constantly. its basically taken over my life and I spend most of the day with my vagina issues in the back of my mind. I am at the end of my rope. Any opinions at all are appreciated It does look like LS. Find a dermatologist who is familiar with LS and a biopsy can tell you with 100% certainty. Good luck Thanks so much! Just knowing what is going on will be a huge relief   Of course! Do you have any fusing of the skin that you can see?? If not, you are in a good place to control the active lichen and keep the disorder at bay with long-term maintenance. Even with fusing, it is not the end of things. My labia minora are literally gone. Fused and absorbed into the labia majora :( BUT the symptoms are manageable for a lot of women. If it IS lichen sclerosus, make sure you find a competent, educated doctor. It is about 50/50 in who people prefer: a dermatologist vs a gynecologist. Personally, I had much better luck with a dermatologist, as LS is a skin condition first and foremost. It just happens to affect the genitals. No fusing thankfully. I plan on asking for a dermatologist because like you said I think it will be more likely that they will know what they are doing in this case and I really do not want the run around. Does the white area on the labia minora looks like LS to you as well? Most photos I have seen of LS look like my fold area does with the shiny white skin, but I have not seen anything that looks like big clusters of white patches like on my labia It usually starts with small white areas/patches and it will progress to larger patches without treatment. Treatment is usually a potent steroid cream (clobatesol) that is applied to the active lichen disease. If the active disease is not stopped or controlled, it will cause atrophy and scarring of the tissue. Also, do your own research, but a derm skilled with this condition will assure you that using the cream as prescribed WILL NOT cause the skin to thin. You will read a lot online that says the steroid cream makes LS worse. This is false. Active LS thins the skin.  Not the steroid cream. The mucosa skin of the labia does not react to the steroid cream like normal skin would and it does not thin the skin. I am currently on month 2 of applying clobetasol twice a day to get the active disease under control to prevent additional atrophy and fusion. I have had no issues at all. There is still some (misinformed) debate about this but again, this is my educated opinion after doing research and talking to my doc. ETA that yes, it all resembles LS to me, especially with your symptoms. Incorrectly treating LS as a yeast infection is unfortunately super common Honestly looks like smegma to me. Have you tried to wipe it off? Try it  Yes I have tried it cannot be wiped off", "Did your biopsy results come back positive for LS even though you do not have white patches? I have been conflicted. I had two punches done and they do not suspect LS. They have told me it looks more like Eczema. How accurate are these biopsies? I do not have any white patches, thin skin or tears. Just a fiery itchy vagina with \u2018cracks\u2019 that are mentioned with eczema. I guess what prompted my obgyn to suspect LS was because I have no inner labia in addition to all the itchy I was having. (It never disappeared, it was never there ever, and there is no sign anything was there. I suppose it is possible that I am just different than the norm.)\n\nHas anyone tested positive for LS through a punch puppet but did not have any white patches?\n\nMy punches were taken on the vestibule (where the obgyn suspected shrinking) and on the area where the \u2018inner labia\u2019 would be located which has a raised texture that looks similar to fordyce spots.\n\nThank you! Sounds just like me! I am currently trying to get someone to do a biopsy! That is great! I hope you can get one soon. It is well worth the discomfort for a few weeks. I am just afraid that the biopsy is not totally accurate. I would be totally happy having eczema over LS, but I also do not want to be wrongfully treating myself and things get worse! LS is so scary!", "How long does it usually take for clob to absorb? I take medication that makes me have to use the bathroom frequently. I am scared that I am not giving to clob enough time to absorb before going to the bathroom and that when I do it is coming off with the toilet paper. I was only diagnosed a week ago and was not given much information other than where I should put it. \n\nPs: I know alot of people say to pat dry but I do not have tearing and I never feel clean when I do which causes me paranoia leaving me to wipe instead.", "Did not use my clob for two weeks- queue INTENSE itching hi all- i have not had any severe itching or tears for the longest time this year (two and a half months) due to my everyday use of clob. Two weeks ago i had a lot going on in life and decided it was good to try to get off it anyways. Three days ago, 6 days post period, i noticed a small itch returning. This small itch has turned into all out hell again, but there are no tears present. It feels slightly abnormal when urinating, prickly, dry, flakeyish, and from my scratches looks incredibly red/ raw in some spots aright near my vaginal entrance. \n\nIs this a typical flareup for all of you? \n\nBesides using the clob, what can I do to help it? I do not have any recommendations. But I relate to this so hard. I hope you feel better soon! I would recommend never to do that again. It is not going to feel better if you stop using the ointment. i so agree, honestly just sheer silliness. If you dont mind me asking- Is this what your typical flare up is like though? i have only been visually diagnosed due to a white patch on my inner vulva (can be seen on my profile) and the constant itchiness before using the clob! I was thin as tissue paper it was white I have spilts and it didnt look good. I have had this for 13 years. It has gotten worse for me and I have to see a specialist If you wouldnt mind, and totally understand if this is uncomfortable, on my profile I posted two images, do you mind seeing if they resemble something you have experienced? and on top of that, how was the itchiness for you? Omg the itchiness is horrible I usually want to scratch it with a fork but if you need to itch just rub with the palm of your hand. okay yes this definitely describes my feelings hahaha It was white like that but everywhere good to know though that the symptoms are consistent that which means the clob should kick in again in a few days\u2014 just have to suffer through the itchiness that is EVERYWHERE Lol yeah I unfortunately lost most of my lips and my clitoris is pretty much scarred over that why I have to see a specialist I am so sorry. This is truly the most annoying. When you get the itching is it typically everywhere for you as well? Yes it does Instead of stopping why not just decrease the frequency of use? i read about some using only once a week and they maintain LS is likely an autoimmune condition.  There are proteins in the bottom layer of the skin of the genital area that the body identifies as \u201cnot self\u201d and mounts a local immune response (inflammation) within this skin, leading to thickening and scarring.  The skin tears not because it is too thin, but because it is thick and inflexible (like a crack in concrete).  The inflammation is constantly being produced and so a topical steroid applied in the optimal way (soaking, rubbing in) is needed to decrease this inflammation in the skin.  I generally recommend maintenance therapy with a topical steroid, such a clobetasol, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, further scarring, and vulvar pre-cancer.  Maintenance therapy is typically twice a week, but always consult your doctor to determine the best regimen for you.  A specialist can help determine the best treatment regimen. If you would like more information visit  under Conditions We Treat or follow my educational Instagram  That is actually an excellent point and one I should have been wise enough to do Hello! Thank you so much for your response. I was prescribed clobetistol by my doctor in November, but was still uneasy about using or starting it. It was in January that I officially committed to the regimen of two times a day for two weeks then do as seen fit. \n\nThe itchiness is definitely just the most annoying part. The tear I have only ever had consistently in one spot, with only one other appearing somewhere else in similar fashion to the one on my profile! \n\nThanks once more for getting back to me!", "Vaccine &amp; LS Has anyone gotten the covid vaccine that also has LS? Curious if you had any LS flare up or side effects worsen after? I know there is mixed info on if LS in autoimmune or not but I read that some people with autoimmune issues might have some bad side effects after. I have been in Moderna covid vaccine trial. I requested unblinding and that happened last week\nSo I have had both #1 and 2 shots August and September 2020.\nI have LS and been under treatment for about a year when I had the shots. \nI had no noticable flares or worsening of symptoms.\nMy slow improvement for adhesions has continued.\nI hope this puts your mind at rest.\nMy vaccine card from moderna is posted on my Facebook page if you are interested No change in the ls. It got the first round moderna last Friday. This is so helpful, thank you. \u201cAutoimmune weirdness\u201d has been my concern on the vaccine - since medical and scientific types so often dismiss it. We know real stuff is happening with our bodies, they call it hysterical nonsense and do not know how to measure it so they say it is not real ... I have some concerns. Likely to vaccinate anyway, but this has been specifically on my mind. I know that \u201cthe plural of anecdote is not data\u201d,  but anecdotes are likely all we are going to get. Thank you so much for yours! I would imagine anyone with an autoimmune disease could go thru a period of flares after any vaccine, since it elicits an immune response. I am reluctant to take the vaccine as in a healthy 30yo male and I dont this to progress any quicker. Does the white scaring ever disappear? I dont really have flare ups. Just a progressing white discolouration Got vaccinated while getting worked up. No changes, just the typical vaccine side effects.", "will i lose my clitoris forever? so idk if i have yeast or ls. i am quite a hypochondriac and everyone is saying it is yeast, which i am soon getting a prescription for. but if it is ls, will i lose my clitoris from fusion and never be able to orgasm again? I have LS and have been living 6 years without a proper diagnosis. So far I have lost my inner lips, but my clitoris is still there. I started to get slight itching on it, but never thought much of it until I was diagnosed about 2 weeks ago. Have you noticed changes down below? If yeast comes back negative, you should definitely mentioned LS to a Gyno or dermatologist to be sure. The earlier treated, the less risk of losing stuff. Wish all those years of visiting the docs caught it sooner. Unfortunately it is rare so not many docs notice it. I am sure if I did not mention the name of this disease, this doc would have missed it too. Your clitoris is primarily inside so I do not think so 42YO, 12 years diagnosed but had it much longer. Can report that clitoris is still here and fully functional. sweet. is early detection of white patches and going to the doctor asap also a good thing? will that help it not progress any more? Probably not, no.\n\nEven if it is LS, there are treatments that will slow/prevent fusions.\n\nIf, like me, it is not diagnosed until after full fusion of the hood (years and years and years of going to the doctor thinking it was yeast/BV, only to be told there was no infection and I am fine), there are laser surgery options to allow it to pop out from under the hood again.  I honestly had no idea the hood had fused closed, my orgasm function was never decreased.\n\nFull clitoral fusion/reabsorption comes pretty late in the game, if at all. what a fuckin relief. thank you for the reassurance. Everybody is different. And it is related to hormones, so your case may be difficult to predict if you are on T. You would want to discuss that with your doc. \n\nSlowing or halting the progression of the disease is certainly important. You do not get back external features that are lost. \n\nBut.... you really probably have a yeast infection. LS is not common. Yeast is super common. Treat for that first. If you have got a paper-thing purple-white figure eight going on, then yeah, look at LS. If you have got itching? Completely reasonable to assume yeast until proven otherwise. i have white patches, but not in a figure 8 way. doctor said white patches are also common in yeast. They are! Here is hoping it is just yeast and easily cured.", "Mona Lisa and Prp Hi everyone, I have been told that it is not a treatment or cure for lichen sclerosis but I am wondering if it helps with current scarring ?

While I had my stitches in for two weeks, I did not apply clob and had no itching. All of sudden, when back on clob, my flare ups have been through the roof. What could be happening? It is been 5 days since back on clob and it is painful. Do you use the cream or the ointment? Sometimes people have reactions to the ingredients in the cream. \n\nOther people find clob too strong. I was one of those people and my doctor gave me triamcinolone ointment instead. It is not quite a strong but it does the trick beautifully and does not irritate the crap out of my skin like the clob did. It is the ointment. It is weird, no issues until this ointment came about I was given Tri because my insurance did not cover the clob. Where should triamcinolone be applied? Everywhere or just white spots? I just got diagnosed a few days ago and he said twice a day. I put it anywhere I am having symptoms, which does not always have white patches. If you have got a hand mirror around, it is worth it to take some time to get a really good look at what exactly is going on and check out areas you have itching or pain just to see what they look like so you can get a better idea of where to apply it. I stopped trying to be super accurate about not applying it to non-affected skin after awhile, since it tends to get spread around while you walk around anyway. I just make sure the symptomatic and white areas are covered and then go about my day. It is also best to use the smallest amount possible. I apply it to both front and back and just use a blob about the size of a pea. Thank you so much!", "Male Lichen Sclerosus Subreddit Creation Assistance! Can someone please create a \"Male Lichen Sclerosus\" subreddit? My account is still very new and its not allowing me to create a subreddit. It seems like a majority of Lichen Sclerosus discussion and information I can find is usually related to females. I would love to see a place where males can discuss this, as it is much less common to occur for males.  I hope the males in this subreddit join that subreddit, so we can compare notes and methods/tips on how to handle LS. Thanks in advance! Do you have LS op? Or is it contact dermatitis/fungal..etc? Does it give symptoms like burning or pain? I have LS on my penis foreskin, but what is op? They thought it was dermatitis originally, but took a biopsy and confirmed it was LS. It might have started at dermities but seems to have progressed, as this doctors were not very clear. It does not burn or itch, but I think scar tissue is forming and I have white plague. Also, its has caused phimosis to start as I started to noticing frenum brave about 2.5 weeks ago.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I have started treatment with 0.05% *clobetasol* propionate daily for a month, then every other day for a month, then im told 2 times a week after that. Im trying to find more information on this, but seeing stuff for mens LS progression is few and far between. Additionally, these doctors now days seem to give you very little information and send you on your way.\n\nHere are my current outstanding questions that im trying to figure out.\n\n1. When LS is controlled will the white plague go away?\n2. Will white plague only show when I have flared skin?\n3. Will sex cause flares forever?\n4. When is my skin considered at its best vs being flared? I dont know what is considered healthy skin for those that have LS in a certain area.\n5. Where should I be putting the  0.05% *clobetasol* propionate? Only on the white plagues and skin or on any tight skin as well?\n6. Anything I didnt ask that, you think I should know? Do you get flares from sex? In what way? I support your plan to have a sub for male LS, but I also want to say that I hope guys can also feel comfortable posting in this one. LS is more common in women, yes, but it is by no means rare in guys. I have seen a lot of people with penile LS posting here, and I hope they continue feeling comfortable enough and welcome enough to do so. I applied to be a moderator of this sub (although I have not heard back yet) and I am working on compiling a wiki with information for all genital and hormonal types. 1. I think the white plaques can go away with treatment, yes, but major scarring or structure changes might not (but it sounds like you do not have any of that yet, thankfully)\n2. I think the plaques are visible most of the time until remission; they are relatively stable. I think when people say \"flare\" they mean a period when symptoms get really bad, like itching or pain. \n3. Pretty sure sex will be fine with successful treatment. I do not think sex necessarily causes flares even now, although if the sex is rough on your foreskin or other troubled areas then it could aggravate symptoms or promote progression. \n4. Again I think \"flares\" generally means high-symptom times, and you do not have much symptoms (only signs.) But I guess if a plaque goes away and then comes back, you could call that a flare. I guess for healthy skin they will look for the white plaques diminishing, thick and elastic skin that does not tear easily, and no adhesions or phimosis. But I actually have been wondering how they will know if the treatment is working for someone who does not have symptoms. For me, I do not have a lot of itching or pain (just a bit) and I do not think the changes to my vulva will be reversed very fast. I will ask the doctor (appointment in January) how we will know if the treatment is working.\n5. I am not sure if you apply it to just the troubled areas, or the whole foreskin (or whole vulva in my case.)  I will ask if I get prescribed an ointment or cream (which I hope I will.) I suggest you call the doctor who prescribed it, and ask them exactly where to apply it and how much to apply.  \n6. \\* I assume your doctor told you that LS, when limited to the penile foreskin, is often curable by circumcision. Using medicine instead is a totally valid choice if you want to keep your foreskin, but they should tell you that so you can decide. Steroids can also be curative for early-stage penile LS, whereas for adult vulvar LS it is almost always a lifelong thing.  \n\\* Breathable underwear is your friend, like cotton or maybe silk. Polyester and tight clothes can aggravate skin conditions.   \n\\* Moisturizing is usually recommended. I read to use half paraffin half vaseline, and I do not know where to get that, so I have been using vaseline. Do not use anything scented or with a lot of potentially irritating ingredients. Lube is also recommended for sex, usually in the context of protecting the vaginal introitus, but I should think it would be helpful for preventing abrasion on the penis, too. \n\nI am not a doctor and I am still learning about this, so you should definitely confirm questions with your doctor. \n\nStill, I think we should definitely have a FAQ for this sub that covers such questions. That would rock! Yeah its a strange concept as the disease is teh same, the issue is the disease is occurring on different genders organs which makes things different. I  really appreciate your feedback on my earlier post.  Also, to not be to graphic. Yeah also sex is rough on my foreskin as im aiming to get that rubbed. I was trying to see if this means the treated with steroids if intense rubbing was possible, if steroid were used after. I have a couple other questions, but dont want to be too graphic with a lot of other women reading this. Yeah I would think as your skin heals and recovers, hopefully it will be able to handle it. I would still recommend plenty of lube though. \n\nPersonally, I do not mind graphic questions. I actually wrote my senior thesis about circumcision if you can believe that. But I understand that not everybody is comfortable with it. I think having a thread marked NSFW and with a content warning should help people discriminate before reading if they are comfortable with it or not.

I had to do some digging, this is how I got rid of my LS:\n\nhere is a link to another posters experience w/ Ginny's book:\n\n\n\nhere is my experience:\n\n You have absolutely got this, you have made it this far you can keep going and you will find relief along the way! I have type one diabetes, psoriasis and Lichen Sclerosis and you just find something that works for you eventually! The best advice I can give is to be gentle with yourself, gentle on your skin and mind. Try to find moments to be mindful and take some breaths because stress can really irritate any autoimmune condition. Do not use any soaps on the affected area, water only, use a non perfumed moisturiser (preferably one that is used for eczema etc) to ensure no friction or drying out, until you can get the medications you need to treat the skin. \n\nYou have made it this far, and you are incredibly strong to cope with all that life has thrown at you! We will all be waiting here for you when you need us again I am so sorry! There are a few lichen sclerosis support groups on Facebook that are very helpful, please give them a try. I am sorry that you are going through so much. What does your support network look like? Do your kids know what you are going through? Do you have a therapist? I know I have been glad to be able to talk to my therapist about my LS. A good therapist can help you develop coping mechanisms to live your life again, even in the midst of chronic pain and illness. \n\nHave you tried urinating in a bath or with a squirt bottle? It dilutes the urine and helps it not to burn. An ice pack is also nice for flare-ups and when you are trying to sleep. I have a weird question. Has it gotten worse over time and does it seems to be restricted like a stricture inside the ureter? For what I have found out is using ureteral dilators has been a night and day difference. Hurts a little once and then it is just keep using what is comfortable every so often when it feels like it is getting bad again. Thankyou \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Thankyou You are beautiful.. my kids do know. I ended up in the emergency today and because I could not walk or pee and had severe pain I was shaking they would not give me anything for pain. My gynaecologist is away and the secretary told me to ask for the gynaecologist.. I asked and they said sorry\u2026he is delivering babies. They discharged me in crazy pain and gave me an over the counter pain medication that the pharmacist said they should never have prescribed me having diabetes and low blood pressure meds. Help me Can you find a doctor that will help you figure out what works for your symptoms? You have a lot on your plate, and anyone would be overwhelmed, exhausted, and frustrated! I am not sure where you are from, but here is a list of phone numbers that might help when you are feeling this way. They are there for a reason and can help! \n\n That sounds like an awful time. Unfortunately, I think the emergency departments do not handle pain management very well. Is there any way you could get an appointment with a pain specialist? And a urologist? Thankyou so much. Today is bad and just getting through it. Once I can handle my daily functions and not be shaking and screaming I we I will do this . Monday I assume \u2665\ufe0f Thankyou but the suicide numbers are not necessary", "Just got diagnosed... 27, f, glad it is not cancer, but feeling hopeless. It is early stage, my doctor said. Is fusing a guaranteed thing that happens at some point? I am just most scared of how it is going to look eventually and if I will have fusing at some point. I have a white patch on my inner labia already that is been growing bit by bit over the last year. I am having symptoms that i thought were a yeast infection, but now I guess it is confirmed it is because of LS. \n\nCan it affect clitoral orgasm, too? I started having reduced orgasms last year and they are still not like they used to be. Maybe it is unrelated, but thought I would ask..\n\nThank you so much for any insight. I am crushed and terrified for the future. I was diagnosed @ 27 also, did not realize the severity, then when it started getting real bad read more into it and started to experience the affects of it: depression, sadness, etc due to the fact it just does not work right.\n\nThen I bought and read ginny chandoha's lichen sclerosis beating the disease.\n\nMy LS is pretty much gone. Only effects me if I have sex 3x or more a day.\n\nI do about 80% of what she told me to do, and I also use a cream called Perrins Ultimate Cream. I was also just diagnosed, 22F. Sending you hugs! Is your clitoris fused with the hood? If it becomes covered then you can experience less pleasure, but there may be surgical options if it has professed to that point. I am sure your doctor would have mentioned it though. Using the steroids will suppress the disease and if you follow the regimen, it should prevent future fusion. With consistent treatment and monitoring with a physician you trust, you can prevent fusion as much as possible. Some people have also found that borax soaks help prevent and even reverse fusion. I have been soaking once or twice a day to manage the pain, and I think I do like the borax in addition to clobetasol. I am still not out of the woods, not even close, but I am hopeful that with treatment things will go back to normal soon. \ud83d\udc97 Hi, I am interested to know more about this book !  Can you summarize the regimen she proposes ? Thank you Nope! Lol. It is huge and you need to read the book. YOU ARE worth it, fellow LS'r", "any pointers for newbies? Just diagnosed a little under 2 weeks ago and feeling slightly better but terrified of any issues that come down the line (read some horror stories so I feel a little worried).\n\nIs there anything you can recommend that I should look out for, do, or try beside applying my medium grade steroid, avoiding tight clothing/keeping the area dry, and avoiding hot baths (hard for me but I am going to find another self-care routine).\n\nI feel like I was diagnosed and then left in shock and now that it is more settled, I am trying to be proactive if I can. I am curious to know how you were diagnosed? My obgyn was sure I had LS but my 2 biopsies came back negative. I treated for 3 months with minor relief. When ever possible do not wear underwear and let the air in. If you get a flare up zincofax for diaper rash is good but messy. Do not know why you cannot do hot baths, lots of people with LS do. \n\nSwitch to a Free/Clear laundry detergent, stop dryer sheets, check out the Low Oxalate diet. Try to learn your triggers, or where you are in your menstrual cycle when it bothers you. Do not use anything harsh to clean the area, literally just use water and a very soft cloth or your fingers. Avoid soaps or anything that may irritate it. The baths things was on a list that I got from my doctor. \n\nThanks! I think it was the partial fusion on one side of my labia minora, the wrinkly paper look, and thin white patches. I will message my doctor but she was convinced when I was in her office. Are you doing any other types of treatment/still experiencing vulvar pain now that you have been negative? Mine was also convinced 100% just by the fact that I do not have an inner labia (never have) and my skin was not bouncing back. It was so inflamed, dry and red. But I supposed if you have white patches/thin skin and fusing it is most likely true, but it does not hurt to be totally sure! A biopsy saved me from being wrongfully diagnosed. It could be nice for a peace of mind the doctor that did my biopsy is more experienced in skin diseases so they were able to answer my questions much better than my obgyn! I highly recommend moisturizing in addition to steroid use as per the doc that did my biopsy. (something my obgyn did not tell me to do.) I highly recommend aquaphor! I hope you can find relief soon! Sorry! I tried to save your next comment but I accidentally deleted it! I grabbed a screenshot. Thank you so much for your help, this is super helpful. I am moisturizing and have stopped my birth control + using estrogen cream. I had a follow up yesterday with my obgyn, we suspect it is hormone related as I have other symptoms such as abdominal bloating/night sweats/painful urination. I have a follow up with my biopsy doctor next month. It is like the answer was there all along but no one could figure it out, so I have basically gone through everything at this point. But I swear, the aquaphor ointment is amazing for moisturizing! Also, When they thought I had LS I was also suggested to use estrogen by the biopsy doctor. (But I was scared to use it at the time.) I am glad you found it helpful! It is a struggle, and if ever you find useful studies online I highly recommend bringing it to your doctor. It is the only thing that got me where I am now after 8 visits and getting nowhere! It is an uncomfortable thing to go through, it is nice to be able to help others and get help from others going through the same! \ud83d\udc95  We have lots of suggestions and over 11,000 members.

Hi, I am literally brand new to reddit and this subreddit, but I was not sure where else to go.   \n\n\nI just turned 20, but I have been diagnosed and getting treatment for LS since I was about 9. I have never felt like I can relate to / am welcomed to any support forums because my condition is relatively mild and everyone there is so much older. It feels very disheartening when women in their 40s and 50s say that the disorder ruined their life because they cannot be sexually active anymore, whereas I have not even started. I have so many questions about growing into adulthood and becoming sexually active with this condition.   \n\n\nIs there anyone out there who knows of a support forum for people like me, or would be willing to answer some questions from their own experience? Thanks :) this is the support forum, if you actually read through the posts here you will see that many posters are in their early 20s It is an especially cruel disease and my heart goes out to you. I was diagnosed just about 6 mos ago and found lots of info on treatments plus support from a facebook group of 4000 women. Typically I do not seek medical advice, or anything else from fb, but the group has helped me immensely. It is different for everyone of course but w treatment and finding ways to manage it the majority of the group are able to be sexually active. And it is the same for me after initially thinking it would be impossible. Take care of yourself. When I first began researching LS I thought I would not be able to find more people around my age too (I am 22), but when I joined this forum I realized a lot of posts are from people in their 20s, which made me feel less lonely. Read through the posts and you will find a lot of advice from people in our age range. Good luck!!! 26F diagnosed when I was 5/6 yo. Have found if condition is well managed it does not need to stop you from having a normal sex life. Have a lot of experience with this that I would be more than willing to share. \u270b\ud83c\udffb 26 y/o F here with lichen sclerosus  22 F here \ud83e\udd1awith lichen sclerosus was diagnosed when I was 20! I totally understand how you feel... that is how I used to feel until I found this reddit page! Turns out there is a lot more people our age than I expected! You are not alone\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc95 far from it! When I got diagnosed, it really did scare me having sex. If you are managing your symptoms and if you follow the recommendations of doctors you should be okay\ud83d\ude0a Sex can be painful but that is different for everyone, this does not stop you from having sex. You can have enjoyable sex too without being in pain. It is important to stick with the treatment, to keep moisturizing, have foreplay and lube is a lifesaver! If you do have any questions or want to talk, feel free to message me. I would be happy to help\ud83d\ude0a Take care\u2764\ufe0f 24F here. Was diagnosed 4/5 weeks ago and given a steroid cream to use for 2 weeks. After 2 days of using the cream it didnt sting after using the toilet and after a week all tearing had healed. I didnt have sex while I was having symptoms as I was absolutely terrified after reading other womens description of sex. My partner and I used KY Jelly lube which I highly recommend and we took things slow to start however it felt like normal. I had no tears down there after and no burning. I did stand into the shower with the shower hose to rinse the area after to prevent any irritation. \nIt is looking normal again, any of the whiteness I did have had disappeared and no further symptoms. I think the key to this is catching and treating it early. You have to stand up for yourself until you are heard. Also, when I went to the doctors the first doctor tried to blame it on thrush and me using different products down there. I was having to tell her over and over that I wasnt using anything different. She repeatedly was wiping the discolour skin (possibly thinking I was dirty down there?) Which caused more tearing! She thankfully got another doctor to come and see and that doctor had better knowledge and prescribed me the cream. Just posting this to say that some doctors might try and brush you off but there are good doctors out there. Of course, I definitely will! It is nice to know I am not as alone as I was when I was a wee one haha 31f here. Married with 2 kids and a perfectly active sex life. It has been inconvenient and annoying at times, but has certainly not ruined it for either of us! Mid 20s / male.\n\nIt took me a long time to get a diagnosis of LS - but thankfully it has not really impacted my sex life much. I have phimosis most likely due to LS but it is not caused me many issues. Just annoying that my body has decided not to work properly. Glad to see others your age chiming in. I am 43, and was diagnosed with this about 7 years ago but probably had it since my 20s, it just did not bother me much. I think a lot of times people that hang out on forums sharing stories are having a hard time, whereas people who are doing fine tend not to hang out on them. In fact, I used to be in the Facebook groups and I think I still am but I muted them/never go in them because it was making me anxious and stressed reading worst case scenarios. I was able to start treatment (I use clobetasol and estrace) soon after diagnosis and the itching and pain soon left and I have not had any issues with sex and I do not think you need to worry about it. I remember reading a lady who founded a yahoo group for it and was in her 70s said she had sex every single day lol! And my LS dr says sex is good for it. You can definitely have  a normal sex life, so try not to worry. \ud83d\udc97  Hi I am 23F with LS, feel feee to message me if you want to talk. I am here for ya! There is hope \ud83e\udd7a 24f here! Happy to chat. Some of the forums and stuff made me more anxious because a lot of people posted about worst-case scenario stuff, so I have been struggling with this as well. I was diagnosed at 21 after being misdiagnosed &amp; in severe pain for a year; luckily my treatments have improved things a lot since then, even if it is not perfect! Hi, I was also diagnosed when I was 6 and stopped treatment at 14 because I was told I did not need to continue with the ointment. I am now 26 and had the worst flare ups last year not having a clue what it was until I finally went to see a vulvar dermatologist and sure enough the LS was back. My coloring has gone back to normal but it seems like no matter what kind of underwear (thongs, cheeky, granny full bottom panties) it is always irritated by  the opening :( I am putting the ointment on three days a week as instructed. Is there anything else you might recommend I do? I am very active and workout 4 times a week which does not seem to help down there either. I am at a loss and this is something that consumes my mind because I can feel it all the time\u2026 you know? Is it safe to put coconut oil down there? Very similar to me! I also stopped treatment and now only use a steroid cream when I have flare ups. I am based in New Zealand and was prescribed Dermol 0.05% with the advice to apply daily (after a shower before bed was best for me) - maybe ask your doctor if you should be applying more frequently? I often sleep without undies to give myself time to breathe. Being active is great but maybe you could try exercise that does not cause as much rubbing (at least while you are mid flare) eg swimming? I also read a lot about sugar and other inflammatory foods causing flare ups so that could be another thing to watch?", "How should I tell the GYN I think I have LS? Hi there! I am undiagnosed but have suspected I may have LS for the past few years. I have been to scared to go to the GYN about it up until now, because I am afraid they will not believe me. I have been to the GYN before, but not to address this issue. In the past few months I have began to notice what is definitely some fusing and adhesions, which has prompted me to make an appointment. I am nervous about now to bring up LS, because I am only 23 and doctors tend to assume LS is only in older women. I do not have any autoimmune conditions that I know of, but I do most likely have hEDS, which can cause skin fragility. I am scared to go to the doctor, but I desparately want something that will help.", "Hi, so almost a year ago I noticed a white patch surrounding my rectum. After a few months, I finally went to the dermatologist and she said it is vitiligo. So for about 5 months I have just deemed it vitiligo. But, it is always very itchy and irritated, like to a point where it hurts, but \u2026 \u2026.But I just thought that is part of the vitiligo. So now, this past week, there is a cut and red scab on my inner butt crack on the white area. Now I am scared it is LS. I am not sure but is this common with LS? LS is often mistaken for vitiligo but the two are very distinct with the exception of skin discoloration. Vitiligo is not painful; the symptoms are discoloration, but there is not itching, burning, discomfort, architectural changes, etc. Thus, if you are experiencing pain and itch, it is possible you were misdiagnosed (this happens a lot where doctors diagnose thrush, vitiligo, scleroderma, etc). I cannot determine for sure if it is LS or not, but it could be. Therefore, I would recommend asking for a biopsy and detailing your symptoms to the doctor. A biopsy is not necessary to diagnose LS (for example, I was a textbook case...my symptoms plus clinical examination sufficed), however, they are important when a differential diagnosis is needed. In this case, there are different diagnoses on the table, and a biopsy is the best way to rule out and diagnosis. Have you been treating the area with steroids and or how have you been treating (this is important info that may alter my advice). I would get a second opinion. I have vitiligo too and it presents much differently than LS. If you have a vagina, go get checked out by a gynecologist. Definitely get a second opinion and do not be afraid to be persistent. Doctors can be dismissive of how uncomfortable it is, and it needs to be treated asap. Exactly!!", "27F - questions, possible diagnosis Hi everyone - I am new here, to Reddit and this forum specifically and hoped maybe someone could help in some way. Even if just relating to my situation. \n\nLast January I started to notice that I had the feeling of a cut or tear on my vulva. I did not think much of it at the time and it eventually went away. I had a baby about six months before and just thought maybe somehow related. A few weeks later the same thing happened. Then again, and again until I could not bear the issue any longer and I saw my obgyn in august. \n\nAt this visit she suggested I had vaginal dryness and possibly a yeast infection.  She prescribed a steroid cream and an anti fungal which seamed to help and symptoms improved. But a few weeks later the tears came back. I tried the cream again and it did not work, I tried a vaginal moisturizer, monistat, etc\u2026 nothing helped. This time it seemed worse and has progressively gotten to a point where it almost looks like my vulva skin is cracked. \n\nIn addition to the tears, I spotted for almost the entire month of December and started to notice a weird discharge. Im not sure if I should even call it discharge - it is a very large piece of fleshy tissue that came out of my vagina. It was about 2-3 inches and white in color, with pink spots and some blood. After this came out, nothing else did. I immediately requested an appointment with my doctor but she could not see me for over a month. \n\nThis week I had a similar discharge. A large piece of the fleshy tissue, this time it almost seemed bigger and I have a weird pressure in my bladder area. Almost like period cramps. \n\nI finally visited my OBGYN today and she gave me two possible answers: \n\n1. She said some vaginal cancers present in this way but she did not want to consider this until we got back pathology results. Should be 1-2 weeks?\n2. She said it could be LS (which I had never heard of before) and prescribed me Clobetasol Prop 0.05% Oint 15gm. She said she thought this because the skin around my tears appears discolored. \n\nIn all my reading (today\u2026) about LS I see descriptions of white skin, patches, itchiness, but I do not have those. I have these tears that come and go. I see other people describe flare ups in their posts. Is this what you mean by a flare up? How did you manage after diagnosis? How to do you keep your stress down? I should mention on top of this that I have suffered with anxiety and depression most of my life (trichotillomania since 3rd grade). \n\nI am rather frazzled and exhausted tonight but just looking for any help. Any feedback. Anything at all.", "Pretty sure I have LS I am a 20tear old female. I am a type 1 diabetic. I have white patches everywhere. I am extremely itchy and my vulva flairs up constantly. Every time I go to the gyno it is always you have yeast and bacteria. Every single time but it never seems to get better with the medication they prescribe me and they refuse to do a biopsy. Any guidance or steps I should take to figure out what is wrong? You need a better doctor. Do you live in the US Visit dermatologist and talk to your regular doctor. My mom has yeast and bacteria part and gynecologist told her same but turned out she is allergic to herself and she is also diabetic (not sure which type, runs in family). \nNow she is back on diabetic therapy and takes allergy meds and she is less itchy (probably would work better if she would remember to take her meds every day). Dermatologist is who put her back on meds and gave her allergy meds even though her problem showed down there so not first person you would turn to.\n\nAnyways that is just the part of what you told here, do not know about the rest but definitely speak to your doctor and dermatologist. Good luck! \n\nP.S. I do not know what is LS short for Yeah Do you have insurance? It should be easy to find a way better doctor than that if you have insurance Yeah I do, I am actually seeing the best gyno that is around me and the only one I am trying to find someone else to get a second opinion and a biopsy but idk who to trust because like I said my gyno now is apparently the best around so I am kind of scared I have also seen the \u201cbest\u201d and they did not do anything for me. Try shopping around some more because this is something that has to be treated properly Lichen sclerosus. This is the LS subreddit Found post on popular...soo...yeah I did not pay attention on that. Sorry! Still try talking with your doctor and state your concerns. That is why they are here right?", "New diagnosis (F27) Hey all, I am new to this subreddit, I was just diagnosed with LS and I am stressing. \n\nWhen I was 5 years old I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and last year at 26 I had a bout of alopecia. Needless to say I am frustrated with my body. \n\nI have a pretty active sex life with my boyfriend and I am feeling self conscious with my white scarring. I started the clobetasol treatment and I am curious will it clear about the white scars or will that be something I have to live with for the rest of my life? The ointment will help it heal and it will get better it will take time but it is something you will have to do long term. I am in the middle of treating a big flair up and it is getting better but it took me a month or longer to really notice a difference. I had vaganismus too when I got diagnosed with lichen sclerosis. Thankfully I do not have vaganismus, I have never had problems with tampons, or painful sex. It is really the appearance and shrinking that has started to happen with my labia minus and that is what is causing me so much stress. My doctor did not seem very concerned for my case so I am hoping it is a mild amount and it completely clears up. That is good unfortunately for a lot of mine inner lips disappeared I am sorry I am sure that was very hard. It is hard I am trying to make sure it does not get worse I am doing 3 ointments Autoimmune issues are a huge affliction to deal with - my daughter has Celiac and multiple food intolerances that are very diet limiting (and life altering as carefree travel is impossible and she loved to travel before her diagnosis). \nWithout knowing your history I would encourage you to take a look at your diet and try (separately) eliminating some of the common inflammatory trigger foods such as dairy, nightshades and grains. There is a series of cookbooks by the author Danielle Walker that have been an enormous help to us. She manages her Crohn\u2019s disease by diet alone, allowing herself to stop taking immunosuppressive medications. It might be worth a try in addition to the topical medication you have been prescribed? Thanks! Yes I have been considering going to my doctor to talk to her about diet to improve my immune system. Thanks! Yes I have been considering going to my doctor to talk to her about diet to improve my immune system. Certainly start there - though most physicians receive little training in diet (think a couple lectures in the entirety of education). There is a page on Facebook called \u201cPhoenix Helix\u201d and might be something to check out. I am also experiencing something similar. I have vaginismus as well, so I have been receiving PT and dilating on my own. I was also diagnosed with LS last year and I am currently using the clobetasol and estrogen cream. Do you have any advice or tips? I was diagnosed 5 years ago, definitely have scarring but have found that most partners of mine do not notice or care. I use Clobetasol a few times per year when flare-ups get bad enough, but have managed to eliminate most symptoms by taking high doses of vitamin D, topically applying Perrin Naturals Creme Complete once per day at least, avoiding fake sugar, and using plenty of lubrication during sex to avoid any further damage. \nHere is a link to the cream I think works miracles -  Because mine was so bad I had to get Botox and dilation through a plastic surgeon. But for tips I would wear more of breathe able shorts right now and when wiping after going the bathroom either just dab with toilet paper or use a water wipes. Wiping too hard can cause tearing and cracks and when with your boyfriend use a lot of lubricant so you do not tear either. Make sure to go slow if you are having problems. Just be extra gentle with yourself. Thank you! I am really not in any pain at all really, I only find after a lot of sex I notice anything. It is really only visually noticeable. I am lucky I was checking myself out when I did or I would not have noticed at all! I got diagnosed about a year ago but had the issue for a long time before that. The clobetasol will help. Also, use a fat based cream everyday so that when you wipe, it touches the cream and does not impact your skin. However, do not use latex condoms with a fat based cream.\n\nMy sex life is better now that I get treatment. No itchiness to speak of.", "30 M - I am circumcised, but I think I might have LS?  Provided an erect and soft pic for size comparison - easier to see in the second pic if you swipe.\n\nContext: This did start about a week after an unprotected sexual encounter, so at first I thought it might be fungal(?) so I got some like, generic athlete\u2019s foot cream and used it for a week with no improvement. I do have clobetasol, but before I start using it I wanted to get your guys\u2019 opinion. I know it is not common in cut males, but it is on the part of my penis that scrunches up pretty tightly when I am soft, so I was thinking maybe it is that more..... damp? vibe. I do see that pale spot in the second picture. You are right that penile LS is more common around the foreskin, but it can happen other places too, including on circumcised people. But clob can have side effects, and if it were an infectious cause, clob could make it worse. So I would definitely get a professional opinion before applying clob. I would try an experienced dermatologist or urologist. \n\nI had to wonder why you already have clob. Do you have psoriasis or something? (I do, and LS is more common in people with it) well, I do not have health insurance and I have a sympathetic PA that I go to, and asked if I could have the prescription but not use it unless the fungal cream cleared it up. Not exactly the best practice but I promise I am a good boy \ud83d\ude05\n\nMy other thought was that it could be like... a yeast infection? I do not know. It does not hurt or itch or anything, I am just afraid of someone putting their mouth on it &gt;asked if I could have the prescription but not use it unless the fungal cream cleared it up\n\nAh that makes sense. In that case maybe you should go ahead with it. Even if it does not hurt or itch, if it is LS it could progress and cause problems. I would still try to see a derm at some point if you can, or at least check back with the PA about the regimen, because you will need to decide how often to apply it and for how long (for vulvar LS, it is common to do 2x daily for a couple months, then indefinitely at a low frequency like 1-2x per week. I think penile LS can sometimes be cured by clob, but it could also require maintenance treatment.) \n\nI think yeast infection is a type of fungal infection, but you could check whether the medicine you tried would have worked on yeast specifically. I also think yeast usually causes white stuff that wipes off, not blanched skin. I am NAD though.", "Question about LS (14M) I am a 14 yo male. I have had this white patch on my penis from the back of the penis tip down to a bit of the foreskin (glans as well). I have never had any pain or redness or bleeding, however you can tell there is discolouration (pure white).I do not know if it is just discolouration or if it is LS and will start slowly showing symptoms (it is been like this for 1-2 years). I am too embarrassed to speak to my parents about it. What do I do? Any help is appreciated. Is it thicker than the surrounding skin? Ever so slightly raised? It could be scar tissue if it has not changed in years. Definately get this looked at by a family doctor (it is really not as awkward as it sounds, they will ask you to drop your pants and look at the coloring for a few seconds.) I cannot really tell but if it is higher it is *barely* higher. I also noticed a few weeks back when I did not touch it or do anything sexual that the colour dimmed down, almost matching the original colour. If that has indicated anything else please let me know, I will probably go to the doctor either way like you said I am im trying to hold off as long as possible lol. Thanks for your help It could be LS. Mine was never itchy. The coloring is really tricky to go off, especially on the tip which changes color for various reason anyways. The best way that I could describe it is that the coloring looked \"off\" or \"sickly pale\". My wife's description: \"that does not look good, you should really get that looked at\". It didnt behave like the surrounding skin either, it was way less elastic and ended up splitting. The coloring was more noticable when erect.\n\nJust tell your parents something like \"I have skin condition in my genital area, I am a bit too embarrased to discuss it further, but I would like to get it checked out by a doctor.\" I would not mess around or wait too long at your age, you are going to need that thing! That is quite a perfect explanation of what is going on with mine. I am glad it is not itchy lol that must suck. Anyway I will get it checked out, like you said I will definitely need it haha! Thanks for your help once again, cheers Hey I started getting LS symptoms around your age like 13-4. I am now 17 and in treatment for it. I would encourage you to tell your parents now because if you let it go too far it might cause permanent damage or never go away.\n\nMy LS did not have any itching or pain and just white discoloration and bumpiness until a couple months before I went to the doctor when it got bad enough to where the itchiness started. It was about a 5 year process to get to that point.\n\nLmk if you want to ask anything. This is a really embarrassing disease especially considering LS usually happens in older women and sometimes men, not teenage boys. It sucks Wow that is horrible. I am sorry you have to go through this at such a young age! I will probably go tell them now just to be safe. I will let you know if I have any questions thanks a ton! Hope your LS gets better! It could be LS, vitiligo, or something else. Either way, you should get it seen ASAP. Most conditions have the best prognosis when caught and treated early. Definitely true of LS, plus treating LS reduces risk of developing cancer. Just tell your parents to make a doctor's appointment with a dermatologist or urologist, or if your health insurance requires you to get a referral from your GP, then with the GP first. You should not have to discuss the details with your parents if you do not feel like it, but I know it can be hard if your parents are the helicopter type. Just keep in mind it is not your fault and it could happen to anyone at any age. Okay, I hope things go well. And yes, I got circumcised and am using some creams and have eliminated like 90% of my LS. Unfortunately because I acted so late I have permanent discoloration in my penis which is very embarrassing but it is better than a bunch of white spots. ", "How often applying clob on a newly discovered spot I have got LS on my anus since several years. Using clob ointment for that. \n\nRecently I discovered a white non-pigmented spot on my penis. It does not itch or flake yet and the spot is not red. Just a white spot. How often should I apply the steroid ointment? Start with daily applying for a month or - because it is small and not itching - just once a week? I know you are asking your question here, but you should really probably save questions like that for your doctor.  I thought people generally use a less potent steroid cream for LS on the anus.  Standard treatment for penile LS is typically clobetasol twice daily for a few weeks or months, then you taper down to once daily for a few weeks, then continue to steadily decrease the frequency of application until you reach a comfortable long term maintenance dose.  If flares occur later, frequency is temporarily increased again until flare resolves.\n\nAlso, a question for you:  I developed LS symptoms on my anus before i ended up with the classics LS symptoms on my penis.  I do not have any visual changes to my skin back there like i developed on my penis though.  Did you get pigment loss on your backside that lead to your LS diagnosis?", "Just end me I am so frustrated Finally had my appointment at the dermatologist today and they literally said why are you here for lichen sclerosus, I said it is a skin condition and that is what a dermatologist does, you guys state on your website that you specialize in lichen sclerosus. Than she says that is for the gyno and that was my entire appointment I am sorry you have had to deal with such a failure of a doctor. It clearly is a skin issue because your reproductive areas are fine! Is there another derm you can refer yourself to or go see? I would also file a complaint about that doctor. What in the world, I would be livid. I would really try a different dermatologist. I am sorry that happened to you! I see a dermatologist for my LS!!! I am so sorry that is infuriating. Find another dermatologist, that one sucks. Hi so sorry that is infuriating, I am Dad! :) That is freaking infuriatingly idiotic. I am sorry. I hope she does not get paid for that.\n\nMy gynecologist referred me to a dermatologist, but she was totally clueless and obviously uncomfortable looking at a vulva. She just took a brief glance downward while I was standing in front of her. She said I could follow up with a specialist instead. So today I tried to make an appointment with a different dermatologist who is also a pediatrician and specializes in LS. It says right on his website he does adult dermatology too. But he will not see me because he does not do adult dermatology \"in that area.\" Meanwhile my gynecologist recommended a pain clinic staffed by *social workers*. It is like everyone thinks LS is somebody else's job. Actually, I never saw a dermatologist for my LS. My gyno sent me to a specialist at the Colposcopy Department to monitor it. Once it is diagnosed, there is not much they can do but provide prescription for Clob and make sure cancer cancer cells do not develop (very rare cases) This doctor was literally an hr and twenty mins away and I went there for absolutely nothing. I have been to the dermatologists near me that I am allowed to go to and all the gynos they are just playing hot potato with me and passing me back and forth. No one wants to help me or even give me a biopsy I am so sorry, please hang on girl!! The hardest battle can be getting a doctor to be on your team. Unfortunately that can take a while. Keep trying, whether it be another dermatologist or gynecologist, they are both qualified. Try googling vulvar clinics in your area and you will likely find a provider that specializes in LS. You can also call different gynecologist offices and ask if they have a provider that focuses on chronic vulvar disorders. Good luck and do not give up! Where are you ? Perhaps someone on here can give you a recommendation for a dermatologist. Since most dermatologist's here in Dallas area are women I would think you would not have a problem here !\nMy dermatologist was treating me for general skin problems and diagnosed me without much in way of problems. Yes it maybe its embarrassing that I am a man and she is a woman but so far it works. \nGood luck. I know the struggle. Is there any online support group in your area, where you can speak to people with the same condition and who can point you to a doctor who is not an idiot? After many failed appointments I am not travelling three hours to a doctor who actually knows something and to whom all women in my country migrate to... It really sucks Yes, completely controlled in the sense that I rarely get flare ups and hardly every get uncomfortable itchiness. The odd time I feel it starting, I use my clob cream. Thank you for asking. As i am now in menopause, I wonder if some of the things I am experiencing are due to LS or menopause or both (dryness, atrophy, mild fusion) This is a sad sad post.. I am sorry.  I feel the same way.", "Undiagnosed He everyone. I am a 23 YO M and I am uncircumcised. Long story short, I had a yeast infection in early march and treated it with betamethason-clotrimazole. Everything went away, life moved on. About a month ago, I noticed my foreskin would stick to the glans and the head was drier than before. I also noticed the glans looked a little whiter than what I thought it was before as well. No itching or pain but occasional red dots that form on the head and foreskin. I found LS online and thought maybe I had that. Just went into a urogolist and before he looked at it, he asked me about my condoms and potential chemical burns. That all checked out, and he looked at my dick. He said everything looked fine and that it just looks a little dry and to not worry about it. I want to trust him, but I also asked him about LS and he said it is very rare and more common in women. Should I get a second opinion from another urologist or go to a derm? Or should I forget about it and move on with my life? It is not causing any present issues with sex or daily life, but if I do have LS, i want to catch it early to that i may be able to treat and manage it effectively.\n\nTldr; have dry glans and sticky foreskin, urologist said everything looks norm and uniform in color. Should I get a second opinion? Hey man, \n\nA few points:\n- Some men are symptoms-less except the color change and skin tightening / brightness. Even if it is not itchy or so it can be LS...\n- Your doctor is right that it is rare overall and more common in women but this condition is very often misdiagnosed. Despite research the true incidence is unknown and estimates vary...\n- In my case I was 21 a few doctors told me it was not LS, I am not a women so no risk etc... I insisted and they told me no, until I find a doctor who knows LS who eventually confirmed. \n- Trust your gut if you think color changed a bit and get a second opinion preferably with a derm. It may very well not be LS but look online for doctors which know this condition well. They often are the ones publishing research on it. Associations or a Google search will help. \n\nMaybe it is not LS but if it is its much better to catch it early as you rightly said. Good luck. Hey, same exact symptoms. I have been to three doctors and all have said nothings wrong but just seems off to me. Is it kind of like the foreskin feels tight and sticky and leaves marks on the glans when retracting. Also does your glans get pretty wrinkly when it is exposed to the air for a little bit? Dude, yes you just described everything I am experiencing! Like I said it started w a yeast infection about 4 months ago. But same exact shit, wrinkly glans, marks on the glans when retracting, and the foreskin sticks to the glans a bit if I dont apply some kind of oil or moisturizer. I hope it is not LS but I am not sure what else it would be. My dick 100% is different than before. Still very functional and no pain, very occasional itching, but I know that it is important to catch it early-ish I do not really know if I have ever had a yeast infection but I could have possibly had one before. I am really eager to find out what this thing is because it bugs the hell out of me. I feel like some doctors really do not know too much about the condition so they just look at it for five seconds and dismiss it, and I keep trying to tell my urologist how strange it is but he does not listen. Hopefully I will be able to find out what this is soon. Lmk if you get a diagnosis. Honestly just considering a circumcision at this point because I feel like regardless of whether it is LS if I just got cut it would probably go away. Yeah I will be sure to lyk if I do. I have a few things to handle coming up but I am going to look for a dermatologist nearby who specializes in genital skin disorders. Also be careful about the circumcision. I have had the same thoughts too, but I have seen some people continue to have symptoms after being cut. One other user advised me to approach the issue holistically and try to make sure my diet, sleep, and stress are all in check so that my immune system may be at it is very best. Perhaps that could help the problem because LS is an autoimmune disease. I would say try that first. Also look into moisturizers and such. I have been using coconut oil and it is pretty dope Also just curious, how long have you had symptoms? I use coconut oil from time to time and it definitely makes my glans look better. I have had my symptoms for about a year or that is how long I have noticed them. Sometimes I wonder if this could just be a condition that has to do with a dryer foreskin because it is weird that a moisturizer can make it look a lot better but idk. And even though circumcision is not a 100% guarantee, If the chances are high I would take it and I have heard using steroid creams can thin your skin which I do not want happening Look into lichen sclerosus and bxo on google if you havent already. The condition specifically implies the drying out of the mucous membrane of the foreskin. Also I have read that the skin actually thickens in this condition, so using a steroid surprisingly balances it out. Ok will do Ok well just sent my urologist photos of my dick bc he kept saying there was nothing wrong with it and I doubted, still said it looks fine. I guess it might just be a cosmetic problem and not really actually anything Hi \n\ni am a bit late, i am no doctor but if you have a doubt or maybe it could be a stress relief go have an other opinion. In my experience, it is hard to find a good doctor that would take the time to listen to your concerns but if you have the money or the time is may be better to be sure about your condition because is always better in the case of Lichen to be take care early so you would have less complication. Also like somebody already said men have less symptoms so it can be harder to be diagnosticated.\n\nWish you the best of luck with your question hope you get answers Circumcision has a good success rate (the success rate can vary from study to study but generally it is quite good) but that does not mean it is the end. Unfortunately the LS can spread on the glans. As my dermatologist told sometime LS is due to a reaction to the urine for the men (the immune system reacts to something in the urine) once the foreskin is removed it can help put the disease into the \"dormant phase\" since there less contact with the urine. After several frustrating years of doctor visits, multiple diagnosis and application of several medications, a urologist diagnosed me with bxo through biopsy. It was devastating to hear but was quite relieved to know what I had. My biggest problem before diagnosis was the foreskin sticking when I try to pull it back for daily cleaning during bath. It was very painful at times. I was prescribed a combo of steroid/antifungal and it helped calm things down. Everyday cleansing and drying is a must to keep things normal. So happy for this sub to discuss this particular issue. Do you think I have it? Also when you say sticking, was it in the same sense as I described. Like kind of peels instead of gliding and leaves marks on the glans. Also did your glans wrinkle up often? Based on what you are describing it sounds like bxo but they can only definitely confirm through a biopsy. Yes, that is what I meant by sticking. Does not leave marks though and it heals well whenever there is a small abrasion. Urologist asked me to keep the area clean. No moisture is a must..he asked me to pull the foreskin all the way out when peeing to aerate the area. I am not experiencing wrinkles though. I want to switch to something that is natural and provides the barrier to prevent the stickiness. Coconut oil is great it it works - for whatever reason it aggravates and caused redness during recent attempt. Urologist said oil traps moisture but if you dry thoroughly and apply it should be fine provided coconut oil works. Has anyone tried any other stuff? Yes same explanation from my urologist about urine being trigger for immune response. I was also asked to keep the area moisture free, so aerate more often. I am not sure what your urologist's thought was on sex and sensitivity with circumsision at older age. For one, not having skin will make it really uncomfortable when it touches clothing etc. But if the condition is severe and unmanageable circumsision is probably the best option. Been to the doctor two times and an urologist once both said nothings wrong so frustrating. The condition is rare in men so I see why they may not be able to diagnose. Are there any visible symptoms of redness or patchy skin where the wrinkles are? I had some areas of red patches that they biopsied. If not, coconut oil is probably the best choice. I am researching on other choices to get out of steroids. Do not stress yourself out as stress itself aggravates IMO. No red patches honestly I think I do not have it Any diagnosis yet? I am so sorry, I am not going to reddit too much.\n\nYou are right about the sensitivity and touch clothes, but my urologist explained to me that over time this will no longer bother because the skin will be used to the touching of clothes (1-2 weeks max). For me sensitivity has never been a problem, maybe it would help me last longer. There is a large proportion of men who were circumcised at birth and have no problem at an older age, but yes you are more likely to become less sensitive than when you were not cut so it can be a problem.  my first comment may sound like i am pro circumcision but i am truly not. I am no doctor and before taking these kind of decision you are better to seek out the best option for you because i do not think circumcision is the best option for everyone. \n\nThanks for your answer i think it make my comment way more nuance. Nope, I havent made another appointment yet. Need to get some things handled in my life first, hopefully will get in within 3 months. Need to find a specialized doctor first Going to a dermatologist soon hope it goes well, I am going to try to get a biopsy so I can confirm if I have anything or not. If it does turn out to be LS I am probably going to get circumcised so I hope this all works out and I will let you know if I get a clear diagnosis Good luck bud Thanks dawg Went to the dermatologist and showed him some photos and he looked at it in person and diagnosed it as mild dermatitis. He gave me an extremely mild steroid cream and told me to use twice a day. Hope this works out and hope this helped Thanks for the update! Hope everything works out for you! I will post when I go in again in the future \ud83d\udc4d Well used the cream for a week did not really work so i stopped. I am probably going to go back in and get fungal tests or something to see what I have", "For my fellow males what differences came from your experiences with your prescription and trying different types till you found what worked for you? Hello everyone. Much like the question above, I am curious to know what was prescribed to you and how that affected you or it didnt and you had to switch to a different type of medication. How often do you have to use it? Is it dependent on the issues? How did it affect your sex life? What were the side effects of your prescribed medication?\n\nFrom a guy who is going to definitely get diagnosed tomorrow and definitely scared to death.

If you are a male with lichen sclerosus, or any other genital skin condition (balanitis, lichen planus, etc.), I would love your input to see if there is truly a need for this device. I would greatly appreciate any responses to this quick, confidential 5-10 min survey! Thank you for your help!\n\n( Can you tell more about what device you are thinking about? How would it work?", "Update Hi guys, \n\nSo I just had my biopsy done 4 days ago now, and they used a punch with no stitches. It swelled quite a lot and the swelling has gone down but now I am looking at the biopsy site and it looks like a yellowish greenish beginning of a scab... and the site is a lot larger than the initial punch. Does this sound like infection or is it just the body trying to form a scab? not sure what to do. my doctor did not give me any aftercare instructions other than to keep using my estrogen cream. My doc told me to put aquaphor or cerave healing ointment to create a barrier, so bacteria could not get it, while it was healing. Does it hurt worse than it did initially? Or is it red at all? If it is I would try giving your doc a call on Monday and see what they say. Good luck!! Biopsies are no fun \u2639\ufe0f I know it was horrible! haha... the swelling has gone down and it does not look too red and hurts less overall it just shocked me to see what it looked like. im going to try and put something over it but im just nervous its infected! if it still looks and feels weird on Monday I think I will go in. Mine looked similar after my biopsy...it was unsightly and unsettling to say the least. It is just a scab forming. I think the coloring is perhaps bc of where it is on the body? My doctor actually prescribed an ointment that is used on burns for aftercare, which really made a difference. I also relied heavily on Vaseline. I think you are fine, but it is always good to check with an actual medical professional, so give your doc a call when you can! Good luck! Mine looked similar afterwards, it was also kind of (this is gross) but oozy, for about a week afterwards and the doctor said that would be normal. He also said to just apply pressure with a tissue to get it to eventually stop oozing, I did this and it worked. Now it has been 2 weeks and the punch site still looks bigger than the initial punch but it is more pale looking now and less fresh which makes sense. Hope this helps.", "Vent about some of the practical clothing issues about LS flares At work I keep getting comments that I wear so many skirts, especially during the winter time. People ask me why I am dressing up so much for work. People asking me how I am not cold. How they \u201ccould never wear a skirt to work\u201d. Or even, that I seem high maintenance with my clothing. It is so annoying because it is not my choice and I had to revamp my entire closet because of disease flares. Sometimes I just want to get passive aggressive and tell them that I have a disease and my outfit choice is none of their business. These people really do not mean any harm, but the comments really annoy me. It just reminds me about how LS impacts me whenever I get a comment about my clothing. \n\n* disclaimer to people reading who may have recently gotten diagnosed \u2014 I am in a flare right now, otherwise I can usually wear what I want with no symptoms.", "In horrible limbo. 62F - I am not sure what is happening.  I have an open (stuck) Eustachian tube (ear) and went to an ENT to see if it could get corrected. After trying many different nasal drops I was given estrogen nose drops.  I was told this would not be systemic but  after one month my clitoris became very itchy.  Later my nipples became sore and I developed a burning sensation in my vulvar region.   I stopped using the estrogen, (it was actually working for my ear) then got a period and a UTI!  (this caused my GYN to order a uterine ultrasound and a biopsy - all good).  After the UTI cleared up the burning did not.  My inner labia was red and inflamed and burning horribly.  I talked to my GP who over the phone prescribed Nystatin for yeast.  When it did not help he told me to see a GYN or go to Urgent care.  My UroGYN said he did not see anything wrong, gave me  Fluconazole and said it was probably from cycling.  I am an avid cyclists.  I love it and I ride my bike with my friends about 100-200 miles a week.  I stopped riding for 2 weeks with no improvement.   After sitting for an hour on a small seat at a wedding in the woods I felt like I had a ragging UTI.  All I wanted to do was get home and get an antibiotic.  40 minutes in the car and it vanished.  What is this?   Saw GYN multiple times and now and he is testing me for herpes, will do a bladder scope and he put me on Clobetasol for possible LS because it is white around my vaginal and ureteral openings.   It burns all the time.  I really do not have any itching just constant burning.  I started using Vaseline which seemed to sooth the area a bit.   \nAfter the UTI the burning was at a level of 9-10.  I was miserable for 2.5 months and no one seemed to listen or take me seriously.  Since then (3 months now) it has settled down to a level of 1-2 thank goodness but it still really bothers me.  I have no idea what this is and I am scared.  I am only using the Clobetasol once every other day (started a week ago) because I am afraid it will do something worse like the estrogen did.  I have read LS can possibly be caused by trauma/friction down there, hormonal changes and there is a possible connection with other skin issues like eczema.  Both my daughter and grandson have eczema and I have some flaky skin issue on my forehead, so I figure I have a lot of risk factors.  I am afraid I might have caused this myself with all the bicycle riding.  I am scared and miserable.  I just want to know what I am dealing with i am a cyclist too! ls can be caused by trauma to the impacted area but it is an immune mediated disease(like eczema is)/generally believed to be autoimmune. clobetasol is a steroid so it is an immunosuppressant (luckily it does not suppress your immune system systemically, just locally). personally, my ls had gotten terrible by the time i saw my 4th doctor about it, asking if he could test me for a \u201crare strain of yeast\u201d since everyone kept telling me i had a yeast infection. within two weeks of using clobetasol every day i felt WORLDS better and i honestly have not had a major flare up since a month or two after i initially started. sometimes i have had to take time off cycling when i could feel a minor flare coming on, but i have been able to do long/intense rides because of clobetasol \ud83d\ude01 i hope this eases your concern a little bit, i know i was devastated thinking i might not be able to bike again! because you said you do not have itching i am not sure if that could be indicative that this is something other than ls, though the white spots sound like it. whatever is going on i wish you all the healing in the world and that you get back on that bike soon!!! Thank you so much!  I love riding and thinking it might be gone is very depressing.  My plan is to take the winter off (I ride year round in PA) and see if that makes a difference.  Although I prefer riding in the winter than the summer.  I have an appointment with a dermatologist this Monday who has patients with LS so I am hoping to a bit more clarity.  I just cannot imagine living this way for the rest of my life. A few things. This sounds like Vulvodynia. Where you live is there a pelvic floor specialist/physiotherapist nearby? Amitriptyline might be very useful to help bring the burning down if you can get a small dose once a day. Best of luck whether or not you have LS i dont think this will be how you feel forever!! inflammation is weird, unpredictable, and so often comes and goes in flares. i hope you do not have a chronic condition like LS but even if you do, you learn to manage it over time!! first and foremost i hope you get out of pain soon \ud83d\udc9e", "clobetasol use question! when my doctor prescribed my clob she gave (what seems to be) the usual directions: 2x a day for 4-6 weeks, then 2 x weekly for maintenance. i have not been able to taper down to that amount and have still been using once daily to keep my symptoms and itching at bay. \n\nhow bad is it to keep using clob daily? i have read about crushings disease and do not want to cause any damage, but if i do not use it daily my symptoms come back. \n\ndoes anyone else have a clob regimen that is daily? \n\nthanks in advance! I am wondering the same thing! I was daily for 2 months and I am trying to go to every other day, but the symptoms start to creep back. Following to see what others say I am not a doctor, but I believe the consensus within the medical community is that the side effects of continued clobetasol (or other topical steroid) use tend to outweigh the consequences of leaving LS untreated.  \n\nEvidence suggests that continued (I assume they mean continued at a maintenance dosage frequency like 2x/week but idk) topical steroid use in LS patients reduces the risk of genital cancers which are associated with  LS.\n\nI will admit, learning about the possible side effects of long term topical steroid use sure got me to think twice about using them for the rest of my life after being diagnosed at age 29.  You are smart for trying to take a closer look at this yourself.  You should probably bring these concerns up with your doctos and see if they have any useful input.  Hope you find relief soon. Did she have you go straight from 2x a day to 2x a week or did you taper? Because going straight from that frequency to 2 times a day will almost definitely cause a flare. Steroids need to be tapered very carefully due to rebound effects. You should go from 2x a day to 1x a day to every other day... some people even mix 50:50 Vaseline and clob to dilute it to taper even more gently, so you could try something like that. The clob will not harm you, use it until you are under control I tried Clob for a couple of years and it never seemed to work for me. Finally I talked to my doctor and she put me on triamcinolone instead, which does seem to work! I would definitely contact your doctor. Maybe they will want to switch you to a different steroid or find some other way of managing symptoms and tapering down on Clob. I understood that long term use of clobetasol is generally not a daily application, but a few times a month to keep the condition at bay. Thus, you will not be exposed to high enough levels of cortisol to cause concern, once your LS is under control (my doctor told me it could take 3 months on it with a daily application, or it could take up to a year). Eventually you get to a point where you do not need it daily or even weekly, and the risks associated with topical steroids decrease at that time. This is what I have been told anyway! You may need to try a different steroid. I had to use triamcinolone instead of clob. Is your steroid the ointment or a cream? It is (or was?) \"standard\" to do clob 2x per day for about three months before tapering, and then taper to the minimum effective dose/frequency, increasing it again temporarily for flares. I guess the longer you take it at a high dose/frequency, the higher your chance for side effects, but as harmala said these risks might be outweighed by the LS symptoms and/or progression. \n\nI would definitely recommend calling your doctor to ask for an updated regimen. She might want you to do another 4 weeks at 2x/day then taper to once a day, or switch meds, or who knows. She also might want to do an exam to check for side effects from the clob, to see if you are tolerating it well. Steroids do come with risks, and it is the doctor's job to balance those risks against the benefits as precisely as possible. This sounds about right to me That is not much of a taper.  For me, it was every day for four weeks, every other day for four weeks, then twice weekly for maintenance.  I use aloe (I have my own plants, if you buy it, get as close to natural as possible) between doses.  If I have a particularly bad flair, I will go back to either every other day or every day for a week or two and then taper back down again.", "Can it be to late? Hi, i am (19M) and i think i have LS. I have most of the symptoms (except itching) and i am worried. I have had this since i was 14. Then i was 15 i went to a doctor, he gave me an ointment and said: \u201cyou will be fine\u201d. I used it but eventually it stopped doing it is job.  I became immune over  time like the doctor had told me. Since then it has not bothered me that much. Only sometimes during sex, so I did not think much of it. I tried rinsing for 15 minutes in salt water bath wich helps a little bit, but gets back to zero after a day or two. Is it to late after these years? It is not that serious in my case but i really do not know a lot about it and google is not giving me a lot of good info. \n\nThank you for reading my story and i hope some of you guys have some advice :))", "Question? Hi ladies,\n\nWith the itching, is the labia minora usually not affected or can you experience itching there as well? I read online it is only the skin, not mucosa, but wanted to ask you all. \n\nThanks! HI Come over to the FBook group and ask about 800 women!  ( I am not sure about the itching. When I itch it seems to be from everywhere. I do know I have some atrophy in terms of my lips. It is slight but I definitely do. I do feel like it is everywhere for me too. Thank you :) It is almost always affected.  It often affects the entire vulva.  I have learned a ton of things from the facebook group that has over 9,000 members.  I think it is called lichen 5-star group or something like that.", "Question about scarring!! My body \u201cabsorbed\u201d my labia minora before I was diagnosed with LS. Because of this, I have some scarring on one side, where my labia minora used to be. It is a line of rough, kind of bumpy skin. Recently, one of those bumps is bigger, and is purple-ish, like a bruise or blood blister. This larger bump is very tender but seems to be getting better. I am wondering if I irritated the scar tissue with my vibrator?? Has anyone had this happen? Is it cause for concern? Should I see my doc or wait to make sure it resolves? I think the fact that it seems to be getting better is a positive sign but if you are really concerned then you could certainly ask your doctor! \n\nI have heard LS is capable of causing a bruised appearance so I do not believe that is entirely uncommon. You could well have just disturbed the skin a bit more than usual with your vibrator and if it appeared after the last time you used it then there may be a link. \n\nI have not had this happen to the best of my knowledge but if it is not clearing up with your treatment then I would recommend a trip to the dr! \n\nHopefully it continues to clear up on its own but to answer your question I do not think you should worry too much about it, but keep an eye on it and see your doctor if you think you need a professional opinion! I always advise seeing a doctor if that is available to you and you are unsure. I am not a medical doctor, so I cannot say for sure what is going on. Hyperpigmentation does occur with LS and can as a result of scarring.  That said, someone would need to examine you to be sure that is what is going on.\n\nI have a lot of scarring but never developed hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, I use a vibrator all the time and it is never caused me any issues. I do think it is unlikely the vibrations would cause hyperpigmentation, however.\n\nIt is likely benign, but I would get checked to be sure.", "After 5 years. I have been diagnosed with lichen simplex. Advice pls? I am 21(f). After years of itching, burning, skin tissues, scabbing, pubic hair loss and callousness of the skin I went to a dermatologist and he told me what I worried. I have lichen simplex. He told me to use Sudocream and is now going to prescribe me a steroid cream. \nFor flare ups, my gp (before dermatologist) prescribed Trimovate and that has helped with flare ups. \n\nAny \u2018non obvious\u2019 advice to start my road to recovery ? Small things that helped that you think would not. I appreciate your responses! Please join Sharing Is Caring Lichen Sclerosis Et Al on fb.  Incredible group, tons of very helpful advice.  I am sorry you have been dealing with this.  It is so hard.  Keep learning and keep hopeful.  It does get better. Are men with LS allowed in the group or is it really just for women only? For the past 3 months I have dealt with these same symptoms and I am most certain I have LS. I have stopped using scented wash in that area all together and have noticed less irritation. I have found relief by making sure not to let the area dry out after showers (pat dry and moisturize, apply creams). For women only. I find that so sad, I am male and feel so alone, fb groups keep rejecting me what sort of things do you use to moisturize? im concerned about staining my clothes and using any products that are going to screw up my pH I use Cortizone 10 and it is worked well for me. I tried vitamin E oil at one point which was good but I stopped for fear that it would clog my pours. I have not experienced any unbalanced PH. Everything is external I use pimecrolimus cream (Elidel is name brand) nightly. Its for dermatitis but it has helped so much. I also feel better using it because there are not risks of thinning skin like with steroids like Clobetasol. So I use Elidel daily, (occasionally I will skip it and sometimes use an oil from moon juice formulated specifically for down there), I will use Desonide if I need a little more help which is a low steroid, and Clobetasol if I have a bad flare or a lot of pain or something after sex. It is been helpful to have multiple topicals depending on my current needs. Good luck.", "Just Diagnosed 22yoM Hello all! I was recently diagnosed with LS today, and the diagnosis was bittersweet. Sweet because I finally know what the heck this is around my genital area and I can treat it. Bitter, because I am going to have this for the rest of my life. However, I believe the sweet overshadows the bitter! I believe my case is very mild, as sex is not really painful for me and I only get occasional itching.\n\nSo I need some advice. I have pretty mad health anxiety (HA). I am going through some stomach problems right now, and my GI diagnosed me with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) based on my symptoms. But I am worried that it might be IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) as opposed to IBS because of LS, since IBD and LS are both autoimmune disorders and I am worried that there is a link. I had other skin problems that popped up and I thought it was Psoriasis, in which if i was diagnosed with that I would have definitely gotten a colonoscopy since Psoriasis and IBD are linked. Luckily, it was just eczema due to my family history. But again, now I am worried that there is a link between IBD and LS and I am really thinking about doing a colonoscopy for my peace of mind. I would talk to your doctor about your concerns and see if they think a colonoscopy could be beneficial for you. Best of luck! Im female but other than that, I have the same health problems. My doctor told me I would have to get a colonoscopy every few years because there is indeed a link. So it would be worthwhile for you to do it. However: people with ibd have very serious digestive issues, they bleed, and need to go to the hospital due to that. I know ibs feels shitty, but that does not mean that you have ibd or that you will ever develop it. I wish you good luck with your health journey. Thanks for the response! Yeah I am probably going to go through with the colonoscopy. I probably was not if I told that this was not LS, but it is so there is that. I just need to do it for my peace of mind since I do have a small family history of colon cancer. Thanks for the reply! Yeah I am definitely going to talk to my GI about this. The hard part is talking my mom into getting one. Both she and my GI believe I am way too young to get one but my grandfather had colon cancer so I really want to have one done, especially with my symptoms I have had gut trouble my whole life. First dramatic improvement was cutting dairy around age 20 and second improvement cutting gluten nearer to 40. Still have occasional issues but nothing at all like the past. Diet plays a serious role in autoimmune stuff. I wish I understood it better, but there is something there. \n\nLS my whole life but not diagnosed until age 30. \n\nI had a colonoscopy done in my early 20s because of the gut problems and I had six polyps removed at that time. Did not fix anything or find any other problems, so gut still sucked, but hooray for removing them. \n\nI had another colonoscopy last year and it was fine. Damn glad to have had those polyps out young.  22 is not too young.  Sounds like with family history and an acute diagnoses of an autoimmune disease like LS combined with your bowel issues should be enough to warrant a colonoscopy just to get it checked out in my humble opinion. I will never understand that way of thinking, that somebody is too young for something. I was told LS primarily affects older menopausal women and here I am, 21 and premenopausal with a diagnosis that you, a 22 male also have. Age is not the biggest factor here lol Sorry i chuckled a little because the thought that shot through my mind is atleast you dont have IBD too when reading the title. I am really sorry to hear that, even more sorry I hope that joke is not in bad taste. I have all of what you describe and same age. The only thing I dont have and sometimes think  i do psoriosis. \n\nIf im honest its all pretty treatable. The great thing about ibd is most of the medication is an immune system nuker. So it helps with most other auto immune conditions. Not that I wish you have it at all, just that there is light on both sides.\n\nMy LS isnt that bad, I think mostly because of my ibd medication. Sorry this is so poorly written I just woke up and read this. I did want to say if you ever want someone to talk it over with let me know. Those things can be traumatising to be diagnosed with, but it totally all depends on severity and if it was bad ibd it would most likely already be found. All the conditions are quite treatable and there are some amazing communities with a lot of people in remmision for years.\n\nI would push for a colonoscopy if you have a good assumption. Or maybe talk over it with your doc. Just wanted you to know there is support for either diagnosis or both :)\n Thanks for the reply :) Yeah I heard IBD is very manageable too. And I would say I have pretty mild case of it IF I have it all that is. I am still able to do things perfectly in my normal life, it is just the hypochondriac in me that exacerbates all my symptoms and makes me freak out. The thing that scares me the most about IBD however is that it increases my chance for colon cancer. And that is further increased by my family history. And I know that a lot of people that have IBD and a family history do not end up getting cancer and live normal and healthy lives. But damn it still scares me. And having IBD and LS means that my life is just so different now. It will consist of constant medicine, doctor visits, and maybe even yearly-2 year follow-ups of colonoscopies. It sucks because before I had health anxiety (it was about my nose), I literally had nothing to worry about. But now I worry about everything in my body and LS unfortunately contributes to my health anxiety. Now, when I get the colonoscopy and it shows either IBD or IBS or hell, even nothing and it was all just anxiety, I do plan on getting help for my anxiety with therapy. Sorry for the long reply, I am just a mess rn haha I totally understand you. I never gave too much thought with ibd but then I picked up more and more and now waiting to hear about cancer.\n\nLet me tell you though, I think IBD will take away that colon fear. If its active you tend to have yearly coloscopies. No one else gets that. If you start getting any signs of colon cancer a camera in your butt is the best thing to pick it up :). So while you do have more risk, the risk isnt hugely bigger and its far more likely to be picked up.\n\nWith health anxiety I cannot tell you how to beat that. I am currently under treatment for it. If its bad, then I know there is the nostral anxiety technique where you breathe out through one in through the other. For more general I would give midfullness meditation a go. There are some brilliant guided meditation tracks. It sounds silly bit its so well recognised by the psycologist community. Thank you so much for this. Do you mind if I PM you later today? I just need to vent about everything  Ibs, thankfully. Oof that is pretty reassuring. Thanks for the reply. All fingers crossed that it is just IBS for me as well Of course feel free to anytime", "How did you find out you have LS/BXO? I am m20, virgin. Recently (about 6 days ago) I noticed a white, linear area of white dry skin on my foreskin, right under my penis, near the frenulum base. It does not cause pain or discomfort, at all, I can retract the foreskin just fine, I do not have any issue whatsoever. It is just a white linear patch which is hard and dry.\n\nI cannot tell if it is BXO because contrary to what I have read, the area is not glistening (it is actually rough, normal skin is more shiny than this), or fragile and have no scars, tears or itching. If it was not white I would be sure it is dry skin or fungus infection, coinciding with the relatively poor hygiene I acquired due to quarantine. I cannot post a photo at the moment but will 100% do in the future, and it is difficult to go to the doctor due to quarantine, and that is after overcoming embarrassment too.\n\nI dread the idea of it being BXO. Since reading about it I cannot sleep at night, I am having this constant fear it may actually be BXO.\n\nHow did you find out you have LS? Are the white patches similar to what I described? What is your story? Hello. I just went to the dermatologist today and yep, I 100% have LS, she told me right away and prescribed a cortisone-steroid cream to apply every morning for a month and then we will see. Splendid..... out of all things in my life, now this is one more. Really pleased that you got some clarity so quickly!  All the best with the course of steroid. Thank you! I wish all the best to you too!", "Possible diagnosis question Hi all,\n\nI have had what I thought was chronic thrush for 2.5 years. My symptoms have started to change though which is making me think LS\n\nI get really white frail crinkly skin that peels off , and then will be angry red for ages. The white is happening more frequently now though.\n\nJust wondering if any of you had the white patches actually peel off?", "DO I PUT THE OINTMENT ON ON MY PERIOD???  IDK\n\njk - do you need it during that time? If so then probably?", "Hi, new here. Can someone help? Hey everyone. I am a 24F that is been dealing with what seems to be lichen sclerosus. It started about 3 or 3.5 years ago. I started taking the depo shot for birth control. That is when it seems to have started and not sure if that is what caused it. Just until about maybe 2 weeks ago, did I finally get a \u201cmaybe\u201d answer to what this is. At first it was \u201coh your hormones are probably out of whack, it will take the depo shot some time to adjust with your body\u201d to \u201cmaybe we should up your estrogen\u201d to \u201cmaybe it is your psoriasis coming back and it is just on your genitals\u201d to \u201cthis might be lichen sclerosus, let us set you up an appointment with a dermatologist.\u201d \n\n\nI really thought for a period of time that I was just crazy. Like it was just all in my head. I have been with my partner for 5 years and just recently, did I open up to him about this. I broke down crying about how I am in a lot of pain, how sex hurts because of this, how much it itches, how gross my vagina looks. He did not know what to say except \u201cwell I have not noticed and I am sorry, we can set you up an appointment again and I will go with you\u201d all these years he thought I was going to the doctor for birth control or paps. It felt so good to open up about this issue. \n\n\nTomorrow I have a dermatologist appointment and I feel so happy but also so scared and nervous. What if this is not lichen sclerosus? Then I am back at square one. I feel really lost and unhappy with this but if it is lichen sclerosus then I have an answer, I will learn how to manage, I will learn to not live in fear and embarrassment. \n\n\nYou might wonder why I think I may have lichen sclerosus and what makes me think that. Well for some period of time, my pubis mound was flaking (which made me think my psoriasis came back), my inner labia had this chalky look, it is extremely itchy, sex is painful, when I have fissures it hurts to pee, I have no natural discharge anymore so getting fissures is very common since my inner labia is so dry. THE ITCHING THOUGH, I will be up all night from scratching and I know how bad that is but I just cannot help it. \n\n\nI really hope I will get answers tomorrow. For the last week I have been trying a gluten free diet, I have been watching how much dairy I eat, I have even changed my laundry detergents and soaps hoping that make some kind of difference. I use Lucas papaw ointment on my fissures, psoriasis cream when the flaking happens on my pubis mound and I cannot even use tampons anymore because the string of all things rubs me raw. Toilet paper even hurts.\n\n\nPlease anyone, if you can provide tips on how to live with this, share it with me. I am not sure what more I can do. I have tried doing research but every website says the EXACT same thing, YouTube has maybe 6 videos of women sharing their experience but it is like there is no real info on this. So here I am reddit. HELP MEEEEE. Please :((  The dermatologist should do a punch biopsy to confirm what it is and will advise the best treatment plan. For me its dermol ointment on a regular cycle. My skin will balance out and then flare so I need to be more regular with the cream. For itching have you tried wearing cotton gloves at night so you cannot scratch? I do that for my skin on my hands but it means I cannot itch it. Unfortunately sex will still hurt sometimes and it will still tear - do not usually notice at the time but will when going to the bathroom.  Only other tip - be honest with your partner on how you are feeling. Sometimes you will not want sex and it is easier to be honest.  We do not have sex very often to begin with, maybe once every two months. We work different shifts so making time for it has been hard.  Yeah, I do not notice until after, I will go to the bathroom and I will be bleeding.  Get super good at oral.\n\nI used to use that to avoid the pain issue altogether.  Or, go a long way orally, then switch -- everybody feels like they got properly laid, but there is less time thrusting and tearing.   My LS got dramatically better when I changed my diet.  I am very shy about the whole gluten-free thing, as so many people think it is a crazy stupid fad (especially on reddit-at-large!).  But my gut is a million times better (IBS? Not anymore!) and my LS is vastly improved.  Still flares occasionally, but nowhere near like it used to. It took a couple months to be sure that was it. That is it.  I miss bread, but you know what I do not miss?  Turning the water heater up to get hotter water to spray on my labia because that was the only thing that stopped the itching. \n\nHope you get some answers and some relief. Omg I am so shy about the GF thing too! So many people hate on those that ask for GF but it makes so much sense! Ever since the first day I went GF I have been craving bread sticks. I have come so close to caving but I know that I need to stick with this diet. I have tried getting my boyfriend to eat GF because he thinks he may have a mild form of IBS. At home he has no choice but to eat GF so hopefully this helps us both. Lol  This! \n\nThere are plenty of ways to be intimate without penetrative sex! ", "Do the lighter parts look like LS? No itching or tearing. Some burning after sex if stubble rubs against me. I was just at the gyno a few weeks back, all tests were negative. Just concerned about the color because I do not remember if it is always looked this way. ", "Does anyone have vaginismus as well? Hi I was wondering if anyone here has multiple sexual dysfunctions. I have been diagnosed with vaginismus for over a year and at the same time my biopsy showed I had lichen sclerosis. \n\nI know both have their own complications and my vaginismus has improved enough to dilate to larger sizes, although I fell back in progress a little after not dilating for 6 months. I have been using clobetasol and now estrogen ointment for my lichen sclerosis, but my skin mostly looks and feels the same. I am able to wear tampons, have pelvic exams and Pap smears with minimal pain but still cannot have PIV sex. Does anyone here have experience dealing with multiple disorders? Any advice or help would be great! My vaginismus is cured and I currently have lichen sclerosis that I am treating now. But with lichen sclerosis it can cause pain to the outside of the vagina because of scaring during sex it was very uncomfortable until I started using 3 different ointments everyday. It definitely has helped. Mine has caused my inner lips to disappear. I cannot get them back. What 3 things do you use? Clobestol ointment estrogen ointment and A&amp;D ointment everyday", "Can anyone help ease my mind? I (F/28) have had what I believe to be my first LS flare-up for about a week and a half. I thought it was a yeast infection so I treated it with a Diflucan, 3 day monistat, and another Diflucan. The itching and burning is still there but worse now, I think the monistat really irritated it. I went to an urgent care and she said it looked like lichen sclerosus, after ruling out a UTI or an STD. Since then I have put over 30 hours of research into LS. I have an appointment with my OBGYN on Thursday. I just feel so hopeless and honestly I feel like I have been having a panic attack for the last few days straight. Is this truly manageable? Is this going to hurt forever? Sorry for format, I am on mobile. Any answers are so appreciated. Hey there, welcome. Your pain is valid, and you are valid. LS sucks but there are so many great treatment options now. I am 24 and was diagnosed 2 years ago. Like a lot of chronic illnesses, my LS is fine some days and bad others. With topical steroids, moisturizers, and lifestyle changes, I am managing my life (and sex life!) just fine. New treatment options like steroid injections and the laser treatment show excellent results. I just got my first steroid shot and it stopped my flare immediately. \n\nI would highly recommend searching for an \\*expert\\* in LS, likely a dermatologist who treats urinary/women's health issues. I have not had the best luck with Gynos, they have either dismissed me or just said \"topical steroid is the only treatment\". \n\nIn the meant time: soak in hot water, with epsom salt if you have it. Wear loose clothing (NO underwear) and apply a moisturizer like aquaphor that you can get at any drug store. Throw away anything with fragrance. You got this! Mine just came back after going dormant for like 4 years. So it can disappear of its own accord. The rest is just management of the symptoms. When you find a treatment plan that works for you, your symptoms will be lessened or even disappear. Its horrible and miserable and uncomfortable but it will not just be this forever. You will see normal days again! You are truly in the worst of it right now\u2026 the unknown\u2026 the failed treatments. I am 22 and it started as an \u201cassumed yeast infection\u201d. It was never yeast and unfortunately it took a year of many other diagnoses with oral medications and different birth controls to see what was wrong. Finally I found a gyno that specializes in LS and after a few months of steroids I am pretty much back to normal. I have days every now and then that I feel \u201cmeh\u201d down there, but then I am back to normal the next day. I guess the only positive about this is I did catch it pretty early, I am lucky the PA at the urgent care knew immediately what it was. Did you just do the clobetasol twice a day? Thank you for replying! You made me feel some hope. Hi, thank you for replying. Did you have the topical clobetasol? I had some already from my dermatologist for eczema on my legs so I have just been using that the last few days. It seemed to burn worse and the white spots are getting bigger so I quit using it until my appointment with the OBGYN on Thursday.  I have just been using hydrocortisone cream. The clobetasol ointment is better than the cream. Not as many ingredients and absorbs better. Also, there is a book o. Amazon called Help I have Lichen sclerosis that talks about some alternative treatments (in addition to what your doc says, not instead of). Thanks, I am going to buy it right now!", "Men with LS, how bad is it, and how much is it linked to sexual activity ? Hello,\n\nI am a 32M with what I really think is LS (diagnose coming very soon).\n\nThe scary part for me is that it is close to the meatus, and does a 1cm x 3mm stripe.\n\nThis section is not itchy at all but it is kind of \"shrunk\", which makes me think it should be LS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother section is just two stipes, almost symmetrical on each side of the foreskin.\n\nIt appeared 2 years ago on the foreskin, and at first these stripes on the foreskin were red and itchy, and then went completely white, and did not go back red since. Sometimes they are a bit itchy, not much, really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow bad is it for you and how long has it taken to make it a problem for sex/masturbation ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, do you guys think masturbating more/less has an effect on this condition ?\n\nI tend to masturbate a quite a lot sometimes... (up to 3x a day, usually once everyday).\n\nIt is definitely more painful now than it was before (when masturbating too much in a short time, I mean), but I am wondering if cutting this down could prevent it is growth too ? There is a great LS for men Facebook group. Maybe you will get more traction there. I am a lady with LS so I am no help. Lol.  any links? I find that any rubbing especially while unlubricated is very irritating so yeah I would reduce frequency when you feel a flare up coming on. My GYN and derm said coconut oil is an okay lubricant. Just make sure it is of a good quality and patch test on your skin for sensitivity. My only two horrible flare ups came right after two weeks where I overindulged in self pleasure.. Do you know what it is called?", "Are there any other females with vulvar LS who are asymptomatic??? I do not have itching, very very mild and occasional burning but that is all. Does this mean that I DO NOT experience flares at all? Or just that I do not feel them or experience them in the same way as others?? Trying to figure out if things can cause my condition to worsen without me being aware (diet/stress/etc). \n\nThanks in advance! for anyone with LS (or LP) you can check out the FBook group:  ( Bump My only symptom at my checkup was a white scar of skin that is grown longer, but I did not feel anything so left it alone.... asked Obgyn, she takes one look and schedules my biopsy next week\n\nI dont use scented body washes and switched to fabric pads that are eco friendly and muuuuch less irritating! So you do not know for certain yet? Good luck with the biopsy and keep me posted, please!! Did your OBGYN call in a cream to help numb the area prior to the procedure? They numb you with a shot but that shot can be painful in such a sensitive area. The cream ahead of time makes the numbing shot more bearable. Oh my biopsy was a year ago \u263a\ufe0f And yes, diagnosed for LS and on clobetasol, which really has helped since she saw at my follow up. I am bad about my 2x weekly use and usually do around 1x weekly bc it is so mild/nonexistent now.\n\nNot sure, the shot was pretty painful and she said something about having the nonideal scalpel to use for me...uh but she did a good job otherwise and my nurse held my hand when i asked haha I was basically asymptomatic (sorta, there was white there and the doctor noticed it, but I did not feel anything) until after childbirth. I do not know if this is a thing, but it seemed like it attacked my tearing/episiotomy scars. We realized it when I went to the doctor to complain that I thought some of my stitches had not dissolved and were pulling at the skin but it was actually the LS", "Breastfeeding moms with LS I have a question for moms with LS: how did breastfeeding effect your condition? Did it make it worse? No real change? \n\nI am already thinking about opting for a c section and I would hate to not be able to breastfeed as well. But I am just trying to decide between what is best for my body and what is best for my baby. It is such a hard decision... any insight would be great! I believe i developed LS because i have been breastfeeding for 7 years (3 different kids). I think my lack of estrogen for all those years triggered it. I may be completely off but that is what my research has led me to believe. That being said, I am pregnant again &amp; will breastfeed until he is ready to wean (no judgment for those who do not, I am just very lazy &amp; weaning is hard for me \ud83d\ude02). My LS is under control with clob &amp; i feel very VERY lucky for that. I am hoping once i wean completely, things will get better. Even if you breastfed for a couple of days or months, your baby is still getting that liquid gold. But there is absolutely no shame in deciding to formula feed for your health, mental or otherwise. It is a hard decision, but i do not think there is a wrong one to make. Thank you for your input! I am hoping to at least make it 6 weeks. \n\nAlso, I love your username! 6 weeks will be great! Hopefully it will not trigger anything for you. Just my personal experience - I was able to have a \u201cnatural\u201d childbirth and breastfeed fine. LS was under control - I used triamcinolone a couple times during pregnancy and BF but not very often, it did not ever get bad. I also went on a progesterone-only BC around six months out. \n\nI have had abdominal surgery before that went very wrong, so a c-section was something I wanted to avoid if I could. Plus my husband is not exactly awesome support, and I honestly did not want to have to rely on him for recovery from a c-section. Normal birth, no drugs? I am up and walking around in half an hour. Yes please. \n\nI had a doula help with labor and nothing got rushed unnecessarily, so with my second kiddo, even knowing about the LS, there really was not an issue. But the key there is that everything was in pretty good shape heading into labor. If my skin had be shredding, a c-section would make sense. But it was not; it was good. \n\nI breastfed the second for fifteen months and it was fine. No major flares. \n\nRetrospectively, it was the NEXT year that was harder - after breastfeeding, switching back to my \u201cnormal\u201d BC, and having a terrible-twos ... that year, I had a harder time controlling it. But it settled out again within about a year. I have the same experience. My second is 10 months old and I got LS 5 months PP (did not get diagnosed until a month ago though). I am sure it had everything to do with hormones + stress (having a baby at the height of a pandemic is no joke!). I am still breastfeeding and I am 4 weeks into treatment with Clob. Pretty sure I have it under control, for now. Planning on breastfeeding until I can get the vaccine so he can get some antibodies. Very curious to see what will happen when I wean, though. Ohh if you think about me when you do wean, could you let me know your experience, please? Just out of curiosity because we will not wean for a couple more years. \ud83d\ude29 I was just diagnosed today and have been breastfeeding my daughter for the last year. My OBGYN said that breastfeeding may be contributing to worsening symptoms. Might be time to start weaning but my daughter is not showing any signs of being ready to wean \ud83d\ude22 Just my two cents. Got diagnosed 3 years before I got pregnant, so do not think there is a connection, at least for me. It is an autoimmune condition that results in overproduction of collagen in the anogenital area. \nI was able to have vaginal birth with no tearing. I breastfed my child for 3,7 years ( shocked myself, never planned doing that), my LS symptoms definitely did not get worse, if anything they have gotten better. \nPregnant with my second one and hoping for the best.", "Me after starting a 6 week course  Have not seen memes here, so I hope this is allowed!

", "Should I get circumcised? Evening folks. I am a 22 year old male who was diagnosed with Lichen Sclerosus late last year following a positive biopsy. I have since seen a urologist who recommended circumcision as my case is very mild at this stage and there is a very high chance undergoing a circumcision will cure my LS. \n\nI am on the fence about having the procedure to remove my foreskin for obvious reasons. I am mostly concerned about the sensitivity changes it would bring. My symptoms are currently minimal and those that are there are mild.  Also, part of me cannot help thinking \"what if I get circumcised and they come out with a cure for LS next week?\" (obviously not likely, but possible). \n\nOn the other hand, I do not enjoy the thought of having to apply steroids to the area and dealing with the potential skin changes they may cause (thinning).  Have any males here undergone circumcision after being diagnosed and whether it cured your LS? I am in the exact same boat. I do not know what to do either. I am tempted to ride it out until the condition gets worse to the point I want a circumcision. The issue is, I do not know if I will be incurable at that point and have further problems. What made you have a biopsy in the first place?  I had white marks on the inside of my foreskin located on the frenulum and on the right side of the frenulum extending around the shaft a little. I mentioned them to my GP who sent me to a dermatologist. The derm did a biopsy, but it came back inconclusive. I returned to the GP who then did their own biopsy in a different location (the derm took a biopsy from the frenulum area and the GP took one from just right of the frenulum). The second biopsy came back positive, so I was referred to a urologist.\n\nI forgot to add that I am also afraid if I get circumcised the LS may still be present. If you have a shot at getting rid of LS I would take it. If you get progressive LS that will affect sensation (and not in a good way) far more than circumcision would. As well, cosmetically and maintenance-wise circumcision for sufferers of LS  is preferable for most partners. That is my vote anyhow.  You have a point. My urologist said there is about a 90% chance that it will get rid of it. Logically I should go ahead with a procedure that offers a high chance of real results rather than clinging to possibilities.  I would suggest that wearing the foreskin retracted significantly reduced symptoms for me and eliminated that possibility of spread. Urologist gave that strategy the thumbs up. Slight reduction in sensation but nothing like circumcision.  Unfortunately my foreskin is quite long and does not tend to stay retracted. It is a good approach though. They all long.  Give it a few weeks try.   Hello there, I have had a circumcision today to treat severe phimosis and other LS/BXO issues. I ignored my symptoms for almost 10 years but have spent the past year trying all sorts of treatments to no avail. My condition worsened dramatically over the past year and circumcision was the obvious choice. I am hopeful it will cure my LS.  Do whatever it takes to get rid of it now.\nI was diagnosed 25 years ago and have tried everything.\nOh my god I would give anything to have the options you have at the age you are.\n\nLichens is a hereditary immune system and there is no getting it better.\nRemissions occur but as you get older the remissions get shorter until it is there all the time.\n\nHave a circumsision. .\nAny sensitivity you fear losing is better than the no sensitivity you wind up with if you choose to keep the infected skin.\n Thank you for your comment. I hope the circumcision can rid you of your LS. Did the urologist (or whoever you saw) say how long it will be until you know if it is worked? Keeping it retracted is much better than cutting it off.  It is really easy to put on a cock ring and pull the skin back underneath it... In my case I did just a frenuloplasty (banjo string removal) because the urologist mine was a mild case and it was not worth it removing the foreskin unless it got worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B; My urologist actually recommended a frenuloplasty, as my frenulum is a bit tight and I suffer mild tears quite often. This recommendation was before the discussion of circumcision. Is not what you described a frenectomy?  Yes sorry Can I ask if the LS was affecting your frenulum? Yes, it was torn a bit or getting torn A biopsy is used to confirm it is LS and not something else. Before I was 'officially' diagnosed with LS the dermatologist already knew what it was but wanted to confirm it was not something else. Its standard procedure. It is not hereditary. Actually it is.\nIt is known to skip a generation or two and to compound in one generation as well.\nMy sister, uncle,mother, grandmother and I all have it.\nAll biopsies and positive results.\n\nI had surgery on Friday for repairs, steroid injections and nerve blocks.\nIt has not been a fun weekend.\n\nI would just love to be able to sit,stand,lay down for more than ten minutes at a time.\nSex is out of the question.\n\nEvery specialist I have seen has assured me it is a hereditary immune system disfunction. Are you male and are you circumcised? Any update on you today? I have decided not to go through with it at the moment. What are your current symptoms with LS? Do you have white patches? When you say you had white marks were they clear and transparent (could see veins underneath) or were they really white and patchy or raised? Also do you remember how it began? They were white and raised. First noticed them beneath my frenulum. However, a biopsy of that area came back inconclusive. So, I am unsure if those were/are LS (I would had them for years. No itch or pain). I also noticed subtle white marks to the right of the frenulum (inside the foreskin) that were new. I was being treated for a suspected yeast infection at the time and the cream I was using extremely aggravated the marks. My GP took a biopsy which came back positive for LS. \n\nI am currently using a cream called Resolve at the advice of my Urologist. My main symptoms are pain and tenderness where the white marks once were. They have nearly cleared up by now, though the skin in that area is quite dry looking. I am glad it is clearing up! Honestly if I was you and it is clearing up using that cream I would hold off until it is a last resort with seems to be what you are doing. It would be my luck that I would get circumcised and a week later a cure would be found.", "28F: Is it best to see a dermotologist or a gynecologist for diagnosis of lichen sclerosis? Please help! 28F: Is it best to see a dermotologist or a gynecologist for diagnosis of lichen sclerosis? Just speaking from personal experience... a gyno could not figure it out for 3+ years so I saw a dermatologist and before he even took a look he knew what it was. They specialize in skin, I would just see a dermatologist Unfortunately I do not think there is a right answer and likely depends on the individual doctor!

Are you still able to have sex? Are you in remission? Can you still have sex? I am freaking out :( Yes! A clobetasal ointment has kept it at bay for me.

It still has flare ups, but yes much more under control. And yes!  As long as I take it slow,  and do not get too rough, I can have sex with minimal issue. i agree it depends on each specific doctor. i went to a dermatologist specifically asking about LS, it took 2 biopsies and 5 visits to wind up with no conclusive answer. i went to a new gyno (for something different) and she brought it up the first visit without me mentioning it. i am still waiting for a conclusive answer, but right off the bat she seemed MUCH more knowledgeable than my derm! Not in remission. I only got diagnosed in December, but have been on Clob daily since then. Did not have sex for the first 6 weeks on Clob cause I was generally uncomfortable both mentally and physically with my vulva. After mustering up the courage and taking a long shower, finally tried and with a lot of patience and a lot of lube, was able to have sex again. I was more sore than usual after at the insertion area, but I chalk that up to probable skin breakdown from Clob. My doctor hopes to take me down to Clob 3x weekly by Feb/March and then only as needed after that.\n\nEveryone is case is so different though, listen to your body and find a good doctor who will listen and validate your pain.

I was diagnosed by an OBGYN and put on steroid cream which helped but I also later saw a derm and I am very glad I did because she gave me a secondary medication that helped me have to use the steroid less!

I have not posted on here before, but I was just hoping I could get some insight. October 2019, I discovered some discoloured blue-ish skin on the left side of my glans. Not exactly a patch, as the skin feels exactly the same, just some discolouration and a slight skin coloured lump on top. Since then, it has not gotten bigger, smaller or anything, just stayed the same. I am 28 years old, and never really dated much before because I had bad anxiety, and now with this development, I feel even less likely to date or have sex even when I did not have this. I suppose I should have had some balls when I was younger and health down there to get what I wanted, especially if I knew all this was coming. Do you think that my dating life is truly over now with this? I really hate the way it looks, and I do not expect anyone else to like it. I just want to know if I should expect a life by myself and how I might need to adjust. So what steps have you taken to deal with this?  What does you doctor/dermatologist say? Its not all as hopeless as it seems at first.  Keep your head up. I was diagnosed last fall and I have reversed all my symptoms already by experimenting with a home-made salve. \n\n-the ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology enthusiast So your issue is just an appearance issue and u have no crazy pain and burning?

I have been moisturising in the mean time, skin is not as dry as it was which is good, but I do not want to depend on it forever as I feel like I am just messing with the natural oils of the glans.

A sprayer (I got the SonTiy sprayer on Amazon in the US, but there are other options) is far more practical and I find that rinsing rather than wiping reduces LS symptoms.  \n\n\n\nAlso, for vulvar LS, I keep a gentle soap near the toilet.  Pee, rinse, soap, rinse.  I added soap after reading the information posted in the ( thread.  While I do not believe that LS is *caused by* urine exposure, it can certainly be exacerbated by urine exposure, and cleaning up immediately seems to be a big help in my experience, even better than aloe or coconut oil between clob doses.\n\n\n\nGet you a sweet sweet anogenital shower wand. I can vouch for the SonTiy sprayer. Reasonably priced, great value, package includes great instructions and everything you need. Awesome!\n\n\n\nI chose that one specifically because the sprayer head on the others like it are plastic while the SonTiy one is metal.  Seemed more durable, but the plastic ones are more affordable if you do not have the budget for it.  I also like the design of it better than sprayers that are shaped like kitchen sprayers and that the spray strength is adjustable at the head.  \n\n\n\nPersonally, I think it is a superior design and a solid build.", "What is Lichen Sclerosus and How is it Diagnosed | Harbor Compounding Pharmacy ", "Recent diagnosis of LS and feeling alone I am a female and a nurse spotted it in November 2019. I felt relief at that time as It explained years of on and off itching and nobody able to find out why!! I was given steroid cream to use everyday for a month and then every second day till I saw a gynecologist in February. I was diagnosed by her looking at me and telling me that my clitirus hood is sealed up.\nIt took time till I could look at it myself and it was horrible to see. The changes of my skin colours and thinness. I was able to see the LS to put the steroid cream on in the places I had missed!\nI was managing it till I developed a fungal skin infection in between my thighs that is still hurting when I walk, sleep, move! I am using a fungal cream which is easing the pain but not the scarring. It took time to get a diagnosis and had to take photos to send to my GP on a secure email and that was humiliating for me!\nI feel frozen sexually and cannot bare to contemplate it. I am 46 and single and am scared that this is it and no more relaxing pleasure for me. I agreed to go in for day Surgery to open my hood by pulling it apart but that got delayed due to the horrendous coronavirus.

I am so sorry you are feeling this way.\n\nI have not had the surgery but I am curious to see if anyone here has. \n\nYou are definitely not alone and I hope you know that.

It may also help to discuss your worries with your gynecologist, they may have resources and information. \n\nAlso it does sound like you are having a particularly hard time of it right now with the addition of the fungal infection. That will eventually go away and things will get better, I would think. I appreciate your kind words. It is good to know that I am not alone...

I have made a tele appt with my GP to discuss all of it in 10 minutes if I am lucky!\nI hope that someone knows about the surgery if it is worthwhile or not...

I have had blood work, swabs, biopsies. I have been tested for ALL STDS/STI'S all NEG. I have seen 3 GYN's, 2 Derms and 2 Primary Care as well as an Allergist. There is a lot to my story as this has now been going on a year. \n\nI was treated for yeast(Aug), lactobacillus overgrowth (sept) and staph (oct) since then other than redness/inflammation they do not \"see\" anything that is abnormal. I got a skin biopsy and the results came back Lichen Simplex Chronicus or possible early LS. Hydrocortisone helps my symptoms but they come back, Clobetasol burned when I used it. I do not have white patches or any architecture changes right now. I was given a 3 week course of oral prednisone which helped ALOT. Unfortunately, my symptoms are slowing returning now that I am off. Oddly I get a break during my cycle and for a few days after my cycle. Once the discharge/ovulation kicks in its over. Sometimes it seems like my skin HATES my secretion's and sweat. When I work out I pay for it. I have been tested for yeast/trich/bv when this happens and its always negative, I have also taken diflucan and extended courses of diflucan during this time, nothing helps. I have been waiting since Feb for skin patch testing and still waiting. Due to covid they are out of the kit I need. \n\nA couple things to add: I use only water to clean the area and vanicream for body wash. All free and clear detergent, no dryer sheets, 100% cotton underwear or no underwear. I work from home so loose sweatpants always. GYN told me to stop tampons so now 100% cotton pads, no sex AT ALL. I drink tons of water and eat ok not terrible but I am not a health nut either. No alcohol, smoking, or meds. All blood work is normal.\n\nI have read Lichen simplex comes from scratching rubbing but I do not itch  because I know the dark hole it leads too. So I am wondering if I do in fact have LS. What I ask from you all is how did your symptoms of LS start? Have you experienced anything like I have? Any information is greatly appreciated! Pretty well seems like I could have written this before getting diagnosed, so it very well could be likely. Unfortunately, I am no doctor to say for sure. If you do have LS, it is a chronic problem that will creep back if you do not medicate it as a preventative thing. The Clobetasol keeps it at bay. Like maybe a couple of times a week, or more if you are actually trying to manage it. \n\nI too react strongly to my body secretions. My only real advice is to keep everything free from contact irritants...it sucks. I invested in a bidet to flush away urine and sweat. Thank you for your response! How long did your symptoms go on before you were diagnosed? Has anyone ever explained why you react like that to your secretions? Honestly, I do not find that doctor's and specialists know a ton about LS. It is not super common and I do not think that much research has been done on it, in comparison to other autoimmune problems. I always find the advice fairly generic and I have seen several specialists.\n\nYou may hate to hear this, but it took them over 5 years to find something to biopsy and verify that I indeed had LS. I had to wait to attend a special clinic run by a gynecologist and a dermatologist that specialized in vulvar skin. I still am learning how to effectively manage it, because I struggle to find the exact factor that triggers it.\n\nYou may benefit from asking a doctor to prescribe you a mix of creams. Half Ihle's Paste, half Nystatin cream. It is zinc and yeast cream mixed together. It may give you some relief. \n\nNo one has been able to explain the body's reaction. I just have figured out from experience that anything that creates any trauma to the skin will trigger itching. I just try to wear very basic cotton underwear that is a bit loose and loose pants. With the jogger pant trend, it helps a bit. Sometimes, if it is really bad, I will just wear a skirt with no underwear to let things breathe. At bedtime, I often skip panties. \n\nGive the Clobetasol a fair chance. I wasted years trying to avoid it, but really, that did not help anything. Was the Clobetasol compounded as a cream or ointment? The cream burnt for me, but the ointment I do fine with. It also helps to take a good warm bath ahead of time to sooth the skin (anything hurts on raw skin, truly!) and between applications I moisturize/soothe with coconut oil or emu oil, something similar. You may benefit from Estrace which is an estrogen based cream prescribed along with Clob. It helps make the skin supple and smooth again, at least in my experience. There are other steroids that are between the low strength of hydrocorisone and high strength of Clob as well. You may need something like Triamcinolone. It is kind of in the middle. \n\nAre you still testing that you have a fungal infection? If not, I am not sure why they are still making you take an anti fungal. Have they checked for any bacterial infections? \n\nYou are doing everything right! I am sorry you are dealing with this. No kind of LS is caused by scratching, but itching can increase inflammation. LS and related diseases are autoimmune and genetic in nature. Trauma, stress, itching, etc. can certainly cause a flare up or make symptoms worse, but do not cause the disease. I hope that helps! \n\nI swear by a gel ice pack under my crotch when I am experiencing a lot of itching. Just ensure there is a layer between the skin and pack. I add a little hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to my soak baths and take one every other day or so, which seems to help me as well. Not sure why! Thank you! Also, I am sorry to hear it took that long for you to get diagnosed. I am saving up to try and go see a specialist so hopefully they can give me some insight when I finally get to one. If the Clob helped, but it was too strong, you can always use it with a barrier ointment. I use mine with aquaphor sometimes when I feel that burn and it completely helps and I still get the positive effects from using Clob. There are also other ointments like Triamcinolone that people have success with who cannot tolerate Clob very well! \n\nAlso, make sure the Clob is in ointment form, not cream. A lot of woman react badly to the cream vs the ointment due to the added ingredients in it :) To me this really does sound like LS, at first I thought my symptoms were a bad yeast infection but it was lacking the typical discharge, then had similar symptoms to you, no white patches, the area was just super red and inflamed, itchy and would get cuts and tears when I would wipe with toilet paper and when I would try to have sex (which felt like I was being cut by glass down there)\n\nFrom what I have researched it is hard to tell how it starts - the only theories I can think of for my own case is that having coronavirus a few months before it started messed with my immune system or the protein production of the skin there (a reach, I know, I dont have enough biological knowledge), that hormonal birth control had a role to play or damage from having recurrent yeast infections in the past :/ the papers I have read though insinuate that it stems from an autoimmune side of things or hormonal issues but have not found a definite answer\n\nEverything you are doing lifestyle-wise is great! \n\nClob kind of burned when I first used it then it helped me, I am not too sure whether it is a common thing. (And if it does burn really bad then probably not a good idea to use it)\nMy doctor told me to use clob on the affected area once a day for a month, then twice a week after that passed with hydromol on the area on the days I am not using clob.\n\nThis helped my symptoms a lot, the area did gain a white patch but the pain has stopped so I am not too fussed that the appearance has changed, I had a little flare up so I am on clob for a month again but I have had no pain for months now thankfully.\n\nI hope things work out for you and your symptoms get better! Thank you for your response! It was the ointment but I did only try it once bc it burned so bad. I have not tested positive for fungal since august and I have been checked a lot. Same with bacterial, last pos test I had was staph in October.  Was really hoping the gyn or derm could help me out but all my gyn said to me was we can stop your periods even though i explained the problem is after my period and since my skin biopsy just showed non specific inflammation they could not tell me much other than that Thank you! I may have to try that. I used Vaseline on my biopsy spot to help it heal bc it was a suggestion by my derm, big mistake, it burned so I hope I can tolerate aquaphor THANK YOU! I have done a lot of reading about this as well. I did not put it in my original post bc like I said its a LONG story but I tried going on the pill and I only made it two months bc my symptoms got so much worse so I got off of it. I had my hormones checked to see if that was a possibility but all was normal. Was your itching constant or intermittent? I find mine is more come and go as well as my skin being SUPER sensitive, even air will cause itchiness as well as touch. I would keep trying to find a second opinion/better doc. I know it is exhausting, but you deserve care by someone who does not give up and wants to address your needs! You should not have to be miserable. Good luck! I am saving up to go to the CVVD in DC/NY, I have contacted them for a telemed app, just have to save up a bit first because they dont take insurance. I have had a terrible time with Doctors in my area, I live in a small town and I even went 4 hours one way to see a new derm. Sad that it has come to this for many people. I appreciate you and everyone on here taking the time to respond. I wish everyone well! I know my experience as a male is not that helpful but I want to tell you I use betamethasone ointment augmented and apparently it is not as strong as clobetasol. I had bad reaction to water based lubricant my dermatologist told me to use.\nMy conclusion is anything that is water or body based fluid is bad. \nIf you wish you can read my posts for more details. \nPS itching was not that much of a problem for me, however I have adhesions and white scar tissue. The more you know! It is all helpful! The fact that vaseline bothered me, kind of makes me think you are right. I asked my derm about it and she had no idea why vaseline would bother me but told me I could try aquaphor. I havent yet cause I am just now coming off prednisone so i havent needed anything. Thank you! My dermatologist doesnt like me using vaseline,  cancer  concern!  But the ointments are typically 80% petroleum based, ie like vaseline!  Reluctantly agreed to some vaseline use to prevent sticking of forskin to glans when lubricating effects of betamethasone wore off.\nI recommend using something before it flares up. I use betamethasone twice a week for past 18 months. \nIt stings when I have an open tear when I wash before applying but ointment is ok. Of course!\nI am still on the pill because I am in a relationship but I am really considering the copper IUD instead.. my doctor told me the pill is not bad for people with LS but I have heard that going off makes things better so I am very tempted \n\nFrom what I remember at the start the itching was every so often, however after any sexual activity the area would get so itchy! After washing there too, so I think any time it was given much attention. It then stopped for awhile until this recent flare up and would start to itch when I washed/applied ointments so again only with attention but now it does every so often, mostly at night :/ I am considering contacting my doctor about it (did wonder if it was a yeast infection but I got tested and nope) but I am unsure if it is enough of a serious issue because last time she complained that I contacted her too much about my queries (I called in a week or two after my first in person appointment with her because of this flare/itching). Luckily it seems to be not too sensitive because cold water tends to help me but I do wish this recent bout of itching would stop :^( \n\nI wish there was more to read about and more research into this condition, I am grateful for this community and the research there is so far but I have spoke to multiple medical professionals now who do not even know what it is That is exactly how I started my LS journey! I was treated for everything you can think of, and they even treated my husband because the drs had no clue what it was! As soon as you can get symptoms to calm, use the clob! Try a hot bath before applying...I used to do that to avoid burning. Once you can get on a regular plan with the clob, you will see the light at the end of the tunnel. You will have flare ups here and there but you will gain control! My one GYN got that way too and that is why I found another one. Still is not the best and I do not feel he listens that well but the next closest GYN is 90 miles, perks of a small town lol. Sometimes I would bet money I have a yeast infection and then next day the symptoms are gone so I know its not. Cant tell you how many times I ran to urgent care thinking it was yeast and nope always negative. I am sorry you are suffering with this I know how miserable itching is. My current GYN prescribed me Hydroxyzine they say its like a prescription Benadryl because I was having trouble sleeping due to itching. I do not use it often but it WORKS. From my experience its basically sedates you and you do not even know you are itching. I do not know if you have an Instagram or Facebook but Dr. Jill Krapf posts a lot on LS, she is a specialists on it and has lots of great information. I just watched her and Dr. Goldstein's webinar on LS, very informative. I hope you feel better soon!! Thank you for the info and positivity! Was your itching intermittent or constant? That is good to know, thank you! In the early days before diagnosis almost constant...once I started with clob, had to find days where I was not full of tears/rips to use it without burning. Yeah ;-; I know a lovely GYN who I trust but I need a referral from this GYN to speak to her so I cannot because it was denied.\n\nSame here! I would get all the symptoms of one then it would disappear in a couple of days, negative tests but something was not right.\n\nBut yeah ;-; it is really not fun, I am pretty sure I have ADHD too (in the process of getting diagnosed) and just about can fall asleep usually.. so this does not help. It makes me want to find some kind of sleeping drugs (or actual drugs) to help.. \n\nOoh I will have a look! Thank you, hope you feel better too! I was and am so confused about my LSC because it *does not* itch and it is on my tailbone/upper butt, not a place I can really scratch readily or without noticing. But yeah, I suddenly had three little red spots that would not go away almost a year ago. I thought maybe from a hot tub? Maybe an allergic reaction? Maybe infected bug bites? After three different antibiotics and a mild steroid cream did not help, someone prescribed a topical antifungal and all Hell broke loose. My three minor spots turned into 15 red raw ones over an area 4 times the original size. Scrape biopsy revealed nothing. I heard shingles, herpes, staph, etc, but nothing fit exactly right, or I tested negative for it. Finally got a punch biopsy and a diagnosis. I am still in mourning for my butt. I was a gym rat. I spent years on deadlifts and hip thrusts and shoving so many grams of protein into me every day. And now I still have a nice butt in clothes, but I feel like a walking catfish because of all the discolored spots and sores and scars from the LSC plus the biopsy scar. Kind of dumb, but hard not to be bitter about all the wasted effort. \n\nI am now on clobetasol ointment, applied before bed, bandaged, and then compressed for better penetration. It sort of helps, in that the inflammation is less. The spots are less raised and less red. But if I stop for a day or two, it comes right back. I do not understand why -- it is definitely not getting scratched and retriggered since I now sleep with it bandaged and under compression shorts. I switched to plain cotton everything and the same gentle cleanser I use on my face months ago. And yet it stays.", "Pain (flair up help!) Im crying right now that im in so much pain. I wish there was a magic fix for the pain. Anybody have something that would help quick? I just started a flair up. Ice the area, rest as much as possible, no undies as much as possible  and lubricate..I use coconut oil and emu oil. I try to wear maxis or loose sweats/shorts around the house when things are upset to give it some space. So sorry, we have all been there...also your prescribed meds..for me that is clobetsol. I also feel like Benadryl helps with the itching..but that totally could be a placebo..but I will take anything I can get I use an ice pack when it is really bad. No underwear and if able to I wear a large oversized T-shirt the whole day or a dress. I try not to walk around so much and I try to not use the bathroom so much bc peeing makes it burn if I have fissures. Really sorry :( hope you find some relief soon! This may sound a bit bizarre but on the idea of ice packs.......You know the water bottle that have the ice tube that you freeze and screw into the lid to keep your drink cold?   Depending on where you flair up it can be a huge help if its in a more difficult spot.  It helped me immensely before mine was under control. That is such a good suggestion.

I would think not, but what do I know.\nI suggest you see a urologist as soon as possible,  sounds like you have a UTI.\ngood luck. I am a male and for us LS can spread to the meatus and can also cause stricture in your urinary tract which for me it did. My symptoms were pretty much what you describe but it also might be completely something different. Please have it checked by a qualified doctor ASAP. What did u do for the strictures? And what did you do for the lichen itself? Pls describe in details thank you and happy new year LS can definitely cause urinary problems like that. A UTI or a prostate problem could also cause those symptoms. I would definitely get it checked out.\n\n&gt;The most common complications of BXO are secondary to progressive sclerosis. Phimosis, paraphimosis, painful erection, **urinary retention, urethral stenosis, and altered flow** are acknowledged as understood complications.\n\n( I got constant \"UTI\"s when I was younger but was undiagnosed until after puberty when my LS reappeared. My gyno (specialist in LS) thinks that they were likely caused by my LS in one way or another (again it was years ago before I was diagnosed). Could be both honestly. Do you have high blood pressure and stress in your life? I had to make sure to lower my blood pressure which caused all of my BXO issues to go away. It is as if I never had it. I will actually flip this on its head and suggest that urine could actually cause LS", "What do you do for flare ups? Hello!   \n\nWhat does everyone do when they have flare ups?  I used to have cream, but my insurance required a pre-auth from my doctor and my doctor never gave it and I have tried to leave messages, but am unsuccessful....(time for a new dr.)   Every so often, I experience flare ups of my LS symptoms...and am in complete h*ll trying to find some sort of relief.   Is there any OTC things that you guys would suggest? Sitz baths with Epsom salts in them can calm things down sometimes. Some people like borax baths (it is another mineral salt, it is not a laundry detergent - it is just sold in the laundry aisle because it can be used to enhance the performance of soap). I have used it a couple times and can take it or leave it but some people swear by it. \n\nEmu oil is also another OTC thing I have heard others use. EmuAid is a brand sold in some pharmacies. Just be careful not to get the emuaid max version, as it has a lot of tea tree oil in it and that can be uncomfortable. I also use avocado and almond oil to keep things moisturized. \n\nWhen you do finally get a doctor to prescribe medication, try the gel ointment before the cream. There are ingredients in creams that can sometimes cause more irritation and the ointments tend to moisturize a little better. Borax!!!!! Put a couple tablespoons in a bath and see how it goes! You can build up to find your most effective concentration.  I use like a cup now. If you do not have a tub or sitz bath, there is also a cotton ball method you can check out! Let me know and I will explain it. It helps my skin heal so much. Life changing!!!!! I also love vitamin e suppositories. But try to get clob back, ASAP. So sorry you are suffering \u2764\ufe0f\n\nETA: emuaid is also bomb. I like v magic though. Not OP but please could you explain the cotton ball method for Borax? One time I was in a rush and the closest thing I had was Aloe Vera. It worked in a pinch! Thank you everyone for the replies!   I never would have thought of any of these suggestions!   Everyone is truly my hero for the responses!! I take warm/not super hot baths. Sometimes I do not even put anything in them and just soaking helps. Get a cooling gel pack just for that area and putting that on helps. If you do not have to get an ice pack, just wet a face cloth and put it in the freezer for a couple minutes. I used to swear by preparation H rapid relief, it has lidocaine in it and it would literally numb the entire area so I can have a couple hours of peace. I asked my OBGYN if she could prescribe me lidocaine and she did but she mentioned it may not be covered by my insurance and if it is not I can pick up some Orajel and it is safe to use in the area externally :) hope you start feeling better soon! I know how bad this sucks. My old derm used to prescribe me the cream based clob and I swear it made things so much worse! He swore by it. A couple years later I have a lady OBGYN &amp; she asked me if I ever taken clob and I explained this to her, she said it is the strongest steroid. So I decided to give it another try. This time it is the gel based one and it makes such a big difference. It does not feel drying or irritating at all.\nIt actually does what it is supposed to do, calm everything down lol Of course!\n1. Fill a glass that is able to hold hot liquids with hot water (eg a mason jar). Then start adding borax 1 teaspoon at a time until it is fully saturated - when no more borax will dissolve in the solution. \n2. Let the solution cool before use, hot water will obvi burn the vulva\n3. Once cooled, submerge a cotton ball or makeup remover pad or whatever is most comfortable into the solution for about 30 seconds\n4. Tuck them into the areas of the vulva as needed and let them be for at least 20 min. You can lay in bed or sit or whatever is most comfortable \n5. Moisturize after with coconut oil or emu oil or whatever your go to is. \n6. It is recommended to repeat this process for as long as needed to see results, it will take some time \n\nThe solution does not need to be refrigerated, and I would not, since cold will cause the borax to crystallize and come out of solution. Some crystallization will happen as it cools but you want to minimize it if you can. You can use the solution until you run out, it does not go bad or anything.\n\nYou can also use a cotton swab to really get the solution in all the little cracks! \n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions at all \ud83d\udc97 Thanks so much. I will get hold of some and give this method a try!", "Creative ways to soak? I recently moved into a house that only has showers, so I cannot soak in the tub like I normally do during flares. Does anyone have any creative advice? They sell sitz baths that can go on your toilet seat. When I was a kid on the farm, I was bathed in a tin tub in the barn or set out at the garden in the summer.  I filled my belly of cucumbers, tomatoes, corn, and strawberries, then took an afternoon bath right there in the yard.  \n\n\n\nPerhaps you can set up a tin tub or a half tub designed for a tiny home in one of your bathrooms.  It takes work since it is not connected to the plumbing, but if you are only using it for flares, the extra effort might be worth it.  \n\n\n\nPerhaps get an aquarium vacuum like the Python No Spill Clean and Fill that will drain the tub easily into a sink when you are done.  Iirc, you can use it to fill the tub from the tap, too (It is been about 20 years since I used one, but pretty sure there is a switch to reverse flow). We discuss this all the time at our group on FBook called LICHEN SCLEROSIS LICHEN PLANUS SKIN DISORDER SUPPORT. Some use a sitz bath; others a plastic tub/container, etc.", "Please read!!! Suffering for 5 months! Could this be lichen sclerosus? I know this is long but please someone read this. \n\n\nEarlier this year in February 2020 I shaved down there and started experiencing some itching. I did not think much about it. Fast forward to the first week of March and the mild itch turned into an intense itch that was localized to the upper area of the labia majora around the area where the clit is but on the part of the skin where the hair grows. It was sooo itchy that sometimes it would wake me up at night. That lasted for a few weeks. During that time I tried applying some hydrocortisone and it did not really do much. In April I bought some jock anti fungal itch cream and within 5 days it reduced the itching by about 70%. The upper part of my labia was still itching so I went to the doctors. She looked at my skin. Did not notice anything abnormal and prescribed me Fluconazole suspecting it was a yeast infection. I took 3 pills and after I was done with treatment I still had itching. Up until then the itching was just on the skin of the labia majora but around this time I developed a random itch that felt like it was on the mucosal part of the labia minora. It is not constant but it seems to flare up more some days and it feels like I have needles stabbing the labia minora and I have to move around to \u201cscratch\u201d it for it to go away. \n\nAnyway, after I was done with the Fluconazole I did a 7 day treatment of monistat. No relief. Called up my doctor and she then gave me Clotrimazole and betamethasone cream. Used it for about 5 days and did not feel any difference so I stopped using it and finally was able to see a gynecologist on May 29. He looked at me said my vulva looked irritated and suspects I have PCOS and that my testosterone levels is probably causing irritation and that when I lose weight my symptoms will go away. He ordered some bloodwork and took a culture swab and put me on Metformin. I have been waiting almost 2 months for my follow up appointment however I already looked at my results online. All my hormone levels were normal and swab came back normal. The only abnormal test was my insulin resistance which I am not worried about because I am already on Metformin and losing weight. \n\nI do not believe PCOS is causing this chronic itching. My symptoms are not as bad as they were in the very beginning but they are seriously taking a toll on my mental health because it has been 5 months already and I still have no definite answer. I thought that maybe I was having an allergic reacting to something even though I had not changed anything in my routine. I changed soaps including body wash for sensitive skin, stopped using panty liners, switched pad brands, switched toilet paper, even stopped washing with soap and only rinsed with water and still no relief. I thought maybe the skin was really dry and i started applying coconut oil to the labia and did not really do anything. Sometimes when I use a cream moisturizer it feels a little better. But I try to avoid putting anything down there to avoid irritation. \n\nThe best way I would describe my current symptoms is a prickly feeling on my labia majora especially on the upper part of my labia by my mons pubis. It is like that feeling when you shave your genitals and the hair starts growing back except this happens regardless if the hair is long or short. Sometimes it feels like I have tiny tears or cracks on my skin and it will either itch or sting. Most of the itching is on the left side of my labia majora however the right side will itch sometimes too. A random itch on the left side of my labia minor that feels like I have a needle poking the mucosal skin. I have looked down there with a mirror and the skin on my labia majora looks wrinkled more than I have ever noticed and on some areas it looks like patches of little stretch marks. The weird part is that I only have symptoms when there is friction to that area like when I walk around, move or when my clothes rubs up against the skin. If I am just sitting down I do not really feel anything. \n\nI have been reading online about lichen scleorosus and lichen simplex. I heard that lichen simplex can be random and triggered by stress. Around the time that this started I was extremely stressed because I was going through a pregnancy scare. The itchy patches that initially started all this could have been triggered by all that stress? and maybe I damaged my skin by all the intense scratching that it then turned into lichen simplex? I am inclined to believe that I might have lichen simplex but the labia minora mucosal itching is throwing me off because lichen simplex is usually confined to the labia majora area only. I cannot really say that I notice any white patches like you usually do with lichen sclerosus but I could have a very mild/early case? \n\nAnyone who has lichen sclerosus or lichen simplex have you experienced any of these symptoms? I am sinking into a deep pit of depression stressing over this. I finally have a follow up apt with my gynecologist on July 23 and I am going to ask if he thinks this it what it is and ask for clobetasol. If not a biopsy. Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!! With only itching as a symptom is very hard to say. You could try eliminating all sugar from your diet as it feeds microbes and take a good vaginal oral probiotic daily to see if that helps at all. There are some strains that have been studied and shown to combat microbes. Look for one with L crispatus especially. Possibly look for an obgyn or doctor that specializes in less common vaginal issues for a second opinion. What you are describing is what an LS flare up can feel like for me. I would ask your gynecology to do a biopsy from the area to confirm. I know it sounds painful but they will numb you first. You could also request an anti anxiety pill prior to the procedure if you go through with it.\n\nAlso, yes... I would start using clobetasol immediately if your doctor does the biopsy.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend removing common food allergens from your diet until you have an answer. Dairy and grains really fuck me up down there, although I can tolerate rice and butter.\n\nEdit: ALSO: Vagisil anti itch wipes are a life saver for me when I have a flare. NOT scratching the area is important so that it can chill out.\n\nBest of luck! Feel free to DM me if you want more info. :) Hi, thank you so much for your reply! What are the typical symptoms you feel with LS? Do you only feel it when there is friction to the area like i do or do you also feel it even when you are sitting/laying down? Did you notice any changes to your skin when you first got diagnosed? I recently saw my gynecologist on Tuesday and he said he did not see anything out of the ordinary down there and that my skin looks fine according to him :( I mentioned Lichen Sclerosus and lichen simplex to him and he said I do not have that. I also tried asking for a steroid cream and he said he would not recommend it because it will cause atrophy down there. Once again he attributed my symptoms to me having PCOS supposedly which I still do not believe is what is causing this. He basically told me to lose more weight and that it will go away. He also prescribed me Clotrimazole/betamethasone cream to use 3x a week. I already tried using that back in May and I did not really notice a difference but I only used it for 5-6 days that time. I really wanted a steroid cream only because I do not think I need the Clotrimazole antifungal part, but I got to make the best out of what I got. I am going to try using the cream again for a month and if I do not notice a difference I will go to another doctor. It sucks because I feel like he is not taking me seriously but I swear I am not crazy! I definitely suggest asking your primary care provider for a referral to a dermatologist! Your experience sounds super similar to mine: nonstop itching (I would get some temporary relief but nothing that lasts) that led me to discuss with my PCP who referred me to a gyno who prescribed an ointment that did not do anything at all. Eventually, I went to a dermatologist and it made SUCH a huge difference. From the first appointment, she is been nothing but super helpful and understanding of what is going on. They would know better than any other specialty provider (imho) what to look for with LS. Please keep up updated! I contacted my PCP for a referral to a dermatologist just this past week! I went to my gyno appointment a few weeks ago and he was no help at all. Basically told me to lose more weight and was hesitant about prescribing me anything. He finally gave me some Lotrisone which I already have tried. I have been using it for 12 days and do not really notice any improvement. Still feel prickly and irritated down there. What did your dermatologist tell you? And we are you prescribed anything to help you? So weird, I can exactly relate to that \u2018prickly\u2019 feeling you are on about, i thought i was going insane! I have been feeling the exact same for months, it is driving me crazy and waking me up in the middle of the night. If you find anything that helps please let us know! I have been experiencing prickly and pain you are describing since November. It feels like a mix between razor burn, and hair growing back and like I wiped way too hard. \n\nOriginally got diagnosed with BV but the issue came back and would not go away. Finally was able to see my GYN who diagnosed me with LS. I do not have the \u201cwhite patches\u201d they say you may have. But based on my symptoms my dr says it could be LS. I just started a steroid ointment today... Triamcinolone. We will see how it goes.... \n\nIt is so annoying because I feel like I cannot wear underwear without irritation. I am ready to cut my vag off!! Yes the prickly feeling and \u201chair growing back\u201d sensation was driving me crazy!!! Thankfully after about 2 1/2 weeks of using Lotrisone it seems to have gone away. I now use it about 2-3x a week. I still have some minor irritation on my inner labia but I still cannot figure out if it is yeast or irritation from using so many different moisturizers. Either way I have drastically improved from where i was 6 months ago. Has the triamcinolone been any help to you? Not at all. I read to use Vaseline as a barrier cream and helped immediately but of course only when in use. I am going to mention lotrisone to my dr. Thank you! Do you have any updates? Have you gotten a biopsy? Hope you are feeling better! So in the beginning of August I used Lotrisone for about 2 weeks straight everyday and my symptoms went down a lot! I no longer feel the prickly feeling that was driving me crazy for months. However my symptoms are not completely gone yet. I still get irritated/scratchy sensation along my labia major every once in a while. It will come and go but for the most part I feel 90% back to normal. I actually got a biopsy a couple weeks ago and I am supposed to receive my results this Friday. I am hoping to finally get some answers. That is good news \u2014 I am glad you are feeling better! I am really interested to hear about your results if you would be willing to share when you get them! Take care! So my biopsy results came back as superficial perivascular dermatitis. I am not sure how accurate this is because my biopsy was taken from a spot where I have had little to no symptoms. I am surprised something showed up at all. But my dermatologist said there is an irritant I am using that is triggering this. Now I just need to find out what it is. Oh! Well that is good news, hope you find out what it is sooner than later!", "what can i do at home? i am pretty sure i have LS but am too scared and ashamed to ask my family members and see a specialist so what can i use in the meantime to keep it under control? I find coconut oil helps but really I would advise you to see a dermatologist about it because it needs steroidal creams usually. Do not be ashamed, it is only a skin condition and the specialists have seen it all before. After years of fertility investigation I have finally accepted that there is nothing to worry about. You are not the first and you will not be the last person who is afraid to see someone but I would highly recommend it to avoid too much scarring in future. Hope that helps. i will eventually but i cannot right now. how often should i apply the coconut oil? I do it as often as I feel necessary - usually morning, night and each time I go to the toilet. It is a little messy with your underwear but so relieving!! Seconding Right Opportunity. If you are in a family that is shy about talking sexual things, I am going to go out on a limb and guess that future babies are also strongly desired after you are married?  Well, if they want you married and making grandbabies someday, you need your vulva cooperative. And that means nipping this in the bud - the damage is cumulative over time. You want to start treating it ASAP so that you do not have scarring that does real damage and makes a sexual relationship difficult in the future. \n\nOver-the-counter steroids like cortisone 10 MIGHT help, but the steroids prescribed for LS are far, far more potent (and effective). And honestly you should not let an internet stranger to put a random ointment on your vulva. It should come from a doc. \n\nAre you in the US? This is what Planned Parenthood is for. You can call them and ask them for help. \n\nGood luck. Also take heart that LS is rare. Odds are against it. But you should see a doc for your health, now and future. thank you so much Agreed with the coconut oil.", "N-Acetylcysteine and Resveratrol for LS Hey everyone,\nCurious to see if anyone has ever dabbled or knows much about high potency anti-oxidants, specifically NAC and Resveratrol in treating LS?\nI am taking NAC as recommended by my dietitian to treat endometrioma, as it is shown to reduce their size. I am really curious if it will help my LS, but I have only been supplementing for a month so it is too early to tell. \nI also read a study where participants' Lichen Planus improved (impressively so) by taking Resveratrol.\nI am really curious about these two supplements in particular in treating LS but would love to know if anyone else has researched or knows much about this!\n\nIn addition to these supplements I am also taking fish oil for their anti-inflam properties as well as adopting a mostly Mediterranean diet to help with endometriosis/fertility. I will definitely report back if I find that these improve my LS too.", "Easy breezy Have any of you made the decision to go underwear free? \n\nI cannot find a single style of underwear that is comfortable because in the end one part of it causes friction and irritates the skin or everything bunches up and irritates the skin that way. (Yes I am buying the correct size). \n\nFrom anyone who has decided to go easy breezy and air their bahookie, any tips, advice or things I should know/do? Dude, ya!   How hard can it be to make underwear that fit!? Very hard apparently.  I feel your struggle. Im still trying to find something that works for me also.  Ive started wearing a thin pair of pajamas under my pants or sweats as a substitute for underwear sometimes, but that has its limitations.  Wearing just sweatpants with no underwear feels nice, but it also gives a bit too clear of an outline of my male annatomy.  Haha there is no easy answer. Hahah, I am a lady and I feel like the seams of my clothes between my legs just ride straight up and it is awful! I have basically stopped wearing trousers of any kind at all except pjs and the occasional loose pair of shorts. Which is really difficult cos my thighs rub and I need the clothes barrier hhnnnggg  Ya, I basically get the same problem as a dude with the crotch seams riding up between my legs somehow.  Ive found that Dress pants, sweats, and pajamas tend to have a bit more space between the waist and the crotch seam, and that helps me a lot to have the extra space for things down there.  Just room to breath and to not have the fabric riding up between your legs makes a big difference..  loose clothes all the way!  \n\nShoot, and as far as the legs rubbing, if its not a weight issue, then just keep looking for that perfect pair of sweatpants.  Goodluck! Hahha, yeah your on to something with the length thing! It is not a weight thing just one part of my thighs are wider and it rubs - trying to see if I can slim that but down by toning the muscle more in my legs but I will just have to weight and see :\u2019( \n\nKeep me posted if you find underwear that works for you cos I am sure it will work for me too!! You are * Ya, if you have curvy thighs then that is just the way your body wants to be.  I wouldnt try to change that.  \n\nIve been using boxer briefs, but they are too tight around my thighs, too loose around my waist, and too tight around my junk.  Boxers dont have any of the tightness problems but they bundle up into a thong with any kind of physical activity..\n\nThe pajamas as underwear avoids all the downsides mentioned above.  Plus, pajamas work especially well for me because my lower body is extremely cold intolerant. Oh yes all time when I am in the house but couldnot adjust this new behavior to my daily clothes yet. But, I work from home so I dont have to weat underwear on a daily base and it really changed the game for me. I am currently working from home too so no underwear for me either, but I have managed to wear long dresses outside and no underwear which has been oddly liberating \ud83d\ude02 yes. i have been underwear-free for years. i like using powders (lush silky underwear or megababe bust dust) to keep things dry since i do not have panties to wick away any moisture.\n\nalso, when i am on my period, one thing that was really helpful was switching to a menstrual disc (or a cup could work too).\n\nmaybe TMI, but the one thing i did not plan for was what happens when i get aroused. you will be very aware of it when you do not have underwear on! I have mostly stopped wearing underwear, whenever I can get away with it, without too much risk of flashing someone. I have been wearing more skirts and dresses, since pants also irritate me, especially if I am not wearing underwear, since then there is nothing between my crotch skin and the crotch seam. And I have been trying to find relatively long skirts and dresses, to reduce the risk of flashing people or accidentally sitting bare-assed on a public surface. \n\nI sometimes wear a slip or underskirt so I do not get a nice dress too dirty. Leggings are a problem, too, since they are usually tight and not very breathable. I have been substituting really long socks, sometimes with a garter belt, or regular leggings with the crotch cut out of them. I did it for about a year. My gallbladder died, then I gained sixty pounds, and LS flared all in one year. I could not stand anything around my waist - I could not wear pants at all - and underwear felt bad on everything everywhere. \n\nI wore sleeveless maxi dresses every damn day for a year. Summertime alone or with a short sleeve cardigan and sandals. Winter, under a sweater or long sleeved cardigan with boots and thigh socks. For a while I even wore a loose garter belt with the attachments for stockings just so that I would not have to wear underwear or anything tight. Was not sexy at all. Was comfortable at the time. \n\nI do not think I could have gone commando in pants. But in long dresses, yes. \n\nMy preschooler only flipped up my dress and showed my bare ass to the Starbucks once\u2026.\n\nPotential problems: SWEAT. Need a material that will not show it. Summertime crotch sweat on your outer layers \u2026 no. Just no no no no no. Yes, it shows on cotton, yes, it can smell. \n\nSmall children. Obviously. \n\nPeriods. You do not want to get surprised when away from home with \u201cI did not expect you for several days yet\u201d and bleed onto your clothes or have nothing to catch any leaks. That just sucks so much. \n\nA thing I found that worked for me was Undersummers. They are the ultimate granny panty. They go down your thighs and up high on the waist but they are not tight and they have an underwear crotch.  Stops thigh chafing. They do not irritate my vulva, I assume because of the style. Put those under a maxi dress and I can do anything anytime. I imagine the material is not always best for everyone, but it has worked super well for me! Hahah very informative and good to know!! Thank you!! Ohhh that is a good idea!!! I had not thought of modifying existing clothes! Amazing suggestions and things to note! Thank you for your advice!! I have not worn underwear since February. I just kind of stopped \ud83d\ude02  I wear a lot of loose clothes and pants (but still make sure to look \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude09) honestly I have not had any issues at all other than having to wash my pants more often lol", "Questions  Hello, just found out about this sub, really cool!\nMy doc thinks I have LS and I am getting a biopsy soon probably. I have few questions\n\n1. Is LS forever? My doc told me that the it can go away permenantly after the cortisone treatment.\n\n2. Is it less likely to come back if your uncircumcised?\n\n3. How does the treatment work? Like do you use this cortisone cream for the rest of your life?\n\nIm pretty bummed over this but I guess its life!\n\nThanks in advance! LS is permanent, although it can go into remission. Circumcision is not a factor, at all. Expext to use the steroid for the rest of your life to keep flare-ups from getting out of control.\n\nFinding the treatment that works best for you can be difficult. This disease seems to respond to different treatments for different people. My best advice is to be active in these groups, ask lots of questions, be willing to try new things and share your experiences with hope it helps others! Damn. Thanks for the answer. Maybe my doc was trying to make me feel better by saying that its \u201dcurable\u201d. Real bummer. Finding a knowledgeable doctor is another part of this battle. Doctors can be so quick to down play this thing.  I spent almost a year in massive pain because of it. My support group on facebook may have saved my life! I have been diagnosed with LS in may 2017. I am circumsised.\n\n2017 was painful as fuck. Erections are unbearable. No sex.\n\n2018 was a bit better but sex is not fun, chaffing/burning sensation when erect\n\n2019 better starting to have a bit of sex.\n\n2020 is even better so far. Sex is not painful anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have used cortisone cream for a maximum of 1 month at a time... after that i am supposed to use tacrolimus for the long term but i am skipping it. I have started my treatment with tacrolimus in 2017 and it got worse. I am scared to use that again. Cortisone can make your skin thinner and with lichen its the last thing you want. So it is not viable to use cortisone year long.\n\nWhat my dermatologist told me tho and it is paying off I believe, is to hydrate my penis H24. With the best hydrating lotion/cream you can get. I have been applying a first aid cream every single day since 2017 and multiple times a day. it sucks but my situation is improving. Pain is pretty much gone at this point.\n\nBut its still a hell of a skin disease. :-( good luck. Damn this made me panick a bit. Maybe I have mild LS because I have never had any pain or anything, only thing is that there is like a white layer of skin ln the shaft and some parts below on the penis. I remember getting a cortisone creame for it and it when I adressed this white skin thing with my doc for the first time 1 year ago (he thought it was a yeast infection) and after a few days using cortisone all the white skin went away amazingly, but after like a month or two it started to come back and now another doc told me he is sure its LS, biosy to be done soon. I do not get it. Were your symptoms as mild as mine and it developed more painful symptoms? Because I am reading all these posts and its making me think that this is going to get mich worse. It striked me out of nowhere in may 2017. During a couple of days my penis was itching a lot. I thougth it was a yeast infection so I used a cream for that for 1-2 weeks...with no results. I consulted a dermatologist and she told me it was Lichen sclerosus with atrophy. What happened over the early weeks is that my skin started to scar, thin and ''shrink'' alot, a zone of about 1cm all around the penis, just under the glans. My glans became extremely sensistive. I was getting erections all the time just cause of the friction with my underwear. when soft... not too bad, but with ''shrinking'' skin when you get erect it burns cause the skin is so stretched out. 2 years later my dermatologist tell me i am a mild case lol. I do not want to know what a severe case looks like. Also, my glans changed color so many times... from red to purple to grey to white to purple to pink... scary sometimes lol.\n\nToday the sensitivity is back to normal and my skin regained some ''slack'' if I could say so getting an erection is not painful. The downside is I hydrate it h24 multiple times a day. But scarring is irreversible so my penis does not look as good as it used to be. Can have sex but got to be careful and gentle.\n\nMake sure your doc is 100% sure it is LS. My brother has psoriasis on the penis. It is white patches, redness... its itchy sometimes but it is waaaaaaaaay better than having LS like I do. My brother just put cortisone cream and it is gone after a few days. There is no permanent scarring like LS. Thank for the info! But was your case like mine? I have white patches appearing now and the white are is getting larger. As I said, when I used cortisone like a yeat ago it all disappeared and everything looked normal and healthy, I am wondering how it progresses from there, like will it come to a point where the cortisone does not do anything to the white spots and all the pain and things you described comes? Because so far I havnt had any pain or discomfort, only a weird looking dick. Will it get worse? Thanks! I have never had white patches so it is hard to tell. Multiple sites online say that at times it can go into a permanent \"remission\" when treated early. But it does sound like that is rare, so I would not bank on it. Hey did you get your Biopsy what did the results say? and your issue has it gotten better or worse? Hey, yeah so the doc called and said that I had ls. Since then I really have not done anything different. He prescribed me some creame like 2 months ago which I still have not bought but I am planning on getting it soon. It has not gotten worse, maybe the white has spread out a little more but not noticebly. I have no pain whatsover which is really strange considering other people with this condition seem to have other symptoms including pain. Ok so you have had no issues yet that is good to hear.\n\nHow do you feel about this is it scary to you has the doctor shown concern regarding to stuff like cancer ? \n\nIm sorry for bothering you i have been really anxious for past 2 days as i have similar white patches and think its LS. No problem man I was also super anxious. The doctors I have visited have not really adressed cancer in a detailed manner but they said that it is nothing to worry about because the chances are tiny. That being said, it is better to treat it asap, that way you reduce the chance of getting cancer. OK thank you its a pretty bad time for me mentally because of this pandemic and now this hope you do good tho best of luck. Best of luck to you too, try not to worry too much about it!", "How was your Pregnancy? Can someone share how their pregnancy and birth went with LS? I am not pregnant but I want to be soon and this new diagnosis is making me imagine awful birthing scenarios. Thanks. Following! Fine\n No tears and virtually symptom free the whole time. Unmedicated. The pain and burning right after birth that everyone has was nothing to me haha. It took a few weeks but eventually it went away completely. Pregnancy kind of sucked but that aspect of it was great! It did not return until maybe a year post partum and did not get to the point i needed clob until around 15 months after. Starting to get more annoying lately at 20 months out. As for birth, I had an emergency C-section (twins!) so no comment on that situation. So I actually read a ton of responses regarding pregnancy on the LS fb group. I highly recommend that group. The info is fantastic. I am currently pregnant and my symptoms have reduced significantly. I have read that breastfeeding and drop in estrogen after birth can trigger a flare, looks like some are okay and some need extra treatment (like estrogen creams) Yes, that is what I have been seeing in the fb group. Thanks for your response! Congrats btw! What is the group called? Search Lichen Sclerosus in the fb search. Click the group tab at the top and it is the first group that pops up.

Are you troubled in your daily activities? For three years, I was not getting proper treatment- I could not focus on anything except the itching. I did not sleep for 3 years and cried a lot. I used to do that funny walk when I had an itch but could not scratch, or the awkward twist in the chair/crossing and I crossing my legs. It was absolutely insane. But after a year of using clob ointment, I can say I am pretty much healed/recovered.

I was in a nearly constant state of flare for nearly 6 months until a couple of months ago when my clobetasol seemed to really improve the situation. I thought it was finally in remission. \n\nThen, my daughter was recently hospitalized for 4 days and she will need surgery soon. My husband and I have been under a great deal of stress and my LS has been flaring so badly again. I know LS is thought to have an autoimmune component so it makes sense that this could be the case, but does anyone else feel as though stress can cause a really bad flare up? \n\nI am back to using the clob twice daily.

There is a lot of information about Borax being dangerous but you will see from the Facebook group that most people swear by it for LS. I would recommend soaking in it for a few weeks and see how you do. The best part is that it takes the itching away. \n\nFingers crossed for you!! Oh yes. You stress and sweat and stuff, your LS will go fucking bezerk. Oh yes yes yes. My LS support group talks about stress maintenance all the time because of this.

It has faded a little now with the cream my doctor gave but it is there.", "Personal experience, research and questions Hello guys,  \n\nI am a 19 year old, uncircumcised male who was diagnosed this year in June. I suspect that I have LS since im 14 or 15 years old as my foreskin at that time began to become white and scarred. The LS on my foreskin never really caused any medical problems like phimosis or itching and I could pull it back easily. It was mainly a cosmetic issue. The LS luckily (I unfortunately can not explain why) started to peel at some point which left my foreskin looking pretty normal again. However since last year the LS started to be present on my glans especially around the meatus which got me really scared and depressed. Because of Covid-19 and my education I could not get a diagnosis last year and had to wait till this year. My dermatologist described me 0,1% Betamethasone and I applied it once a day for two weeks straight. To be honest it helped a little bit considering the scarring and discoloration but my glans does not really look pink and \"healthy\". In my next visit I probably ask y dermatologist if we can change the therapy.  Since the diagnosis and being told that there is no cure for this disease I have been constantly researching. During my research I have found a few interesting things which i wanted to ask you guys since many of you probably suffer longer than I do.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. circumcision  \n I have read in tons of articles and scientific papers that circumcision is somewhat curative. As far my understanding goes: circumcision prevents moisture and \"trapped\" urine which leads the glans to be \tdry. Circumcision however is only curative if its done in the early \tstages of LS and if only the foreskin is affected. My question is: Is there somebody who has done circumcision after his glans was already affected? And if you did it, has it helped long term?  \n \n2. cortisone  \n In my research I saw a articel which described the long term use of cortisone on the glans. \tIn that articel a male LS sufferer used cortisone (I think it was also Betamethasone) every day for 25 years. The result was pretty good considering he had no symptons like scar tissue or \tdiscoloration. I think the articel also states that the skin tissue on the glans \"deals\" better with the cortisone than other \tskin tissue. My question: Are there any males who used corstisone \tover a longer timeline and if yes, could you also share your \texperience?  \n \n3. laser therapy   \nLaser therapy is, I think, mainly used on female patients. The offers in my country are pretty much all targeted toward women and i did not found one single doctor who performs these laser therapies on men which in my opinion sucks because according to one study those therapies are really effective and also somewaht \"curative\". My question: Did any of you \tguys have done it? What was your experience and has it helped long term?  \t  \n \n\nI know that this is a lot of text and questions but since I do not know anybody from my friends/family who suffers from LS, I just wanted to ask you guys and I think this also works kind of as therapy lol. To wrap it up, I just wanted to say thank you that this subreddit exists with all the helpful people and say sorry for any grammar and spelling mistakes since english is not my mother tongue lol. &gt;&gt; Circumcision however is only curative if its done in the early stages of LS and if only the foreskin is affected.\n\nI read somewhere that problems on the glans can also resolve with circumcision and so hopefully this statement is not entirely correct.\n\nDid you come upon stem cell treatment as well? If not, here is some info:  Thank you for your response I recommend checking out r/circumsicion, I have seen men post in there about getting a circumcision for LS.", "Super far fetched but does anyone here live in NE Ohio? Just wondering if anyone has found a good doctor here, thank you Have not found a specialist (my case is super mild so far,  thank goodness, so just being handled by my regular doctor), but I am in Cleveland. Did they formally diagnose you, biopsy and all that? I am! Diagnosed by my Gynecology Oncology doc, a couple years post cervical cancer treatment. I frankly hate my doc and his approach and am sort of following along in case better recommendations appear. Thank you, just want to get a good doctor to do a biopsy and am having a hard time trusting the doctors I see to handle something like that, if that makes sense Makes sense 100%! I feel like my GYNONC is not super well versed in LS and his response is to do a biopsy EVERY TIME I see him, which only seems to make things worse. I understand his concern, since I have already been through a gynecological cancer, and LS can cause/look like vulvar cancer, but I am hoping that once I have my first appointment with a new Primary Care doc in December, I can discuss a better route with her for who to see about this. I am also close with a nurse at the cancer center who has been trying to help me find either a dermatologist or an rheumatologist, which she thinks makes more sense. My step-mother USED to work for Associates in Dermatology in Westlake, and I do believe they do the biopsies for LS there. Anyhow, I will keep in touch in case I come across anyone helpful. Please do the same and best of luck to you! LS sucks.", "How can you differentiate LS, Lichen Planus and Lichen Simplex Hey, \nI get white, hard and rough scarring on my penis and foreskin. I went to two doctors that diagnosed me with chronic dermatitis. One of them was an expert in Lichen related diseases and she told me that I have to get circumcision in order to get the highest chance to get cured. I am pretty sure that I have one of those 3 diseases. I have an appointment tomorrow to make an appointment for my circumcision. The thing is my disease and the scarring and itching only gets worse, when I irritate the skin with too much physical pressure/movement. I also got my first symptoms after I did some stretching exercises, which I have not done anymore after I saw the discolouration. So for me I think the disease gets triggered by movement/pressure. Also, I tried to pull back my foreskin all the time to get used to how it will be when I do the circumcision. But that is really making the skin on my glans worse! I think it is because of the irritation of the glans through the underwear. So I am scared that circumcision actually will make my disease worse? Can anyone help me ? I already had to visit a billion doctors to get the dermatitis diagnosis, and I feel like with this disease no one can help me, so maybe here is someone that knows what to do. Thanks a lot! Why would you rush into a circumcision?  The steroid treatment is very effective in my experience.  The thick white scar tissue is gone and my adhesions are coming apart if slowly. I had phimosis after a fungal infection and the Betamethasone ointment fixed that in 3 days. If this does not work then think of circumcision Because if it is lichen sclerosus then circumcision should result in the highest remission rates by far (70 to 90%) Especially in the early stages of LS. I only used tacrolimus for about 3 months but it seems like it is not helping. I am curious: are you still uncircumcised and if so how long were you able to manage your LS with steroid treatment since your diagnosis? Are you still using it? Yes uncircumcised. I have had adhesions since at least 1984 and some symptoms before this.\nDiagnosed 2019. Been on betamethasone dipropionate ointment 2 yrs. Yes still on it. From reading it looks like I will be on treatment for good. So: white spots or even thicker scars are reversible with steroids? Yes. The really thick white scar tissue has gone and nice pink color returned. It took time ! Now I know what tacrolimus ointment is. It is not steroid but eczema ointment. My dermatologist just changed to to it after steroids for 2 yrs. Will see if there are any changes", "Struggling with intense itching for awhile now and no doctor will listen ", "I (M36) got diagnosed with LS today and I feel a bit anxious Hi everyone,\n\nI am new to this sub after getting diagnosed with LS this morning. I thought I was taking it quite well, but to be honest I started to feel a bit anxious about it today. Not really sure what I am looking for with this post, maybe I just want to get some things off my chest in an anonymous way and possible get some advice from people that are dealing with the same affliction.\n\nWhen I was young I had phimosis that prevented my foreskin from retracting properly and causing the skin to tear while having sex. At 19 I had surgery to counteract this problem and luckily my entire foreskin was saved. After surgery I used some steroid cream to stimulate the healing of the skin and to prevent too much scarring tissue. This really worked well and for 15 years everything was really good.\n\nBut two years ago my foreskin started to become inflamed. I am not exactly sure what caused it, but at a certain moment I deduced that I used to accidentally touch the rim of the toilet with the tip of my foreskin. And I always cleaned the toilet rim with bleach. So my guess was that the bleach somehow induced an inflammation. I do not know... But fact is that my foreskin started to get tighter.\n\nI went to see my GP and she prescribed me with a steroid cream (after I told her that had worked 15 years ago). This did not really counteract the tightness so I was rather upset of having this issue again after being rid of it (at this point there was no discoloration of the skin). Not knowing what it was, I started looking for solutions on the internet, and found that you could stretch the skin (I actually remembered my GP saying something about it as well). So I started stretching my foreskin several times a day and it actually worked. At first... After a couple of weeks my foreskin was \"back to normal\" in term of that I could pull it all the way back without tightness.\n\nBut then the inflammation started again and the skin got even tighter than it was before. And very clearly, I could see dry, whiteish patches appear. Previously I would have discarded it for the original scar tissue of my surgery 15 years ago, but now it seemed to start growing and ripping from time to time. Now it has gotten to a point that the white tissue has gone full circle around my penis, but luckily it is still only on the outside of my foreskin. But it is just itchy and now, when I clean it under the shower (without soap, mind you) it rips like every week. It also started to interfere with my sex-life, to the point  that my husband and I just are not having sex any longer.\n\nWhen I looked online last month for growing scar tissue on the foreskin I immediately found LS and got really scared. I directly called my GP for an appointment and she confirmed my worry. She referred me to a dermatologist and this morning I got the diagnosis...\n\nI told the dermatologist I just want a full circumcision now. I just want to be rid of it. I fear too much that it will grow inwards so to say, on to the tip of my penis. I know there is still a chance it will return after that, but right now I just feel like I need to get rid of it.\n\nThe dermatologist prescribed me with a clobetasol cream to prevent the spread right now and referred me to a urologist to talk about circumcision. I do have to wait till March for that appointment, so I am happy I have got the cream now.\n\nYeah, so, as I said, I do not really know what I am looking for while writing this post. I just needed to get this of my chest. I do have good friends that I have told about this and they have been very supportive. But still... it feels like they do not really understand the anxiety I have over it.\n\nThanks if you have read my story all the way to the end.\n\nCheers\n\nM", "Sex after vulvar biopsy Hello! I had a vulvar biopsy for LS on my vagina opening 5 weeks ago. My doctor said that I can have sex and we tried with my partner, but my biopsy scar got red and very irritated afterwards. Did anyone experience something like that? Very worried :( I will let you know when mine heals and steroids clear the LS up enough to have sex but my thought is that LS causes scar tissue to build up anyways so the biopsied areas are going to be pretty fragile for awhile so it is not surprising that they got a bit irritated from the friction. Provided there is no tearing my guess is it should be fine and nothing to worry about (even if it does tear this is no more risky than having tears from Lichen, just a slight infection risk cus microbes can get in easier through broken skin).\n\nRemember that this is a high blood flow area so it tends to redness pretty easy. My guess is that it will go down pretty quickly though because the blood flow also offers faster healing, especially from simple irritation. Thank you very much for your answer! It definitely gives some comfort! I hope it will go away soon. I will update you when it will be gone. Wish you a speedy recovery! Thank you, and the same to you!\nI am about a week past biopsy and the bleeding has stopped so I am very anxious to start treatment (at this point do not know what of the stinging pain is still healing scars or just the LS since it just... feels like that sometimes). It was such a long journey to get this far and I am really hopeful to never feel like this again!\n\nHow long after biopsy were you able to start treatment? Thank you! I started the treatment around 3 weeks after biopsy, my healing process took longer than usual because my stitches came out earlier that they should have. And I also had a lot of itching and stinging during the healing process, I think it is all together LS and healing wound. For me to arrive to this point it took 6 years of doctors not knowing what is wrong with me. I am on steroid cream right now, so I really hope that this will improve my life. Depending where your biopsy is, try putting your hand over it when you have sex, to protect it from friction right there and o cushion it a little bit I found a meta-study on LS and the stats for remission/near remission were shockingly high with the steroids. Sounds like some people still have some issues with itching, but it is promising as heck!\n\nIt took me 5 years. We entertained the idea that is was Psoriasis since I have that on my feet after 3 years of repeatedly trying yeast. Dermatologist prescribed Protopic that did not work very well for me and finally a Gynecologist decided to biopsy. I did not want to apply steroids to that area but they have been found to be very effective and I am past the point of desperate.\n\nI am so sorry that you had to have stitches! The gynecologist took 3 punch biopsies from me and I did not need any stitches. Seems like two of them have mostly healed but the other has been torn a little so it will take some time.\n\nHave the steroids been working pretty well for you? It took some time for my dissolvable stitch to finally come out (around 6 weeks) and after that my scar was still tender. I used emu oil to massage and lightly stretched the area to help with the return of elasticity. I feel like that was the biggest issue with my scar. It was right in my vaginal opening skin and it was not stretching with the rest of the skin there like it usually would on a good LS day. Oh, I am so sorry that you have to go through all of it. Hopefully now the steroids will have positive effect.\n\nI think for me steroids (I am currently using clobetasol) help, even with less strong steroids (emovate) I was feeling better. I think for me now is just to find the steroid that works for me the best.\n\nAre you also prescribed to take Clobetasol? It is exactly in my vagina opening, so could be quite hard :( Same, friend! I cannot imagine going another year through this like you have had to. You are a real trooper for making it that long without going rabid (metaphorically ofc).\n\nI was prescribed Betamethasone which I think is kind of in the same class as Clobetasol (kind of sounds like it might be stronger, actually - but they are both strong topical steroids). The dermatologist said I can use the Protopic in-between doses after I get down through the taper (which should be 1-2xs per week on the steroid and 5xs per week on Protopic (tacrolimus - a non-steroid immunosuppressant). My stitches came out like on day 4, so I did not wait for them. But because of that healing process was longer. I am also using oil based product to soften this area, I can relate what you are talking about the scar being tender and not stretchy enough. \n\nHow long did it take for you for this area to get back to normal? Yes, I did not know about Reddit and now I feel that I am not alone dealing with all this stuff. It is giving comfort to know that there are people out there who are also going through the same experience! \n\nGood luck with the treatment and hopefully the better times are coming! :) And good luck to you as well! \ud83d\udcaa For me after my stitch came out, maybe a couple weeks. The tissue around the stitch as healed up by then and after it came out the tissue it was holding together got a chance to really heal and I could get to it more. A good stretch  (careful slow to start penitrative sex for me) every few days really helped me too. It would feel alot better each time. I avoided sex with my stitch bc even though the area of pain got way smaller it still was like a pinprick in very sensitive skin.", "Lichens spread to thighs Hello. Not sure if anyone is around. It is surprisingly hard to find a forum for this issue. Wanted to send this out into the void as my treatment is not going well.\n\nMy patches have spread to the back of my thighs, right below where my butt and thigh crease. I have huge dark patches of skin in my bikini area and the back of my thighs. The scratching is almost automatic sometimes. My bf tries to hit me gently when I scratch to remove my hand from the area. I feel so ashamed at how I practically beg to be allowed to scratch. I know I should not but it feels like I need to rip my skin off. \n\nI am only 25. I have had this for over 2 years now. I am feeling like I am out of options. I am using Vaseline and setting up another doctors appt. ", "Can lichen be red? Hey everyone. Have not been able to find a doctor who can find out what is wrong with me yet. \n\nI have been tested for everything under the sun, and all comes back negative. Was wondering if i might have lichen sclerosus.\n\nMy only symptoms are intense itching between labia majora and minora, usually caused by friction (walking a lot). \nAnd it looks like a dark red/irritated looking line? With what looks like tiny lesions/raised areas from irritation. It has made my life hell every day for the last 6 months, on and off. \n\nWas wondering if lichen can be red like this, instead of white like I have read about. Also, would it be better to see a derm instead of obgyn to diagnose? \nThank you! From my experience I had dark red skin and lines and itching and burning etc in the exact same spot as you, appearing like long deep cuts or splits. My skin peels and leaves the underside very raw and sore and I only knew I had white patches because my gyno told me I did on my perineum! \n\nSo in my experience, if its red like this, its because the skin has torn or peeled and its left it red raw. Mine was mistaken for a highly resistant strain of thrush for a long time because of this so it could well be! If you have not already, try suggesting lichen sclerosus to the next doctor you see and ask them to really consider the possibility! \n\nIts difficult to say because some OBGYN are familiar with LS and some dermatologists are too but then it can be the opposite. I personally was diagnosed by my Gyno but she is like super experienced with this stuff so it depends who you get, i would say gyno though personally.\n\nIn the mean time, i would keep the area dry from water but keep it moisturised using a non perfumed emollient or olive oil or something to prevent friction. Keep the area clean and avoid tight non-breathable clothing and underwear! \n\nHope this helps thank you so much. i am so sorry you have had to go through this! i have a feeling this might be what is going on with me too. docs have also been quick to think it is a weird strain of yeast on my vulva. \nthank you! :( &lt;3 Oh hell yes. Before white, can be red and irritated and angry. \n\nAnd as other poster said, doc does not necessarily know. I saw so many people that said I was a whiny bitch with a widdle yeast infection. \n\nSorry you are going through that itching and pain. I hope you can get a reasonable answer soon. thank you so much. i have another gyno appointment in november, and just made a derm appointment in january. i hope i can figure this out! your insight is very helpful. i am sorry you have gone through this too! Could certainly have redness and irritation with LS, especially with scratching or other friction, but I do not know about \"instead of\" white patches. But sometimes symptoms show up before any white patches have developed.\n\nA similar condition, lichen planus (LP) is classically red on the vulva, but sometimes shows up as white patches in the mouth. \n\nHave you been tested for allergies, or could it be an irritant? Any new soaps, laundry detergents, lotions, etc. around when this started? I have never gotten white patches and always have red areas where the itching is, so it is definitely possible! \n\nAnother poster pointed out that it really does depend on the doctor, so you could see if there are any at your obgyn office or a dermatologist who say they are familiar with it? I got lucky with my gyno so I have never had to do that kind of hunt. Good luck! Definitely! Mine is primarily red and raw, with a few pale (but not properly white) areas, which is why for a long time while it was very mild it kept being mistaken for dermatitis/contact dermatitis. Luckily my new GP is quite knowledgeable about gynecological issues! I am treating it now with clobetasol and am only two weeks into the three month treatment, but the itching has vanished and the rawness and redness is already lessening too, so definitely get to see a specialist/someone who knows if you can! Mine is pale at this point, but I have definitely had red patches earlier on. Look specifically for a \u201cpelvic specialist\u201d in your area or someone who deals with vulvodynia . As far as I know I have never know a dermatologist to diagnose VLS, but it very well may your best option. Yeah..mine is not white but it can also that you have another condition associated with linquen, that was partly my case, i had mine treated for more than a year as candida with no result, I used to treat for 15days but after less than a month that rideous itchness would begin again. AFTER ONE MORE YEAR I changed doctors and for all these wrong treatment i was diagnosed with liquen and was with a fungus infection assossiated with it caused by the previous wrong treatments.\nMy doctor also said there is a pattern of pacient with liquen to suffering with fungus assossiated illness.

Be cautious about asking for people\u2019s opinion is it LS and believe them if they tell you it is or it is not. It is something important for you and you should seek professional medical opinion (or opinions)on this. \n\nStruggle with getting diagnosis is real - even with doctors, but diagnosis can mean getting treatment you might need and it is worth going after. Being worried about LS is nightmare, and it might help if you focus your energy into research - looking for the right specialist.

Thanks a lot for responding! I appreciate it so much! But the problem is that no one even mentioned LS... No one on here (even a doctor) can give you a diagnosis for LS. You need a biopsy for that. I had to see many specialist before one gynecologist finally gave me a biopsy and gave me the diagnosis. Reddit is not a good source to help you figure this out.

I have had issues with tearing after sex, wiping after pee, but no real white scarring or loss of anatomy. I think it is a low estrogen issue, but I digress. So I started clob ointment 2.5 weeks ago and have started tapering down.\n\nAlmost immediately I started experiencing tightness in my chest a few days after starting ointment. I thought I went to hard on my workouts and eased into yoga instead. 9 days in, it became painful to breathe like my airways were swollen. \n\nWent to urgent care. EKG, chest x-ray, lymph nodes were not swollen, and d dimer blood results came back normal. I was advised to take it easy and not to workout over the next week or so.\n\nFast forward to 2 weeks after starting clob. I did not put my ointment on Sunday night this week, and Monday I felt like 60% back to my old self again. Used the ointment Monday night, and within 30 minutes of using it.. my chest tightness came back fill force and I thought I needed to go to the ER. I dealt with it, and was happy I woke up Tuesday.\n\nDid not use ointment Tuesday, and today I feel like 80% my old self. \n\nThere is got to be a connection, right?\nCalled and spoke with my doctor office\u2019s triage nurse. She said it is unlikely, but she will pass it along to the on call doctor.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\nTLDR: Am I the only one that has trouble breathing after using clob ointment? Yikes, maybe you are allergic? I definitely would not use it again unless you get medical advice that it is safe. Maybe try the estrogen cream and if necessary, tacrolimus instead. Thank you, it definitely crossed my mind \ud83d\ude2c\n\nI will ask about estrogen cream I think! Hi there. This is not a documented side effect in the medical literature. That said, you could be experiencing a rare undocumented side effect or an allergic reaction. I cannot determine which it is, but one thing folks do if they have an allergic reaction to an ingredient in the base is to have the Clob compounded in different base. For those who are genuinely allergic to the Clob and not the base ingredients, typically they will try you on a different steroid (there are numerous options), or, if steroids cannot be tolerated, calcineurin inhibitors can be prescribed. This sounds super scary, I am so sorry you had to experience this. I hope the doctor calls you back soon and is helpful Thank you, i will definitely be asking about allergies to the base vs the actually clob. \n\nI am just hoping they can find a solution! \ud83d\ude05 There are a lot of options out there, your doctor just needs to be knowledgeable and willing to think outside the box. Fingers crossed Update: Doctor\u2019s office called and said to stop using until follow up appointment next month. Thank you everyone that commented!! Holy carp. I would ask for a different steroid or protopic ointment asap", "No clitoral stimulation; too much scar tissue Hi, everyone! \nI (25f) was diagnosed a few years ago after telling my doctor that I had never had an orgasm, and could not really feel any pleasure at all. To make a long story short, it turns out that my clitoris is completely fused underneath scar tissue. \n\nI have been using clob ointment for a long time, and it does not seem to be doing much in the way of uncovering my clit. I had a surgery in May 2019, but within a week the tissue had grown back. \n\nOn the bright side, I recently started seeing a new doctor who I have a lot of faith in, and I might end up getting plastic surgery if my insurance covers it (this was her own suggestion). \n\nBut I am wondering if anyone else here has dealt with lack of clitoral stimulation. The only way I can even begin to feel pleasure is with excessive, hard grinding (with sheets on my own, or with my ex, who was my only ever partner, on his stomach. He did not like that, because apparently it got old really quickly. But he also did not like the fact that I have vaginismus as well, so I was just a useless impenetrable object that he could not even turn on with oral sex.)\n\nI still have never had an orgasm. I do not think I have to explain how that makes me feel. \n\nHas anyone had any success with overcoming this specific issue? What are some surgeries you have had? Did they work? What was your experience like? I am sorry you are going through this. I was diagnosed about 10 years ago and it was only because I switched my OBGYN. By this time my clitoris had ulcerated. I used clob ointment and was never given the option to have surgery. I also feel the ointment does not help. Penetration was super painful and my libido was at an all time low. My first orgasm happened when I started using vibrators. That was all that worked after ALOT of foreplay. And not during penetration. I have now moved on to doing penetration with the vibrator on my clit at the same time and i have finally had an orgasm together with my boyfriend. It took a lot of time and a whole lot of patience but we have finally gotten there. So I guess my advice would be explore toys I do not have an anecdote for this as the clob worked to heal my clit fusion. I really just wanted to say good luck on the surgery and good riddance to that asshat - you sound like a sweet girl and he can suck an elf. Hi! I do not know if this might help but I had my first orgasm in my mid twenties after using a vibrator from Hot Octopus. I got the Queen Bee because it had two sides with deep vibration technology, one side had a ridiculously gentle pulse, which is what I needed at first, and the other had stronger pulses which I was able to use over time. I checked the website and unfortunately, they do not sell the Queen Bee anymore. If too much stimulation is the problem, I would look into a similar model. If what you need is stimulation, the world is your oyster, just make sure to find a body safe model. Rechargeable toys are worth the investment.\n\nThis made a world of difference and I can still use it even when I am having a flare-up. I hope this is helpful but bodies are all so different. Good luck!!! Thank you so much for your comment! \nI used a vibrator once, and it felt like I was being torn open, and I was in pain for days afterwards. I have not used one since. But maybe it is time to try it again/try a new one! Hi, I am so sorry you going through this. I did request surgery from my gynecologist but he dismissed it. (Possible because he thinks the tissue will grow back). \n\nAlthough I have read a few girls have had successful surgery followed by laser treatment to help with their condition. Has your new gyno mentioned that this surgery will be different from your last ? \n\nI really do hope it all works out for you, keep us updated if you go ahead with the surgery Thank you for your comment! I am scared of vibrators, since the one time I tried using one it tore the scar tissue over my clitoris, and I was in pain for days :/ It was on a low setting, too! Aww, thank you so much for your comment! I am on club ointment now (I was using cream before, and that did not do much). I think I have seen a minuscule bit of improvement with the ointment since it absorbs faster. I hope I am not just imagining it. Thank you so much for your reply! \nThe surgery I had back in summer 2019 was a small incision meant to remove the excess tissue; by the time I had stopped bleeding from the surgery it had grown back. I do not think I was instructed properly in aftercare, either. \nThis new doctor mentioned plastic surgery instead, so it would be reconstructing the area. She did not go into much detail about it, but I will be seeing her again in mid-January and hopefully we will discuss if that is an option for me. Pls answer my dms I am in a similar situation to you but from a doctor\u2019s error.  On top of scar tissue I now have nerve damage and my clit does not function at all.  No pleasure.  After spending thousands on therapies and treatments nothing works.  I am going to a vulvodynia doctor to see if they can break up the fibrosis tissue as well as put my clitoris back into place.  It is hidden and stuck in my body.  No arousal feeling either.  It is been a nightmare.  Almost a year like this.  Lmk if you find anything that works for you and I will do the same. Oh, I am so sorry. That is so frustrating! \n\nI ended up having reconstructive plastic surgery in June, and visually-speaking, there has been a big improvement. I should be able to feel more sensation. \n\nHOWEVER. Right when I was healed enough to start experimenting, I went on an antidepressant that causes anorgasmia. Now I feel even less sensation than I did before my surgery. My doctors are sure that this is the cause, but I was terrified that there had been nerve damage. I will not know for certain until I am taken off of this antidepressant, and who knows how long that will be? Either way, I am still living with minimal (if any) pleasure. \n\nWe deserve better than this. I wish we could just get a clitoral transplant at this point.  After all it is an organ.  Too bad doctor\u2019s do not study it.  \ud83d\ude21 Also may I ask which doctor you went to for reconstructive surgery?  I cannot seem to find any that deal with scar tissue. I saw a plastic surgeon in Boston. I was referred to him by my dermatologist (also in Boston).", "Have any LS patients had a biopsy that was tested for Lyme disease? So, I am curious how many LS patients have had a biopsy to diagnose their LS and also have had that biopsy tested for Lyme disease.\n\nI have formatted this post as a survey because I am very curious about people's answers, but I would also love to discuss the topic further with other interested people here.\u00a0 I have a hard time understanding how anybody with LS might not be interested in learning more about or discussing possible root causes for LS, but people are funny :)\n\nScientific evidence supporting the link between LS and Lyme disease has been growing for decades.\u00a0 However, the Borrelia bacteria which are thought to be the cause of Lyme disease have proven to be difficult to detect in the blood or urine samples of patients when standard methods are used.\u00a0 Studies have found that tissue samples on the other hand, tend to be a more reliable source material for detecting evidence of Borrelia in the body - especialy in patients with LS.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere are some links to peer reviewed journal articles which discuss and provide evidence for the possible link between LS and Lyme disease.\u00a0 The first artice I have linked was submitted to the publisher in 1992 and the title is:\u00a0\n\n\"Further Evidence for\u00a0Borrelia burgdorferi\u00a0Infection in Morphea and Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus Confirmed by DNA Amplification\"\n\nNote that the first word in the title is FURTHER.\u00a0 As you can see, this was not a new idea even in 1992.\u00a0 Also, because this first article is so old, they use an outdated term for LS and refer to the disease as lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.. Just in case anybody was confused by that at first like I was.\n\nThe last thing I would like to mention is that the final link is not realy to a peer reviewed article, but it contains references to a number of peer reviewed studies which discuss the possible link between LS and Lyme.\u00a0 I often find many of the journal articles I read by looking at the references in articles I am already reading.. It can be a helpful way to find additional relevant info on the topic you are interested in.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n( Do any of you that have had biopsies have any reason to suspect having Lyme disease, other than the poasible link with LS?  I am very curious what kinds of results people here would get if they had their biopsies tested for evidence of Lyme disease.  \n\nWhen I taked to the doctor who diagnosed my LS about the possible link between LS and Lyme and showed them some of the research suporting that link, they agreed that I should try to get my biopsy taken out of the archive to be tested for Lyme.  \n\nI would imagine most doctors would have a similar reaction if presented with the same scenario. Ok my mind is blown. I need to look further into this. I had lyme testing about 8 months ago prior to me finding out about the lichen.  I was told that the results were negative. I was going to get a second opinion but I let it go. Fast forward several months later I start having lichen symptoms so I get checked out and was advised that she was sure that it was lichen but I need a biopsy to be sure. The doctor gave me cream for it. Have to schedule the biopsy but now in thinking I need to go to that lyme specialist like I intended.\n\nThank you for this Your story sounds a lot like mine.  I was also pretty mind blown when I learned of this possible link.  After I got diagnosed with LS and learned about the possible link to Lyme I felt like I had finally found the one missing puzzle piece that I needed to figure out this complicated and painful health puzzle I have been trying to solve for years.  Lyme disease would explain all my other heath issues that doctors have never been able to figure out for me.  And now I understand why my blood test could have come back negative even if I had Borrelia bacteria in my lymphnodes or other parts of my body.\n\nI had a negative blood test for Lyme a few years before my lichen sclerosus was diagnosed.  I actually had one of my abnormal inguinal (groin/waist area) lymphnodes biopsied a few years back also.  The final diagnosis on that was dermatopathic lymphadenitis of unknown origin or cause.  I was left with no way to try and treat it because the underlying cause is what determines the type of treatment prescribed. \n\nAfter being diagnosed with LS, learning about the possible link between LS and Lyme, and learning more about Lyme disease I have decided to try and get that lymphnode biopsy tested for Lyme since I didnt have a genital biopsy to diagnose my LS.  \n\nI have come to learn that testing for Lyme disease is a real tricky thing.  If you read the material in the links I provided, you will see that even testing for Lyme in tissue samples has sometimes given mixed results.  That why people have been trying to develop other methods or techniques to detect it.  I think I am going to see if I can convince one of my doctors to have somebody in the pathology dept. learn how to perform focus floating microscopy (FFM) so they can do both PCR &amp; FFM on my lymphnode tissue sample to test for Lyme (assuming they still have enough material left in the sample to do both additional tests).", "Skin texture question Wondering how LS affects skin texture. I am a 26M and I have developed mild phimosis and the top part (opposite side of frenulum) of my foreskin has started to thicken and develop small hard lumps with what looks/feels like mild scarring. Rubbing my finger on the skin it is not smooth, but is a bit rough. The lumps are under the skin and appear white when pressed. I also have a few small firm raised bumps that are red. There are not any obvious white patches but when the skin it stretched it appears whiter. I do not have any itching. Is this typical of LS?\n\nPics here:  I would see a dermatologist. You are describing a number of symptoms which fit with penile LS. Not necessarily conclusive in themselves but they certainly warrant professional investigation. I wish you all the best.", "Steroid withdrawal Let me start off by saying I do not have a confirmed diagnosis yet. My derm has no clue what I have. \n\nI read here that clobestol (apparently a high potent steroid) is what is used on a regular basis. Twice everyday first and then on a regular basis later. However, I read about topical steroid withdrawal (also known as Red skin syndrome) and that it might take months/years to get better from that. \n\n(\n\nSo my question is, how is everyone combating this? I dunno if I am getting worried about it too early. But i would like to suffer from just one condition, not two. Thanks in advance. Im pretty sure that properly tapering down dosage frequency should make this not an issue.  You can always taper down more slowly if your body seems like its telling you to. Yes, this is why it is important to not go \"cold turkey\" with steroids You take every steroid this way. I took oral steroids last year, started with 5 pills the first day and tapered down to one every other day until they were gone. Same with steroid creams. The goal is to get you to a point where you are only using clobetasol frequently enough to prevent a flare up but first you have to get rid of the present flare up. Steroid withdrawal would most likely happen if you tapered off too quickly. My dosage was every day for six weeks, every other day for six weeks, then twice per week in perpetuity.  There should not be withdrawal because you are just continuing to take it, but if you ever do get off, make sure to taper.\n\n\n\nRed Skin Syndrome, however, is not a withdrawal, it is a side effect of high dose steroids over a long period of time.  That is one of the reasons that it is important to taper to a maintenance dose and not use Clobetisol excessively.  It is also why you or your partner (assuming you or your partner are male) should use a condom for intercourse as the person who does not need the topical steroid should not be directly exposed to it or they could suffer the effects, as well.\n\n\n\nEssentially, taper down to the maintenance dose, only use the amount you absolutely need when applying it, and limit contact to others or other parts of your own body. This might seem like a stupid question. But if you dont put on steroid cream before sex, it should be fine right? Or showering before sex? I generally am careful about sex for about 24 hours following application to be certain.", "What style of waxing should I choose? I have VLS. I have never tried waxing, I am considering sugaring right now. What should I mention to the aesthetician and what style would irritate me the least? I am okay with leaving some hair, but do they trim it? I have only done sugaring and have been very happy. I do not get everything removed and i personally trim the rest but some places would probably do it too. Just ask. Thank you! Do you ask for a certain style like bikini line or french, or explain it in your words? Sorry, I am just nervous not to get a flare! I get a bikini. I told the girl about what was going on so she was aware. I have gotten the whole thing done when I have been in a total remission and it did not induce a flare. Thank you so much! i used to wax before my issues, def recommend bikini I did it! Really happy with the results. I have done many full Brazilian waxes with LS and never had a problem. I might skip it if I am in the middle of a flare though", "Where can I find - \"Lichen Sclerosis beating the disease\" by Ginny Chandoha Hi, I have read a lot about this, and that book is the only one that suggest any different method than corticosteroids or surgery. I have been trying to find it for a week now, however I was not able to. The only place where it is available is amazon, but there is like 150$ shipping fee to my country. Sadly it is not available for Kindle, Audible or in any other online form.  \n\n\nIf someone know where can I purchase it as an ebook, pdf, epub, please post below or message me the online store. Also if someone who owns it, thinks he might be able to share it with me, I will be extremely thankful (ofc I will pay).", "What are people\u2019s thoughts on the NSFW pics? In my opinion I prefer when someone adds a link in the text, and then we can choose whether or not we would like to see the picture. I personally cannot bare to look at my own vagina out of depression, let alone others. However I do understand people seek others opinions on whether or not something looks like LS, but personally I think it should be a choice to see the pic. What are your thoughts? \n\nAll opinions welcome. I would say that this is without a doubt the one sub that as I scroll through makes me go \"holy shit\".  I have considered commenting or complaining before, but it is what the sub is about and makes perfect sense. Either I hide NSFW, unsub, or accept that this is where I will be getting my dick pics (and vagina pics) from, like it or not. I have a setting turned on that blurs the pics with the NSFW setting and then I know it is my choice to click through and see. Before that I was slapped in the retinas with some pics I did not expect.\n\nAnd yeah, I (46F) dread looking at my own undercarriage because of this disease so have not looked at the pics for the most part. It is kind of hard to talk about this condition without them :-/ I have seriously considered unsubbing because if it. I have my account set to blur anything with a nsfw tag but not everyone uses them and its so very unplesant to be presented with a strangers asshole penis or vag. Personaly I would love to see a bad on \"does this look like LS\" posts.

You can change this in your settings, I can only see the pictures if I click on them! But I think it is important for people  to  be able to post a picture about it, sometimes it can be hard to describe symptoms just with words, with a visual it helps! I agree, I feel that they could add a link in text like some people do though I honestly think that the photos should not be allowed. I understand that people might want to post photos, but no one here is a doctor. And even though we have the rule that the photos must be listed as NSFW, only about half the posters notice it. \n\nI just do not think they are useful enough to keep them.", "Male - Finally seen a consultant, pretty dejected After months on the waiting list to see a derm on the NHS I have coughed up the money to see a private urologist. He confirmed it is LS but was pretty blas\u00e9 about it. He does not think it is that bad at the moment, but stated that being circumcised in 5 - 10  years is \u2018inevitable\u2019. When I asked him if there was any chance of the white patches going away, he plainly stated \u201cno, it is scar tissue\u201d.\n\nHe was not even particularly bothered about me using steroid cream. He just told me to dry the area with a hair dryer after showers and rub in Vaseline. Maybe use a light steroid cream intermittently.

Does anyone else have it on their anal region? Mine spreads up the crack. Is this common?\n\nAlso has anyone tried a gluten free diet or zinc supplements? Hi! Yes there is where I have mine. I had mine in the anal, vulvar and clitoral area. It is a lot better since starting treatment. I would say 90% better now after 7 weeks of using clobetasol.\n\nOnly thing I changed from my diet is coffee and alcohol because I found myself very anxious. I really do not suspect it improved my LS though, I think all the improvement is from the clobetasol. Yup I have the anogenital variety also.  Havent tried the stuff you mentioned though.  \n\nI get small little tears on my anus and itching all up and down my crack that is usually worse at night.  No depigmentation or other changes to the skin back there for me though.  \n\nI was initailly diagnosed with LS because of the depigmentation and other symptoms on my penis and then I realized that my symptoms on my backside (which had preceded the symptoms on my penis)  could be attributed to LS also.\n\n\nI didnt start treating my backside until quite a while after I began treatment on the front, cuz it took me a while to figure out the connection, but treating it has helped a lot.  \n\nYou may need a different type or strength of topical for your anus vs the rest of the body, so talk to your dr. about it.  Good luck! I see! Thanks, so you cut out coffee completely? \nMy vulva is getting color back and I credit clob. ointment for sure. Hoping I get the color on my booty back lol Actually, the carnivore diet I did for a while was totally gluten free. That gave me all kinds of overall improvements in my physical and mental health but it didnt actually cure/treat the underlying cause of any of my various mysterious health issues. Thank you! I feel like the skin on my butt crack is probably more sensitive to the steroid ointment so getting a different prescription strength would be very beneficial. Thanks so much for the tip! \u263a\ufe0f I see, I know stress is a trigger for me. It sucks that there is no dietary \u201ccure\u201d but I am sure having better health would alleviate stress which would help flares. Ya, plus you also have to consider the fact that topicals applied directly to the outside of your anus will absorb into your bloodstream much more readily compared to topicals applied to other external surfaces of your body. In other words you can get more significant systemic effects (or side effects) from topicals on the anus. Oh snap, this is good to know. Thank you stranger \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Exactly!  You know how it works. Yes, ugh, it sucks, sorry. \n\nI have been gluten-free for a few years now and yes, it helps me. When I tried to manage two weeks back on bread to do a celiac test, I did not make it two weeks. The headaches came back first. Then horrible fatigue. My gut, oh, man, no. Then my knees hurt so much I could hardly walk, then my hands curled up in pain, and then LS went boooooonkers. I limped in after ten days and had them take my blood and then I quit eating wheat again. Not worth it. Negative result, do not care. \n\nI have a couple flares a year, but it is quite well managed with a couple days of clobetasol at that point most of the time. \n\nIf I get super stressed, or sometimes when I travel, or when I eat wheat, I get thrown off course, and get a nasty flare. I cannot prove that GF is a cure for anything, just that my body has had a very good response. Good enough to give up proper pizza and beer for eight years now.  And I do think it links to the whole inflammatory thing that is related to autoimmune crap that is related to LS. How exactly, I do not think we know, but the link seems to exist. See this is my same thought process. I will do anything to reduce the flares and slow progression. So you had it on your anal area? Mine runs up my actual crack and I am worried that it will progress and branch outward. When diagnosed, I had a very clear figure-eight: white, then purple, skin around both the vagina and the anus. It was awful. Just one unholy mess everywhere. \n\nIf flared I can crack open and bleed either in the vulva or I can crack anally. It f*cking hurts. Got To move those bowels with silent tears in a public bathroom sometimes. It is utter torture for a few days when that happens. I do not know if it is considered a fissure or what, just that there is a lot of blood and pain and it is during a flare. \n\nIt always heals though. If there is any scarring there, I do not see it. I only have scarring on the labia, where they are considerably shortened. Everything else looks normal when not-flared. I have not had the figure eight in full since diagnosis. \n\nIf I am having a flare (itching, burning, tearing) and it seems inclined to be everywhere, I do use a small bit of clobetasol externally there. I do not pop it inside the rectum at all ever. And I only do it a couple times. It has been enough. \n\nIf you have a bad crack there it is still worth discussing with your doctor. You can get unrelated anal fissures that may not heal on their own. I knew someone who literally needed a stitch (and then was fine). You may need to use stool softeners for a while to let it heal, or it may be a different problem altogether. I find that anal LS really is external for me \u2014 not internal, not a long crack usually, just smallish external tears. Quite painful, especially for a bowel movement, but not a structural issue. A longer crack, especially if it is into the rectum, is something to have a super-fun visit with a doc about. Cracks that are just like vulva cracks from LS that respond quickly to clobetasol? Probably just more LS, yay. I have a figure 8 too! I do not have any cracks really, but tears on my perineum (and constantly!). I mean like my LS goes in and up my butt crack \ud83d\ude14 it is red there right now but closer to my vulva, it is white. My vulva is getting color back with clob use twice weekly for maintenance though! I will say though, A+D helps after bowel movements! You can try that :-) Yeah, I feel a lot less anxious and tense. I think my first flare was brought on by stress so I have been trying to take measures to stop being so worked up.\n\nI think my colour def improved too in the last 2 weeks a lot! Not as pale, it looks pink and more lively now. My boyfriend says it looks the best it is been since my diagnosis. So hang in there :) Yes very common to have ls in the anal area. during my first flare everything was swollen and it felt like my cheeks grew together. Did not realize it was ls in the butt crack. I moisturize there, use baby wipes after a poop. I had fierce itching once and used clob there-huge mistake bc it is too strong and burned for days. Stress is a factor. I have not done much w my diet but read many people do well with a low oxalate diet. Haha I relate so hard to this it made me laugh because I put the clob there yesterday and my crack was on fire!! Might have to get a lower percentage bc my clob is super strong. Stress is a major factor for me. I know stress causes inflammation I am happy your color is coming back! \u263a\ufe0f it is always nice to see progress. Also, feel free to message me whenever. I know this disease is really debilitating in more ways than one, and it is nice to have people to relate to! Yes it burned like crazy. After 3 days of that I was going nuts and called my bf nurse friend in tears who suggested it was too strong. I used cortisone ointment and aquaphor and it stopped burning and cleared up. Seems like everyday is a new complication to be managed. LS is the longest game of tag. Haha so true unfortunately Mine is worse on the anal area. There is a large amount of discoloration. The itching is unbearable there.", "Found this helpful ", "bought a jar of emuaid as an alternative treatment i am about two months into a resistant flare-up of LS affecting both my vulva and anus. i did all of my usual stuff: started clob, cut out sugar, sitz baths. i am already underwear-free, using unscented products, the whole thing. i was in remission for many years, so this has been extremely frustrating. the pain the itch; you all know what i mean. \n\nthe clob has provided some relief, but has not cleared it entirely and it is not healing as quickly as it has in the past. so, i did some searching on here and other LS forums and decided to shell out the cash for (\n\ni am hoping this will provide some relief from this stubborn flare and maybe heal my fissure. \n\ntonight is the first time i will apply it and i will report back here in case anyone is curious. i plan on applying it 3 times a day as directed on the jar. \n\nif anyone has any experience that has not commented on the other threads, i would be keen to hear how this worked for you.", "Does it get worse before it gets better? I was diagnosed with LS Monday, after years of intermittent discomfort (flares I guess) that culminated in very regular discomfort over this past year that finally drove me to the doctor. I am on clob, but I am wondering if maybe I am doing it wrong or something. I regularly get tearing during sex where my vaginal opening meets the perineum, but it usually heals and stops stinging after a day or two. Now with clob, I am not engaging in PIV sex, but the stinging does not seem to be getting better. It is like that area is constantly raw and irritated. Am I using too much clob, not enough, just need to wait it out? Thanks for any advice. You were just diagnosed on Monday? So I am assuming you have been on the clob for just a few days? If that is the case, it is definitely too early to see an effect. Sorry, but patience is the answer!\n\nTo stay more comfortable in the meantime, make sure you are wearing loose clothes and cotton underwear (or no underwear if possible). Sometimes a warm bath can help. You can also ask your doctor about lidocaine, it is a real life saver for me. I chose to decline Rx treatments when I was diagnosed with LS and instead made my own plant based salve which basically cured me and even gave me very rapid releif from my most uncomfortable symptoms .  Please see my latest post in the lichen sclerosus group from today", "Anyone find the steroid makes their skin look whiter or is my LS progressing fast as hell???? My skin looks so pale but like not white just so pale???? I do not know if it is the steroid or I am like legit losing colour of my vagina now :( I had a weird experience like this when I first started using it. I recommend you talk with your doctor of course but here is what happen to me. \n\nPrior to using meds my skin was super red, I had no whitening or flakey patches. I also had insane itch and did a really bad just controlling myself. I spent many a night with an ice pack between my legs, just to end up scratching anyways. \n\nSo when I started using Clob the itch went anyway almost immediately. About two weeks later my skin looked amazing, no longer inflamed, just normal skin. I was still getting tears though. So I kept using Clob and all of a sudden I started getting whitening in some places and flaky what patches where I typically get the worst itching. \n\nSo I thought it was the Clob so stopped using it right away. The white stayed though regardless of whether I was using the meds. I realize that I think the patches were always there, but a layer of skin was just always missing cause of scratching. It was not the Clob, but that the Clob had given my skin time to fully heal for the first time in so long that it was my first time seeing the patches. \n\nSo now that the skin has healed, I still get the white patches and they cycle though like any skin would. Getting bigger then flaking off then coming back. Hoping they are I will go away completely eventually? \n\nThat is just my experience, but maybe it resonates? I totally appreciate the detailed message and maybe that is in fact my case too. Can you take a look at my profile to see the recent pictures and if you resonate with them at all?? I think those white patches are basically scar tissue that has finally healed. At first they arent there because it was not ever allowed to heal.", "Managing symptoms? I was diagnosed about 6 months ago and I was told the only thing I can do is manage my symptoms by using a steroid cream. The past week I have been in complete agony even with the steroid and vagasil. Do any seasoned vets have advice on how I can manage my symptoms? I am finding it hard to work because it is screaming burning pain. Any advice would be much appreciated. Have you tried *not* using vagisil? It may be giving you problems. I would discontinue it. \n\nBurning pain is not something I normally experience. Tearing and stinging pain, itching, but not something I would generally describe as burning.  Could you have something else going on? Yeast or an STI? It is worth checking if the steroid has not helped and you are having pain that intense. Unless you see LS cracks and splits of skin happening right now that you know are definitely the source of the pain, I would see if you can get an STI screen just to be safe. \n\nOther things that have helped me are wearing a maxi dress in the summer with no underwear. Sometimes a few days of that just helps. Was not cool when my then-three-year-old pulled it up over his head at Starbucks, but otherwise it is been fine.  If no-underwear is impossible, I wear Undersummers- ultimate in granny panty style, but it puts zero pressure anywhere I do not want it, super comfy. Next best thing to naked. \n\nThis is a dumb one but I also get more pain if I am not drinking enough water. Not sure if this is a Thing or not. \n\nSometimes I put a towel in the bed and get a washcloth and fill it with ice cubes. I get the washcloth a little damp and then hold it where it hurts. Obviously only works at home. \n\nFirst step is quit using vagisil though. I hope you get some relief soon. Thanks for all the tips! I am thinking it might be a yeast infection but idk at this point. I doubt it is an STI, unless my boyfriend has something to tell me. \n\nI will stop the vagasil and just continue the steroid. \n\nThanks again! Just a heads up that STIs can rear their ugly heads *years* after initial infection. A great example of this is HSV (genital herpes). I wish I could get away with no underwear, but my regular discharge would make it pretty messy. The best I can do is cotton undies that are breathable. If the burning is only on the surface of the skin, try Desitin diaper cream. The purple box is 40% zinc oxide compared to a lower amount in the blue box I use a pure aloe vera gel between applications of the steroid ointment.  As close to natural as you can get. I have had it for about 3 years now and these are tips I would give someone new for management: \n\n1. Try to cut back on baths. The sitting water can really irritate the skin, and can cause itching. After showers, make sure to thoroughly dry the area. \n\n2. If you are a woman- try to avoid thongs when you can. The rubbing of fabric on the skin is an irritant and the trapped sweat can also irritate the LS. Let the skin air out when you can. \n\n3. Do not be afraid to tell your doctor if the steroid prescribed is not working. I had to go through 3 different types of cream before I found one that worked. \n\n4. During a flare up, it is okay to take Benadryl for itch control. This has been a life saver for me. \n\nLet me know if you need anything else! Happy to help I agree with a lot posted above..maxi dresses with no undies or loose shorts. Benadryl when it gets itchy or irritated. Keep it dry, clean and as sweat free as possible. My doc recommended washing off with a removable shower head after a shower to get any leftover soap or product off.\n\nI use emu oil or coconut oil when it feels dry and itchy. Sometimes that helps sometimes it does not. When it gets really irritated I find burts bees diaper cream (with zinc oxide) helps to keep the rubbing/chafing/burning down. \n\nYou may just want to get looked at if it is really bad and nothing seems to help. Something else could be going on too. I have one maxi skirt that I can wear without undies and it is a GODSEND. Whenever I have problems I will wear it for a day or two and it consistently helps. Do you have a favorite place to buy long dresses/skirts for going commando? I have struggled to find more that I like after snagging my first one at a thrift store. I feel you! They can be tricky to find, especially when you want them relatively inexpensive. I wear them around the house, I do not need anything fancy! I shop all over for them. I usually look on eBay, poshmark, old navy, Nordstrom rack, tjmaxx, and thrift stores. It is easier to filter by size and length on those websites. Some of my favorite ones, when I can find them used or on sale,  are by free people. They are usually made of just cotton or a natural fiber blend. (My body seems to be irritated by fabrics easily) Thank you!", "Has anyone had success with self unfusing? I have been on clobetasol in the past for LS in the clitoris area only. I have not had any symptoms in 2 years so I stopped the occasional clobetasol. I was dismayed to notice today that the skin is completely fused on one side and the entire clitoris is being enveloped all around. \n\nI want to know if anyone has had success gently unfusing themselves? I have read things like baths and massage can help but Im literally thinking of using the clobetasol for a week straight then trying to manually force the skin apart little by little.", "Is this Lichen or balantis? Dry ring around foreskin when pulled back, cuts also appear on 'banjo' after sex. Tried steroid, anti bac and anti fungal cream and nothing is working.  You can see the ting ring around the foreskin when I pull it back, it is acting like a rubber band. When flaccid this also gets dry and itchy during the day. I am washing 1/2 day minimum with water. I have tried all the creams and nothing is helping to relive this. Sometimes the skin turns flakey and will peel away. Also the 'banjo' tears frequently during sex making it impossible without lube, otherwise it just becomes painful. Have you seen a doctor or dermatologist? That looks incredibly painful, sorry that this is happening to you. Go see a dermatologist. This looks very similar to what I experienced before getting my diagnosis. They will probably do a biopsy (not a pleasant experience but well worth it) and then you will be prescribed an extra strong steroid cream. It will fix you right up. Do not worry. I have been there and I am totally fine now. Does your foreskin get stuck there? If so, that is called paraphimosis and it is a medical emergency. \n\n\"**Balanitis** xerotica obliterans\" is another name for LS. Balanitis in general just means inflammation of the tip of the penis (and often foreskin) so you could have balanitis caused by LS, but that probably would not be the most likely cause. The flaking sounds maybe like psoriasis, which can also cause balanitis. But many other things can cause it. \n\nWas the steroid you tried a prescription one? If not, you might need something stronger than what is available OTC. Weak steroids are probably not enough for LS or psoriasis. They could also make things worse if it is actually an infection. Regardless, I would try to see a doctor as soon as you can. Hope you feel better soon.", "Diagnosed with LS today during physical exam I have had some pretty significant changes to my labia in the last several months and had an appointment today concerning a dark patchy area. I saw an OBGYN a year ago who basically thought I was ridiculous for thinking I had LS, but this time the OBGYN brought it up herself and pointed at places where my labia minor had receded as a result of going untreated. She is putting me on a 6 week regimen of a high dose clobetasol ointment and then possibly another 6 week course before a maintenance dosage. \n\nAs for the dark patch, she says it is something *not* typically seen with LS and did a 5mm punch biopsy. \n\nCan LS be diagnosed with just a physical exam? She seemed to feel very confident to go ahead and diagnose it. Mine was diagnosed by 2 separate doctors, my family doc and a clinic doc when I went in due to a possible uti. Ended up not being a uti and clinic doc put me on clobetasol right away as my family doc wanted to wait the 7 months for the specialist to see it untreated. \n\nMy results were back just about 2 weeks ago with \"non-specific cells\". So visibly diagnosed due to the white patch I had and some minor majora structure change. I go back in 6 months to the specialist to get looked at again. I was diagnosed by two different doctors by just an exam but 12 years later i was having trouble and they wanted to make that all it was and I had a biopsy and it was LS and eczema and my lips have fused somewhat and half have disappeared. But it has not gotten any worse just get flairs ups on occasion. My gyno said he would bet money I did not have LS due to my age (32) but he did the biopsy at my insistence. Guess what came back positive for lichen?? Every doc is different. If you are at all doubtful, a biopsy will tell with 100% certainty. Sorry curious about this doc's opinion, 32 was too young or too old? My onset was late teen years. I was diagnosed by a specialist gyno who focused on dermatology. At the time (15 years ago) she diagnosed me visually with a microscope and stated on meds and physio right away. Said I did not need a biopsy to cause more scarring as I was affected badly already. I have used betaderm for maintenance for past decade and other than slightly more itching monthly with my period, no flares so I have never second guessed the diagnosis. Too young according to him. Most women with LS are post-menopausal, and in their 60\u2019s My doctor was convinced I had LS just from an exam. (At the time, I was not even having itchiness.) We eventually did the biopsy, which came back completely normal. She was still convinced I had LS. It is been years now, and I am still being treated for LS. One or two other doctors have independently remarked on the possibility of LS also, without looking at my chart, just based on exams. Mine got diagnosed during an IUD check and she asked me if I was itchy, which I really was not. I assumed the bleaching was from a lube I used but when I went back I told my other doctor it felt like skin tearing and I had rectal bleeding so be did a punch biopsy out of precaution. It came back very mild but positive. It is the same exact spot I ripped during childbirth years ago but it is very well controlled now! Mine was by a dermatologist. Which was weird to me because you could not really see anything except fissures but I had explained my symptoms and he was like \"yup LS\" and I was on clobetasol for 4 weeks daily, then 4 weeks every other day, then for 4 weeks once a week and now I use it maybe once every 2 months if I get a flair up. I seem to have gotten LS after the copper IUD. I am wondering are they linked due to the hormonal imbalances the coil can cause despite being hormone free. I had Mirena and I HATED it. For the first time ever in almost thirty years I had migraines (plus the kind that blocked my vision with auras), my hair fell out in massive patches and then I got diagnosed with LS. That was all within a year. I got out my mirena and I have not had a single migraine since which was back in February. My hair is completely back to normal and my LS is well controlled (I barely use clob). I think it was the silicone causing an autoimmune flare up. My only issue now is that I have really dry eyes and I am hoping that is from the pill which I am about to get off to and be on nothing \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc Apologies in advance bc this is long and probably overly detailed. I have spent too much time researching LS in medical journals so I am prone to word-vomiting informaiton. My doc is considering doing an LS biopsy on me, but I have a long history of sex pain that makes me hesitant to get stiches if I do not need them, so I have spent a long time researching how necessary it is to get a biopsy to reach a diagnosis. (FWIW I am pro-biopsy and probably going to do one soon)\n\nAlthough a biopsy can diagnose LS it cannot always definitively rule it out. Sometimes an LS biopsy can come back with a false negative. This mostly happens in younger patients. The biopsy often fails to meet all diagnostic criteria early in the course of the disease, even in patients who eventually progress to meet all criteria on future biopsies. It is a shame because those patients would have really benefitted from early use of topical steroid medication to prevent progression. So the clinical examination is equally important. Even if your doctor had done a specific LS biopsy and it came back negative, there is a good chance it would not have changed your treatment plan. LS is a pretty distinctive condition that some doctors can initially diagnose on sight. Based on your labia shrinkage, which I \\*think\\* is unique to LS in premenopausal people,  I think your doctor made the right call! It seems like you have progressed to the point where LS is the obvious diagnosis.\n\nBased on ( (\"The Real Need for Biopsy in Suspected Lichen Sclerosus\" posted by Rebecca Dale of ST2 general surgery) it seems like the most important reason to get a biopsy is to rule out malignancy. Your doctor took a biopsy for that purpose anyway so you are covered! With LS, the 2 most important things are to start steroids as soon as possible and to screen for cancer. People with LS-type symptoms usually get diagnosed with either LS, lichen planus (a similar condition), hormone-related vaginal atrophy, or precancerous tissue changes. Precancerous changes are being ruled out with your biopsy, hormonal conditions can be ruled out based on age/symptoms or hormone blood tests, and lichen planus usually presents with distinct symptoms like blisters, bleeding, and involvement of vaginal tissue. Even if your doctor was wrong with this initial tentative diagnosis and you end up having lichen planus, LP requires the exact same steroid cream as LS, so I am pretty confident that you are getting the treatment you need. Besides, maybe the punch biopsy will be evaluated for LS in addition to other conditions like malignancy. The pathologist who looks at it should be familiar with all kinds of vulvar epithelial abnormalities and they will report back whatever they see. LS started in 2018 when I had my IUD put it. I got an infection and had it removed 2 weeks later. They tried so hard to convince me to keep it and the pain and itchiness was so bad. Ever since, I had LS and Bacterial Vaginitis. IUDs are evil. I am curious to know your biopsy results. I had two punches taken and they have told me I have eczema and that it does not look like LS. My entire life I have never had an inner Labia, and now that I have been having a fiery vagina they suspected LS and biopsied me. I do not have any tears or white patches. I am a little confused about my diagnosis honestly. The biopsy confirmed the LS. I am so sorry you are having such discomfort. I hope you get answers soon! So it shows LS directly? Not eczema? Thank you! Hope you are feeling ok ! Yes", "Help . I am at my wits end. I have not been officially diagnosed with LS only vaginal dermatitis. But, I am certain I have LS. I have been suffering for years. Toilet paper is pretty much ruining my life. My most recent flare up is a beast! It will not go away. I went to the Dr and she prescribed me a super high steroid cream, I diligently used for 2x daily for 2 weeks. Almost immediately after stopping the steroid my symptoms returned. I am going insane. I plan on another visit ASAP... but, does anyone have any helpful ideas. I did send for some Bamboo paper as 7th generation and some of the others are no longer working for me... I do not use laundry soap on my underwear only scalding hot water.. I do not use soap on my ladybits or bubble baths etc. I seriously feel crazy right now. Have you purchased a bidet attachment for your toilet seat yet? There are some with an extra \"female\" spray nozzle to wash after you pee. You could greatly reduce your contact with toilet paper that way. Amazon sells them for under $100. I have been using CBD oil and found that topically applied it has been helpful. Soothes the itch. Seems to help with inflammation. Worth a try? Do not stop the steroids all at once... try tapering them off I have not even thought of that! Thank you! My OBGYN told me pure coconut oil, which I have been using. It helps momentarily. I was reading another thread thAt said CBD as well. Thanks! Ok. I am legit going crazy. I am so frustrated and very worried as well. I have been dealing with this for about 6 years and we have always been able to get it under control. To add to the above, you can get an OTC steroid, if you found that the stronger steroid helped. Did you see a dermatologist bc I would start there. There is also CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser you can use to help with the dryness/itching. Given how crazy it is making you - have you tried an anti-inflammatory diet?\n\nSuper difficult, a major PITA, absolutely no fun at the holidays, and not something you probably want to do long term.  But if you are in this much agony over an inflammatory / probably autoimmune condition, it might be worth doing for a time. If you get noticeably better, you would want to follow slow, careful reintroduction protocols and watch for what gets you. \n\nAre your underwear cotton?  And I assume they are not thongs?\n\nDo you wear hard or tight pants?  I wore dresses for about a year once because my body just would not tolerate pants. Jeans rubbing all day? Absolutely no.\n\nHave you treated for yeast just in case? Without a diagnosis of LS, do not eliminate other possible sources of misery.  Even if you have tested negative in the past, if you tolerate the treatment, might be worth trying.  Also ask doc to do a full STD scan, if they have not already - the moment of embarrassment is uncomfortable, but not as uncomfortable as years of suffering. \n\nThis may sound silly, but if you have been beat up by life, have a history of trauma, our bodies have problems. Not fair, but this is something that stress can help to trigger. Meditation might be worth a try.  Headspace is available as an app for the phone. Just taking a few minutes out of every day to sit and breathe can maybe give your body some space it needs to take care of itself.  It is no quick miracle cure, but it can be part of a process of healing.   \n\nI hope you find some relief. To piggyback on this, I find that an oral CBD oil tincture is helpful for general inflammation.  It certainly helps my asthma, and I suspect it helps LS.  If you are in a legal state, you can get a mostly-CBD-but-tiny-bit-of-THC tincture as a dropper. Absolutely does not make you high, not even a little bit.  There is way too much hype - it does not cure everything.  I tried it for migraines and it does not help that at all for me.  But surprisingly, it calms asthma for sure, and I am pretty sure it helps LS.  My LS flares are in slow-motion compared to asthma, though, so it is a lot harder to be certain what helps or hurts! My doctor recommended I use Vaseline. You can put it on after every time you pee if you want. I do not use it that often, but it does seem to help when I have a flare-up. For me, the steroids do not seem to help immediately when I am having symptoms (I use mine 3x/week, per my doctor). Vaseline, on the other hand, seems to give a little immediate relief most of the time. I was using Vaseline and it did help with relief, then my Dr asked that I only use coconut oil. The baseline provided more relief. I just wish I could get this flare up under control. It is taking over my life. It is terrible. I have done the diet it did not help with this, I also wear cotton granny panties, no STD\u2019s or yeast, just \u201cvaginal dermatitis\u201d..... I have not been to a dermatologist only the OB I am\nguessing it is time to see the Dermatologist. I am\nalso wondering about my water softener at this point. Would not that be something ?? Being sensitive to the salt we put in it. To use afterwards? I am not understanding... I have not seen a Dermatologist... I will look for one today! Thank you. I will look into the CeraVe also. I only ever use water or a light bit of Cetaphil as I was told to wash with nothing other than it??? I think cetaphil and CeraVe are very similar. But maybe give the CeraVe a try and see if that works better for you bc I used to use cetaphil cleanser and moisturizer for my face and that stuff did not work for me so I never tried using it for my LS. And my dermatologist was the one who recommended the CeraVe. I saw my gyno for three years and she kept saying I was making up my symptoms and said there was no std/Sti, no BV, no YI and said she could not figure it out and always dismissed me until I started googling it myself and went to a dermatologist And now most days it is like I do not have it. There are times I get a flare up, but it is managed now and I feel sane again. But yeah I highly recommend you see a dermatologist. I am calling today! I seriously cannot take this.. I have already found a Dermatologist. I agree, I feel a little dismissed by OB.. She acts a little like I am making it up even though she can see that I am red, swollen etc. I told her I was scared of Cancer and she kindof laughed... Meanwhile I have been suffering for 6 years and she is never tested for anything other than the usual. I googled the CeraVe and quite a few populated... \n\nI have been using this for a few years and it is helped me a LOT. Especially during winter months. They also sometimes come in travel sizes and I never go anywhere without it. My derm also said that you can get LS around your nipples and around your mouth so look for that too. I have had it around my mouth, just looks like dry skin really. And do not use wet wipes. Even if it is derm approved it still has an ingredient in it that irritates LS and can actually spread it to your anus. Your stress will be making it worse! Try natural yoghurt (chilled) to soothe it and ask for Dermovate or Betnovate on repeat. I am sure my stress is making it worse. Omg. My nippes do look wrinkly and funny, upon close inspection. They do not itch, though. You have been very helpful! I am sorry. Perhaps look into some alternative medicine, like acupuncture? I have not tried it, but it was my next move when I was at the end of my rope if we could not get things under control.", "Is this LS? My GP told it might be LS , i have an appointment with Urologist in next month. Does this look like LS?  Needs to be marked nsfw!! Yes i did thanks. Any symptoms? Pain burning or itching? Are you circumcised or not? Not circumcised... \nbut there is burning Where exactly is the burning? On glans. Did you use anything that might have made it inflame, like lotion or soap or lube? Not really! im using my regular soap, that im using from last 4 years. I went through your history and it says urethral burning, has that resolved? Do u think its related.\n\n\nIn regard to picture try to take a better quality image because from this pic i can not see anything it looks almost normal. is theburning constant? Doesnt look like the LS I have Products that you have used for years are actually the ones you can develop allergies to over time. I always thought a \"new\" product had to be the suspect, but I recently learned that is not the case. Even if you are not allergic, you should use a mild, high-fat soap if you have any skin condition. I do not see it, but it is hard to tell from a picture, and LS does not always \"look\" typical, so your GP could still be correct. Would you say your glans is pale or has white or pale spots, or redness, or that the skin has thickened and hardened? if the burning is constant and it looks not like LS, could it still be LS? Cuurious why \"is the burning constant\" asked? Because I have a Lichen Planus on my glans and burning is constant,. but am also treating it cold turkey (without ointments). I fear sometimes that it might progress in to a Lichen Sclerosis. Anyways am thinking of a circumcision, to be proactive NAD. Looks more like a Lichen Planus than a Lichen Sclerosis to me Yep I thought its an STI but its not...\nVisited too many docs ! I came clean Thrice for STI/STDs. Not that constant... but i think the peeling on my glans making me feel that burning sensation. I see skin peeling (maybe due friction?)and little redness on the skin... Pm you. But does the urethra still burns or is it just the glans now? Anyways the pic is not what LS looks like but only a dr can confirm Nope urethra do not burn anymore.\nIt is just the glans and i think it is because of skin peeling on glans.. That sounds more like psoriasis or eczema, or maybe lichen planus, but it is impossible to diagnose from picture/description. If the urologist is unsure, maybe seek a dermatologist. You might need a biopsy.", "Steroid downgrade experience? I was diagnosed in January and was using clob .05% twice daily until last month when I dropped down to once daily (and stopping after 4 weeks) at my doctor's instruction. I did not see a ton of improvement with 2x and got my first tear after dropping to 1x. My GP and suggested stopping completely to see if the (obvious)skin changes (that my gyno did not recognize as LS spreading) were from using the clob for too long or if it was from LS. It only took 3 days for a flare to happen so I put myself back on clob and messaged both doctors.  I mentioned using a less potent steroid (after seeing a couple of posts about it here) to my gyno and she said it did not make sense to do that. My GP, however,  thinks it makes perfect sense, so she called in a Rx. \n\nI have seen posts where some of you said the clob was not working but a less potent steroid did. My question to you fine people is, how did you come to the conclusion that clob was too strong and what was your experience with the less potent steroid? \n\nSorry this is so long! What I have seen other people here say about that is that the stonger steroids irritated their skin and in some cases caused a burning sensation.  Lower potency steroid creams still releived other LS symptoms like itching etc. without the skin irritation that clob. caused.   That Is what I have gathered from reading other people's input on that subject here.  Sorry I cant give first hand info on that specifically. Have you tried getting a referral to a genital dermatologist? I hear they deal with LS patients more than other specialists. My gyno actually suggested this to me today and plan on looking into it. That Is good, take that referral ASAP. It sounds like the steroids were doing something positive. Even if things didnt improve, its good that your treatment seemned to slow down the progression of your symptoms.\n\n Certain symptoms will change faster than others.  In my experience, things like pigment loss and shrinking of affected skin took a long time to appear, and a long time to resolve with treatment.  On the other hand, symptoms like itching appeared quite abruptly and resolved equally abruptly with treatment. My only symptoms up until I temporarily stopped treatment were pigment loss and pain/discomfort. After stopping, I had itching, worse pain, increased loss of pigment, I am currently dealing with a tear, etc. Hopefully the dermatologist will have more answers. Sounds like there is a good chance you started your treatment just in time (since you hadnt developed all the symptoms quite yet) and you also may have stopped your treatment too soon or too abruptly (since your symptoms rebounded -or returned with greater severity- when you stopped/ tapered down on your treatment). \n\nSteroids (both topical and oral) are notorious for causing rebound effects when you stop using them.  Tapering down the dosage slowly and and gradually is key.  Some people have to taper down from things much more slowly than what doctors recommend or what works for other people.  \n\nWhen I stopped my LS treatment prematurely after a few months I got pretty bad rebound effects until I resumed treatment again.  As far as I know, since the disease is \"incurable\", most LS patients will usually continue using topical steroids with some kind of reduced frequency for the rest of their lives in order to manage their symptoms.  I think that once people get their symptoms under control, a lot of people eventually taper down slowly till they only use the steroids when they have a flare in symptoms.  \n\nI was just diagnosed last fall so I am still kind of learning all this LS stuff, but I hope the info I shared helps. That is very helpful information about the rebound! As far as I am concerned, my symptoms were never under control, but for some reason my doctor felt different. I will definitely keep the tapering in mind going forward! Your dr may have wanted to have you stop treatment to see if there was some other factor at play besides LS.  Using steroids can really make things tricky if you have a yeast infection or something else going on because the steroids will mask the symptoms of things like yeast infections or even allergic histamine type inflammatory reactions, while not addressing the underying cause and allowing those other underlying things to get worse.  This can lead to some nasty rebound effects as well.  \n\nIf you find a good doctor, hopefully they will keep these kinds of factors in mind.  You.ll also need your doctor to be able to help you find the best way for you to manage your symptoms with treatment, while also minimizing possible side effects that come with long term steroid use (assuming that LS is determined to be the most likely cause). \n \nYou really need to listen to your body and see how it reacts to using/stopping or tapering the treatment.  I think the concensus is that for LS patients, the benefits of using the steroids outweigh the risks of side effects from the drugs, or the risk of complications from leaving LS untreated. Basically, finding the right balance of how much to use and how often to use it is an important thing for you and a good dr to figure out together. And seriously, dont be afraid to taper down as slowy as you need to.  Just listen to your body, and keep an open discussion with your dr about how you feel when tapering down. Like I said, they should be able to help you weigh the pros and cons of continued steroid use to manage your symptoms. Wow lots of comments! \nMy 10 cents , I use betamethasone ointment,  for whatever reason I do not see it prescribed much on here.\nIt is weaker than clobetasol and have helped remove my thick white scaring and release my adhesions. Adhesions are still resolving. OK I male, uncircumcised,  but all information helps.\n Avoid water based anything !\n\nGood luck.", "Could this be LS? I get \"cracks\" or cuts above my clitorous, on the top my labia majora. Ive had this on and off for awhile, it can be itchy and painful. I thought it was my underwear but after having this awhile it does not seem to be effected by underwear or pants.\nEverytime I search up what it could be, LS pops up. Ive never gotten the white spots but I sometimes get redness and itchiness. It could be dryness I guess? I usually have to use a lot of lube during sex, and sometimes tear a little but idk. Im at a loss, I plan to bring it up to my PCP next time I go in but I just wanted some opinions, and this is my best guess.\nI realize you all are not doctors but I appreciate your opinions nonetheless, thank you.\n\nThis image is just a diagram to help indicate where the cuts/irritation is.\n( diagram  Yes. That is one of my only noticeable symptoms (that I noticed myself). My skin used to always crack at the little crevice above my clitoris. I have not had it happen again ever since I started treatment with the steroid cream. I have had this symptom since August of \u201819 and have seen about 9-10 doctors and specialists about it since and have not had any luck. Hopefully you have better luck with getting a diagnosis or answer than I do. It also sounds a bit like lichen planus, or eczema or psoriasis. I would recommend a dermatologist appointment. They should look in your mouth, too; even when people do not feel any symptoms there, white areas can often be found on the gums, cheeks, or tongue, which are indicative of lichen planus or occasionally LS. Yes it is imp to make a distinction between LS and LP. I have noticed a lot of folks use these two terms interchangeably since both have lichen in them Thank you for the info! Would derm be better than a gyno even if my symptoms are only on my genitals? I have never been to a dermatologist so I am not really sure what to expect tbh. Oof. I hope you find answers \u2764 I definitely can sympathize with doctors just not having answers. I am so sorry you deal with this, but selfishly I am glad I am not the only person to deal with this.  I thought I was going crazy or doing something wrong. Some people say seeing a derm is better because these are skin conditions that just happen to be on the genitals. I think if you can get a doctor who is knowledgeable and listens, that matters more than their specialty. \n\nTo me, it makes sense to maybe get diagnosis and treatment from a derm, and get ongoing supportive care for symptoms from a gyno who can advise you on comfortable clothing, sex, etc. But I cannot really speak from experience yet. My gyno is a nurse practitioner and did not feel qualified to diagnose LS, although she strongly suspected it, so she sent me to the derm, but my appointment is not for two more weeks.", "Pimecrolimus So at long last, a derm diagnosed me with scrotal eczema (lichen simplex chronicus). I am still not sure what the big differences are between lichen sclerosus, eczema and psoriasis are medication wise. From what I see, the medication for all three are steroids like clobetasol, triamcinolone or protopics like tacrolimus, pimecrolimus. \n\nAnyway, I have been using pimecrolimus for the past 2 days. *Maybe* there is some improvement. Could be placebo too. How long did it take you guys to stop the itching? I am thinking if the itching does not stop completely in 2 weeks, I am going to ask for stronger medication like clobetasol. What do you all think? \n\nThanks in advance. Male LS didnt make me itch at all. The Clob is so extremely slow acting that it took 2-3 weeks for the improvements to be truely noticable. Skin heals very slowly. Thanks. At this point, I have not going to look at the skin texture at all for months. I had LSC for a while. So I am assuming it will take months to recover. Right now, all i am looking for is to stop the itch. But i am surprised your LS did not itch. I thought all LS/psoriasis/eczema itched horribly. You can cure Lichen simplex and the skin looks different than lichen sclerosus", "Post biopsy blood loss ", "Has exercise helped you? Could it be related to lymphatic system clearing? For lichen sclerosis, over the last few years I find that exercise immediately causes the affected skin to become puffy &amp; white, then gradually calming minutes after I sit down. This temporary flair seems similar to that when I am exposed to cold water or weather.\n\nI have generally been inactive physically (only basic movements, going to work, etc). However since I moved to an apartment with stairs that I must climb daily, I am noticing over the last couple months that my exercise flairs are lessening more and more, though they still arise.\n\nCould it be that exercise initially causes autoimmune flares for inactive people, but then eventually benefits them if they continue it on a regular basis? Could this be due to the lymphatic system (or other systems) slowly detoxing due to exercise/movement?\n\nWhat is your experience with exercise? Were you initially a couch potato? How long did it take to notice benefits? What conditions did it help/hurt? What kind of exercises helped/hurt? I had it and I quit dairy and it went away after having it for about a year.", "can you get ls directly on your clit? if so, will that affect your ability to orgasm or feel good?  You need to stop obsessing over this im trying :((( it is hard for me It is a valid concern? Chill out. I was wondering the same and I am sure other people are as well. Sex and pleasure are important!  Seems like the most thing that is common is clitoris hood fusion. It is a valid concern in the sub, yeah. Check the posts over the last few days by username. \n\nI completely agree these things are important, but this individual does not have LS. It is a difficult issue she is struggling with and it is coming out here. Yes, but it does not always affect your sensations, though it can. There are a few things you can do to try to help the situation if it happens to you: use some coconut oil and massage the area and try to gently tug the excess skin away from the clit. You can also use one of those clit sucker toys to try and keep things open using that toy. im a trans man, actually :) You can get it on your clit, I had a white patch on mine but dermovate helped and eventually the patch disappeared. As someone else said the most common issue is your clitoral hood starts to fuse with your clit and surrounding structure. In extreme cases your clit can be buried. There are surgical interventions that can reverse this though, do some Googling regarding that!\n\nIf you are really concerned about it being LS I would highly recommend getting a biopsy done, I did and got officially diagnosed about two years ago. I know what a flare up feels like and can usually nip it in the bud before it gets bad.\n\nAlso fwiw I am a transguy too (he/him) ! I have been on T nearly 2 months and being on T has not adversely affected my LS, I was a little worried it would as T can lead to atrophy down there but mostly internal.\nAlso I am sorry someone misgendered you in another comment. I find when posting regarding LS or about my natal genital health I put my pronouns somewhere obvious in the title or a comment &lt;3 That I will fix so as not to misgender. \n\nAs a Reddit psych (advice worth price paid), I still advise you to put this sub down. You do not have LS.  If you did we would be here for you (for things related to LS), but these fears are not about LS. \n\nMost of us do not have experience with the effect of T on anatomy, if you are on that. You really need the doc for that one. Do the yeast treatments. IF they fail, try a different one. If that fails too, then go back and say so. But do not make yourself miserable reading horror stories. Breaking out when looping is hard. But ya got to do it anyway. You are going to be okay. im not on t, but i am on birth control. i will see a doctor soon if nothing clears up :(", "Lichen Sclerosis Male Not getting better I am 23 and I have had lichen sclerosis for a year and a half now and it is not getting better. A year and a half ago I first got a small white spot that I did not even notice but it hurt to pee so I went to a doctor. The urologist told me I had genital warts so for 3 weeks I was absolutely miserable and hated my life. I just found a girl I really liked and could not bring myself to tell her so I started to avoid her and when we would go out I would pretend I got too drunk so I could not have sex. The guy referred me to a dermatologist and so I was waiting for the confirmation. I walked in and right away she goes no that is lichen sclerosis. I would never heard of it before but I did not care what the hell it was, I did not have an STI. I actually started crying right there on the spot. Due to my relief and joy I do not think she had it in her to tell me what I was dealing with, and if she did all of this might of been saved. She gave me clobetosol and said come back in 6 months. That is it did not tell me anything else. I thought it was curable. I used it and it got better and I stopped and did not think anything of it. Fast forward, I love lifting and me and my friend decided to try SARMS which is somewhat like a steroid. WORST mistake of my whole life and I have not been the same since. Idk if it messed my hormones out of wack but by week 3 my lichen sclerosis was much worse and now spreading all over the head of my penis. I was now and still to this day 6 months later uncomfortable every second of the day. I am mentally defeated. 3 months in I could not take it anymore and broke down sobbing to my mom. She is tried to help me and all I do is try to put on a fake happiness that it is getting better and I am okay. I am not. I am in my last semester of school and idk how I can have a full 8 hour job everyday in this much discomfort. What girl is ganna want me? My whole penis head is practically white and I cannot even have sex without my whole head getting inflamed and red spots all over it. I feel like a monster. At least girls can get sympathy but I am supposed to be a strong guy, what girl is ganna want a guy like this. How can I do this. The only relief is when I put clobetosol all over my head, but I cannot keep doing this it will thin my skin off. Literally the day I stop clobetosol it gets way worse again and my head starts to look more bruised. It is only the head of my penis that is uncomfortable. I am on my last legs. I have lost 25 pounds and lost a ton of my muscle I have worked years for. I am eating everything organic, no diary or gluten. My diet is bland as can be. I just bought 4 pairs of expensive silk underwear for 170$. I am buying all the most expensive shit I can find trying to be as healthy as humanly possible but nothing helps. HELL I was even circumcised at birth and have been extraordinarily healthy my whole life never out of shape or overweight. It does not make sense. I still workout but I cannot enjoy it the same as I am in pain the whole time. sorry for the long ass post but I just needed to get this off my chest I do not talk to anyone about it any suggestions welcomed. 95% of this is on girls which makes it more frustrating. I have always been the happiest guy in the room and now am on the verge of depression. Id love life if I could just get this shit to stop hurting and burning all the time. I do not even care at this point if my penis looks different I just want it to stop hurting. Any suggestions for guys? Could it be balantis or yeast infection on head? Idk", "What helped my flare ups Hi everyone. I have been a silent sufferer of LS for about 5 years now. It is hard to talk about because a lot of people do not know what it is and I feel if they did they may be grossed out. I was so excited when I found out there is a Reddit forum dedicated to this and reading some of the post I do not feel so alone anymore! I just wanted to share something that helps me so much during a really bad flare up. I understand that some may have different opinions or maybe can even teach me something if it is something I should not be doing but I have been using it for the past year and it helps tremendously.\n\nI was prescribed a series of steroids and celob thinned my skin out so much. It left me feeling dry and almost like I needed to keep putting more. My skin felt like paper. I finally ditched the celob because I wanted something that gave me instant relief. ESP when I am waking up in the middle of the night soooo itchy I cannot even fall back to sleep!! I have tried emu oil and that seems to only cool things down or speed up the healing process if my skin becomes basically raw. The best thing I stumbled upon and swear on next may sound strange to some but hear me out... preparation H rapid relief with lidocaine... LIFE SAVER. I had some left over and one night I was thinking to myself I just wish I could not feel anything down there! Then I seen the PH tube on the counter and in a desperate moment I lightly rubbed some onto the *outer* lips only. When I tell you guys, instant relief!!!\n\nI now swear by this stuff! I always keep some. When I have a horrible flare up I rub it on before the shower, before bed or whenever I have that nagging itch and it literally numbs the area I cannot feel a thing. It is like a mute button LOL. It helps so that I am not further irritating the area and it gets a chance to heal and the rash goes away. Within 2-3 days I do not even need to use it until I have another flare up.\n\nI noticed caffeine, alcohol &amp; PMS are flare ups for LS. I try to stay away from these but it is so relieving knowing I came across something I do not have to go to the doctor for, it does not thin my skin out, etc. if you do decide to try this please do not place it on the inner area. I only use it on the outside of my effected area. I am no doctor obviously so this is just me sharing something that worked for me hoping it may help someone else. Another thing I think is irritating it further is shaving. I am considering doing laser hair removal and still researching if that would help alleviate any symptoms. I have an appt w my OBGYN and plan to ask her as well. Great tip! I have found getting sugaring as a bikini area hair removal technique has helped me as shaving was definitely an irritant. It is definitely pricier than a razor and shaving gel but worth it to me for less irritation. Ooo! Sugaring did not even cross my mind as an option. I forgot all about it. I will be looking into this too! Thank you This is brilliant! I just looked on Amazon and there are a ton of lidocaine creams! My ls is ok atm but I am going to try this on my inverse psorisis. Thank you!! Lidocaine is awesome! Right now I am being extremely careful about what goes down below, and prep h lidocaine has a rather long ingredient list. If this is a concern for you too, you can ask your doctor about getting lidocaine from a compounding pharmacy. Then it will just have lidocaine and the base, which can be petrolatum, coconut oil, and some other options. It is a little pricier but in my opinion worth it, where I am it is about $16 per tube and comes in the mail. I never thought of that. I am going to ask my doctor. Thank you :-)", "Best no-show 100% white cotton underwear? I have to wear specific pants for my job and I have TERRIBLE panty lines!  Help!

Now if only my holiday bonus would hurry up... lol Yeah, I know what you mean! these are normal panties, they should do the trick and keep the air flowing too", "Period advice!! Hello everyone, I would like to share with you my experience with Lichen Sclerosus and my period. Tampons and pads irritated me severely, the burning and itching was unbeleivable and I suffered so much. I recently started using reusable sanitary pads and period underwear, and let me tell you that it has been a lifesaver. My unformfortableness has been reduced a lot and its way cheaper too! I recommend a brand with good reviews (I used Bamboozy) and give it a try, it could alleviate your burning and itching :) Period underwear has saved my life as well. I have tried thinx and modibodi. I did not get on with the former but could not imagine living without modibodis now. I started using a menstrual cup and it has helped so much!!! Once you get the hang of it it is so much more convenient. Love this!! I did the same as well, that period underwear is a god-send, I would get so irritated from using disposable pads. I luckily have a friend who makes re-usable pads and she has sewn me at least 2 dozen of them, they feel so much nicer than regular pads. Something else I found that helps during my period is a bidet, we got a bidet earlier this year and it has been life changing during my period, no more chafing from wiping!", "Male experiences with sex Hello everyone,\n\nI am 18 years old and about a year ago my dermatologist told me I have either lichen sclerosus or vitiligo on my penis. I have done some research on my own and my symptoms seem to match with the ones of lichen sclerosus (I have very thin, black and white skin on my penis tip as well as on parts of my foreskin and also easily irritable skin around my frenulum which is red, sometimes purple and also scarred). Luckily for me, the symptoms are just cosmetic and do not cause much physical discomfort. I have been to multiple urologists and tried about 5 different creams which all did not seem to make a difference. I am planning on seeing more dermatologists and trying to find something that can reduce the redness and scarring around the frenulum.  \nI have had this problem for about 4 years and it has always been an insecurity of mine and also the reason that kept me from making any sexual advances to females since I feared they would find my penis disgusting. Am I making a big deal out of it or is explaining that it is not an std as difficult as I would imagine?  \nI would also appreciate any recommendations. What creams have you tried and for what duration? \nAlso did any of the urologists suggest circumcision? Is the condition confirmed by them or they are suspecting?\n\nCircumcision seems almost a cure if you could look into that and discuss it with a doctor also always keep the area clean and dry and never let urine touches it Takrozem, Decoderm tri, Linolacort Hydro 1,0. Two days ago a urologist prescribed Nytalocal for 10 days and after that to use a zinc ointment \"Zinksalbe-CT\" for that part around the frenulum. Unfortunately all of those are german names and I do not know a lot about the ingredients. \n\nNone of my urologists actually recommended getting circumcised by themselves but I asked both of them and while the first one said okay and gave me the documents to fill out the second one (the one from two days ago) recommended to not do it because they would have to remove all of that sensitive skin around the frenulum and parts on the other side of the penis which are totally fine (besides some white spots).   \nAnd since I really enjoy masturbation with my foreskin I want to try to heal that part of the skin without circumcision unless it is absolutely necessary.  \n\n\nNo the condition is not confirmed but it is what the dermatologist suspected a year ago. And looking at the images on the internet it really appears similar, but luckily not as severe as most of them. Also I forgot to mention that the condition did not get worse since I first noticed it and maybe it got a little better when it comes to the redness. But maybe it is just me being optimistic because I do not have any photos.\n\nThank you for your reply. Oh and I do not remember taking any of those creams for longer than two weeks. Sir i think if in case its LS then the treatment should be way longer than 2 weeks \n\nUse the tacrolimus (the first cream you mentioned) for 3 months and see what it does \"it is considered safe and doesnt cause thinning\"\n\nDiscuss with your dr though Hi, the most effective treatment for LS in men is clobetasol/dermovate. I have looked up the medicines you have been prescribed so far and they do not seem entirely appropriate.\n\n Explore with a dermatologist, with experience of LS in men, a course of Clobetasol and, as Throwaway 69 suggests, ensure that you wash/dry the tissues under the foreskin after urinating, use a barrier cream, such as epaderm, to both moisturise and also protect the glans/frenulum from any drips, and replace soap with an emollient wash cream such as E45 wash. \n\nWhilst you describe the symptoms as cosmetic, ultimately the tissues of the foreskin will scar and become intractable and it can develop on the glans, frenulum and cause strictures in the urethra which can require some nasty surgical intervention. \n\nThis type of conservative approach to treatment is typically around 60% successful in bringing about a full remission. Circumcision is generally curative and is the historic treatment for men with LS ie. removing the conditions within the foreskin which precipitate the disease in susceptible individuals, however the conservative dermovate approach is very much easier/less invasive. \n\nI wish you all the best. 69? Nice. \n\nI am a bot lol. Sorry, should also add that vitiligo and early stage LS in men are frequently confused and skin biopsies in men are a bit more difficult and not very reliable indicators of disease.  Hence, it is really important that you see a dermatologist with experience with this disease. Good luck Hi Nick, thank you very much for for taking the time to look into the creams. I have now found a dermatologist who has a lot of information about LS on his website and I am hoping he will be able to help me with this. \nA lot of the stuff I have read on the Internet described Ls as a really hopeless disease, so a 60% chance of full remission sounds great.\nI appreciate the advice and I will give Epaderm a try. Okay, I will ask a dermatologist about the cream. I would need a new prescription anyways because I used it two years ago.", "Please help! Newly diagnosed- no biopsy yet. Terrified and depressed and feel like a monster. Link to pics 31/F. Does this look like LS? Is that already really bad fusing that I am seeing? \n\nLong story short, I went to the gyno because of the black spot I was seeing. Instead was told I have LS and the black is likely a blood blister from using a vibrator. The gal I saw today was completely cold and unhelpful. I have no idea what to expect. I am getting a second opinion tomorrow.  Does mine look like a really bad case?? \ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I am no professional and I have only really ever looked at my own bits, but your skin does look white and shiny in places. Really, the only way to know for sure is a biopsy.\n\nGetting diagnosed is the worst. It is so much to digest and others do not really understand...I am sorry for you. But with proper treatment, it can get better. \n\nDo you have any other symptoms? Itching? Not a lot of itching no, but very dry and often mildly irritated. Sex always leaves me sore for days. Other than that, I have not noticed much. I do not often examine myself but I feel like it looks different. I thought it was because of having two children *shrug*. Like I said, I went to the gyno for a different issue... ugh \ud83d\ude29 Yeah, that is tough. I felt the same about my vagina after kids too, with scarring and whatnot. I do not know what they recommended, but changing up things like the type of underwear you wear and detergent can really help. I use a scentless, gentle cleanser (lots of people like the gentle Cetaphil). Try switching detergents to no scent too and only cotton underwear...anything to help you stay as dry as possible. I find it helps to not wear panties to bed to let the skin breathe. Ultimately some corticosteroids are what will help, but taking other measures will help too. Maybe some good quality lubricant before sex... The other thing too is that the skin becomes rather fragile with LS, so the blood blister could be a product of your skin just being too weak. Tbh, I do not know. I still do not totally understand what a normal vulva is supposed to look like. Lol. Because I still think my own looks normal, even though I was diagnosed by sight from multiple doctors. And at the time, I did not have any itching. (Though that did come eventually for me.)\n\nBUT I wanted to reassure you a little. It took me two or three years to emotionally accept I have LS, and even still I once in a while question things. It is a hard diagnosis to receive. That being said, I am, for the most part, on the other side of that wall now, and my doctor is really pleased with my vulva, and I feel a lot better about it. If you have LS, this is not the end of the world, nor does it have to be the end of your sex life. You did not do anything to cause this or deserve it. It does not make you less of a woman. You are not losing value. And your partner will still love you.\n\nMy advice would be to find a doctor you trust. Follow their treatment plan to a T and follow up with them regularly until you find a good system that works. I wasted a lot of time being in denial and worrying about the side effects of steroids and thus not using them often enough. I was eventually honest with my doctor, and we came up with a plan, and I stuck to it, and it really helped me accept my body as it was and really stopped symptoms and the progression of skin changes. \n\nBest of luck. You are going to be okay, either way. Promise! Are you using a lubricant? Coconut oil is great. It is hard to tell based on these pics, so I am glad you are getting a second opinion. I would definitely get a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Near your clitoral hood, I see some white areas, so you may have had some issues there that caused tearing that may have caused that black spot/blood blister. Skin tears very easily when you have LS. Do you know why it looks like my labia minora like disappeared? You can see the lines but the actual lips are gone \ud83d\ude31 So i def think you have LS. Your labia has fused together, you have white patches/red areas. Blood blisters are common with ls. There are tons of LS groups on fb! Very helpful. They will give you steriod crean snd it should help the fusing and itching if you have any. Is your lavia fused over your clitoris? Or is it just not ahowing in the picture? Have you noticed the inner labia getting smaller/shrinking?\n\nThis is super scary at first. I totally get that. But you do not look like a moster and you have options. Treatment can help so much. Get a second opinion and definitely get a biopsy. My ob was so so nice about everythinfd amd so understanding. Find one that is! So will the steroid cream reverse the fusing?? The gyno I saw wants to do a biopsy to rule out cancer and also see if it is LS. I do not have any itching tho... I do not understand \ud83d\ude14 Please update us with biopsy results when you can ! As far as i know, yes sterioids can undo fusing! But it will not u do the color or shrinking. Did the biopsy come back yet?? I did not have any itching until 5 years after i noticed white spots. Biopsy is scheduled for Wednesday June 10 \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc Biopsy is scheduled for Wednesday June 10 \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc Any results? I was just curious to what it was! Hope you are ok! Positive for sure! \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude41 For LS? I am sorry :( Yes for LS. Thanks", "Male LS 26 Hello\n\nI was diagnosed with LS when I was 24 I believe. It started when I was 23 as a white stain at the tip of my penis. I went to a doctor he said it is fine so I did not do anything. Later that year I developed the same whiteness around my foreskin but with redness and tightness around my foreskin. In February 2018 I finally got to see a dermatologist (almost a year and a half later) after 3-4 Doctors said I was fine (I did not have itch or sever pain, I guess my case is mild). My dermatologist immediately knew what it was and prescribed me Tacromlius. Fast forward more than 6months from then and I started to see real results. The sensation came back on my penis, the white thick skin was almost completely gone (it is still white on the left side of my foreskin) the pain went away and I was able to stretch my foreskin so it could go back further. I cannot remember when I stopped taking the ointment but recently i believe I have had flare ups. My foreskin is sore when retracting it once I have an erection the redness is there after disappearing for a while. As many of you know this is also a mental disease and I have been tripping out over it the last month which has caused me to come here after reading all of the posts. I am going to continue with my ointment in hopes it can fully clear it (I was doing so well before I stopped). But in the back of my head I have thought about circumcisions. I want to keep my foreskin but where it is located I believe a circumcision will fix my issues. I just want to know if anyone has experience with a circumcision as an adult to remedy LS. I am overweight (have been for 9 years) as well and I think that is a cause for it too I am currently doing my best to lose weight and return my body to its normal state. Basically long story short it is really messed with my sex life like I am nervous to sleep with girls and I feel it is effected my erections (although that could be because of being over weight). I try to remain grateful that I caught it within two years before it became very serious and it is still mild (only effect my sexual performance). Talking to people about it is great but I really do not have anyone I am comfortable mentioning it too. I am just looking to hear from some people on their experience and what helped them specifically the circumcision. I think the ointment did extremely well and I stupidly got off of it without being fully treated or being as normal as possible. Some days I look at it and it does not seem like a big deal other days the white stains look enormous. Not being able to get close to girls intimately that I really like because I do not believe I can have sex with them has me feeling very lonely. I have lots of supportive friends but I want to share that with someone who I am attracted and not have this on my mind is really what is messed with me.  I want to back to before this or be as close as possible to that. \n\nTLDR: I got LS after 3-4 misdiagnosis caught it early took Tacromlius within a year it really helped but did not go away fully. Now it is kind of back again but not like it was before and will go back on my ointment plus things like vitamin D and losing weight. Will also consider circumcision if this does not help/interferes with my sex life. Thanks for reading hope you are all doing well.", "Question about dermovate (Male) Hello, so I have (20 Male) used dermovate creame before and it kind of gave my penis stretchmarks? So for the past 8 months I have not done anything for my LS, since it have not progressed on its own. \n\nWhat I am worried about is my shaft, and the white patches that looks like scarring that is on there covering the whole back side of my shaft! My question is can dermovate remove this thick white patch of scarring? Or is this scarring permanent?? I am meeting my doc next month and I think I will go for circumsition since the foreskin is really tight but I am also thinking of applying dermovate on my shaft now to get rid of the white patches! \n\nThought?\nThanks in advance! I believe that is called betamethasone here. Ointment is preferred to cream. \nYes it will remove thick white scar tissue. The underside of my penis had thick white patch. I was told to apply plenty to this twice a week after 2 weeks once a day.\nSlowly the dead tissue sloughed off. Look of the glans on underside has gone from grey-red to red to match the rest.\nNew data shows cancer risk with a steroid treatment plan returns to normal. So this is forever ! Btw the ointment fixed my tight foreskin. Imho you should avoid circumcision! Thanks for your input, I am glad to hear it cleared it for you, but why do you recommend to avoid circumsition? \n\nI did try the cream but actually did not work the first time, and the second time it gave me terrible wounds on the foreskin! I do not think it will work for the tight foreskin but maybe for the white patchess on the underside! I had phimosis from a yeast infection. It was so tight I could not retract the forskin at all. 3 days on betamethasone ointment and it was fixed. \nCircumcision reduces sensitivity. And the skin cells change. Circumcised men have a 10 % failure to ejectulate during PIV vs 1 % for uncircumcised men. \nI dont know why the medical establishment has been trying to circumcise me for last 40 years. Its ingrained and wrong.\nits important to use ointment not cream because it stays put longer and has less water content.  I found water based lubricant made my LS much worse. Did I mention that ointment is preferred to cream because the ointment stays better and cream has much higher water content. Talk to your Doctor and do not give up on the steroids to soon. Even with circumcision you may still need steroid ointment. Yes sorry I meant ointment, that is what I am using. How long did it take for your white scar tissue on the shaft go away? The thick white scar tissue on underside of glans took a long time. It is just about gone now, it is pink and there are some adhesions opened up. On glans it still comes and goes but not very noticeable now. On 3rd or fourth day after Appling ointment it reappears a thin white layer that can be messaged away. Okay nice to hear. I have been on dermovate for a while now and the white tissue has not gone away even the slightest... and what you said regarding circumcision, I had phimosis prior to getting LS so getting the scar tissue removed from the foreskin would stilll leave me with phimosis. The Betamethasone helped and cured my phimosis.  In fact it has helped my excess foreskin. Of course this is difficult to judge but it feels different ie better. \nBe patient. I found the scar tissue would get itchy around 3rd day and I could massage and dead skin would slough off. It takes time. Mine on underside was very thick. \nBTW my dermatologist wanted me to use K-Y as lubricant to stop sticking foreskin. This is water based and by 3rd day my whole glans had white Frost!  Washed and applied Betamethasone ointment and it sloughed off in a few days. Use vaseline now if needed.\nGood luck, do not panic ! On another point. I had bad tear scars on my foreskin where I had earlier phimosis.  When at the dermatologist some years later I commented the tear scars are gone. She said yes it is the type of skin cells the foreskin is made from.", "Clobestol and skin thinning Male, uncircumcised. Starting a regimen of clob. My LS symptoms are redness of the foreskin, some whiteness, and slight phimosis (foreskin getting smaller). I am applying twice a day, the steroid ointment, along with tacrolimus. Already only a week in to application and seeing, or rather feeling, some skin thinning in the form of increased sensitivity and delicacy of the foreskin. Although the inflammation is certainly also going down, and I have not torn or injured myself yet. I was planning on a full month course but now I am not so sure.\n\nAnyone have long term problems from clob use? Anyone have any thoughts and want to share their schedule? Did anyone have their doctor taking about pulsing (apply clob for a couple days, break, do the same again)?", "You Have to Participate in Your Own Rescue ", "Pfizer/Biontech vaccine and LS? For me it seems the vacc kicked off LS. It started 2 weeks after the first shot. I also have Vitiligo since i was born which never was a problem. Anyone else can make a connection?\n\nThe EU is also looking into this since few days: ( It sounds like the skin disease that the EU just started looking into as a possible side effect of the mRNA vaccines is Erythema multiforme.  Sounds pretty different from LS.\n\nI still would suggest you report your side effects to the appropriate regulatory organization (probably a total pain in the butt, but worth it) so that they can see if this is happening to other vaccinated patients at a higher rate than the rest of the population. That Is how a connection will get established if there is one. Personally, I experienced no change in my LS following either dose of Pfizer.  Agencies are monitoring reports for potential side effects just like they did with the blood clots that showed up with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine in the US.  I am sure there is a means of reporting in your country where your doctor can send information about your experience and it will be added to the data pool. I had no change in symptoms after my vaccination Could be just coincidental too. I had oral thrush 6 days after my first Pfizer shot. I reported the symptom as I never had thrush before. Turns out it was a symptom I was exhibiting for anemia. I already had LS for years and it turned into vulvar cancer at the start of the pandemic. It was not until I did a blood test during my cancer surgery screening was the anemia detected. Chances are you already had LS and was not aware it of prior to taking the vaccine. Since LS is an auto immune disease, a vaccine which is designed to ramp up your immune system would potentially excel the symptoms. Same thing happened with me. I do not think it is related though. But it could be, who knows. I had no change after my Pfizer vaccinations. Same.", "crying everyday - how do you guys cope? please help me. the itch is horrifying, persistent... and yet there is no discharge, no white patches, no fissures and no tears (i try not to scratch), i went to a GP today, and she said my vulva looks fine (it does look fine to me too), but when she asked if im imagining / worrying too much.\n\nafter i left the room, i cried so much because this itch is torturing me daily - i cant sleep anymore, im so afraid to sleep because im just lying there wasting time itching to death. i cannot sleep and im falling asleep everywhere in my classes, even during my own presentation. i have taken so many antihistamines that i have gotten complications from that. and for the doctor to say i am just worrying too much about nothing... i just feel so.. embarassed. it is already difficult to visit a doc about this.\n\n i have not officially been diagnosed with LS (apptment 30mar), but i have had this itching for 7 years or so and i have exhausted many other reasons such as:\n-dry skin\n-yeast infection (took diflucan, applied topicals)\n-bacterial infection (i am on antibiotics for acne and have no discharge)\n-detergent, tight clothing (i wear nothing now, i stay at home and cry until i need to go out)\n-STDs (never had sex)\n\nand yeah you name it i have tried it probiotics, teatree oil, vagisil, hydrocortisone, antihistamines, feminine wash, baking soda, boric acid, detergent, wearing nothing...\n\ni am sorry. i dont know what im writing and crying about, it is not like anyone needs to know about all the methods i have tried to stop my disgusting problem, i am just feeling so hopeless right now and have thought briefly about suicide but i have cats so i do not want to.\n\nhow do you guys, cope, or live with this? The itch for me was horrible too. However, if it is LS, then the hydrocortisone cream should most likely help with the itch after a few days of use. It does for me. You should probably not be putting any of the other things you mention onto the area either, only wash with water - this is the case whether it is LS or not.\n\nI hope you find an answer! I do not think using all of those products is making it any better but actually making it worse. Especially feminine wash. You should not be using anything but water down there. If you are using wet wipes, I would stop using those too. Your appt that is coming up, is that with a dermatologist bc that is the person you would want to see. Not a GP or gyno. Dermatologists specialize in skin and can get you the correct treatment. For now, I would suggest you quit using feminine washes. I would call a dermatologist or even a pharmacy and ask what you could use safely to help with the itching until your appt. I am really sorry it is been so long and you have not had treatment yet. I went three years with the same issue. My gyno kept telling me I was making up symptoms so I started googling and it said to see a dermatologist, got in 2 weeks later and started with the topical steroid and within 2 months I felt sane and normal again. Good luck to you! I am so sorry your doctor treated you this way. Are you using Clob and estrogen cream? I would cease using anything else except them and a barrier cream like Vaseline, coconut oil or Emu oil. Anything else could be worsening things, especially the feminine stuff! I find I get the most relief from a sit down bath in warm (not hot, but on the warmer side) with a couple splashes of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. Does something to the itch! Wear really loose pants and cotton underwear, because when you flare up and ulcer, any itching, pressure or chafing will just make it worse. (I have been so bad I have woken up to blood on my nails) \n\nAlso, gel ice packs are a godsend. I hope you find a doctor who understands soon. This one clearly does not! I know exactly how you feel! My doctor had no idea what it was until I told her it might be LS. I too tried everything to relieve the unbearable itch and pain. She prescribed a low dose steroid cream (0.05% betamethasone) to be applied sparingly twice a week. Ice packs at 20 minute intervals, coconut oil and the betaderm cream seemed to get it under control. However, during a horrible flair up while traveling out of the country, I began slathering it on to find relief. It became worse than it had ever been. After three weeks, I finally made an appointment with a female gynaecologist in the US who specializes in menopause and LS. She officially diagnosed me and discovered that I had been having a reaction to the cream! She prescribed mometasone 0.1% ointment and was told to wait until the inflammation went down before I began using it. It is been 6 months since it first appeared. I know I will never have the carefree days of pre-menopause again and flare ups still happen somewhat frequently (sex, excess sugar or alcohol) but it is a more manageable now with proper diagnosis and a prescription that actually works. I am a man, but I have had LS for a few years now. I only was able to realize what it was sooner because my mother also has it. I know of what you are going through. Always itchy and in the morning  when I would have to relive myself, I would be sort of erect and it felt like my skin was being peeled off. At first I just thought I was not cleaning well enough. Then I wondered if it was an STD, the. It must be dry skin or something like that, and it went on like that for a while. Until white patches began cropping up and a couple of tears. I also felt myself going crazy, trouble with sleep, trouble with sex, trouble with self confidence, etc. \n\nI was prescribed clobetasol ointment and some lidocaine jelly. I feel that the lidocaine makes a huge difference because it gets so sensitive it is hard to really get the clobetasol in where it needs to be. The first time I was only prescribed the clobetasol and it took the whole tube to feel better. But with lidocaine, it took 5 or 6 applications and then my flare up was gone. I felt \"normal\" again. When they prescribe you clobetasol for example, ask for some lidocaine jelly. It made a *huge* difference for me. \n\nI know that it seems about hopeless, but you will soon get some relief. My PCP was the first doctor to prescribe me the clobetasol btw. Your PCP might do it until your appointment. you need a qualified dermatologist and not merely a GP or even a Gyno. I am so sorry to hear you are dealing with this. I went through something pretty similar. I had the tears that just would not heal at first, saw a GP, she scared the shit out of me and told me I may have herpes, did a test, it was negative, and she did not do anything else. so then the tears turned into the worst itching I have ever experienced, it was awful. I was worried I had some kind of vaginal infection and I got a referral to a gyno. she had just actually come back from a convention of sorts on skin conditions of the vulva, and told me it could be LS. she did a biopsy  of my tears, and eventually confirmed what she would thought. She prescribed a .05 clobetasol ointment, first 2x a day for 6 weeks, then 1x a day for 6 weeks, and currently I am taking it 1x a day, every other day. she also mentioned that just regular, unscented vasoline would be good to use if I experienced my symptoms before I was able to put on the clobetasol. my suggestion is to definitely ditch anything but water for cleaning yourself, cotton underwear/something breathable, and the occasional use of vasoline. I hope this helps! To answer your title question - a lot of us struggle. But it looks like you have gotten some responses of things to try that have helped others. I think most people have been able, after years, to find a physician they trust who can help find treatments, so I hope you can find that soon. \n\nThe doctor you saw is a ridiculous person. Did you explain to them how terrible the symptoms have been for you?  And sure, even if you were \"imagining\" or \"worrying too much\" I would think if that was a legitimate concern, they should have referred you to a psychologist because something is clearly going on, they just disagree as to why.  I believe you, and I do not think you are imagining things. You are crying every day, I really do not think you are worrying too much. I believe you are worrying just the right amount. Do not think that this is your fault in any way. \n\nAs others have asked, is the march appointment a dermatologist? I hope that they can help you. \n\nAs far as not having any other symptoms, I have also only had pain and itching. No white spots, no tears. Everyone is a little different and I do not think the lack of those rules you out. I am so sorry you are going through this and that you have to wait for so long for your next appt. I would hope your GP can help by prescribing you some clobetasol in the mean time, or something. It is the least they could do. I would consider finding a new doctor, maybe one who will take you seriously? You deserve it. Lidocaine jelly is one I am not familiar with, good to know. \nAnd I second the pcp, that doctor cannot just say \"it is your imagination\" and then ignore it altogether, they owe OP to try something. Hey, thank you so much.\n\nYes!! i felt so dismissed and ridiculed but it is okay. she commented that there were no tears and no rashes and so perhaps it is logical her assessment is just usual irritation. my vulva actually looks quite healthy to me too.\n\nyes i am crying everyday hahaha but it sort of helps. i am worried partly also because i keep googling photos, and you know, there is images of severe conditions and i get really scared. yeah the fault thing... this is not the 1st doctor i have seen but they seem to chalk it down to poor hygiene and dressing practices, which makes it feel shameful like hey woman just be less gross and you wont itch so much. but if it is an auto immune condition where your body just decides to attack you, i dont think anyone can be blamed for it, yeah.\n\nas for the symptoms, i see!!! slight pain and lots of itching is also my symptoms. (sorry this sounds stupid but: i actually realised there are other skin clinics i can approach for an earlier appointment date, other than a specialist hospital which is cheaper but longer waiting). no!! the GP was so reluctant to prescribe.. she gave me antihistamines but i alrdy have so many of them (but i am monitoring how much i eat cause i realised i had bad constipation from eating too many of it once)\n\nyes. thank you. my brain is so fucked i cant rmb the last time i slept for 8 hours. i can only sleep for 2-3 hours then i wake up due to itching and idk if you guys have experienced this too but it builds up a kind of cognitive fear in me? like man i am just going to be lying there, trying my best to sleep but itching, i might as well be up doing something productive. thank you!! can i ask about the biopsy, is it painful or anything and how long did you have to wait for the results?\n\ntill now, i am not sure if i have LS but i have been noticing white specks of what seems like skin flakes on my pubic hair (i am 100% sure it is not lice). and thank you for sharing your experience!\n\nyep i do use vaseline but in my experience, it helps for like 1 hour, then it sort of itches crazily as it dries up? i had similar experiences with vagisil and aloe vera gel! but yeah anything is better than scratching and damaging the skin further. i have realised i may be able to see one tomorrow! so hopefully it all goes well i see!! thank you. i think the discovery process of such illnesses is always a long and arduous one. there is so little known, since most assume itching in that area is just STDs. \n\nyes there is that similar process of oh it must be dry skin, let me apply moisturiser, oh it could be yeast, i will take some flucanzole, it is unlikely to be BV since i am on antibiotics for acne and there is no discharge, etc. it is been a crazy process of checking out your symptoms and worrying and suffering and i am glad i am not alone, thank you so much for sharing your experience!\n\ni see!! i think the jelly thing might be helpful. i have lidocaine cream (vagisil) but it itches like crazy when the cream dries off. umm idk if it is TMI but may i ask what do you mean get the clobetasol in where it needs to be? i always thought it was an external application but it could be different for males and females .\n\nthank you!! i hope i can get some relief too. ah travelling yes, i rmb wearing jeans and dying in them literally. \n\nthat sucks tho to get an allergic reaction to somethign that is supposed to help you! betamethasone, mometasone, are these steroid creams too? like clobetasol?\n\ni see... thank you for sharing your experiences!! yes i tihnk there are certain things weh ave to give up, or manage carefully due to this condition. im glad something worked out for you btw. the biopsy was not too bad, she took two spots, and one hurt more than the other, but I think that is just because she was rushing (as most doctors in my area do) and did not wait for the freezing to fully work. I probably had to wait 4-6 weeks for the results to come back, but (this is weird and maybe tmi) the itching was pretty well gone in that time, purely because she took the spots that did itch, then it was just kind of a, my wound is healing type of itch, if that makes sense.  I have ever experienced the white flakes so I cannot really speak on that, my thoughts would be maybe that it is just skin flakes from itching dry/irritated skin, but again, that is just an assumption. I know some people experience white patches of skin, so maybe that has something to do with it? I think that with this disease we are not really getting into TMI territory because it affects our genitals, and really any information that can be shared to the benefit of others should not be viewed as such. \n\nSo I will explain what I mean. I am highly sensitive, largely due to not being circumcised until I was 6. I was much too ill as a newborn for the procedure, and then when I have a flare up, it is even more sensitive. So I can barely stand to touch my penis because of the added sensitivity, and without lidocaine I just quickly put some clobetasol on without running any around the head and pulling skin back to ensure I get everything, as it feels like I am being flayed. With the lidocaine, I cannot feel anything after 5 minutes, and then I apply the clobetasol, and ensure that I am able to get every area that needs it. I got my first case of LS at 34 and my penis became pretty much useless, it was horribly painful! I went through a really depressed period.\n\nBut crazy enough I was affected by the California wildfires and my power was out a month which means I had no refrigeration and that meant I was not eating dairy, crazy enough my LS went away! I quit dairy and my LS is still completely gone for over a year. Maybe you are the same? I was crying too.  I went to two different doctors and neither of them knew what it was.  I finally researched myself and thought it was LS.  I just went to another doctor a few months ago and she said that it appeared to be LS, but could only tell for sure with a biopsy.  I opted out of the biopsy, as one will be needed prior to a laser treatment that I want to have which I believe will cure it.  (There is a doctor in Tallahassee that has had very good results with his one time procedure.) In the meantime - just try soaking in a sitz bath or a tub with some Borax (2Tbsp per quart in sitz bath or 1/4 cup in tub filled only as needed to soak your affected area)  That STOPPED THE ITCHING IMMEDIATELY.  I am so happy to never be kept up at night (all night long) with the insane itching. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f I just randomly found this sub because I was looking at someone is profile and they had a post on here and as I was reading it I was like THIS IS ME DID I WRITE THIS. I started itching in January 2017 and it has been every single day since then and the area has spread. Right when it started I saw an obgyn who totally ignored me and said the skin looked fine. Then that same year I saw a normal doctor who did not even look and said it was probably an allergy and to take Zyrtec (did not help). Then I went to Planned Parenthood and again they said I was fine and echoed the allergy thing. That all cost me hundreds and hundreds because I was on my dad\u2019s high deductible insurance. It is been over 3 years and I have just been dealing with it \ud83d\ude2d my partner is amazing and supportive but traditional sex has been basically out of the question for 2+ years. I start a new job next week and literally March 1st I am going to find a fucking dermatologist. I never knew there was a real answer!!! Good luck :) I hope it all goes well. If you ever have any questions, everyone here is super helpful.", "Has anyone been prescribed nystatin? I see everybody talking about clobestol but not nystatin. My doctor has me using clobetasol at night and nystatin in the morning. Just started a couple days ago so fingers crossed it helps! I tried it, but it did not work for me. The clobetasol worked wonders for me at first, and the the efficacy of it just disappeared. I do not think it cannot hurt to try it!", "What treatments/ ointments have you all had success with? I am a 23 year old male and I am pretty sure I have LS on my glans. Derms have said it is probably LS but I never got a confirmed diagnosis. I am circumcised and been dealing with this for years. The skin on my glans is discolored (white red etc.) and when it first started I had itchiness and peeling. Looks like a chunk of my skin on my glans is missing and it is really had an impact on my self esteem. I have tried tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, ala-quinn, duobrii and clobetasol. Probably tried each one for about a month. Clobetasol for like 2-3. Doc claimed he saw improvements. I did not really notice any. Do not really know what to do anymore. I have seen my doctor, a urologist, 2 dermatologists and nothing has helped. Also wonder if there is some way I can get the skin missing to grow back on my glans but I think that is it is too late. The color sucks but it really sucks that one half of my glans just looks like someone took a scalpel and removed a chunk of skin. My sex life is non-existent :( Hi. I have just had a meeting with my dermatologist - a highly regarded professor in UK who specialises in penile skin diseases. During the questions part of the meeting, I raised cases such as your case. The immediate question he asked was were you RIC or later?  If later, was it for phimosis?  Lastly, would you describe yourself as overweight or having a fat pad or buried penis such that your glans when flaccid is regularly enclosed in flesh? Definitely overweight. When I am bent over yeah it may be pressed up against skin. It is are not the biggest one around I will tell you that \ud83d\ude02 What is RIC? Routine infant circumcision which is still common in USA. Thank you. I think you might find that, despite being circumcised, the excess flesh etc is acting as a pseudo foreskin - my dermatologist\u2019s words - so that, despite your circumcision, you glans is still exposed to urine, micro-incontinence, moisture of a natural penis. My dermatologist believes that the majority, but not all, of the c.5-10% of men for whom circumcision does not work largely, but not completely, fall into this category. Other than losing weight and/or surgically reducing the fat pad and/or extending the flaccid penis by cutting the suspensory ligament ie. a penis \u201cenlargement\u201d procedure, you best option is long term use of Clobetasol to manage the symptoms as most female members of this group do. \n\nPlease note I am not a doctor and this was a discussion with my dermatologist rather than specific advice. I am a female so our LS is a little different but it took me like 6 weeks to really notice a difference with clobetasol. Might need some more time.\n\nAlso, even prior to having LS if my partner had an issue like this it would not bother me one bit. My genitals also do not look like a pornstars anymore and my boyfriend loves me the same. You will be able to have a great relationship. Nick - just want to say you are a fantastic resource on here. Thank you so much for posting all the information that you collect - I am sure I speak for myself and many others when I say it is IMMENSELY helpful, especially since so much of it would not otherwise be accessible to us. Thanks for the words of encouragement:) Hey, sorry to ask in an old thread. But how does being overweight cause pseudo foreskin? I get that fat deposits would be there in thighs and near base of penis. But the penis head in itself should have nothing. So i am not sure how this works. It is not the penis itself that get fat. A pseudo foreskin get created when the glans in enclosed within flesh of the thighs, belly, the penile fat pad such that urine drips can be occluded in the tissue surrounding the glans.", "Itching flareups for 3+ years, doc suggested it might be LS. I am not sure. 27F.  I have been having these flareups for at least 3 years now.  A couple times a month, I experience awful itching in a specific spot on my perineum.  It gets worse if I scratch it, and it tears and bleed easily, even if I just wipe too hard after using the toilet.  It helps to soak in a warm bath.  It is sometimes worse at night.  I have been evaluated for BV, yeast infection, and STD's - those seem to be doctors' go-to ideas, but then they do not offer any other ideas when those fail.\n\nBut finally when I mentioned this at my last pap smear, my new doctor suggested that it *could* be LS.  I had never heard of it, and after doing some research I just do not know.  Mainly because my skin does not visually appear any different in the itchy area.  I also do not have any pain or issues during sex, and it has not spread beyond this one small spot.  But I am secretly somewhat hopeful that it *is* LS, just to have an answer.  \n\nAnyway, this was a few months ago that my doc suggested this and I am just now thinking about following up on it.  I guess what I am asking is... Does my case sound like LS?  How do I actually get diagnosed? I am just at a loss and needing to talk to someone about this.", "My story and a few questions Hi guys,\n\n36 male here. I am the newest camper in this great LS adventure...\n\nFrom what I have read, some of you suffer a lot more than I do, but still this is worrying as hell. I still have no major issues with my genitals functions so far, so I really have no right to complain. Nonetheless, good luck to you all and here is my little story so far.\n\nNoticed some white skin on the tip of my glans about 2 years ago. It was still smooth and not painful, maybe some loss of pigment I thought. Then several months ago, I noticed that the inside of my foreskin that was actually touching the white patch when pulled on the glans had developed a spot of raised and scarred tissue down along the frenulum. I was a bit freaked out, but since I do not like to go waste my time at the doctor, i decided to wait it out (because from experience I found that they can help you only if you have SUPER OBVIOUS symptoms...).  Anyway this caused me no trouble for sex or peeing, so I tried to stay cool about it. Then a couple months ago, a red stain appeared in the white patch, starting at the bottom of the piss slit and going down following the urethra under the glans and stopping at the frenulum, as if there was blood under the skin. Some parts darker red and others brighter red, and changing a bit depending on the days also. So that was it, something was wrong enough with my bits to go see a doctor now.\n\nI had to wait a few weeks to get an appointment, so that gave me time to scour the internet for info, obviously (we all try to self-diagnose do not we?). Reading about LS made me realize that I also had a few anus itching episodes that i had no explanation for and also that my pee slit had scarred very slightly at the top (a bit inside the slit). I sometimes had an annoying spray instead of a clean stream, making a mess around the toilet when I do not sit, and I always thought it was just occasionally sticky or something, but I guess it has been sneakily scarring for a while now.\n\nAnyway, I saw my general practitioner and she referred me to a dermatologist which I saw 3 weeks ago. She looked at my bits for less than 10 seconds and said \"That is Lichen sclerosis, it is fairly common to man and woman alike. We do not want it to spread so I will prescribe you strong cortisone ointment and we will have a follow-up appointment in two months to see the evolution\". She also said that this requires a possible lifetime maintenance of putting cortisone ointment two times a week.\n\nConsidering I am stressed AF about it... I was a bit shocked at how unimpressed and nonchalant she seemed to be. I prefer woman doctors in general because they seem to be more caring and have more empathy in general, but I think I would have preferred a man here. Surely any man would know that learning that your dick is being attacked by some disease that you will fight for the rest of your life is something you need to be supportive about. Sorry if that is stupid or sexist, I am just sharing my gut feeling.\n\nSo...... Right off the bat (pun intended) I have several questions popping in my head.\n\n\\- I have had very mild burning sensations when peeing, but I did not mention it to the doctor yet  because it was very occasional. Could this be damage to the urethra? Also, can the urethra heal by itself if I manage to heal what is visible from the outside, on the glans and foreskin?\n\n\\- The cortisone ointment is pretty greasy (like vaseline). Is it advised to put your foreskin back on after applying it? I feel like this would prevent glans and foreskin to ever breath through their natural skin if the ointment does not ever have a chance to \"dry\" or \"wear off\". Did any of you have had the same kind of cream to apply?\n\n\\- I often have some weird sensations just above the pubic area. I thought it might be intestinal, but I am starting to think that maybe it could be my bladder. Am I tripping out or is it possible for LS to go all the way and attack the bladder?\n\n\\- Bonus question : Is not BXO just the name for the male version of LS? Or is this a different disease?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, thank you for reading if you made it all the way through. Looking forward to chat about it.\n\nCheers! Do you reduced sensation of the glans, Nope. No such thing yet. In fact I think its become a little more sensitive since I use the steroid ointment. Hi you might find my thoughts/observations interesting:  dm me if you have any questions  Thanks, that is appreciated. I just completed my 4 weeks of steroids ointment and the redness isnt gone yet. It seems to have maybe faded a bit and shrunk in size also. I was expecting a faster result, but still, I think this is slowly helping.", "Newly diagnosed! Hi everyone,\n\nIm a 25yo male, and I am just glad to know I am not alone! I have recently been diagnosed via biopsy, and being treated with Pimafucort topical hydrocortisone. So far so good.\n\nDoes anyone have any other advice for managing, whether dietary, lifestyle etc? 35 y/o Male. \n\nWhen it is really painful, some lidocaine jelly/cream can be your savior. \nIf you are experiencing severe burning/stinging from urination, submerge your penis in water then go. Just make sure to pat dry afterwards and allow air to get to it. Obviously this is only viable at home. \nNever use any scented soaps in the tub, even when showering.\nInvest into something like cetaphil for cleaning. \n Soak for 15 to 20 minutes a day if you can. Wash your hair over a sink. \nKeep your pubes trimmed way back. I cannot stress that enough. \nKeep your penis hydrated through first aid creams or only plain vaseline (not any with anything additional like cocoa butter as it has fragrants which will cause irritation) apply 3-5 times daily. Even when you are not experiencing a flare up. \nTry to avoid sex up to 3 to 6 weeks after a flare up. Make sure to invest in a good lubricant. Something that is natural. \nUse as little steroid ointments as possible. They can thin your skin. \nAnother medicine to discuss is Nystatin cream. It is used for yeast infections mostly, but it can help some with LS. \nWear cotton underwear only. If you can, place something soft like a cotton cloth to use as a cup so to speak to prevent the cream or ointment being rubbed off when you are going to be moving around a lot. \nDrink lots of water. \n\nThis is about all that I can think of for now.\n\nI am on mobile so formatting may suck. I apologize. Why trim pubes? It makes it really easy to keep your penis clean, especially with a lack of bodywash/soap. It will reduce that muggy, sweatiness environment which breeds bacteria and can worsen your irritation. You can also end up getting a lot of ointment and creams stuck and matted in your pubes. Less hair means more and better contact with skin with ointments and such. It can also lead to pubes getting stuck under the foreskin, or to areas of the penis that are irritated due to ointments and sweat. \n\nYou need not shave it or do a super close trim. I personally never shave. I do just enough to ensure the above. It is definitely a quality of life thing with this disease. So I was diagnosed with it a couple of months ago.  Been dealing with it for several years and not knowing or understanding what it is.  Doctor diagnosed it 2 times as \"jock itch\" and prescribed a cream that did nothing the first time and then told me to just use lotramin or lamasil which did absolutely nothing.  I finally got brave enough to get past the embarassment and went to a dermatologist who diagnosed it as the lichen.  She prescribed the clobatisol (spelling) and told me to use it for 3 months before coming back.  I thought that was a scary amount of time with the steroid, but also read some cases that took close to 3 months to heal.  It does seem to have gotten better and I am close to the end of 2 months.  There is still an area on either side of the head where the foreskin is \"attached\" for lack of better term.  I am not sure what steps to take after this next month but it has been a horrible experience sexually with the skin tearing.  I assume you other men that commented have experienced this as well? When you say, 'so far so good'... Please be aware steroid cream is not a treatment for LS. It has an ameliorating effect, but if it is LS there is no known cure. Sometimes it clears up by itself Thanks, I am well aware Op can you give us an update please? \nHow are things now? What did you use? Is sex painless and is life back to normal?\n\nThank you i really need the reassurance Can you give us an update? How are you now? Are you no longer tearing during sex? Did the steroid work? What are you using?\n\nThanks Hey, ive neve really experienced pain during sex as a result of LS, so it is not been an issue for me. I have been using Pimufacort every day to 3rd day since diagnosis and it is really calmed it down, itching is rare and the white plaque has drastically reduced. I do occasionally get flair ups though, these seem to happen at random. That is great to hear, how long between flare ups would you say? And how long a flare up would typically last Could be a day, could be a week, depends. I am better now.  Only time it tears is if the sex is very aggressive with no lubrication   the sides of my shaft are still fused with the head and will tear if I do not keep it lubricated.  The steroid seemed to help, but only up to a point.  I did experience one episode? Of where the entire skin on my penis became red a d raw and irritated.  Open sores from rubbing on underwear.  I do not know what caused it, maybe the salt levels in my hot tub were off kilter and did it.  I used the steroid cream and the skin began to heal but peeled like a bad sunburn during.  Now I put Aquafor on every day and have not had issues.", "23, M. Small brown dot near white patch. Hyperpigmentation? Benign melanosis? Or signs of something malignant?  There is some mild trauma above it from the other night. Steroid cream successfully thinned the diseased skin, but some tore in the process. Healing well I would say it could be LS. I think you should consider seeing a dermatologist. \nThere is an Lichen sclerosus group on here with some information and pictures It looks dark red in the picture. Tiny bruises are common with LS. If it goes away in a few days it was probably a bruise. If not, or if it really is brown (like a mole), it has to be checked out. Thanks, will continue to monitor", "Negative biopsy result Hi everyone!\n\nI just got my result from my biopsy for Lichen and the result came back negative. I feel really helpless and alone. The doctor has the suspicion it might be Vulvodynia and recommends clobetasol once a week. Does anybody had similar experiences ?\n\nIs not clobetasol also a cream against LS? \n\nThank you for your help! So, Clobetasol is a steroid cream used for many different conditions, not just LP or LS. Glad to hear of your negative results! keep on smiling! Iam not sure weither I should be happy about it or not. I have a really bad itching and pain during sex and no solution for it .. I keep on living without knowing what it is I received a negative result too. But still have the annoying itching and almost \u201cbuzzing\u201d feeling. Do you have that? Yes I do ..", "Oral BC to treat vulvar LS I am F20. I have had vulvar LS for 2 years already. Started treating it 1,5 years ago and still no remission. My gyno suggested oral BC, as she believes LS gets better during pregnancy. What are your thoughts on this and is there anyone that by any chance has tried this treatment? I have had a baby since having LS and it did not impact it whatsoever. Not to be rude, but it may be time to look for a new doctor. You have been uncomfortable for a very long time under her care! LS is suspected to be an autoimmune disease, and most autoimmune diseases get temporarily better during pregnancy because it is a time of natural immune suppression. \n\nThat said, hormones do play a role in LS, although it is not 100% clear what that role is. Certain types of BC are thought to increase the chances of getting LS (the anti-androgenic ones), others may be protective, and most probably have no effect. try low dose naltrexone Thank you! This helps me understand the situation more. Is not it used to treat alcohol dependency? I have heard that it is like a lottery. And if some people do get better, it sometimes returns after breastfeeding (from what I have read in groups). That is true... I wish there were more specialists in my country, but I will try finding a new one. Which country are you in? Lithuania. Ah sorry, if you were in the UK I would be able to suggest some people. :/ At least I am glad to hear that you can get good care there then. I hope this pain has an end :/ In high dose yes which is 50mg+ ...low dose you take anywhere from .5 to 6mg or even slightly higher. It has a completely different effect. It causes the body to release more endorphins therefore bringing down inflammation response in the body. Read more into it if you like. I take 2mg and I love it. Thank you! I will look into it! Hi there! What positive effects have you experienced with the low dose naltrexone? Almost zero LS symptoms, forget I have it most of the time. Compared to before, where I was aware of it pretty much 24/7. Increased energy, mental stamina, improved stress response, lowered anxiety and depression. It is clear to me now I was having a lot of systemic inflammation. Getting pregnant is what triggered my LS, so it really is different for everyone. Omg it is been used with fibromyalgia! I cannot believe I am just now hearing about it, I did so much research on fibro and literally found a hugely beneficial treatment plan for myself. I am so interested in this\u2026 just getting my LS test results today. Woah, that sounds so good. I have never heard or read about it, but I guess it would help me as I have depression and anxiety as well. Do you still use steroid ointment/cream once a week or is it not necessary? And who has prescribed you this? I do not use the steroid cream. Only if I am having some intense itching which rarely happens. I got the prescription through my naturopath, as she was the one that recommended it. From what I understand, conventional GP's do not usually prescribe it nor know much about it, but of course that could vary. What was the exact dosage that you used each day? How long did it take for the low dose naltrexone to make you feel better? I started on 1.5mg, noticed an immediate effect. I went up to 3mg and felt that was too much, currently take 2mg a day. May lower it to 1.5mg at some point. Higher dose is not necessarily better, you have to play with the dose to see what works best for you. Thank you for letting me know! Did you have a lot of itching? That is my most bothersome symptom. I did yes, I would get itching spells a few times a week. However, my main symptom was a sandpaper/chafing like feeling around my vulva, very uncomfortable. That has completely gone away. Hey. Do you know why the anti-androgenic birth control increases the chances of LS? I was on Yasmin for 8 years and when I came off of it I got all of these issues.", "Issues with protopic I used the clobetasol twice daily for a month and now I have been instructed to use the protopic once a day as maintenance. The clobetasol was really helpful but immediately after applying the protopic for the first time it felt like mildly burning. I googled and saw 1/5 people experience mild burning that goes away and it should not burn for long, but after applying once I felt the burning sensation for two full days and now I just have pain and sensitivity and have not used it again. Yep, I was the exact same. My dermatologist said \u2018oh but it goes away after a few days\u2019 like it was nothing but even 2/3 days of burning was enough for me. I just use dermovate now. Bleh okay maybeeee I will give it a couple more days buttt... do you like the dermovate? Yeah it works well for me", "Newly Diagnosed Man and Stressed I am a 25 year old man who was diagnosed with Lichen Sclerosus a few weeks ago. Although I have had irritation for a few years I only realised something was definitely wrong when the white patches on my foreskin and glans appeared this year. My foreskin luckily is not tight at all and remains very movable as it has always been (I have a lot of foreskin honestly) although there is red swelling at the frenulum and around the very tip and erections are a little sore. \n\nI have been started on Clobetasol and 2 weeks in have not had any relief yet from the mild pain and swelling or improvement in the skin appearance. I have to use it for 3 months though before going back to my doctor for review so maybe I should not panic about it yet. How long has it taken to work for other people? \n\nMy case does seem to be fairly mild overall judging by things I have seen and read from other people and the foreskin being more than fully retractable still is hopefully a good sign it has not actually scarred but I am still feeling really worried about what will happen in the future. \n\nSexual activity involving my penis is sore (although not excruciating) so I will have to refrain from that for a while at least since friction more than anything it seems to make it worse. But I am scared I will not be able to use it for sex again without pain or that I will lose sensation totally because of scars if they develop. \n\nThe internet seems to either say it will definitely get worse over time resulting in scarring, phimosis and inevitable circumcision which I really do not want or that it will likely be controlled by the steroid cream eventually. I am also concerned about the small cancer risk since there is some red swelling as I said before. \n\nIt is a really worrying time for me as you can probably tell and considering I would never even heard of this condition until a few weeks ago I am feeling really stressed and angry that this has happened to me.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading, I suppose I will need to wait and see how things go and I am glad things like this sub Reddit exist for people with this condition. This is what cured me, listen very carefully. Stop eating junk foods, try to eat gluten free if you can. Start exercising as much and living as healthy of a lifestyle as you can, drink plenty of water. Go to Amazon and buy these 3 ingredients : Emu Oil, Tea Tree Oil and DSMO (100% pure). This is some powerful ass shit that will make the white discolored patches of skin disappear, and peel off, it might sting and at first it might seem to be working (might make it look worse) but just trust me. Get a bottle that has been clean and sterilized and place a 1/3 ratio of each oil until the bottle is full, and shake that shit up. Now at least 3 times a day, get a Q-Tip, dip it into the concoction and apply to the white patches/area. Make sure you wash your dick before applying, you do not want any other particles. Do this until the white skin starts peeling and all the white scarring is gone. Also, Stop masturbating, throughout this whole process do not you fucking dare masturbate. Honestly you should have never got a Circumcision in the first place, because the doctors do not have a fucking clue. BXO is an autoimmune disease, so more than likely your body is having an inflammatory reaction to something ( probably something you are eating so change your diet). This process may take a couple months, but feel free to DM me along the way if you have questions. Honestly might need a picture to judge accurately but you can DM me I do t know if you are on Facebook or not but there is a support group specifically for men with lichens. Thank you, I have had a look and applied to join them. Please consult with a doctor before applying any oil or anything other than your Rx...especially if it is some \u201cpowerful ass shit\u201d that stings\n\nJfc I agree completely. I was also recently diagnosed with LS and I have been treated with Dermovate/clobasterol for 1 month 2xday, and now Trimovate 6weeks to go 2x day, as a break from the Dermovate, but with the option of returning to it if required. Progress to date has been very positive. My dermatologist has been at great pains to stress the importance of not letting urine get trapped under the foreskin, shaking, washing, drying and using a barrier ointment, Epaderm, in case of any dribbling. I have been happy with the medical treatment and ultra-compliant. I believe the disease was caught early in my case, only being discovered when the frenulum broke followed by immediate but narrowly defined phimosis at the very end of the foreskin. I have experienced no other LS symptoms. I have been very clear throughout that circumcision is an utterly unacceptable, albeit possibly unavoidable, outcome for me personally, UK based. I wish you all the best Thank you, hopefully after another while of treatment  our issues will be resolved best we can. I have also been using a barrier ointment and making sure I am dry which should help. I am also going to refrain from any sexual activity involving my penis anyway until the invitation treatment time is up.\n\nI have noticed that I always dribble so its not surprising if urine has irritated it. My frenulum is red and swollen but luckily has not broken and my foreskin has not tightened at all so hopefully that can be avoided. I wish you the best of luck with your treatment and relief from symptoms, I am from Scotland and like you feel circumcision is an unacceptable and to be honest scary option for me. Regarding the point about sex, interestingly my dermatologist wanted, within reason, me to continue to have sex, once the dermovate had kicked in, to test functionality. I failed to mention that the only real LS specific symptom I experienced was tearing of the foreskin during sex, which I attributed to the foreshortening of the healing frenulum/phimosis on a purely mechanically basis. I found that 1 week of the dermovate sufficiently softened the skin and enabled me to, cautiously, test sexual function. I never received any advice like that especially since I just saw my GP. However masturbation seems to really aggravate it and before I was on treatment I would notice improvement within a few days of stopping so I think waiting until when and if its healed would be a good idea. She said not to worry about using Dermovate long term either although I am only using it once a day at night. I think masturbation, particularly a more \u201crobust\u201d style, would be unhelpful and I have minimised that. I have had no concerns regarding dermovate although I recognise it is a very strong drug. It may be worthwhile seeking a referral to a dermatologist, possibly privately to accelerate the process, in addition to your GP? My GP said to wait until the 3 months was by with and if I still had symtoms a biopsy and dermatology referral would happen then. For masturbation I have bought vibrators to use instead to miminise friction. Ok. Understood. I think she is following the British Association of Dermatologists\u2019 guidelines with the 3 month timeline. The dermatologist I am seeing is one of the authors. I challenged him on changing to a less potent corticosteroid after 1 month. His position was better to apply twice a day, hitting it harder initially, then \u201cresting\u201d with a return to the stronger drug as required. do you have statistical evidence for this approach? tbh applying some home-made oils that sting do *not* seem advisable. Male here too, has this for 2 years now. Not circumcised and saw all docs and they did f all tbh apart from steroid cream.\n\nIt worked but then 2 weeks later white patches on glans came back\n\nI feel like i was given so much steroid cream that it ended up ruining all my glans even the parts that were normal\nI ended up gettimg of all the creams and go to a strict diet, anti inflammatory one\n\nThe soreness has basically stopped the only thing is the glans dont loom very nice because though the white patch is still there, the effect of the cream really ruined my glans (they are super tender as not thick as your normal skin)\n\nShout me if u want to chat mate Nope, but I did it myself and it worked. Basically followed another post some guy on this subreddit made DMSO and Emu oil make sense but Tea tree oil on already aggravated skin gets a no from me :/ Any updates op? I finished the 3 months using the steroid cream and pretty much all the pain and discomfort went away although the skin is still discoloured. My foreskin though is still fine and completely retractable. \n\nMy doctor said now just to wait and see if it comes back and if it does to ask for the steroid cream again. I do still have some pain but I am unsure if it is caused by the LS or damage from too much masurbation during quarantine! I am planning to wait a few weeks and see how it goes. And how is sex now? You mentioned it was excruciating before! So is it enjoyable now hopefully? I have not been able to have it for months because of my country's quarantine restrictions so I am not sure to be honest. Masturbation? I currently have no itchyness no symptoms just discoloration anything i can do before it gets worse? Get Dermovate as soon as possible, you might be able to cure it completely because even with huge discolouration the steroids reversed most of it and gave me normal function.", "Opinions if this looks like LS  This has been occurring for 4 years now, everytime I go to my gyno he says it is a yeast infection. I am cut at the top of my clit, at the bottom of the opening, and inside my clit. please find a better gyno I am trying, and I am a type 1 diabetic. So once I found out that LS can be related to a immune disorders that is what set me to believe it is LS I am looking for other opinions I just want to know what is wrong with me. Tired of the constant gyno appointments and them doing absolutely nothing. It certainly appears that you have got some fusing going on. Find a dermatologist that knows about LS and make an appointment with them this week if possible. It does look like LS to me (not an expert or doctor tho) I would definitely see a dermatologist. I have been trying my gyno does not know anything about LS pretty sure he does not know it is a thing lmao, so I had to call today to ask for a referral to a specialist so I have been waiting for a call back all day today ;( I found a dermatologist tho! They specialize is LS so we will see soon! I am waiting to get a referral so hopefully it does not take to long You can request a biopsy from your current doc to confirm. If he refuses, ask him to document refusal in your file. He should change his mind pretty quick. If he still refuses, find a new gyno who will. Even better, see if you can find a vulvar specialist near you.   \n\n\nThis does look like LS to me based on my experience. I have had it since I was age 8 or 12, basically as long as I can remember. Since you have already got one autoimmune disease, it is likely since they travel in packs. Yeah I have been trying to ask him for a biopsy but her keeps dodging the question, I been calling him office everyday asking for one as well and I just asked for a referral today so we will see what he does. I kind of hope he refers me because clearly he has no idea about LS and I would rather go to a specialist that knows what they are actually doing Do you have to have a referral? Can you just call around and ask if the other docs in your area are experienced with LS and set up an appointment? My insurance limits where I can go, I have been to 3 different gynos and none of them have said anything about LS and I was not getting better so that is why I decided to ask for a referral today. I have gone to everyone I could with my insurance Damn. Insurance blows. Amen, wish I was rich I have had several gynos tell me it is just a yeast infection, \"That Is just what happens.\" Finally diagnosed. 2nd opinion is never a bad thing. I wonder if you can find a different gyno or a dermatol That definitely looks like LS to me. Granted I do have a penis, but that is the same white patchy skin I have on my glans. \n\nYou could try asking your gyno or even your GP for some clobetasol and lidocaine jelly. My GP prescribes that to me and the lidocaine is amazing! Especially for pain control. I am guessing you are experiencing some pain as well or just itching? I am experiencing the whole 9 yards constant pain, constant itching, constant dryness, always cut up I have clobetasol but I have .5% and honestly it does not help too much 9 yards is 8.23 meters That is what I have. .5% and it works for me, but steroid creams/ointments will not work for all. Something else that works as well is Nystatin. But for me at least, the lidocaine allows me to really rub it in, otherwise it is just too painful. Trying to pull back, feels like I am being flayed.\n\nI also get cuts too but that is usually the result of intercourse. That is probably the most depressing aspect is that my wife and I both have very high drives, but once a flare-up occurs. It is at least 3 weeks before it has passed. \n\nWhat are some routines you do? I bathe twice a day and will always use some water after urinating then pat dry and apply aquafor or Vaseline to keep myself hydrated. I also meditate as stress seems to be a trigger for me. When at home I will wear lose boxers or nothing at all. I realize not everyone can because of kids or other family. i have suspected having LS since the end of march and looked similar to some of these photos. my derm did a biopsy and said it was negative. they found a fungus and prescribed me meds for that but it did not help and i go back wednesday. i am thinking my biopsy was somehow wrong? anyway, hope you find an answer as well! I hope everything\u2019s good with you as well! Keep me updated!!!! I hope everything\u2019s good with you as well! Keep me updated! I hope everything\u2019s good with you as well! Keep me updated!  The red, eroded areas make me think Lichen Planus (LP). LP and LS can also occur together. LP also seems to be associated with diabetes too (and many other autoimmune diseases).\n\nIf you have any symptoms in your vagina itself (as opposed to just vulva/vestibule), or white lacy areas in your mouth on your gums or cheeks, that is more suggestive of LP. \n\nIf yeast treatments are not working, it is probably not yeast. \n\nI hope you get some answers soon, and more importantly, some relief! I am I have both that is gunna be a great time lmao, and yeah the yeast infections are always constant they state and never seem to get better. Thank you so much! Yeah I had 4 dif gynos blow my LS off as yeast or \"just anxiety\". Dermatologist did a biopsy 1st time I saw them, diagnosed me with LS and got me treatment and its doing much better. I really hope you can see your new derm soon! And do not be afraid to advocate for yourself for a test. Biopsies are not fun but they are nothing compared to how uncomfortable LS already is. Good luck! I hope you find relief! Thank you so much! My referral was just sent over to the dermatologist today! The doctor there just had to approve it so probably in a few days and then we r off! I just hope I figure out what is going on I am pretty sure it is LS but you never know! got a second biopsy, hopefully will know more in a few days! Yes!", "Male 24, LS confusion After the 3 years of progressive spreading of white skin on glans, I went to a dermatologist. She was not alarmed at all and I quote: \" Let us just see how things go\". She would not even do a biopsy since the affected skin is close to my urethra opening and did not want to damage anything. \n\nI monitor this spreading of white skin very carefully and it is just not right. I atleast expected to be prescribed some clobetasol. I also went to an urologist 5 months prior, he too did not seem concerned. \n\nI have noe itching, no pain, just discolouration on glans. My foreskin is not affected, but lately I have been developing eczema-like rashes on shaft and scrotum. Any tips or advice would be appreciated. Unfortunately your doctor's reaction is not an unusual one.  You are probably right in sensing that something is wrong, but it sounds like your doctor might also be right if they think you do not have enough (or sever enough) symptoms to warrant a biopsy or treatment just yet, since biopsies and treatments both come with drawbacks that are worth considering carefully. \n\nFor me, different symptoms definitely emerged at different times and some symptoms emerged very gradually.  My discoloration began before my other symptoms. \n\nKeep an eye on what is goin on and share any changes in symptoms with your doctors. And feel free to ask your doctors for a referral to a more secialized doctor if you or they feel like its appropriate.  I hear genital dermatologists deal with LS a lot. Did either doctor give you a diagnosis?  If not I suggest finding a dermatologist who treats LS patients. Mine did not do a biopsy but diagnosed LS straightaway. You can read my others posts. I have had good results with betamethasone ointment augmented,  it is a bit milder than clobetasol. \nGood luck ! It is not an uncommon in cases of suspected penile LS not to do a biopsy, but rather to rely on a visual/symptomatic diagnosis. I would agree with Lahend, go and see a dermatologist, confirming their experience with penile LS. A positive diagnosis should result in immediate treatment. This is not a \u201cwait and see\u201d disease. It will not clear of its own accord. Neither gave me a proper diagnosis. I asked my dermatologist if she sees penile LS often, to which she responded yes. Interesting that you mentioned betamethasone, I was acutally prescribed betnovat (0,1%) betamethasone by the urologist. I used it for 4 weeks, but did not see any improvements. \n\nI have a question for you, did you use ane moisturizer after applying betamethasone? The lady over the counter advised me to apply some moisturizer 20 min after applying betamethasone to preserve elasticity in the glans skin. Anyway, thank you for sharing! I agree with you, I will contact my dermatologist as soon as possible. Thank you for your help. I was first prescribed betamethasone for phimosis, this was caused by antibiotics and resulting fungal infection. In 3 days it was fine. So I dont think this is a problem with betamethasone dipropanate 0.05% although my excess foreskin may have got a little better over last year or so. Will discuss with urologist,  dermatologist says doesnt know. I dont use anything but some vaseline on day 3 on 4 day applications if glans gets to stick on foreskin. When I first used betamethasone I had several bad bleeding issues where small lump was torn from glans. Does not seem to be an issue now. Nearly 2 yrs into treatment. I hope this helps. What country are you in ? I cant find betnovat here in USA? I am in Norway. Ah, Found betamethasone valerate 0.1 % available as cream or ointment. I assume this is the same as you were prescribed? My experience is that it doesnt happen fast. The thick white scar tissue that give Lichen sclerosus its name took a long time to dissolve a thin dead skin layer at a time. Admittedly I have had this for a long time. The frenulum was completely gone when the white scar tissue was removed. Yes, that is the same ointment. May I ask, what was your regiment like? I applied the ointment 2 times daily for 4 weeks. How long did you use it? Did you take any breaks? Twice per day for 2 weeks then twice per week. Can go back to twice per day if get flare. I have been twice per week for last 18 months or so. I dont know how the two different forms of betamethasone differ in effectiveness or strength. \nThe augmented version came out part way through this and I find it stays around longer. I learned not to wash the ointment off, just to rinse with water in shower and pat dry. It helps to stop foreskin adhesion to glans. Betanovate is not strong enough for a initial treatment of LS although it is useful for maintenance and is the preferred steroid to facilitate stretching. Dermovate, which is materially stronger, tends to be the initial treatment for a month, twice a day. Thank you for sharing! I remember coming across a reddit post where a guy mentioned his white patches cleared up after a couple months use of betnovate betamethasone valerate 0.1 %, but I guess it is individual how we respond to treatment.", "Is this Lichen Sclerosus ? Hi all , my english is not so good so kindly pardon me for any grammatical errors. From two years I am experiencing itchy anus . Initially i assumed it to be worms and took Albendazole but it did'nt seems to work. Now i face itching at night . Is this Lichen Sclerosus ?  The white patches certainly look like lichen sclerosis to me. Go see your doctor and hopefully they can give you some treatment :) Thank you . I went to dermatologist today and he prescribed anti fungal tblet and sertaconazole nitrate and beclomethasone cream for 10 days . Wonderful! I hope you get better soon! Thank you :) Hi sir just checking up if your improvement is still going. \n\nI really that it is all over for good! How about now op? All good? Really reassuring.. may i know the name of the ointment?", "Signs of lichen sclerosus? I have been dealing with chronic irritation in my vulvar area for about a year now after three rounds of antibiotics for a uti. I have been checked for infections multiple times, and they always come back negative. I notice white stuff on my vulva, but the thing is it comes off and is not always there. Also my symptoms always feel better while on my period. Also steroid ointments always inflame me even more, so how would I even get treated for it?  Does this sound like the start of lichen sclerosus? It does not sound anything like my symptoms but your dr should be able to diagnose it if that is what it is. The white part is because of changes in the skin, like scar tissue, it is very taut. Okay thanks, yeah I am not sure its that then because it comes and go. Even if it is not LS, I definitely think you should bring it to your doc's attention. No need to keep suffering!! Is there a smell associated with the white stuff? You said it seems to go away during your period. What about sex... is it worse after sex? Does the white stuff seem creamy like lotion or clotty like cottage cheese? I know these questions are so gross, but there is a lot you can learn about your vulva and so much is normal. I dealt with infertility for years and took a fertility course and learned more than I knew I did not know. Try not to worry, but do not suffer needlessly. I have been to four different doctors and they are all stumped as to what it is. I had two tell me just by looking at it, that its a yeast infection and then when I get tested its negative. I have been treated for yeast multiple times with no improvement. Only in the beginning I felt any better, and then I did everything wrong and irritated my skin all over again and have never been back to 100 percent normal again. I have used steroid cream which has blistered me on the outer fold of my labia, and I was terrified to ever use one again. Then, I used a lower potency one when I was feeling better because I still had some pain, and it threw me back to square one almost. The white stuff is not always easy to come off, I feel like my vulvar skin is dry and the other day I used coconut oil which I have been told to use by my gyno, and it clumped a lot of the white stuff up, so I do not know if its because I have not been using it to give my skin a break and its just super dry or what.. Its mostly creamy though or sometimes like a toilet paper texture. Also its usually burns when my skin is provoked or from sweat. I feel like your story is very similar to mine. I have been struggling with this for 3 years now and it really did not get better.\nI try my best being positive but it is so hard because of the constant itching.\nI really hope that there is someone around here who can help You poor thing!! I had to see several doctors, who told me it was many things (I was treated for BV and yeast more times than I can count), but it never went away. I finally had one doc who did not examine me, but listened to my frustrations and gave me the clobetasol (sp?). She said she thought I probably had LS and just to try it and see if it offered any relief (which it did... finally). I mentioned this to my GP at my next annual and he said he did not think I had LS and did not see signs of it. I stopped telling people I used the cream unless it was relevant, so when I went for a biopsy a year ago on my vulva, I mentioned it to the gyno. He told me I was ridiculous.... said my light skin AND dark pigments were all because of vitiligo, that there was NO sign of LS, that I was imagining things, and that my pain/bleeding during sex was due to a small vagina and I needed to stretch it by having sex with my husband more. When I mentioned he was deployed, the gyno told me to get a dildo and use it often.\n\nSo, when I had to go back this past week, I requested a female to ensure I would not be seeing him again. As soon as she heard my symptoms, she said it sounded like LS. When she saw it, she confirmed it and my biopsy results have confirmed it once more. \n\nSometimes you have to keep going... uphill... in the snow... barefoot... fighting bears... until you finally get the answers you need. I am so very sorry you are suffering in the meantime.\n\n(if you are comfortable, try taking some pics when it is bad, so you can show the doc if things look okay when you finally are seen) It does get hard being positive, especially when every treatment you try does not work. I notice I barely itch and just have a more burning/raw feeling. The only thing I do not understand is why the other steroids I have used have not helped me at all? They always make me feel worse, and then after I stop using them, my skin starts to heal back up. Thanks for all your help though! Now I started to use a spray, it is called Cicaderm, it is something for idk, scars and bruises but it really calms my skin. \nBut again, this is not helping in the long run. Have you tried antihistamines for the itching?  No, do they work? Well, I recently saw an allergist and he said to use them for itching and steroids for a few days What kind did you use? Sounds frustrating to not know what is going on. Good luck I hope you figure it out soon! The first one I ever used was triamcinolone acetonide, and that is the one that blistered the inner crease of my labia. Then I used maybe two months ago clotrimazole betamethasone cream that my gyno prescribed me, and I did not put any in the crease bit and only on the inner labia and that did not really do much of anything and two weeks ago I got prescribed hydrocortizone 2.5% ointment which was the least potent of them all, and I used it for 5 days twice a day and at first it was okay, but then I got super irritated and red on my vulvar skin with tiny fissures and I even looked a bit puffy Thank you! Yeah, they tried the hydrocortizone with me. Big laugh. It is like trying to treat an accidental amputation with a bandaid. Seriously, when I finally reached a doctor who prescribed Clobetasol, that stuff was like a miracle. Advocate for yourself and see your doctor. You may well be dealing with LS, but either way, there is something happening that is making you miserable and you should not continue to suffer. Best of luck to you and please come back and update us!! It could be smegma, it is quite common, do u feel good after that white stuff comes off? If so then there is high chance that it is smegma It is not because it does not always come off. It looks more like mold spores or something.. I took a photo of it last night and I am not shocked why doctors think it is yeast, I am not sure what it is. Also my irritation comes and goes, it varies with my menstrual cycle. Three days before ovulation I am usually in the worse pain, and I get itchy, but then it tones down after I start to ovulate. On my period I feel the most normal. So I was not sure if it was a hormonal or a lichen problem since the white stuff does not always go away. I have an appointment with a dermatologist next week, so hopefully I get an answer finally if it is a skin issue It could be cyclical yeast , look it up n see if it is what u think it could be n yea lemme know what the docs say after the appointment And I do not think it is LS Yeah, I am not sure. I never tested positive for a yeast test yet, despite having all the symptoms Probably that cyclical yeast is causing a flare up n it clears up on its own,I think hormones can be the reason of overgrowth of yeast at certain times of the month , it is definitely not LS Will a dermatologist be able to treat it? I have been to multiple gynos and they have been of no help I think a dermatologist should be able to help Okay thanks for the help! Have you resolved this? I hope you are feeling better!", "Skin thinning - symptom? 21 male. The skin around my anus got very thin, and it tears and itch all the time. My doctor said I had an yeast infection even after seeing the white patches I have on my genital area.\nShe prescribed me an antifungal and hydrocortisone but it is not working at all, it is getting worse.\nI cannot afford a dermatologist at the moment.\nWhat to do? Is the skin thinning a common symptom of lichen sclerosus? \nCan it go back to normal? :( Hi- so sorry you are going through this! Yes, skin thinning and tearing is a symptom of LS (along with the white patches).  The itching is crazy - I have (47F) had LS in the same area and thought I just had massive swamp ass for a few months.\n\nUntil you can get to a dermatologist, try using a bidet or perianal bottle (common for post partum women but you can buy one on amazon for a couple bucks) to rinse after pooping so you do not have to wipe as much and risk aggravating it. A stool softener (not fiber) can be helpful to make sure you are not passing giant turds that can cause tearing and fissures.\n\nI have read some things on here about mitigating the itching with over the counter ointments but with the anus being connected to the digestive track, it can absorb things into your system that topical on the genitals will not so you have be cautious what sort of things you are putting in the area.  There is a powder called Anti-Mokey Butt that is used to control moisture in the area and helped me a bit with side effects from discomfort but it did not help with the itching.\n\nHang in there! If you cannot see a dermatologist, is there anyone you can see? Can you call the same doctor back and tell them the antifungal did not work, and you would like to try a stronger steroid? \n\nEven a generalist can write a prescription for clobetasol or tacrolimus. You might have persuade them on the diagnosis, but corticosteroids are not especially dangerous and have little abuse potential, so there is not much to lose with them going along with it. My GP finally prescribed me clobetasol 0.5% for the genital area, do you think it is safe to apply it around the anus too? The skin there is still very thin, she did not seem too concerned but honestly as a gay man, I am concerned. lol.", "Wife suddenly noticed the skin in the underbelly of my shaft has become white. I do not feel any itching or pain. So about three weeks ago my wife noticed a small patch on my shaft has become white, and today she noticed it became bigger. That is the only time she told me.\n\nI never noticed it as I do not really look at the underside of my penis. It does not hurt, does not itch and it is white.\n\nIs this possible LS? I do not believe LS normally affects the shaft. It is generally on the tip and foreskin around the tip. Maybe go see a dermatologist? Could be something like psoriasis. I think the places you mentioned are indeed more common, but LS can show up anywhere. \n\nIt could also be vitiligo, some yeast that does not happen to itch, etc. Psoriasis maybe, especially if it is scaly. I definitely second seeing a dermatologist or urologist Go to your doctor. LS does not typically itch in men.", "got to love it  If I send this to my vet friend, is she going to laugh?

Side note: I am a lesbian and I have never had penis penetration. \nThe second she looked down there, she started asking questions. Do I have irritation? Does it hurt? I could tell something was off. \nI told her I have been dryer recently and itchier, but attributed it to changing soaps and not wearing cotton underwear and using scented detergent. Everything I should not be doing. \nBut the itch has never been unbearable. My girlfriend notices that I scratch more than her, but I always have. Even since I was little. \n\nI had noticed I have a small opening before, but I figured it was from not being stretched out... for lack of better words. I have also noticed that I do not really have labia minora. Since putting my first tampon in in seventh grade I have noticed that but figured it was normal. I also casually told her how I tried a menstrual cup but could not get it in there or get it out (she said it could be due to LS). Lastly, back in high school, I had someone tell me that she does not think I have a clit. Could it have been fused over all the way back then?  Also, I am embarrassed to admit this, but I went through an long and extreme masterbating phase... even since I was too young to understand what I was doing. Like constantly rubbing it through my clothes. You can judge me. Could that have irritated it and caused this? I did not tell my gyno about that period of my life, but I was wondering if that could have irritated it? \n\nAnyway, she scared me a little. She said she saw dry irritated skin and white patches (which I still do not see) and my labia minora are fusing (which I thought was just my normal anatomy). I am pretty sure they have always been that way. I have seen this doctor twice before (back in 2015 and 2016) but she never mentioned this before. Could she have just missed it in the past? \n\nShe encouraged a biopsy that day (and wow ouch did it hurt). I was all for it because I trust her. Immediately prescribed clobetasol which I applied last night. I Woke up in the middle of the night itchy. Idk if it is a mental thing or the ointment made me itch.  \n\nAfter getting the interim diagnosis, my friend came over and we compared the sizes of our vagina (were clearly not very modest) and that is when I realized how small mine is. \n\nTLDR: I am scared and feel alone wondering if my vagina will completely close. Will the fused area ever become unfused? Should I use dilators or dildos to stretch it out? Could this be why people have trouble getting me off? I can to myself but it has to be much more aggressive than usual females. Feeling alone and so glad this group exists. Lastly, since I got the diagnosis so young, does it mean I am going to have it WAYYYY worse when I actually go through menopause and have decreased estrogen? \n\nSorry if it is tmi!! I just need to let out my thoughts and feelings and looking for any advice. At least your doctor properly diagnosed you.  Seems like I have read a lot of horrible doctor experiences here.\n\nHard to say what is going to happen.  LS seems to affect people differently, as in different levels of severity.  \n\nMaybe be regular about moisturizing with coconut oil or something and keep looking at yourself for changes?

I also have lichen planus in my mouth. Yay.", "Lichen Sclerosus Hello everyone,\n\nIam 22 two years old and I have always had pain during sex. I cannot remember having sex without pain at the beginning and most likely 2-3 day afterwards. Three years ago my skin started to itch really bad so I went to the doctor. She told me it was an mycosis several times. I changed the doctor several times because it was so bad. Than I got the diagnosis chlamydia. But the antibiotics did not help at all. I got diagnosed for several mycosis, bacteria and even herpes. My skin is burning, breaks during sex and itches like hell. The last doctor I saw told me about LS. She made a Pap test to see if there were any Bacteria. She found \u201cStaphlyokokken +++\u201d and gave me a new cream. It did not help. She told me because of the Staphylokokken, that LS was excluded. I finally have a doctors appointment in special clinic. They already told me in the telephone that they think it would be some form of Lichen. Iam really shocked and feel so uncomfortable. \n\nIs anybody here who had the same symptoms without any white patches ? I would be so glad to have a normal relationship with my boyfriend without having sex with pain. I cannot even imagine how nice that must be .. looking forward to some experiences from you. \n\nThanks a lot I have had LS for 8 years no white patches at all! I too was diagnosed with several different things. A dermatologist can do a biopsy and tell you without a doubt. My dermatologist treats my LS not my Gynecologist . So your dermatologist diagnosed you with LS with a biopsy ? Did you have similar symptoms ? How are your symptoms now? Controlled with Estrace and clobetesol ! But you must use it regularly! I have \u201c forgotten \u201c a few times and it comes right back quickly! My skin is burning, itching, sometimes red and lacerated. I also have pain during and after having sex I myself have had a sort of similar issue, doctors believed it was chlamydia gave me doxycycline to sort it but absolutely nothing was still there, I have the white patches and as gross as this is some sort of Scabbed white patches, because it is scar tissue of which when stretched too much causes a tear and this then leads on to pain when urinating, when moving, when having sex. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have an anomaly where I have pain in my testes which the doctors believed it was Epididymitis but again took the tablets to resolve that with no upheaval. They seem to think the two are linked but as they can not do anything to cure it they are giving myself a circumcision. I am not quite sure what they can do for a female unless   they cut the labia I am not sure Actually a surgeon did-and treated me-then I went to a dermatologist the next year. I understand completely!", "Borax? So I recently joined a couple Facebook LS support groups which has been interesting. A lot of the women swear by using a borax solution and soaking their affected areas with a cotton ball of the solution. I have done a little research and found mixed things about it because healthcare professionals do not recommend this. Still, it seems like borax was the only thing that reversed the fusing of the labia which I previously thought was irreversible. Has anyone ever heard of or tried the borax method? I want to be extra careful about putting anything on my vulva because it is already very sensitive, but the fusing of my labia minora and clitoral hood have always bothered me and if there is a way to reverse it then I am interested. That sounds like a terrible idea. I cannot imagine putting Borax on my skin. I use the Clobetasol and it works every time. I thought the same thing when I first read about it, but I am curious why people say it works so well. I use the clobetasol and estradiol creams and they have relieved pretty much all of the itching but I still cannot have sex and my labia minora is still fused. Up until now, I did not think the fusing was reversible. Borax is essentially just a water softener. Some people have amazing luck with it and some do not. Every  body is so different. If you are interested in trying I would try 1/4th cup in a full warm bath. If you find it irritating stop!! Some people have their skin peel just to reveal healthy pink skin underneath. So if that starts happening do not be too alarmed! Dr\u2019s do not recommend anything that tends to be more natural. Most in the west will not even recommend a diet change to help with autoimmune issues. So take them not recommending it with a grain of salt. Borax is ok on skin when diluted, but I am not sure about the vulva. It makes no sense to me that it would \"reverse\" fusing of the labia though. From what I understand, fusing means that scar tissue has bridged both sides of the labia and its essentially grown into one continuous piece if flesh. You would need surgery to fix that. That seems consistent with what I have seen and known. My labia minora are so fused to the rest of my vulva that it seems like they are just one piece of skin though it seems like a lot of the people who have used borax have noticed unfusing which I cannot wrap my head around. \ud83d\ude31 Sorry I am late in replying but I joined those groups too and was not sure what to think of that particular suggestion. Maybe it helps fusing if done early enough?  I highly doubt it would completely reverse a really bad case though, as the other comments have talked about. \nIt also just seems like it is used for cleaning, right? Just does not seem like the best thing to put on such sensitive skin. But hey, if it worked for them cool. Maybe if I am desperate I might try it but I am lucky that I am not that desperate yet! I stopped using Clob because it is a steroid and it makes your skin even thinner with continuous use.  I started soaking in Borax and the itching subsided IMMEDIATELY.  No longer was I kept up at night by the insane itching, and no longer was I paying excessive amounts of money for expensive creams that only worked for a limited time before the itching came back.\n\nI finally mustered up the courage to drink it - very much diluted - (1 tsp per liter of water.) But I have not noticed anything other than the itching reduced.  I have been soaking in a sitz bath (I got a plastic thing on line that I put over the toilet seat and use 2Tbsp per quart of water) and some of my fusing is starting to become unattached.  I have only been doing this for a month and am very happy with my success.  \n\nI hope to cure it completely with a one time laser treatment by a Dr. in Tallahassee, Fl who claims to have success with this TULIP treatment.  I plan on going there after my job contract ends.  Right now, the Borax is helping tremendously.  I really love my job, and want to stay employed for as long as I can, but the upside of my job ending will be my ability to get the treatment which I believe will cure me. I only wish I started this sooner - or read about it sooner.  I am new to experiencing fusing, as it only started with me a few months back, but now I am soaking twice a day.  It does not burn me at all.  I was afraid, at first - but when it completely relieved my itching, I was sold.  Now I am starting to drink it.  I do not drink it every day - I am easing into it.", "Birth control and LS I got diagnosed after almost 2 years of dryness, tears and pain. I just finished my 6 week clobetasol treatment after the weaker steroid cream did not work. Last night while putting in my nuvaring after the shower I had the biggest tear (about 2cm in length) and the clob hurt so much to put on that I could not sleep. \n\nBut my question is: Is there any correlation between birth controls and the amount of hormones in them with LS? \n\nI saw a post on another space saying that they stopped the nuvaring cause it caused dryness. I like the ring because I have really a really irregular sleep schedule (shout-out 12hr nursing shifts) and WOULD NOT be able to take the pill the same time everyday, I have tried before but just cannot. I am also not a fan of the weight gain from the pill that I do not get with the ring. Also tried the IUD but was spotting nearly everyday for 4 months so got it removed. I need something that can allow me to skip my period or at least make it regular and light because pads and tampons make my LS so much worse. I am 23 years old and this has been such a shitty thing to deal with and really affects my mental health. I lost a relationship last year because my libido was so low and my ex did not understand even though I tried so hard to explain LS to him (I even sent him to this subreddit). He ended up having sex with someone else because he said he did not feel like he was attractive to me which really messed me up \n\nPS now that I have this tear, should I be putting on clob 2x a day till it gets better? Or should I not? I honestly feel like the clob just makes it worse with the amount of burning. I also have the weaker hydrocortisone cream left if that would be better", "Nerisone forte Was prescribed in january and got better. LS got better but just saw my doctor again and he says its gone back to how it was. \n\nHas put me on it again\n\nAnyone else used this before?

I have have an irritated vulva/labia for 6 months. It itches, feels dry, and the inside of my labia/vagina burn with urination. I also sometimes feel like my clit is aching. My vulva is usually a fire hydrant red from the irritation. Initially I had BV then yeast, but now for months I have tested negative. Dr said try coconut oil but that did not help. I tried terazol on the vulva for external yeast and it did not help much. I cut all products and that did not help. Tried clotrimazole with betamethasone and that helped externally, but not with the burning pee. \n\nDr now says maybe LS? Has anyone been diagnosed without the white patches? Can this be internal (like in the inner labia/vagina area?). Can clobetasol be apply inside the labia/vaginal entrance?\n\nThank you in advance!! I am so confused. Yeah it is possible to have LS without white patches, or patches that are quite hard to see. It could be that your doc is seeing some whitening that is not visible to you because it is hard to get a good look down below. Your symptoms sound consistent with LS.\n\nYou should not put clob inside of the vagina, ointments do not play nice in there. You should clarify with your doc about using it between the inner labia (the vestibule), personally my doc gave me a testosterone/estradiol ointment for that area. If you have burning inside your vagina, it is unlikely that it is caused by the LS. It sucks, but if you have one problem with your genitals, you are more likely to have another condition as well. I also have pain inside and was diagnosed with Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis, which is treated with an internal cream of hydrocortisone and clindamycin. It is a good idea to ask your doc about the internal pain, because it is probably a different problem. This is really helpful. Thank you!", "Lichen and PCOS - Clinical Trials/Research I was diagnosed with lichen sclerosis and PCOS a few years ago. Both lichen and PCOS are incurable and I know more research is needed.

This was no fun and I immediately started to receive medication for it. Unfortunately for me the medicine is really messing with my head and making me feel quite ill. On top of that I noticed I had started to develop these white patches on my glands and shaft. After doing a lot of research and speaking with my doctor, we both agreed that it was probably Lichen Sclerosis. He prescribed me .05 Clobetasol propionate and told me to apply it once a day for a month. \nI do not have any itching, but I have had some urinary retention for the past couple of years. I did some research and found out that Lichen Sclerosis can cause urinary strictures. So now I am panicking because I think I may need urethroplasty to fix my urethra and I do not see any of the white spots disappearing. I have an appointment scheduled with a dermatologist in about a month and am currently trying to see a urologist. Not sure if I have any questions here but if anyone has any advise, words of wisdom, positive experience, I would appreciate it. I am scared as heck and have never been so depressed in my life. Hey, female 21 years old and I was diagnosed a year ago. I think your best bet right now is to keep using the clobetasol consistently as your doctor advises. I know it seems like progress is slow, but your skin can improve slowly over time.  Try not to think too much about if the white patches are disappearing but rather how you are feeling and if the flaring/itching is better. I know it is hard not to get overly fixated on this issue, but all the worrying is not going to get us anywhere!! It is definitely not easy living with LS but you are doing your best and that is more than enough. Hope your skin improves soon! Good luck :) Hang in there, dude. It will be ok, one way or the other. It is so hard to deal with autoimmune issues as such a young age. But you can do this. You can overcome this. Treat your body with the utmost respect. Eat healthy. Get good sleep. Drink lots of water. Get back to the basics. Hey mate\n\n\nI got it when i was 23, worst thing ever. Happened when i was unbelievably stressed. Docs say its to do with your urine, but though it may play a part i dont know if that causes LS.\n\nBasically i try keep the glans as dry as possible and then put some ointment on it. I use mix of coconut oil, olive oil and tea tree oil. \n\nIve also been freaking about the strictures etc but im really hoping that doesnt happen.

I am circumcised so I am kind of an a oddball it seems. Also, I am already having post-dribble, just hoping that is not related to the LS right now.

But that is happened all my life. \n\nJust when i was stressed this happened.\n\nTheyre telling me to get circumcised as it will help but i really dont get how, and nor do they!\n\nThey say it looks like it works but we dont know why, and theres many people on forums who tried and it didnt work or they were already circumcised.

Hi everyone. \n\nSo my situation is this - had a mild case of phimosis my whole life, did not cause any pain or functional problems. Finally decided to sort it out for aesthetic reasons.

The phimosis has not come back, foreskin is still loose.\n\nGP said it cannot be LS because it affects the glans and is itchy. sent me to a urologist, who said he did not know what it was, told me i do not need a circumcision, and did not help beyond that. \n\nI suppose as a result of the stretching I did, it could be stretch marks/scarring/dead skin replaced by new underneath? but i have seen others on here report that their LS started similarly to mine. \n\nNo tightening, no itching, no pain, just weird small patches of skin on the frenulum and in a ring around the foreskin, which are whiter, drier, and slightly bumpy compared to the surrounding skin. Does this sound familiar to anyone? any other ideas or advice? \n\nthanks very much in advance. i have another Dr\u2019s appointment by phone in a month (with the same guy who was not much help before). then it will probably be a long wait for a dermatologist, which is probably what should have happened before instead of a urologist. extremely frustrating trying to get this diagnosed and treated. if it was an STD there is free walk in clinics everywhere constantly, doctors seem to not know much about this issue and also dismissive and nonchalant about it. \n\nthanks for reading if anyone has any advice or similar experience let me know! you have ls, i have same symptoms and i got diagnosed immediately after a derm looked at it, also the glans is the most common place I am pretty sure I have LS and I have no itching or redness.

Cannot retract my foreskin but otherwise everything works fine, thankfully.\n\nI recently read about tacrolimus and other similar immunosuppressive based treatments. Brought this up with my GP who checked with dermatologists but they determined that it was unlikely to be useful for me, due to the scar tissue caused by stretching attempts before I knew it was LS &amp; the LS itself apparently. Of course I understand and accept that they have determined it is unlikely to work, however I would still like to try as it is basically my last non-surgical option... they were totally against prescribing it for me.\n\nWhich leaves me with this post - I am considering trying to get this prescription privately. Has anyone had any luck getting something like tacrolimus privately as it is not licensed by the NHS for LS treatment. Or, more generally, does anyone have any recommendations for companies or methods to get a private prescription without having to jump through a million hoops.", "Hypopigmentation question Hello everyone,\nDoes the white patches/discoloration going to fade away with the treatment? \nI have no symptoms rn, besides some spots of hypopigmentation (one really white) around the vulva.\n\nI am really concern that I will never get my skin color back to normal, and kind of makes my depressed.\n\nDid anyone of you got lucky on this? \n\nTysm It can take a few months, but yes the color should return if you are sticking to your treatment plan/avoiding your triggers :)", "Doctors appointment Hi everyone! \nIam really afraid of my doctors appointment in a special clinic on Thuesday and I do not know who to share it with.

That is why I cannot imagine having LS.. can somebody maybe give me some advice ?\n\nThanks a lot You can have LS without any white patches. I have none but I definitely have LS. Good luck to you!! I hope you get a diagnosis and some treatment plan soon! Do not be afraid of getting LS- there is a very helpful topical steroid and little changes you can make to start feeling better quickly. It is best to get it diagnosed now, so go in there and tell everything to your doctor, and build a relationship with your doctor. Do not hold anything back. LS is not sauced by anything you did to yourself. It is so good that you are going to a specialist!! I have recently been diagnosed. I had five \"specialists\" tell me they could not see white patches but the final doctor said she could. I had a biopsy which really is not anything to be afraid of but can be really helpful.

You should definitely see a dermatologist as soon as you can. \n\nIf it is LS, the good news is it is very treatable. You would receive a strong steroid ointment, clobetasol propionate. With that, it is important to follow directions to the tee, because it is a fine line between enough steroids to treat the LS and too much, which causes bad side effects. Make sure to ask exactly where to apply it and how much to apply. \n\nAnd yes, I would avoid the antibacterial soap unless a doctor instructs you to use it. People with skin conditions need to use mild, high fat soaps like the Dove bars. Indeed ... go to a dermatologist asap. It can be stopped, but damage already done is hard to reverse. So do it fast. Cannot tell on the picture, but are you cut? \nNormally men who had a circ at birth do not get it. Looks similar to what I have, cannot share photos since I am a minor but you will just have to take my word for it.\n\nGood news is that it seems like it is mostly just in your foreskin area and not all over the head like some people. This means like me, you have a more mild case which is much kore treatable and probably barely has any pain.

I have all the creams... I used tacrolimus and pimecrolimus daily. But I am not really sure what lichen sclerosus is??? Or what it even looks like in a circumcised guy. I have red marks under the head of my penis that kind of look like lichen planus on one side, and on the other side I had it biopsoed as eczema. The new biopsy was a tiny white patch that was pretty asymptomatic.\n\nIll get these blister looking things that pop up after sex sometimes, then the swelling goes down and it leaves a red patch for a couple days and it feels like paper cuts. That is only happened twice so far. But that is not even what I had biopsied! The biopsied part was asymptomatic for the most part... \n\nI am early stage so I am not entirely sure where I am supposed to be putting this steroid, do I only use it when the \"fake blisters\" pop up?\n\nI have one section of my foreskin scar that is swollen permanently it would seem. Do I put steroids on that? I am just kind of confused about the whole thing\n\n It would be helpful if this forum included pictures because the internet is not really helpful... Not sure if this is helpful or not, but prior to getting classic symptoms (pale coloring, white band, inelastic skin, etc) my earliest symptoms were what looked like a red \"friction burn\" after sex. The skin tore really easily and took ages to heal (freaked my wife out at one point). I believe that may be what really early LS looks like. It seems to start at the top layer and work much deeper. Over about 6 months without treatment the skin thickened, turned pale, a distinct white band appeared on the foreskin, and the phimosis got progressively worse to the point where I could not retract it when not erect. The topical steroid worked wonders though.\n\nRegarding the ointment, I started out pretty daintily applying it but eventually just covered the whole tip and inside the foreskin. The key is to try and keep the steroid in place as long as possible, it gets lost pretty easily throughout a normal day, moving around, using the washroom etc. I applied it twice a day for the first month, + reapplying after showers, workouts etc.\n\nRegarding the cuts, I did have a section of the penis tip split, partially heal, thicken, but not fully heal for the first 6 months. After about 2 months of Clobetasol it did fully heal though and is no longer visible. That is actually very helpful, thank you. I had one small white spot and still have friction burns. I am cut so I never got as far as phimosis but I did get a white band where my scar was, no tightening though. I have not really experimented with steroids too much as the paleness freaked me out, but I have had a lot of luck with tacrolimus seems to keep it from getting worse. The friction burn never seemed to go away though, but it seems less irritated", "General treatment plans for male? 99% sure i have LS but I do not have health insurance and I am in college so the cost of a doctor visit would be too much.

There is a  .0000003% chance of this happening to me. \n\nI have been getting tossed around from dermatologist to dermatologist for 8 months. Started with UTI like symptoms and a friction burn from sex and I was not able to shower right away. On one side, there was a horizontal tear.. on the other,, the friction turned to lichen planus looking lesions. Had a biopsy done on the first lesion, came back as eczema/atopic dermatitis. Was prescribed pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. \n\nThen the white spot appeared. Its painful.. probably the diameter of a qtip handle. I told the doctor I have had eczema and it feels nothing like this, this is actual pain not itch. I get diagnosed as a hypochondriac and get told to go get a second opinion after 10 visits. \n\nFinally get in with new doctor after 3 months. Seems promising, and he says it may be lichen planus but if my original biopsy showed eczema then he agreed with that.\n\nFast forward to the follow up a month later, they have stopped taking my insurance and tell me an hour before I am set to get my biopsy done. I pay out of pocket and am pretty much scolded by the new doctor because \"a new biopsy will not change anything, it is either lichen planus or eczema and the treatment is the same.\" And when I insisted on a biopsy for my sanity after 8 months, pretty much just insisted I was an idiot and to accept the previous diagnosis.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks, im exposed to COVID. They are out of instant tests and they give me the PCR. They tell me to log into one of those portals that has all your medical records on it. While checking for my COVID status, I saw the biopsy results from 2 WEEKS AGO. It read:\n\n\"The reaction is pauci-inflammatory and indicative of early lichen sclerosis in the appropriate clinical setting.\"\n\nThe doctor did not even call to tell me. He sent a prescription for Desonide 0.05% cream to the pharmacy, which my insurance also did not cover.\n\nI have been on a downward spiral from a brain injury I received in 2019 that was just getting better when this started. I cant even get a doctor to call me back. I just want to cut this one small spot out before it spreads somewhere else since I cannot have a circumcision. \n\nI have no girlfriend, no wife, no kids, and quite frankly no real reason to live right now. I have spoken to 3 dermatologists and a urologist and nobody wants to help me, I just do not get it. Quite frankly, I wish my brain injury had been just a little bit harder so I would not have to ride the downward spiral that came after. \n \n\nI would be willing to bet that there is not one single birth circumcised guy that has this in this group and everything j say has fallen upon deaf ears.. the only thing keeping me from putting a bullet between my eyes is wanting to make a few more paintings before I go. But the second there is urethral involvement, or any of that shit is suggested, im out. \n\nIs there anyway to stop this from getting worse? Does it spread whenever you have sex?

Hey dude. 36 male here, I am also healthy and in shape..I was also circumcised in childhood. My dick was completely healthy until this year when I started to feel trouble peeing. Turns out that it seems that I have lichen sclerosus in my urethra (no biopsy though so I cannot say I have it 100%). I also have meatal stenosis.

Hi everyone! \n\nI was diagnosed with VLS about 6 months ago at 25yrs old after suffering for almost 3 years. I am still required to apply my clob twice a day, my last check in with my doctor we discovered some really thin skinned areas on my upper/inner thighs (where my thighs touch and if I am not wearing underwear, would get clob on it) \n\nI know from this Reddit that not wearing underwear as much as you can helps, but my clob just kept spreading, especially when I slept. So I started to wear underwear again trying to contain it. But I still wake up with my inner thighs feeling like they have the cream on them, even with underwear on and it is resulting in my skin thinning in that area. \n\nHow can I make sure it is not spreading into areas it is not supposed to? I am thinking of buying mens briefs to make sure that my inner thigh area is covered but I doubt I would find a pair that fit properly... is there anything else that you guys recommend? \n\nPs. This subreddit has saved me. Thank you all so much for coming together and supporting each other. I would be so lost and I am so grateful for all the information you have shared &lt;3 Boys shorts briefs might help? (UK term I dunno what they are haha!) There is loads of different types of clob. If it gets thin you can downgrade to a slightly weaker one Maybe apply vaseline on the inner thigh as barriers so that no clob touches them? \n\nAs for treating the thinning just avoiding further contact should get rid of them i guess Vaseline and briefs are both good ideas to prevent this. Also, how are your LS symptoms? Do you think that 2x a day is still necessary, have you seen improvement? After being on clob 2x a day for 4 months, I developed Cushing's symptoms. As I understand it this is quite rare, but I still get concerned reading something like this. Maybe you could apply it earlier, an hour or so before you go to bed, to give it a chance to soak in? \n\nI got \"boy shorts\" from a site called TomboyX. They are pretty comfortable but they were a little pricey. I also got some adorable plaid boxers from Hanes, sized for boys (not men) but they were not actually cotton as advertised and they have a seam down the crotch, so they were *very* uncomfortable. If anyone has found a good source for smaller-sized vulva-friendly 100% cotton boxers at a good price please let me know! Omgsh I have never heard of Cushings Syndome until now and I am convinced I have it. Thanks for this I will be bringing it up to my doctor!  \n\nMy symptoms have been put at bay but I just saw my doctor a few days ago and she said to continue with twice a day. Thank you! I will look out for some boy shorts :) This sounds like a great idea! I will start doing this. Thank you! An hour before bed works but I also have to apply in the morning and cannot just sit and let it soak. Unfortunately it happens during the day too. Ah that makes sense. Another thing you might consider trying is thigh-high stockings that would cover and protect your thighs. I have a garter belt to keep them from sliding down but there are other methods, too. I got them so I could keep my legs warm without covering my vulva in non-breathable leggings, but if they fit well maybe they would help keep off the clob as well. I would not want to sleep in them but they could be helpful during the day. Mine told me to keep it up, then I developed massive purple striae across my inner thighs, butt, and hips almost overnight. Now I have been off for two months and I am waiting for the results from urine and blood tests. No idea what I am going to do since the only treatment for one disease causes me to get another disease. Good luck. Yeah it is very frustrating. Good luck to you as well! Maybe talk to your Doctor about a weaker steroid. I use betamethasone cream. are you using a pea sized amount and rubbing it in properly ? for a full minute ? i also use finger cots to protect my fingertips from applying. i sit with my legs wide open for a few minutes after application, then i put on underwear right away and go about my day. i use such a small amount that after a few minutes it is totally soaked in and it does not rub off on my undies and it also protects my thighs. i hear the cream is not as good as the ointment; i use the ointment and it is really worked for me with no thinning. my white spot has disappeared in only two months and everything feels and looks normal there. if you are experiencing thinning, you may be using too much steroid or if you really need that much to control your case, maybe ask your doctor about a less potent steroid ? my gyn said the \u201csoaking\u201d for hours thing is a myth, the steroid is absorbed completely within 20 minutes apparently\n\nyou could also vaseline your thighs, or buy garters ! they have those thigh bands you can use to prevent chafing when you run, slide them on up and they should protect your thighs ... like this ! Bandelettes Patented Trademarked Original Elastic Anti-Chafing Thigh Bands  That almost happened to me too. I developed a bit of a \u201cpadding\u201d on the top of my back (my neurologist noticed while she was looking at my neck). Around the same time I developed a slight swelling of my thyroid. I went off of it immediately and it went away. My gynecologist said it was impossible; I do not know why. I only use it now on occasion Yep I got the buffalo hump too. The doc who prescribed it also said it was impossible. But my PCP thinks differently. !!Vaseline or Aquaphor works great!!!", "Is this lichen sclerosus on the upper portion of my urethral opening?

I have had all sort of dick problems this past year - doctors have done blood tests, physical examinations and cannot see anything wrong. I have an appointment with a urologist in 2 months because of a suspected urethral stricture. I am a 27 year old male. \n\nNow my latest complication seems to be LS (i think so anyway). Out of nowhere white spots have apperead on my glans - sometimes they are not visible, but when they are they are always the same spots (and recently, more). \n\nI live in the UK, I am not sure if I am able to find a private clinic that will give me a diagnostic on the spot (will look into though - just assuming worst case scenario). By the time I go through my GP, get referred to a dermatologist and be seen I am expecting about 2 months. \n\nA. Is this something that cannot wait 2 months and I should do everything in my can to be seen as soon as physically possible? \n\nB. Does it sound like i have LS? \n\nC. Do the white spots ever go?\n\nD. How likely is it that I will develop penile cancer and end up getting my penis surgically cut off? Well im a 30yo male that was diagnosed with LS at age 29 last fall.   One of the first things that i noticed was wrong with my genitals was my urine stream became anything but straight over a year before I had any pigment loss, itching, bumps growing on my skin, or other symptoms.  My urologist just brushed off the issue as nothing to worry about.  It wasnt untill over a year later when I developed all the usual LS symtoms that I got diagnosed with LS and realized the issues with my ureathra were probably related to LS.\n\nWhen I started getting pigment loss, pruritus, pain with intercourse etc. I went to my regular dermatologist.  She gave me a preliminary diagnosis of vitiligo and referred me to another dermatologist specializing in pigment disorders who made the LS diagnosis.  I hear genital dermatologists deal with LS patients the most, so if your symptoms progress I would try getting a referral in that direction.  \n\nRight now you may not have enough other symptoms to make a diagnosis and get teatment, but keep an eye on things and make sure you know what to look out for as far as other LS symptoms.  You did mention all sorts of other dick problems though.  Some of those things may be relevant to LS and worth mentioning to your doctor.  If you share some of those other symptoms with us here we may be able to tell you which ones would be worth mentioning to your doctor in the context of LS. \n\nBumps may be able to go away if you use the right treatment and you dont let your symptoms continue to develop without treatment for too long.  And I would try not to worry about the cancer risk too much.  I believe the increased risk of genital cancers is usually associated with late stage and untreated LS.  It sounds like if you have LS at all, you are just approaching the early stages. Hi, thanks for this write-up! \n\nMy dick problems include ED, perceived urine blockage at the tip of my penis (difficult to start stream but once started it is fine), dribbling &amp; weak urine, and now this - a few tiny white spots with some mild itching.   \n\n\n&gt;Right now you may not have enough other symptoms to make a diagnosis and get teatment \n\nSo it likely has to get worse before someone can do something about it? From what I have read treatment just stops symptoms from getting worse but does not necessarily reverse it? \n\nI am going to try and get seen by a specialist - what do you suggest I do in the meantime? I have Dermol 500 and hydrocortisone cream for an unrelated eczema condition - dermol 500 would be harmless I am sure but bit uncertain about using hydrocortisone. The white spots may be enough for an exerienced Dr.   to recognize as LS.  Getting a diagnosis early is important. \nYou should still try to see if you have enough symptoms for a doctor experienced with LS to make a visual diagnosis.  Early treatment and diagnosis with LS is pretty important.\n\nThe issues with urination could be LS related or they could be related to something completely different.  If you have any pigment loss on your urethra, then I would say LS is likely.  Have you tried looking at your skin with a UV light? That can help a lot with making the areas with pigment loss more noticeable.  \n\nIn the meantime, try to keep bodily fluids from contacting the skin on your genitals by waiting around for that last drip, or whatever you have to do.. (the fluids dont cause LS but peole find that they tend to make symptoms worse).\n\n\n\nAnd lasty, try not to panic or let your mind dwell on the worst case scenarios like cancer and stuff. Chances of LS developing into cancer are pretty slim if you treat the LS. Many people here report that stress can trigger flares in their LS symptoms though, so keep that in mind also. Thank you I am going to call a specialist today. Do you mind telling me about your symptoms/treatment?", "Can I use hydrocortisone for longer than a week? My doctor thinks I may have LS and prescribed me hydrocortisone to try and arranged a follow up in 3 weeks time. Tomorrow is a week and on the box it says use for a maximum of a week. I am struggling to get hold of my doctor (complicated NHS story) and am unsure whether he wants me to use it for all 3 weeks or not.\n\nI felt like it was helping, but I used aqueous cream to wash (he said it would be fine) which caused irritation on the glans - apparently this can happen if its not washed away properly and is a known thing with LS. What does everyone else wash with?\n\nThanks! You should only wash with water and preferably no more than once a day. I am not a doctor but I do not think it should be a problem. Corticosteroid creams do cause skin thinning and potentially abnormal cells but over decades of use, not weeks. As an example, from what I understand, of one avenue of LS treatment is to use clobetasol 0.05% (much stronger than typical over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream 1%) 2x/day for 3 months then every other day for a few weeks and taper down even more after. Ok thanks, I will do that :) Ok thanks that is great to know! I am still going to try and get some confirmation but that puts my mind at ease a bit :) Clobetasol is known more commonly as dermovate in the UK, and it is normally what is prescribed for LS. I am not sure if this has already been arranged, but GPs should refer patients to gynaecology in most cases. put hydrocort on ur poosey please", "New Years With LS Hey friends! \n\nI just wanted to share a little accomplishment with my community.

I stay very tender in the creases (one side worst) of my labias. Like right between where they meet. I have darkness and fordyce spots there and I always have pain to the touch there. Sometimes it is like, I will touch it and it sticks to my fingers. The skin is very thin i can tell, but it is never torn or bled. There is no bumps that look abnormal or lesions. It is been like this for 6+ months. It reminds me of my excema pain, but no itching at all. Just soreness when i touch it. I can walk and sit fine. I also feel like it gets worse when i apply Vaseline or ointment. It is better dry. I have also tried 2% lidocaine gel and it does very little. Could be the muscles, but the inside of my vagina does not hurt at all. Any input? I have been tested for bv, yeast, all that and my doc says everything looks fine and all major stds (except herp and hpv, but I go to the gyno yearly for paps).\n\nIdk what to do anymore.. I have not had sex in 3 years so I do not suspect an std but idk Tenderness in the creases would be quite common. Best way to tell though is to look to see is the skin more pale than the rest of the surrounding skin, anywhere on your vulva? Intense itching is a symptom. If it is LS, Vaseline will not help the itch, but a strong steroid clobesterol cream will. Can you get checked by a gynecologist? It is hard to tell because I am black :( but I do have a patch that is much lighter than the rest of my vulva right above it that is also very tender No, LS does not always itch. Some people feel no symptoms at all; they only have changes in appearance. And some people get bad symptoms with hardly any changes in appearance, which can make it hard to diagnose. In your case, if you do not have any white patches yet, it might be hard to get the diagnosis. But, some doctors will let you try a steroid ointment anyway, just to see if it helps. Especially when the yeast etc. has already been ruled out. \n\nBy the way, pain on touch is called provoked vulvodynia. A vulvar clinic or a pelvic clinic might be able to help diagnose and treat it, especially if it does not go away after trying the steroid ointment. I would definitely go to your gynecologist and ask for a specialist. I think they can take a biopsy to be sure. The tenderness will improve if you get the right cream. Any lighter spots like you describe would make me think LS, but GPS are not specialised enough to notice it.", "Complications, alarming discharge Hi guys, due to my LS as it is quite severe I constantly struggle with BV.

I googled it but it said it was an sti called trich (literally impossible for me to have, been well over 3 years since I have been able to get intimate with my partner due to LS :( so deffo is not that). I have never had this before and I have not been able to get time off work to go to the Drs. Any ideas what this could be? I am panicking about it \ud83d\ude41 thanks Does it smell bad or come with any new symptoms (itching, burning etc.)? Either way it does not sound like a reason for too much worry, but I would make an appointment when you can if it persists along with any symptoms.\n\nTrich can hang out for a long time without causing symptoms, and then eventually cause symptoms, so it is actually possible to have trich even if you have not been sexually active for a long time. And rarely, it can be transmitted other ways besides sex. The good thing about trich is it is easy to treat, and mostly a nuisance unless you are pregnant (in which case it can cause serious problems.)  Still, I do not think yellow discharge is necessarily specific to trich, or even necessarily abnormal.", "Just diagnosed with Lichen - I am a 27 (m) Just went to a great urologist today who saw my member and instantly diagnosed it as BXO/LS.\n\nI started developing white patches on my glands about 6 months ago and has progressively gotten worse. Also some white on my foreskin which is getting a bit tight. I am not circumcised. He prescribed me Clob. I will be updating you guys.\n\nNGL I am a bit freaked out as I want the white patches to go away and just want an all around normal penis. I will let you guys know. \n\nGlad I found this community. Give me hope and some peace.\n\nGod bless everyone! As you have probably read the Clob takes a while to work. It really does take 2-3 weeks before there is significant progress so dont get bummed out after the first few days. \n\nI started out applying Clob quite sparingly at first but shifted to applying it a little bit more liberally. It seemed to stay on a bit better throughout the day. Thanks for the input! Fingers crossed. Hey man. Hope things improve for you. Did your doctor prescribe you clob easily? I went two weeks ago and he thought I had thrush and prescribed me cream to treat that but it is made no difference, in fact my white patches have worsened. I am back tomorrow so I think I really need to push him to let me try clob. I am certain this is LS at this point. Yes they did. They looked at it for like 5 seconds and said looks like BXO/LS and prescribed it to me.  It was my first time at a urologist so I was just glad they diagnosed it so quickly and I did not have to go to 5 other Drs to get prescribed something. Thought I would share an update. Even though it is been only less than a week of using Clob. The top layer of the white thin skin is slowly peeling off. The skin under the peeling skin looks like new pink skin. A little too early to tell but I am feeling optimistic that it is working. Stand by for more updates! Thanks for the update Any further improvement? Also thanks for the update. Currently seeking options as I have also been annoyed with the white patches. Hey. I still have the white patches. The biggest improvement I have seen though is the patches looking healthier &amp; stronger and not as dry. Seems to be reverting back to more normal skin but there still is discoloration. Not sure if it will ever go away but it is only been 1 month so fingers crossed. Thanks for following up! Any updates? Any further progress? Have any photos you can share?", "Biopsy results- \u201cmild lichenification\u201d Does this mean lichen sclerosis? The derm said the result is unclear :(", "For the men. When using steroid cream, did any of you notice the skin around the glans or inside of the foreskin becoming a lot more dry? I know dryness is good for stopping LS but its concerning how when retracting the foreskin now, its literally peeling off the glans? Not sure it is good for long term skin health? Is it the white patchy skin that seems to be peeling? Is it generally healthy skin? Or, apologies, is it a build-up due to being unable to clean thoroughly?\n\nI found that when my LS was first starting to take hold I had quite dry white patches on the outside of my foreskin, which would eventually come off and lead to worse thickened white patches underneath. But that is not to say yours will be the same. So when I say peeling, I mean the skin of the foreskin is having to peel from the glans because its dry and stuck. It is not damaged. It is like their no moisture or lubrication Oh, ha, my bad. Yeah I have no idea about that I am afraid. I did notice peeling yes. A very thin layer of skin on the glans did slowly peel off over a few weeks time. It was slow enough that it was not concerning to me, similar to a minor sun burn (but not at all like a major sunburn).\n\nThe skin was not dry though, especially give that the Clob has vaseline in it.", "Biopsy still bleeding. Is it normal? I just had my vulvar biopsy almost 3 hours ago and it is still bleeding. Should i worry? How much blood and what color is it? Few drops, probably more if I did not apply some pressure. The color was bright red OK some spotting is normal after biopsy so I am glad to hear it is not a lot. Keep an eye on it though, and if it continues another day, call the office just to be sure. If you are concerned now, maybe call them anyway so you can have some piece of mind. Many of the folks that had biopsies I know said there was some bleeding the first couple days, but that it was more like spotting.", "Case report &amp; question: Any experience with preventing circumcision? Hey! \n\nFirst of all, I love you all am very thankful for finding this subreddit. \n\nI am a 30 old male, I was just diagnosed with LS (only by looking, no biopsy yet) and I think I had the disease for more than 10 years at this point. \n\n7 years ago I visited a urologist who did not know the disease but subscribed me cortisone/anti-fungal cream nonetheless. It worked wonders, all my white patches disappeared and the phimosis (which I had since I have been a child I think?) got way better, too - to the point where I could retract my foreskin easily unerect and \u201chalf-erect\u201d, but not when fully erected. But after just 1 or 2 months I found this to be surprisingly successful. However I stopped the treatment as soon as the cream was empty.\n\nFast forward 7 years to now, not treating it at all for all those years, white patches came back and phimosis worsened a bit again(it is possible but uncomfortable to retract the foreskin unerect), so I went to a dermatologist who immediately identified the disease and recommended a biopsy and circumcision, no conservative therapy. I insisted on trying a cortisone cream again, and she allowed it, but said I should come back in 3 weeks to do/talk about the biopsy.\n\nI would like to know if you guys had any success with treating LS with creams only, since I thought it went so well 7 years ago, and immediately doing a circumcision seems kind of harsh to me. Especially since I do not have any symptoms apart from the slight phimosis (which does not create any problems for me during sex etc) and the skin/color does not bother me or my girlfriend.\n\nIn my mind, using a cream for the rest of my life to keep everything in check is less harmful than a biopsy+surgery, but I am also a very anxious person and never had surgery. Still I see more and more articles getting released that say, circumcision should not be done in any case and a recent study apparently said that people are who use corticoid creams have no increased cancer risk.\n\nI would like to know if anyone in this forum have any experience with creams for a long period of time and opted against circumcision or any other input you guys have. I do not have personal experience with penile LS, but based on what I have read, maintenance treatment with a steroid or tacrolimus/pimecrolimus etc. is a totally valid treatment option. Especially since it worked for you in the past, I would guess that it is likely to work again; you might just need to continue it at a low frequency for the foreseeable future.\n\nCircumcision is a good first-line option for some people who might want a circumcision anyway, or want a one-time curative treatment and have LS limited to the foreskin, so they have a good chance of being cured with circumcision. If you do not want a circumcision, I see no reason not to try topical treatments first, especially if you do not mind having to apply ointments for the foreseeable future.\n\n You also might want to see a different urologist or a dermatologist to get a second opinion, especially if the one you saw was not a good fit. I saw a gynecologist, a dermatologist, and another dermatologist before I found someone that could help me. Hey myristicae! Thank you so much for your response! :)\n\nI am glad you have a similar view on the matter, since I almost thought I might be acting irrationally. \n\nI will actually see a different dermatologist the day after tomorrow, like you suggested, and I am curious how he will react to my case. Doctors in USA all seem to want to circumcise me ! I refuse as not necessary. I am now 73 and on maintenance steroid  twice per week for my LS.\nDo not do it unless you want it and believe it is absolutely necessary! Thanks for your comment! At the moment I think you are absolutely right. How long have you been having symptoms of LS? That is difficult to answer. Maybe since before puberty. First erection was very painful.  Certainly since mid 1980's when went to GP with adhesions. Actually the studies on cancer risk said on maintenance steroid cancer risk was reduced to normal. Ie you have higher cancer risk with LS without steroids. That is somehow reassuring that you made it this far without circumcision. Thanks for the insight! Yeah, that is what I read, too. \n\nIn general, there seem to be many interesting studies coming out recently. I hope that medicine/science is now making some progress in understanding the disease, it is causes and how to treat them without surgery. At least now I have a diagnosis and treatment plan for last 2 years. I saw a urologist after a lot of back and forth with my GP and after the briefest of looks I was told a circumcision was the only option and 'dismissed'. \n\nSince then I have been maintaining my current position with clob cream and while it is never been as effective as it sounds like it was for you, it thankfully is not getting any worse so it is somewhat successful.", "Do I have LS? Hello, I am too embarrassed to talk to my parents about this or go to a doctor so this was the only place I felt I could turn to anonymously \nI am 18F and a few months ago noticed that the colour of my labia minora and the inside of the labia majora itself was a smooth shiny silverish colour, it does not look dry or crinkly to my knowledge,so googled into it and found LS which when not treated looks like it can get really nasty to say the least. I dont have any non stop itching or burning or fusing or anything like that, my main concern is the colour since when I have looked this up LS is the main search response. Could my labia just be that colour normally or does this sound like an LS situation?\nThank you! ", "Is this what a white patch looks like?  I am not sure about the white patch but it looks like you have quite a bit of fusing which is consistent with LS. Have you felt any pain or irritation? It is definitely worth speaking to a gynecologist about and perhaps getting a biopsy to get officially diagnosed. I am so sorry and I hope things get better for you.  What are the signs of fusion? My clitoris has always been like this. Maybe. It is really hard to tell with the light. Either way, if the appearance has changed recently, you should definitely see a dermatologist or gynecologist. I do not see a definition or gap in between the hood of your clitoris and the skin on either side. I am guessing that is what they mean. But there is a ton of normal variation in vulvas so it could be your normal. It could also be the lighting being confusing.\n\nIn these cartoons you can see how most of them have a defined hood separate from the outer labia meeting it on either side-\n\n(\n\nFor me, I am pretty sure that area is fused as well being fused to the glans, but it has been that way for a long time. Your glans does not look fused to me. But it is hard to tell anything from a picture like that. You could point the area out to your gynecologist and ask them if they see any fusion, if you are curious, or if you have other symptoms of LS but they are not noticing anything. Thankfully managed to get an appointment with a gyno who is trained in vulval skin conditions this wednesday. I am so scared. Glad to hear you got an appointment with a specialist. What are your main fears? If you do have LS, the good news is it is very treatable. For most people it can be stopped in its tracks. That is really reassuring to hear! Thanks so much - I am just worried about having something for life Honestly this looks like a normal vulva. It really comes down to what is normal for you... like there could be fusing or that could just be how your vulva is. I do not see a white patch. Are you having itching? what did the gyno say? I am having a biopsy on Wednesday morning did they see any signs or lichen", "Resources for lichen sclerosus Hi, everyone. \n\nJust wanted to share my resource page from my website for vulvar lichen sclerosus.

Yes Do you know of any ointments I can use to treat it Clobetasol its is very strong corticosteroid Are you circumcised or not? When did you notice it? Do you have any burning pain or crazy itch or is it just a visible issue? I am not circumcised, it is been about a year. At first it was really bad I had cuts all around the foreskin it got to the point where my foreskin tightened up and it was hard to retract it until I started using Terrasil Anti-fungal treatment, it fixed that problem but now it is pretty much a visible issue that does not go away as much as I try to keep it clean First I recommend a dermatologist who can confirm and prescribe the required steroid cream. As mentioned clob is common. My dermatologist prescribed me betamethasone,  next time I go I will ask why one or the other. \nAnd yes it looks simular to mine but I had adhesions and scar tissue as well. Did yours clear/almost-cleared with betamethasone? Well you have to realize that I have probably had this since pre teen and I am now 72.\nBad adhesions of foreskin and scar tissue particularly on underside. The frenulum is gone, area thick scar tissue.\nSo in just over a year all visible adhesions have resolved, I have the ridge or line on underside now that was not visible before. Scar tissue is getting thinner.\nWhite on glans was two types, typical white patch, it disappears and reappears sometimes. The grey on underside of glans is turning more pink as scar tissue thins. \nObviously this is more complex than this simple summary but please try one or other of the steroid creams. Try to find a dermatologist that has other Patients,  I encourage you to ask before making an appointment. Yes I know its embarrassing but the staff are used to it. Have you tried tea tree oil and keeping your foreskin down most of the time? Whatever you do, do not circumcise. My case looked very similar to yours and I cured myself with DSMO and Tea Tree Oil. I have had great results using colloidal silver.  There are many creams but silverBiotics makes a healing cream and I have never had such relief or even healing in years Hi could you expand on what you did? Many thanks", "Is my diagnosis possible? I am 27 y/o female who was recently diagnosed with LS after a decade of being told I had chronic yeast infections. There was one time I got really sick (104 temp for almost a week) and my vagina started to react to the fever and ended up getting a large fissure on the skin. I went to an urgent care to see what was going on and the doctor there told me she thought it was herpes. She did a swab test and it came back negative, I went to my actual gyno took a swab test and also came back negative.  That was 4 years ago and have never had an issue like that since. Then during my last yearly exam my gyno asked my why the tissue inside my vagina was so white and I was not sure what to say because it has looked like that for as long as I could remember, and I thought that was vaginas we are supposed to look like. She prescribed me a steroid to use twice a day for two weeks and sure enough by the end of those two weeks the tissue inside was a beautiful pink. I was amazed! On the spot she diagnosed me with LS, said I did not need a biopsy and I went on my merry way. Over the past few months I notice the white tissue starts to come back so I put some cream on and it usually goes away within a couple of days. I had a flare up again recently which prompted me to do some research and I came across multiple publications saying that LS will never effect your vagina, only the outside vulva area. Now I am worried that I do not actually LS since I was never biopsied. And since I have had so many misdiagnoses in the past I am feeling skeptical about this one too. Has anyone here been diagnosed via biopsy for LS on the tissue inside of their vagina? Whaaaaaaaat? Who says it will not affect your vagina? I had a biopsy and confirmation of it. To be more specific it was the labia/ fourchette of it. The biopsy was incredibly painful BUT I also had scarring from a previous outbreak that was not properly healing and the specialist was able to remove that in the process - which may have been what made it so painful. I have also had doctors assume it was yeast infection or herpes. Negative on tests for those all the time though. The biopsy will only confirm it (I think) if it is done in the middle of a flare up though. Really interested in who is saying LS is not possible for vaginal skin/labia/etc and why? Here is a ( to some research I was reading. LS is the first disease listed and they say that it rarely effects the vagina at the top of page 3. I have seen similar research but I am having trouble finding it right now. \n\nI suppose that rarely does not = impossible, but I still feel skeptical that I would get a rare disease AND have it located in a \u201crare\u201d area. I feel reassured that you have had diagnosis via biopsy though. I have had it confirmed by 3 different doctors that I do have it and have never had a biopsy. I also do have it inside and outside. Interesting. Do you mean \u201c \u2013 LS involves the vulva not the vagina unless prolapse\u201d? Because (and so sorry if you already know this and I am missing another line - public school sex ed failed me and I always assumed it was ALL the vagina) - from a huff post artic( le: \u201cThe vagina is the muscular canal that connects the uterus to the vulva\u201d and \u201cvulva is actually the correct term for all of the external organs, including the mons pubis (pubic mound), the labia majora and minora, the all-important clitoris, the external openings of the urethra (a.k.a, the hole you pee from) and the vagina.\u201d \n\nMy biopsy was on the labia lips and there were signs of scarring over the clitoris too - NOT the internal muscular canal.... You know, it is embarrassing but I am almost 28 and do not know the names for my anatomy at all. Im not sure I have ever heard of a pubic mound or have the slightest idea where that is. I am not 100% sure the name of where mine is at so I will describe it the best I can. If you were to spread your lips to the sides, my \u201cdiagnosed\u201d LS is on the tissue that is in the center of the inside of the opening of my vagina.", "Participants needed to take a survey in the research of lichen sclerosus Hi everyone! \nJust wanted to share the information. I am myself have LS for about 6 years now. Like a lot of you I have been frustrated with lack of information about this condition, it just has not been studied enough. I have been following this doctor\u2019s account on Instagram  for sometime. Her and her peers are looking for women with LS to fill out the survey for their research.  You need to fit the criteria though. They are looking for women ages 18-50 with biopsy proven lichen sclerosus, not in menopause. Where you live does not matter. The more people participate the better, of course. \n\n\n\nOh, the survey is completely anonymous and only takes a few minutes. Hey, I am a man but I was diagnosed with LS and it got to the point where I could not even have sex except maybe once a week or two.\n\nIt was heart breaking and took a couple years to get to this point but I eventually read Ginny Chandoha's Lichen Sclerosis Beating the Disease book and my LS is 95% gone. \n\nI use a cream every now and then (Perrin's Ultimate cream? something like that) but no more steroids, no more paper cut feelings, and besides the vitiligo from pigment loss everything is pretty much cured down there. I can have sex 3x + a day now, no problems.\n\nBest of luck, the book may come as a shocker after reading it I was depressed for a couple days because I realized the extent of changes I would need to make in my life. But it is so, so worth it to have everything working well again. Thanks for the book recommendation. I will look it up. \nThe effect, this condition can have on sex life, is so debilitating and depressing at times. Glad you have found something that works for you! I filled it out!! Thank you the recommendation! Awesome! Thank you for participating! What is the house rider q about? Also Am I meant to be in a bath before using cream?? Hey! I think they are trying to determine if horse riding or biking can aggravate LS from friction and pressure. As for the second question, yes, it is proven that soaking your vulva for 10-15 minutes before applying the steroids really helps the skin absorb the medication.", "Lichen Sclerosus Win! Hello all,\n\nI usually come to this forum to vent/read other's frustrations, but I wanted to share an LS win. I have (24 F) had LS for I recently moved home to Austin, TX and switched dermatologists (a daunting task!) Dr. Seal at Austin Regional Clinic immediately validated me, treated me with respect, and was an actual expert on the disease. She noted that she saw both existing damage and a current flare. She immediately provided a steroid shot to the flaring area. The shot worked within a matter of hours. As it happens, my fiance and I took a weeklong beach trip that next day to celebrate our engagement. I was very concerned about managing my LS on the trip. Salt water, wet bathing suits, constrictive clothing, and physical intimacy - recipe for pain. But with the shot, I was 95% pain free, amazing results. I had my old life back!! Keep searching for knowledgable providers in your area. Not just someone who will hand you a prescription for steroids and walk away. Best of luck to you all. That Is great that you had such a positive experience!\n\nWhat kind of steroid shot was it exactly, and how often will you go back for more?\n\nI assume they used a topical anaesthetic before the needle went in? I dont like the thought of a needle going into my genitals anywhere :0 It happened so fast I did not even catch the name, just that it was a steroid shot. No numbing, she just gave me a quick shot. It was not pleasant but nothing compared to the constant itching and pain of LS. 2 shots in less than 30 seconds and I walked right out. Nothing like a biopsy. She said the effects last for a month or two. It is been a week and I can already feel the need for topical steroids, but less than before. I HIGHLY recommend it.\n\nI am considering laser treatment as a more permanent solution, but the cost is significant. Wow, thanks for sharing.  I would be terrified to get a shot down there, even with numbing cream! \n\nYou mentioned biopsy.. have you heard of the possible link between LS and Lyme disease? I would be curious to see what this new knowledgeable Dr. you found would think about having your biopsy tested for lyme.. You gave me hope!!!  Thank you for sharing.

I had two biopsies 4 days ago. During the procedure the nurse had a hard time stopping the bleeding on one of the sites. It would not stop bleeding even she was shocked by it. When I was finally done it was a mess... blood on the floor on the side of the bed... just everywhere. \n\nIt is still pretty painful which I would think is normal, but it is also bleeding on and off. Tonight I had the worst bleeding yet so far where I was using the bathroom and had to apply pressure to prevent from dripping over the toilet. I am not doing anything physical I have been a complete lazy sack binging Netflix shows today. The pain just intensifies on its own and then the bleeding starts. \n\nShould I be concerned? Seems like every vulvar biopsy post I have read implies healing is a simple process. Just nervous about infection... Mine took a week and a half to stop bleeding and being painful. One of mine had a single stitch, that is the one that bled the longest. I applied a bit of polysporin and it helped to speed up the process a bit. It is a hard area to put pressure on to stop the bleeding. Try sitting cross cross, and take a tennis ball, and wedge it between your heel and the biopsy site. Watch a movie or something so you will stay out for a long time. You can also lay on your side and squish the ball up between your thighs Thank you! I will pick up some today. Big relief to hear some people take longer to heal. It is definitely a hard area to put pressure on so I have not been doing it for as long as I should. I will give this a try... thank you! Yes! I am going in to week 3 and it has finally stopped hurting. There will be a point when it gets so itchy, just be careful not to cave in and scratch. I would make sure to only dab with toilet paper to make sure not to make the thing start bleeding again once it slowed down. I feel you! Best of luck! \ud83d\udc9c Three weeks?! Wow. That is so funny because I woke up this morning itching like mad and decided to ask on this thread. You have already answered my question. THE HORROR OF THE ITCH LOL!!

For some years I have been using only some ointment and it went away without using cortisone, but now after a relapse I went back to the hospital and been trying a cure. It is not helping much and I am sad and worried. The skin is always tearing. Can my skin become strong again? Thanks Hello, and welcome to the group.\nThere is a lot of information here , as literature references and link plus personal experience.\n\nYou do not give much detail on where your tears are ?\nAlso are you circumcised? \n\nI am 73 yr old male and suspect I have had LS Pre teen.\nDespite seeing my GP for tear's for 40 yrs I was only diagnosed 2 yrs ago by my dermatologist, almost by accident. \n\nPlease read other posts and replies on here. Please free free to read my posts.\nI understand you might feel uncomfortable posting a picture on here, I have not! \nIf it helps later we can discuss email.\n\nGood luck. Wow, you have been living with it for over 40 years! I am definitely interested in knowing your story. No, I am not circumcised, quite a few doctors told me that is not a solution. The tears are just below the glans on the foreskin, and the foreskin gets tight around the glans. It was worse at the beginning, over 10 years ago, but it has affected my sexual and psychological life deeply. I am convinced that my LS is stress and anxiety related, because it appeared during bereavement and the loss I had, just the LS, is accompanying me everyday. I am getting a bit too personal perhaps, but so is the topic. Anyway, I would love to hear about your experience Please read my posts.\nYes they are right, circumcision is not a cure.

They are really adhesions coming un stuck. Painfully I might add but you know this. So you need to stop them from reattaching. \nHow ! \nSo I have been told to deliberately pull down on the adhesion and around my glans every day. It was suggested after shower. I find it easier in bed when partially or fully erect.\n\nI also had thick white tissue on underside of glans, now resolved, but was also holding adhesions..my frenulum has gone, there was an verticle adhesions from near urethra down to where two sides join and a horizontal ridge I did not know was there ! This is still coming apart. \n\nOnce apart as soon as any treatment ointment drys I apply vaseline to open  adhesions and to glans to stop sticking. \n\nThere is lots of new information coming out. \nJust 2 years ago there was concern that this led to a higher rate of penile cancar. My dermatologist checks once a year.\nNow there is work saying if you stay on steroid treatment this cancer risk returns to norm.\nAvoid any water based lube under foreskin.\n\nYes there is a lot of person stuff on here but generally to help others or get help.\nWe do not suffer from unwanted attention that unfortunately some women report.\n\n\n\n. I do have adhesions that get fissured too. I keep the area wet with baby cream pretty much all the times, why do you say I should avoid water based lubes? I try to keep the skin wet and lubed as much as possible.\n\nThen about cancer, what they told me is that it is pretty rare and it could happen if you do not treat yourself I had an issue when I started treatment. my glans would stick to the foreskin.\nMy dermatologist who is obviously very cancer aware wanted me to stop vaseline and use K-Y lubricant, which of course is water based.\nOn first application my whole glans turned a frosty white !\nThis cleared on steroid ointment in a week as it was new.\nSo switched back to vaseline.\nNo water based anything now. \nOintment,  no cream based anything. Mine started at 28 and shortly after I developed ED and my hair started to thin. A year or so before it I went through a depressive and stressful time. I often wonder if my body just went haywire and triggered lots of things like this I dont think I have ever noticed itch or irritation. Money seems to be just progressive white scarring. Is that common to not have noticable redness with LS? Yes, I didnt have much itch until the ointment started to reduce the thick white scaring, it would shed slowly, and would itch on day 3 . When applying new ointment I would wash with hypoallergenic soap and it would take top layer off and stop the itch. That is when on my 2x a week maintenance. Did you get rid of the white patches? Yes. The one on glans was about 5/16 inch dia. There is sometimes a visible depression and darker color but white is hone. The thik white scar tissue on underside is gone. Thin pink skin is there now. Took over a year. On betamethasone ointment Is there a specific ointment or cream that should be used. I was prescribed Mometasone. I dont have any itching or redness. I just need to stop and reverse the progressive white scarring. Thanks The majority of men and women use clobetasol.  A few like me use Betamethasone.  I have not seen the ointment mometasone used on any of the LS sires. I asked my urologist and she said Betamethasone was a little weaker that clobetasol. Yes if you have a treatment plan with steroids your cancer risk returns to normal.\nRe: water based meds and lube. Use oil based ie ointment not cream and not water based lubricant. \nI say this because I used KY and whole glans turns frosty white in 2 day's. Now use vaseline with no issues.\n\nHope this helps. Does anyone gets red patches on the glans? I have been using takrozem and now advantan hoping that the red patch on the side of my glans goes away. It usually starts with that red spot (slightly elevated) before it gets a little worse. Now I am pretty ok, but worried about that red bump because it always make me think about cancer...does anyone have the same experience? How do you cope with fear and anxiety over this stuff?", "I got this itchy rash on my skin that occurred on my anal area as well and my labia majora. It what whiter down in my private areas. The only relief I could get was rubbing alcohol! Could this be lichen?  Continuation....I remember as a child going to the doctor for intense eczema that covered my entire legs that has not\u2019 occurred once I was prescribed medicine. But I really do not think this is eczema.  The skin on my hand and anal area was extremely bumpy and itchy. However,  it all finally went away in about 4 months. But, I can see it it is slowly returning on my neck in different spots currently. I am for sure going to hear from a dermatologist I just want to see you guys thoughts on this. Im no dermatologist or Dr. but what is shown on your neck in that pic looks like lichen simplex chronicus.  Or it could be a case or lichen sclerosus that is occuring outside the genital region..  \n\nThe symptoms you briefly described in the front and back of your private areas sounds like it could be lichen sclerosus also.  You should definitely see some specialized dermatologists who deal with pigment disorders and/or genital dermatology to get a definitive answer.  You will probably want to get a diagnosis so you can start some kind of treatment to keep the symptoms from getting worse.  \n\nFeel free to ask any more specific questions if you have them.  Best wishes! I am not a doctor but it looks like it could be lichen planus, which can be anywhere on your body including genitals. Definitely recommend seeing a derm soon, when it is systemic like that early detection is key Just came across this subreddit recently and noticed your post. I have got a similar looking rash that is raised/bumpy on the abdomen, though it rarely itches. Saw the doctor who gave me Urea cream but that has not made a difference so far, apparently it can take a while. Best to get it checked out by a doctor! I am waiting for a referal to a dermatologist. It could be lichen planus", "HOPE!?!? Coyle institute in america I enquired about male LS and this was their response\n\nGood morning, \n\nWhile our practice is focused on Women's pelvic health, Dr. Coyle does indeed treatment men with Lichen Sclerosus.\n\n\nFor our patients traveling from outside of Pensacola, FL, we recommend the following treatment plan -\n\nArrange to stay three days in Pensacola for treatment with two office visits.\n\nOffice visit 1 - Monday or Wednesday appointment for evaluation and appropriate biopsy.\n\nOffice visit 2 - Wednesday or Friday appointment to receive treatment.\n\nReturn to office in three months for follow up.\n\n\nThe cost of treatment for Lichen Sclerosus depends on how many areas need to be treated. Each treated area on your body where profractional and PRP (platelet rich plasma) bath is used is $1275.\u00a0 This cost includes the laser and PRP treatment, BLT numbing cream and Pronox analgesia. If it is necessary for us to perform a biopsy, we will bill your insurance and you will be responsible for any copay, deductible and lab fees.\n\n\nDr. Coyle's current protocol in treating LS is to start with one profractional treatment and one PRP (platelet rich plasma) treatment for each area affected. It would be decided if additional profractional treatments are necessary at your three month follow up appointment. Many of our patients only need one treatment. Additional profractional treatments are $500 each.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to schedule an appointment.\n\n\nAnyone in the US , might be worth it? Hi OP, I just ran across Coyle's treatment option as well.  I see you posted this 5 months ago and I was wondering if you ever went though with the treatment.", "What emollient soap substitutes do people recommend?  Dermol is so great! My GP prescribed it, but if I run out or forget a repeat prescription, it can be bought OTC from the pharmacy Oh wicked, which specific type of Dermol do you use and when? As I have seen different types It is the Dermol 500 - use it when showering and also use it as a skin conditioner most evenings", "To those of you on clobetasol:  In order to feel 100% again from time of initial treatment, a few weeks. Now if I use it after a brief period of non-use, it takes a few days to feel back to normal. Good luck! I noticed improvements within the first week or so, and I hit my 'best' after about 2-3 weeks. Now I just use it daily to maintain my current situation, although I am slowly working towards full normality.", "Possible lichen sclerosis? It is not thrush, chlamydia or gonorrhoea. Going to get checked on Tuesday.  Do you have any other symptoms other than the white discoloration? Itching and burning feeling It could be LS. I see some redness/irritation too. Itching and burning along with white patches is pretty standard for first onset LS symptoms. Idk where you are from but if you have Walgreens/CVS around go buy some calmoseptine and aquaphor ointment for some relief Thanks, I am from the UK and all the shops are shut due to Easter. Hopefully I can get some relief soon Good luck. Let us know how the doctors appointment goes :) Thanks, I will do! My LS started similar to this - the whole area around my vulva was red, itchy and painful then I would get tears on the skin on my perinium after sex/wiping with tissue after going to the toilet so this could be LS. \n\nThey tried to dismiss me by saying everyone gets tears sometimes during sex and gave me a numbing cream (which is ridiculous!) so make sure to advocate for yourself when getting it checked out! The faster you can understand what is going on and get medication the better. And how are you now? Remission i hope? I am okay thank you!\n\nUnfortunately I am still figuring out things and how to treat my LS, things did get better for awhile and it is no longer painful though which is great!\n\nInitially they put me on steroid ointment every day for a month and gave me dermol to use as a soap substitute when washing. This really helped and I no longer had redness/soreness/pain in the affected area, sex was still painful but it was getting better.\n\nThen I started using the steroid ointment twice a week with an emollient to prevent friction every day that I am not using the ointment. Things were still getting better and so far all of the painful symptoms are gone but the area has changed so the skin is white/patchy and recently the white patch has gotten bigger which is new so I am speaking to my gyno about it Thursday but other than that things are so much better compared to when they first started - the only thing that remains is the change in the skins texture/appearance which I am hoping I can prevent the spread of. So now its an appearance/textural issue and no longer you feel pain? Great, hoping that the color returns! Pretty much yeah! Thank you, I hope that you can get your issues sorted too! They did not have space to see me at the doctor today, only urgent appointments. Annoyed is an understatement, already had to wait 4 days over the Easter weekend \ud83d\ude44 Thank you!! Will hopefully manage to get into the doctors tomorrow Uhg I am sorry. Were you able to reschedule for another day? Hopefully you can make it to the store to get some over the counter relief until then If I ring early tomorrow I should be able to get in!! I have been using an emollient cream which seems to help, it is an anti inflammatory.", "I have a lot of questions I was debating whether or not posting would make my anxiety worse but I figure to give it a shot. It will be long so prepare yourself. \n\nI was recently diagnosed with LS. About six months ago this all started. I am 31 yo cis female. I also have very sensitive, allergy prone skin and generalized anxiety disorder (not medicated). This all started with itching and I assumed it was a yeast infection and treated it as that for months. I went to multiple doctors who tested me for everything under the sun and it was all negative. I even had some skin tags surgically removed because one of my doctors thought I had HPV genital warts but they came back as skin tags. I have been on every single OTC and Rx cream you can imagine including clob which did not work for me. Finally, I got better insurance and I went to my original OBGYN.\n\nHe immediately said I do not have HPV and did a biopsy for LS. The biopsy was awful. He did not use stitches and I thought I was infected but I was not, my skin was SO inflamed and red. The biopsy is finally starting to get better (almost two weeks ago) but I developed a red rash around the biopsy sight that is intensely painful, with burning and itch. I cannot even sit without a donut pillow. Previously I had intense itching and burning on the sides, like where underwear would sit, and on the top of the pubis mound. I never had redness before but I did lose pigmentation in my perineum but no where else. It seems like the itching changes daily. But now it is centered around the red rash basically around the anal ring. \n\nSO my gyno prescribed me Nystatin/Triamcinolone cream to apply twice daily. It worked at first but now I need to apply it three times a day. The clob did not really help me, I think it was too strong after reading all these posts. I think the Triamcinolone cream is good but maybe this one I have is not strong enough and also mixed with an anti fungal which I think might be irritating my skin.\n\nMy questions are: \n\n1. What type and strength of Triamcinolone cream/ointment is usually prescribed? \n2. I struggle with hemorrhoids that are not going away, even after months on all different types of steroid creams and  phenylephrine suppositories. Is the LS making the hemorrhoids worse? I have an appt with a vein specialist.      \n3. Should I make an appointment with a Derm? I see some people on here have better results with a Derm vs. an OBGYN.\n4. I take Zyrtec 10mg at night for the itching and I think it helps, has anyone had any good results with taking allergy meds like this for LS? Or even an Rx allergy med like Vistaril? \n5. I have an upcoming appt with my PCP to get on anxiety meds, I am thinking Buspar. Does anxiety and stress really make LS worse? I have been struggling with anxiety for years and I think it is finally time to get medicated. I cannot take SSRIs due to another medical issue. \n6. I am reading about different diets that help LS, does this actually work? I eat pretty healthy to begin with. How do you go about this diet method? \n\nThanks all, this is long and I have been thinking about all this for weeks. When I was first diagnosed I was mortified and had a panic attack for two days straight.  Reading about LS online is NOT good. I am in a relationship and I was imaging the worst scenarios. Our sex life is in the toilet because of this. He is super supportive but I feel like I am damaged goods now and he will leave me. I know it is crazy but this is my fear. I really hope this gets better.  \n\nThanks again. Sorry to hear you are dealing with all that. I have skin tags too, as does my relative who also has an LS-like condition. I wonder if they are related. LS definitely co-occurs with other things like psoriasis (which I also have.) \n\n1. I do not know a ton about triamcinolone since it is not as common. I did find a paper where they treated 34 women with LS with 0.1% triamcinolone ointment to be applied once or twice per day depending on the individual case. ( It seemed to be pretty effective with symptom scores, e.g. painful sex, getting better for most women. (DM me if you want the full text; I can get it through my institution). Other options are calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus, which often work for people who do not respond to clob. \n2. LS can present with constipation which definitely can worsen hemorrhoids, although I think(?) that is more common in children. My understanding is that LS causes tenderness in the anal area, which causes bathroom avoidance and tension, which leads to straining for bowel movements (and is a recipe for hemorrhoids.) By some miracle I do not have hemorrhoids, but I had anal fissures as a child (which I in restrospect I think were likely related to undiagnosed LS). Anyway in the past year I learned that I am supposed to relax to poop. Who knew? I also bought a squatty potty. Vein specialist sounds good, although I do not know a lot about that; I would also consider a pelvic floor specialist or GI doctor if you have constipation. Recently constipation, painful sex, vulvar pain conditions, etc. are being attributed to chronically tight pelvic floor muscles. There is physical therapy you can do to learn how to relax them. My derm referred me to a pelvic clinic since I mentioned vulvar pain with my LS. I have not gone yet but I think I probably will in hopes that it helps my constipation, too. \n3. I feel a little concerned that your obgyn did the biopsy without stitches, although maybe sometimes they do not need stitches? I do not know. I also think your concerns about the antifungal make sense. Seeing a derm for a second opinion sounds like a good idea. I would also ask both of them if there is anything you can do about the rashes around your biopsy site. \n4. I could not say\n5. Stress affects the body as a whole and it can definitely worsen other inflammatory/autoimmune conditions. I would definitely recommend combining the meds, if you choose to start them, with talk therapy, possibly CBT. I would also try to see a specialist, unless your PCP has a lot of experience in psychiatry, because that is an important decision that should be made with care. \n6. A lot of people say anecdotally (on this subreddit for example) that certain dietary choices have helped their LS. I have not found any good evidence for it overall, so I am guessing it is something that varies a lot person to person. Certain autoimmune diseases (LS is suspected to be autoimmune) do have food triggers that vary by person. For example, red pepper and eggplant trigger my dad's psoriatic arthritis. \n7. You are not damaged goods. If your partner had some psoriasis on his penis and had to take a break from (penis-involving) sex, I bet you would not consider leaving him over it. LS is treatable and it is likely you will be able to have vaginal sex again without issue. Until then, maybe schedule some non-vagina or non-vulva one-on-one time? If you both agree from the outset that you are not going to involve those areas, it might help you relax and enjoy your time with him again. I was also diagnosed six months ago. Just a few days ago I want to the doctor because I was afraid the ls would spread but did it spread up in between my breast? My doctor said no it was a yeast infection she gave me a 2-day pill to get rid of the fungal and yeast and also a Nystatin powder to put out directly on the red inflamed area by my underwear line. It was so bad that I went out and purchased boxer briefs for women I know which helped. I do notice that stress definitely in Flames the whole area more often so than other times. I also notice that taking a bath with Epsom salt and baking soda helps tremendously. I take a bath every single day for this reason. I do notice also that if I do not take a bath everyday I will get a flare up. I also noticed that after sex unless take it back now. Something about the semen irritates my skin and causes the flare-ups to get worse. Nothing like wham bam thank you man get the heck out of here. Haha. So my doctor told me that yeast infections are more prevalent because the ALS causes the skin to get thin and and when we have a flare-up the Skins bins out and use spread. I am very sorry that you are going through this. I am very sorry that I am going through this also. I understand completely where you are coming from where you feel like you are damaged goods. Because I felt the same way. I am embarrassed to have sex with my husband 34 years into the marriage because I feel nasty. Thank you so much for your detailed response!!! This has been such a whirlwind. I am going to make a derm appt. I really appreciate your answers Thank you. I was contemplating the sitz bath but I am scared Bc my skin is so finicky I am afraid it will make it worse. I have another question. I was reading about the amount of oxalate in urine as a cause for this or something that makes LS flair ups worse. Is there any truth in that? How can I find out my oxalate levels? My LS is mostly anal/perianal and I have to deal with skin tearing during bowel movements. I have also had hemorrhoids. Here are some things I have learned since my diagnosis: \n\n1. Take a stool softener every day for a week or two, then taper it back to a couple times a week. Increase use when needed. Having soft stool is immensely important to avoid straining, as well as friction from hard stool, which make hemorrhoids worse. I use dulcolax 100mg. \n\n2. Stay hydrated! \n\n3. Try adding some fiber. I like using psyllium husk. It comes in husk form, or you can use the powdered version. If you add fiber it is VERY important to drink water so the fiber does not make the constipation worse. \n\n4. Before a BM, use a product with lidocaine to numb the area first. I use preparation H with lidocaine, but there are a few different products out there. I apply it first and wait a minute or two. It has literally changed my life in the bathroom! I no longer have hesitancy because the pain is greatly reduced, which helps you avoid straining and clenching muscles. I will sometimes use a little bit again after the BM if needed. There are also preparation H traveling wipes with lidocaine that you can carry with you while out and about. \n\n5. Think about trying a bidet. There are ones you can install in your existing toilet. Wiping with toilet paper can really irritate the skin and make LS even more miserable. Wet wipes are also an alternative to toilet paper and they are a little more gentle, but avoiding wiping altogether is preferable. A bidet will also help you avoid irritating hemorrhoids by friction from wiping. \n\n6. Tucks medicated pads for hemorrhoids really help me. I do not know if it is the same for everyone, but I notice a big improvement when using them. I usually stick one over the area and leave it there for a few minutes before removing it. \n\nAlso, I think you may be right about the anti-fungal in your steroid. That may be irritating. I use triamcinolone as clob was too strong for me. Going to see a dermatologist is a great idea! Sometimes people do better with ointment versions of medicines as opposed to creams, so that is also something to keep in mind. I also wear boxers when around the house and it has made a big difference. I used to get super irritated where my underwear touched my skin. Thank you!! Yes same! I recently bought women\u2019s boy shorts but I do not like it. I actually just purchased men\u2019s cotton boxer briefs so I hope they work!! It is not clear to me, did the biopsy reveal LS? You wrote \" I thought I was infected but I was not...\" \nI am sorry you are in this boat. So little real information is available available. Have you heard about borax soaks? There are a couple of fb groups that specifically talk about that. I think one of the mods even write a book about it. I thought the biopsy wound was infected but it was not. Of course, that makes perfect sense. I should have realized. I do not like the wonen's boy cut.  My butt is just to fluffy for that...so the wpmen's cotton BOXER briefs are nice Sorry to hear about your experience with the biopsy. I had a similar experience with my regular (at the time OBGYN who basically said, \u201cyou are too young for this!\u201d Took a biopsy, wrote a script for clob, told me to come back in 3 months, and sent me on my way to google this affliction which obviously sent me into a tailspin. So I determined to find a specialist for LS and I did- there was a yahoo group that had a spreadsheet of doctors- perhaps it is still online somewhere. You need to find a specialist. I would try to find a vulvar pain specialist GYN or vulvar derm. \n\n1. Clobetasol is the gold standard for treatment. It can feel irritating if your skin is irritated. Did you use it 2x daily for 2 weeks, then slowly go down to twice a week before determining it did not work? For people who do not respond enough to clob there are other medications (like I think tacrolimus) but I do not think trialcinolone is often prescribed for LS. \n\n2. If the LS is around your anal region it could make things worse there but if not it would just be the hemorrhoids. A specialist would be able to determine this also. \n\n3. Vulvar pain specialist, gyn specializing in vulvar disorders, or derm specializing in vulvar issues \n\n4. Yes if Zyrtec helps, otherwise Atarax is what my dr prescribes, but keep in mind the reduction of itching is just reducing the symptom of itching and not the LS- you need to treat the LS- it is very important to treat and not ignore. Treated LS does not progress to worse outcomes. Untreated can. \n\n5. My dr said stress is actually the #1 factor in worsening this disease so definitely try to get that under control \n\n6. Personally I have seen no difference with any specific diet and I have tried many including the AIP, paleo, vegan, gluten and dairy free, low oxalate, low histamine\u2026I do not have any food allergies or intolerances that I can tell aside from a few things like sweet potatoes or oatmeal that just do not agree with me personally. So if you do not, I would not worry about doing a special diet because that adds stress. Focus more on eating anti-inflammatory and doing things to reduce inflammation and possibly mast cell activation. This is whatever is your best diet- with lots of fresh whole food and not a lot of sugar which sounds like you already do. \n\nA few other things- LS seems to be hormonally related to low estrogen- my dr prescribes topical estradiol to help with estrogen in that area to keep the skin healthy and flexible and it helps. In addition, anything you can do to support your hormone health will help. I like Lara Briden\u2019s advice- she wrote a couple books on it. \n\nI have also used low dose naltrexone over the years for something else and it really helped my LS skin feel better. Just healthier and less \u201cstiff\u201d. Unfortunately I discontinued it d/t other side effects but I have heard others say anecdotally it helps them also. My LS dr had not heard of that one but he did not disapprove. He does not recommends stem cell etc bc we do not know long term effects. \n\nHeat can make the itching worse if you are in a flare so try to wear breathable things till it is better. \n\nI think I had LS in my 20s as I started noticing some itching then but it got bad after I had my kids esp after the 2nd one and 18 months of breastfeeding (depleted hormones). It is been 7-8 years since then and I am fine! Sex life is normal, I had some scarring but it has not gotten worse, and I almost never even think about having this. I rarely flare up (for me that would be light itching) and if I do I use the clob a bit more often and it gets sorted quickly. I think we must all go through feelings of fear and grief around this diagnosis but please be reassured if you treat this it will get better and things will be ok. I have not found any truth to this. I have read that urine itself can irritate the skin so rinsing after you pee can help. You could try avoiding oxalate foods like spinach but I have never seen a difference with this. \n\nI did forget to mention that sometimes I do a fast mimicking diet for general health and I think it helps bc it helps your immune system so this or other types of fasting could be helpful. Just curious as to what the specialist doctors do besides tell you to use clob? Also I was prescribed Atarax but I noticed it does not do anything for my vulgar itching. The Zyrtec works better for me. If that works better, use it! I do not use anything myself because they make me too groggy the next day. But, I do not have itching either. If I get itching, I know I need to up my clob use till it settles down. \n\nI cannot speak for all drs, but mine prescribes estrace and does checkups every 6 months to make sure the LS is inactive and if needed make adjustments to the treatment (I have not had to, though). Because LS skin if untreated has a higher risk for cancer, it is important to make sure all is staying healthy with exams every 6 months to a year. Not to scare you- my dr told me in 30 years of treating this, he has had zero treated women progress to that, only some women who never treated it. \n\nHe also does my yearly woman wellness exams. Because of his specialty, he was able to help when I had recurring monthly yeast infections- since his help I have not had one again- in 7 years. In the beginning when sex was painful he helped with that, and helped one of my girlfriends with it when she had vulvodynia postpartum. He helped my sister out with a bacterial infection her other drs could not get rid of. And he does surgeries- like fixing labiaplasties gone wrong (with this condition I just cringe when I hear of ladies purposely altering them \ud83d\ude23) \n\nSo, he is just there for vulva and vagina problems. For a mild case, I would not say you need a specialist, if you have clob and estrace and regular checkups. But if you feel like your dr is not up on their LS info or you are not getting the care you would like, I think it is worth seeking one out. I have no idea why this font changed, sorry! He also was able to just ease my mind, since my OB was basically like \u201cwow, weird, here is this cream see ya later\u201d and the LS dr was able to explain everything and address all my worries and reassure me that everything was going to be ok.", "Been diagnosed with LS, but it is on my back. (Biopsy confirmed) After about 4/5 months of a dry white patch in my back I was finally persuaded to go to the doctor to have it checked. (I am not one for doctors visits as I am terrified of anything that can possibly be wrong at any time). \n\nReading through google information on this condition and it is most common areas to arise, I am so sorry for everything anyone has to go through with LS.\n\nFair enough, my back can itch and feel like it is pulling apart just from getting in/out of the car and stuff but I could not imagine the effect LS can have if I had it elsewhere on my body...\n\nDoes anyone else here have LS anywhere other than the genitals? And if so what treatment do you use that helps? I have been prescribed a corticosteroids cream and it is relieving the dryness/itch but I am still having times of the day where it will just go really sore and feel like it is cracking open. Oh god. I am sorry. I have never know anyone to get it anywhere but the genital area. I only have it on my shoulder, torso, and arms. My lips are really bad and I basically have to use a steroid ointment twice a day as lip balm. I also sometimes have issues around my eyes. I have been told it is because those are the areas that my skin is the thinnest. I have it on my arms also. I have it on my back where the biggest acne scars were. What helped the most was a steroid injection like Inhet for my alopecia, followed up with aquaphor", "Symptoms Hi everyone, I have a biopsy next week to check for lichen and am honestly super scared! And going a bit crazy right now\u2026\nSo I was wondering if you could tell me how your lichen started?\nI have had a burning itching pain on and off for about 7 months now and can not figure out why (therefore the biopsy). Other than that pain I do not have any spots on my skin or anything that looks different than usual und my pain is only in the morning\u2026.\nDid it start for any of you like that? Hi I am 23 F and I never had any of the white spots or looked unusual. Mine was mostly itching and that lasted for 12 months until a doctor finally figured it out, especially because I did not physically appear that I had lichen. I had mostly red inflammation and my clitoral hood was stiff/not pulling all the way back. These things I did not realize until a vulvar disorder gyno looked at me. I have been treating for about 6 months now and do not notice it most days anymore \u2026. Biggest relief ever because after a year I thought I would never be the same again. There is hope and good luck :) Very similar experience here! Took 3 gynecologists to figure it out because the skin was perhaps thinner but overall did not have white patches or anything! Hey thanks so much for sharing your experience! Hey thank you as well!! So sorry that it took 3 gynos\u2026\nMine is actually just being cautious that is why I am getting the test. Hi, I am 32, diagnosed at 31. I had a similar start. Itching and redness for months and saw multiple drs before I was diagnosed. Finally after almost three full months of using clob twice a day the flair is going down and I have minimal itching. I now use clob at night, almost every night but I am hoping to cut that back to a few nights a week. \nThings that helped me greatly: switching to clob ointment. Using triamcinolone ointment on anal area because clob was too strong for me on the anal area. Taking stool softeners, using preparation h wipes. Dabbing toilet paper, never wiping. Using aquafor and vanicream ointment when I do not use the steroids. Ditching eggs, gluten, and dairy. Drinking tons of water. Taking Zyrtec at night which now I take vistaril prescription at night for skin itching. Using a pillow under my legs and between my legs during sleep. Wearing boys cotton boxer briefs. Not using soap to wash the area, just warm water. Taking epsom salt baths at night before steroid application. Going to see a derm who has a knowledge of LS. He told me Bc it was caught so early and if I use the steroid ointments regularly I probably will not have any scaring. Using tons of water based lube with NO glycerins during sex.  Using donut pillows to sit on everywhere. Even in the car. \n\nIt is a tough thing that requires a lot of trial and error unfortunately. Write everything down that you try and write down your routines so you remember what works and what does not. Sometimes it takes months for the flair to get under control. But diet does seem to be a big part of it. Rid yourself of processed, inflammatory foods. And stress is a huge part of it. Get your stress levels down and/or try an antidepressant. \nGood luck! Hey thanks so much I still do not have my results but this is super helpful either way!! Did you ever get results? If it was positive, what kind of treatment have you begun, and is it helping? Actually I have gotten my results and apparently it is lichen simplex chronicus which is not the same thing \nI have a doctors appointment tomorrow and will start treatment I am glad to hear that you did get a definitive answer. I hope you find relief in your treatment.", "Itching from LS pls help Hi guys \n\nI still do not know if I have LS but I am starting to get more symptoms now.  Please can everyone share how they soothe the horrible itch that comes esp at night. I really struggled yest as it came out of no where and I had nothing to help it. Had to take an antihistamine but it did not do much. \n\nPls recommend any products/ methods you use \n\nThanks A shower helped me with my itch, if you can get some baby cream with zinc in it, that also helped my itchy backside. My doc recommended baking soda sitz baths as well. Really consider getting a biopsy! My obgyn was sure I had LS, but my biopsy proved to be eczema. If you do not tear or have thin skin or white patches, there is a possibility that something else is going on.\n\nI hope you feel better soon! Thank you. I have been tearing for the last few months during sex and a few times outside of sex. I wrote a post on it a few days ago if u wanted to have a read. I just read your post. I am sorry your going through all this. It does sound like LS but the only way to be sure is to have a biopsy. It might also help to mention the name to your doctor, as most of them do not know much about LS. Since you are system is a bit slow, asking for what you need might help. If no one has prescribed a steroid to you, mention it. If you experience dryness, try some coconut oil. I really hope you can get the help you need soon. It is really tricky, I know. I have been suffering for a year before I got properly tested. \ud83d\udc95 how did you get a doctor to perform a biopsy? My obgyn suspected LS and gave me a referral for a biopsy to be sure. I called a bunch of hospitals and clinics until I found one that could help me ASAP. I am sure you could ask your doc for it and they would not be against it. i have asked about 5-6 doctors about it. they all say no cause my problems are only on my clitoris and next to it :/ I have heard that a lot of doctors do not recommend biopsies in that area, as it is very sensitive. And the best way to biopsy is where you are experiencing symptoms, so it is tricky! But if your skin is thin, itchy, looks irritated, tears/bleeds, has lightening, it is quite possible that it is LS. Regardless, someone should have prescribed you a steroid ointment to help with these issues. But I totally support biopsies, as in my case it was not even LS. I have even seen a case where someone was told they had LS and years later it was actually something far worse that was not being treated correctly. I do not mean to scare you or anything, but your perseverance and advocacy for your health is the only thing that will get you answers. Maybe there is some sort of doctor online, or vulvar specialist in your area. I have been pushing through this for over a year now. Maybe keep calling and harassing the doctors you have seen already demanding a biopsy, in hopes that they get fed up of you always calling. I do not have tearing/bleeding or white patches, and they still preformed a biopsy on me. I really hope you can get the help you need, keep on pushing and follow your gut. I got dismissed so many times before someone actually properly looked at me. Sending hugs and hopes that you can find someone who can help, and hopes that you feel better! \ud83d\udc95 I had biopsy done it is what my obgyn recommend because Ive been fighting this for over 10 years and she wanted to make sure it was not something else. She did 3 punch biopsies of 3 different areas that have trouble. \n\nRight now for me Im dealing with something that the doctor is trying to figure out. I had to stop all my creams and I keep breaking out a really red itching burning rash like everyday. So I have for two weeks and take my allergy meds she prescribed me for the itching and inflammation. Yes I have seen about 10 different doctors over the last year and a half.  Vulvar \u201cspecialists\u201d included. I have all of those symptoms and yet no one takes it seriously haha. Thank you so much There is a group on FB and a page on the Web too that describes how to use Borax to combat symptoms. If you cannot get a dr. to prescribe Clobetasol (steroid ointment that you need to use daily then slowly taper to 2x/week for maintenance forever) then you can try it. Or get an over the counter steroid ointment from your pharmacy til you can get Clobetasol (that one is stronger and much much more effective but prescription required). \n\nThis assumes you do have LS, which sounds quite possible. Experienced dr\u2019s will sometimes diagnose it without a biopsy. But of course a biopsy is definitive. \n\nAnd it is actually quite common for it to localize on and near the clitoris. \n\nThis is an immune disorder and can be degenerative so keep looking for either an obgyn or a dermatologist who has experience with LS. \n\nYou can call the Center for Vulvovaginal Disorders to see if they can refer you to someone in your area. Check their website too. They are located in Washington DC and the director is Andrew Goldstein who is a pioneer in treating this disease. Good luck! I have had plenty of doctors who have experience with LS but it seems like since I do not have the thickened white patches all over they just do not want to consider it. I am just scared that if it is not LS I will damage it more by doing over the counter stuff. I have an appointment with a gyno on the 7th and I am going to ask her for a referral to a place I found 2 hours away and I will go from there.\n\nThanks so much for your advice\ud83d\udc95 it really means a lot. I will look into calling that place. I do not think I would mind too much even if it was LS, I mean, I do not *want* it but I want an answer at this point still not confirmed of LS but had the symptom with horrible night itching. used aquaphor and/or neosporin. i am not sure if you are supposed to or not but it helped me!", "Sports Vagina? Hey everyone, first time posting (34F) - received possible diagnosis today but wanted to see if anyone else has experienced these circumstances. I started working out in September twice weekly for the first time in forever and quickly noticed some itch in the vag/butt area. Figured it was yeast, did treatment, still itchy. Figured it was BV, did treatment, still itchy. I have no white patches or scarring, but a consistent mild itch that worsens when I scratch. I assumed that this was either irritation from working out and not showering that is just continually getting more irritated by discharge, period, etc. Basically my question is, can you have lichen without the typical signs or symptoms or is 'sports vagina' a thing? Thanks for any advice! I would def talk to a dermatologist about your symptoms, rather than get reddit guesses. I put it off, same as you, just thought it was a yeast thing. Nope. You need a biopsy. I agree with the assessment that you need a professional to check it out. Everyone has different symptoms, though the worse-when-you-itch is a very common one, it is best to have a doctor attempt to diagnose it. Oh my god. I was talking to my friend about how I think I have \"sports vagina\" before I got in to see a doc. The fact that you also use the term \"sports vagina\" made me laugh. I am 37, play soccer 3x a week. Changed to cotton underpants, wash on hot and put in the dryer. I have a pap, finally, next week. I will come back and update if I get any diagnosis other than LS. For me, flucozanol and topical antifungal did nothing. But my life changed and I was finally able to sleep at night with the strong steroidal creme, 5% every 3 days now. Coconut oil between then. I have no loss of anatomy, no fissures or tears.", "Will I EVER get over this flare?! Hey everyone! I am 29 and was diagnosed with ls 2 weeks ago because I thought I had a yeast infection and sex hurt for literally the first time ever. My gyne diagnosed me on the spot because I had some white patches in a figure 8 and my inner labia is already disappearing. She gave me clobetasol and told me to use it twice a day until it clears up. That Is it! She also said that I should feel better within the week. Within the first week, the white patches were going away and I had no itching or burning. I also tried to have sex and it was not as painful, but there was some swelling afterwards so we decided to forgo sex for a bit longer.. But today, I am having some itching again and I am noticing a couple tears near my clitoris. I know I am suppose to start my period next week and last month I was extremely stressed so I think that is why this flare happened. \nHow much longer until I go into remission and sex will no longer hurt? What else should I be using to help speed this along and prevent future flares? What other tips do you all have? What are the best menstrual products? I cant use a cup because I have an iud. Do you shave? I feel like the hair is irritating me but I do not was to aggravate it more.\nBoth my gyne and gp seemed like this was no big deal and the clobetasol will fix everything right away... I just feel like this is never going to end!\nThank you all for your opinions! Hey! I hear your frustration, this condition sucks. \nBe patient with clobetasol, it will get better but two weeks is nothing. In my case I started to feel better in a few weeks. Unfortunately, pain with sex might become new normal, but it does get better once the skin heals more. Make sure you soak your vulva for 10-15 min ( bath or shower) before applying clobetasol and rub it in for a good 60-90 seconds, this way skin absorbs the treatment better. Also, use fingertip worth of cream. Wash your vulva with just water, shower gels with strong perfume tend to irritate the skin. I use a cup, so cannot recommend anything in that department. \nAll the best! It will get better. And know you are not alone. Hey there! I am a woman who was diagnosed about 10 years ago, in my late teens, through a biopsy. My inner labia are almost completely gone and I have noticeable scaring around my clitoris. You should know that it gets better, and I have maintained a good sex life (yes I still orgasm and no partners have ever cared about the physical effects) with minimal flare ups since getting the disease under control. Here is what is worked for me: \n- Topical steroid treatment DOES work and it is the best treatment we have right now - keep with it daily until the itching and pain goes away. After that, use once a week or so. \n- Especially while dealing with a flare up, stay moisturized all the time and avoid underwear. Coconut oil and unscented lotion work great. Coconut oil has also been a great lube during sex (with LS - lubricant during sex is not optional). \n- Shaving (while not in a flare up and I recommend using an electric razor so cutting yourself is less likely) can help.\n- Only wear 100% cotton underwear. ( have been good for me. \n- Avoid fake sugar sweeteners - they freak out the immune system and can cause flare ups ... ie Acesulfame K (brand names: Sunett and Sweet One, Advantame, Aspartame (two brand names: Equal and Nutrasweet), Neotame (brand name: Newtame), Saccharin (two brand names: Sweet \u2018N Low and Sweet Twin), Sucralose (brand name: Splenda)\n- Taking high doses of vitamin D every day helps (recommended by a friend who has Lupus and LS). I take (\n- Having an alternative cream on hand to use in between the steroid like ( ) is great (it works but smells and stains underwear - use black undies). I can vouch for the Creme Complete! \n- Avoid damaging the area further - you know your body... careful with rough sex, wearing a harness for too long, too long on a bike.. etc. During a flare up, do everything in your power not to itch! For me, knocking myself out at night is the key (edible or sleeping aid).\n- Seeing an OBGYN and a dermatologist is a good idea. Both have had helpful recommendations for me over the years. I have been told to purchase estrogen cream as that can be helpful in addition to the steroid - still on my list of things to do with my new insurance.\n- Do not be afraid to ask for help. This is a deeply personal disease to be diagnosed with. Most days, after this many years, I do not even think about it - but having a mental health resource is always a good idea. Yay therapy! If you are employed full time, see what is included in your EAP / health plan before paying out of pocket.\n- Know you are not alone! I recently found this site  and have found it helpful so far.", "Birth Control linked to LS? Hi guys and gals! I am new to Reddit and this page has been so helpful. I was super sad that I got this as a potential issue for me especially when it was known to be in women post menopausal women. \n\n\nI am 26yo female and is currently in the stage of diagnosing LS with my dermatologist (I am 98% sure I have LS). I was reading up about it and do hear that LS can be triggered by an autoimmune disease but I have not gone to a endocrinologist to check up on that. I also read that birth control can cause LS. Is anyone else on birth control and noticed this issue? \n\nStarted birth control I believe in 2017 or so and I noticed issues around 2019 or so. It was normally diagnosed as a yeast infection or fungal. But TMI I notice my clitoris hood area like peeling? It was itchy and red. Also around the vulvar area (between labia minora and majora and lower vaginal area? Anyone else have this issue? \n\nThought it could be genetic but my mom never had an issue.\n\nCan this be from birth control? I feel like I need to stop but I do not know what to do. Currently on clob and will see my derm in a few weeks. My gyno never even mentioned it and I saw her the day before the derm.\n\nSorry for thoughts everywhere I am just so brain scattered, confused and upset. I am glad to know what I have but I am also heartbroken I have this. There are lots of kinds of birth control. Were you on birth control pills? I have wondered about the spermicide I used. I was on a birth control from planned parenthood which I started for my acne (cannot remember the name) then finally got a primary doctor and she then set me up on a monthly birth control (cannot find or remember either) and then Daysee which was a every three month period birth control. I just recently switched to the Mirena IUD and it is progesterone only so maybe that will be better?\n\nI completely forgot to say I was on Accutane which could have made the issues worst and started that in Nov 2019 but my issues began earlier 2019? I will include it in the original post! i noticed my LS symptoms pretty much immediately after starting oral hormonal birth control pills. there seems to be debate over if it is linked or not, but there is not much of a doubt in my mind that my birth control is what triggered my symptoms. Hi, \nI am so sorry that you are suffering so much right now, it does get better with treatment. I am 22 and recently diagnosed, so I totally get how much this fucking sucks at a young age.. I am here if you ever need to vent or want some beginner advice from someone who is been diagnosed for a few months now. \n\nAt this point, there is no research or evidence demonstrating a causal link between birth control and lichen sclerosus. Then again, there is not really a lot of info for what causes it to begin with. Most doctors feel it is autoimmune but related to hormones as well. If you do a search on a Google scholar or another database you may be able to find more info on this topic. Here is a ( that found a possibility of birth control trigger earlier onset of LS.\n\nMy experience with birth control &amp; LS:\n\nI stated hormonal birth control pills my sophomore year of college. I had used them briefly before for another year in high school but stopped. One month after graduating (2 years later) my symptoms appeared. They were horrible! Severe burning 24/7, I could not function. Sex? Forget it! \nI went months seeking an answer, only being tossed antibiotics that did not help. I started to notice I felt better during my placebo week (period) and decided to try going off the pill. In 24 hours all of my burning and painful sex went away. I still had loads of LS irritation on my vulva, but I felt 70% better! It still took another 6 months from this point to land on the LS diagnosis, and by then the burning and painful sex had returned a couple more times. It has never been as bad as it was while I was on birth control. My worst day off the pill is better than my best day on the pill. Since treatment, I am better overall. \nThat is just my experience, does not prove anything though. Lots of people have found that they are better and have fewer flares while on birth control. For some people the small amount of estrogen and regulating of hormones/cycles helps, for others it can lower estrogen levels at the vulva and promote the presentation of LS symptoms. \n\nIf you think your LS is hormone related (related to your cycle or affected by birth control) it may be worth asking to be put on a mild estrogen cream along with your corticosteroid ointment. It will help plump up the skin to reduce tearing and improve elasticity. It is a small amount of estrogen that at the topical level of absorption will not have a great impact on systemic levels. It has helped me. \n\nI hope you find relief soon! Hugs\ud83d\udc96 I read that BC can also as to an autoimmune disorder or disease which basically what can \u201ccause\u201d LS. I am just so confused cause there is only so much info out there :( thank you so much! This entire group has made me feel less alone and so supported. \n\nDid you get diagnosed after doing a biopsy? I am debating if I should and wonder if that could make my scaring worst? \n\nThis might be TMI but is it me or does LS cause a smell too? I shower every night and I always keep clean so I am not sure if it is a LS thing or something else. I had been on a birth control pill for most of my life from age 16 to 34. After I had stopped using it on the recommendation of my rheumatologist (I have an autoimmune disease called Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease) I noticed the white plaques show up about 6 months after I stopped. I never had an issue with LS while actually on BC. I am currently trying to get some hormone issues sorted out with a functional medicine doctor because there is definitely something odd going on, aside from the LS. \n\nResearchers do not really know why LS happens. It could be a hormone issue or it could be autoimmune. No one really knows yet exactly why. Its also thought to occur mainly in pre-pubescent girls and post-menopausal women because of a theorized lack of estrogen, but I think there is also a prevalence of LS in post-puberty/pre-menopausal women that is not well understood and might happen more often than realized. I think it often goes undiagnosed in women our age because it is thought to be uncommon for us. Hopefully research will advance our understanding soon! Also, I used to also tear during bowel movements. Making sure you are well hydrated and your stool is fairly soft is very important. If pain is an issue, get some preparation H with lidocaine (or another product with lidocaine) and use it a minute or two prior to having a BM. It helps lube things to make passing them easier and also numbs the area. A bidet could also be a fantastic thing if wiping causes irritation. I have to use wet wipes myself as I cannot tolerate regular toilet paper. Once I started the steroid ointment treatment and I made sure to be hydrated, things improved quite a lot. I am sorry you are going through this. The link with birth control is not certain. My doc told me to go off birth control, but I really cannot do that... I just bled constantly for 3 months, in terrible pain. He put me on a hormonal IUD (Liletta, so basically the same as Mirena). According to him, oral birth control can result in your body overproducing hormone binding globulin, so you end up with all your sex hormones being too low, and those low sex hormones can exacerbate LS. But with an IUD, because it is not systemic, it does not cause the same problem. Again, this is what my doctor told me, I do not think there is much evidence for this and personally I had no change in symptoms between pill, nothing, and IUD. \n\nPoop problems: I am there with ya. I have IBS and pelvic floor dysfunction along with the LS so pooping is like going to war lol. If you have the money, I would highly recommend getting a squatty potty and a bidet. You can use clob on the anal area, and it is a good idea to keep it moisturized with aquaphor or whatever you use for your vulva. You can try taking in extra fiber and water or using Miralax to soften the poops. Im happy you feel less alone! The emotional toll of this disease can be the worst part. I have not had a biopsy, and have been visually diagnosed by two doctors. From what I hear, biopsies are not fun but they will give you a definitive answer if your doctor is not confident you have LS. But they are also an imperfect tool and will often cause false negatives if you have one while having used clobetasol within 3 weeks prior to it. So that is something to keep in mind. Since you have started treatment, I would just give it a few months and if you still are not better then maybe do the biopsy. Seems like it would just backtrack any progress you have made since you have already been put on treatment.\n\nPersonally, I have not had an odor issue, but I have seen it commonly mentioned on the fb support groups. From what I know, LS does not cause odor. It could be an infection. Clob increases the risk for developing infections and LS can mask infection symptoms since they feel similar. i know i wish they had more solid information on LS. incredibly frustrating to deal with. sorry you are going through this as well Omg thank you!!! I got a blood test for ANA (autoimmune) markers and they were negative so o feel hopeless but I should be grateful that it is not an autoimmune issue. Now back to square one. Might as my doctor to do a blood test to check hormone levels? Did getting off (if you did get off) birth control help? How did you stop your birth control? Did you finish the pack out? I was coincidently one pill away from being done with the pack when I stopped. I got a copper IUD 5 days later. If you stop before finishing it would probably trigger your period or spotting, so maybe discuss with your doctor before moving forward :) i noticed a difference! it was definitely at its worst while i was still taking it. but now i do not know what birth control to take considering most are hormonal :/", "One year of treatment and still not better I realize this group has adults with LS but I am hoping you can give me some hope/new ideas. My daughter-4 was diagnosed with LS a year ago. We have seen the head pediatric dermatologist about every 2 months and have tried so many different medications. She is currently on Clobatesol and Tacrolimus. Neither of them or any of the previous medications have helped. The doctors are stumped as it is not responding to medications. How anyone tried natural treatments? How long were you on a treatment before the symptoms disappeared? Also, how painful are the flare ups? I do not know of anyone who has seen much help with \"natural remedies\". The steroid creams are really the best course of action.\nSomething that helps prevent flare-ups: avoiding anything scented on my skin. Scent free body wash, scent free laundry detergent. \nFor me flare ups can be very annoying, but not super painful. They hurt, and are uncomfortable. For me it is like a constant background annoyance/pain.  We have been avoiding scented anything for about two years now. Thank you for explaining what it feels like. She often says it hurts but at her age she cannot really explain more. Have you had a long time in between flare ups? Or are they pretty consistent? Yes I agree with previous poster, steroid cream is really the best option for treatment. When I use it regularly the flare ups are few and far between. For added comfort when there is discomfort I add baking soda to my bath and that is very relieving. Thank you for your input and bath suggestion. I appreciate it. I hope it helps, I am so sorry she has to deal with this so young. Sending love her way! \ud83d\udc95 Thank you! I really appreciate it!", "Noticed those white stains about 2 weeks ago. It isnt itchy or painfull. The skin on the stains is different. Rought I guess. Was thinking it would disappear by itself, but its still here. Is it LS?  This is quite likely to be yes.\n\nHowever, sensible approach is to have a dermotologist investigate it who is LS savvy. He will probably provide clob to see if it can restore the colour.\n\nGood luck buddy.", "Has anyone experienced getting waxed or shaving during a period of time when there is no flare up. I typically get waxed but have not since being diagnosed and I am a bit nervous to do either. Thoughts?  I had no problem with a full wax when LS was not active. I warned the tech, who was curious, but there were no major serious anatomy changes at the time so she could not tell anything was off. When not active, everything is normal. LS is not really on the skin that grows hair. Same neighborhood, different building. \n\nItched like hell growing back, but that is not LS. :-) Oh man, thank you. I have been wanting to go so bad but was not sure. I felt like I would be fine if I was not experiencing any discomfort. Thanks for the feedback and confirmation! Booking my appt now lol Please tell your esthetician, preferably when you bike, if you are using a steroid on the area to be waxed. I definitely will. Thank you Hi there, I will share what I have learned from a gynecologist and vulvar specialist who discussed grooming with LS. The safest options for hair removal with LS are laser hair removal, cream depilatory, or sugaring. If you wax, which is kind of in the middle of the spectrum, with shaving being the worst, some important tips/advice:\n\n1. Ideally, be in remission. If not in remission, make sure you have no active sores, ulcers, tears, fissures, etc.\n2. Ask the esthetician before hand if they use an oil on the skin prior to waxing (this decreasing trauma to the skin).\n3. Made sure they use a protective lotion on the skin that was waxed aftewards.\n\nPersonally, I had laser hair removal, so I do not need to fuss too much with my hair anymore and I have been in remission for over a year and a half. I am confident I would be fine if I went for waxing, but with laser hair removal, there really is not much to do. Hope this helps. Yes this helps a lot thank you. My waxer does use an oil that soothes the skin and moisturizes very well. Her products are also organic and I definitely feel more confident knowing that as long as I am not having a flare up it should be fine. I am not familiar with cream depilatory or sugaring, but I will do some research on that for sure. Thank you so much. My pleasure, glad it helped. If your nervous, you could always try just the bikini or biki and mons pubis but not the lips first. If that goes well and no flare, you can try a full Brazilian the next time. That is a really good idea. Thank you! No issues with waxing here! Hair has always been a trigger for itching a lot of the times, and waxing has eliminated a lot of those issues. The regrowth is so patchy and thin now that I do not even notice it That makes sense, I would imagine that the less hair the better. Thanks for your feedback! Update, I got waxed and there was no problem at all. Actually feels better now. I have had a couple flare ups but with there not being hair it is easier to manage.", "Contagious? I have never been diagnosed with lichen sclerosus but I am seeing my doctor on Monday to see if I can get refered to a dermatologist to get an actual diagnosis and hopefully get something to treat this. My symptoms are very dry skin, white patches, discharge, constant tears, itching and burning, been having these symptoms after I was diagnosed with having mycoplasma genitalium in September 2018, that was treated with very strong antibiotics and was told it was gone but the symptoms never went away, they came and went for the first few months but since January it is been constant with the symptoms. My boyfriend and I use condoms, but we did not once and now he has tears around his foreskin and sometimes on the head of his penis. \n\nDid I somehow give him lichen sclerosus? Is it spread through sex? Has anyone else dealt with this? I see a lot of people say they have pain with sex (i sometimes do when we do not use a lot of lube and I rip open) but does anyone have painful periods with this condition?  Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. It would be like eczema being contagious, or lupus being contagious. They are not. \n\nI will play doctor (I am not one!) and suggest that strong antibiotics could have led to a nasty yeast infection for you. That would account for some of your symptoms, and it can be contagious. But, I am not a doc. \n\nI hope you guys get it figured out! You can also she an OBGYN for this too. That how i got diagnoses of lichen. Unfortunately for me the lichen just came back it is very severe. I am on two ointments and one cream. Not it is not contagious. But guys get it too that where it shows up.  This is an auto-immune disease. It is not contagious. It is not spread through sex. I did not get diagnosed with mine until I was in my 60s. As long as I keep up with my maintenance dose of clobetasol, I do not have symptoms. Maybe we just both have it then? We have both been tested for every sti so it is definitely not that. I have seen a gyno but it was when the symptoms were off. Hopefully I can see her again soon or a dermatologist, cus it is been constant since about January. Thanks for the answers though everyone.  Can yeast infections cause tears though? I will have to ask my doctor about that. Does anyone have any recommendations for dealing with the tears?  Short answer is yes, yeast can mess up your skin like that. \n\nHonestly - as much as I hate to say it (because I kept getting told I had yeast infections when it was LS) this sounds more like yeast to me than it does LS.  LS does not involve discharge, AFAIK.  Antibiotics lead to yeast infections, yeast infections can be transmitted, your symptoms are a good match.  Have you tried using any over-the-counter yeast infection treatments?  \n\nAs far as the tears go, keeping them clean and open to the air is good.  Sleep naked. Cotton undies or go commando with a skirt during the day.  No thongs.  Do not have sex for a little while (sorry).  If it IS LS then a steroid cream would help, but if it is not, it would be the wrong treatment.  I would not put anything on them except water and maybe a single complete course of a yeast treatment until a doc gets a look. Boyfriend really needs that looked at - yeast infection under the foreskin is no joke and can lead to further problems with the penis.  Topical treatments work on dudes too but I do not know anything further about it or how to use with a foreskin.\n\nDefinitely tell doc -- I am sure they are going to want to retest you for every STI under the sun, and that is fine and good -- but they will also hear \"antibiotics\" and go right to \"yeast\", which they can also test for quickly and easily.  Lichen Sclerosus is uncommon, would be extraordinarily unlikely to affect both parts of a couple, and is not contagious.  STIs are far more common, and yeast is ultra common.  That is where my money is.  (And that is what you want.  Much more easily solved!)\n\nRandom Internet Stranger says go grab some monistat and keep your fingers crossed!", "Do you know the cause of your LS? I have never been diagnosed with any autoimmune disorder or anything else like that so I am just curious to know if you were ever given a cause/reason for yours? think it is impossible to target the cause of LS afaik. It is basically your immune system going in crazy mode. Its an autoimmune disease but I have heard women say they noticed it happened when they stated birth control and that happened to be my experience when I started the depo shot. They started at the same time. As soon as I stopped the Depo shot after 3 years, it is almost like the LS went away completely. From time to time I get a flare up, but it is normally because I sweat too much at night and my underwear caused it. Does it get worse when you sweat more? And what about the underwear? I have not heard about this at all, dermatologist mentioned nothing else I could do aside from clobetasal! Any advice would be so appreciated Started with birth control too! Combo pill When I sweat at night my underwear gets kind of moist and I notice that I get a flare up bc of it. I started sleeping without underwear but my derm said that wearing the underwear is actually better bc it soaks up most of the sweat where as without underwear, it just sits there. Which makes sense. So I just try to change out of my underwear asap when it happens. I get a flare up maybe once every couple months or longer. But it is always something small that triggers it. Some people say they get flare ups from diet or stress. But I have not noticed that correlation in myself. I think it is hard to pin down a cause as it is an autoimmune disease but mine begin as a pre teen, which is apparently quite common for LS, so I guess hormones and puberty have a role in it? My LS was caused by childhood trauma which led to c-ptsd, that is what my therapist has said anyway. People who experience stress/trauma are likely to have skin conditions. So yours went away after cessation pf the Depo? You didnt use Clob or any steroids? I used clob and still do when I get flare ups but it is not common that I do. Once I stopped taking the birth control shots (the Depo) it is like it went away almost completely. There was no more itching, burning, or fissures. And sex is completely non painful during and after? I have only had sex a few times in the last 4 years. So it was typically painful on insertion but after the initial insertion, it was fine. i suspect i have LS (based on having a majority of the listed symptoms). the symptoms all started when i stared BC too. has anyone stopped birth control and had all LS stop too?? I had almost the same exact experience as you except I was using birth control pills instead of the depo shot.", "Can I cycle (bike) having this condition? Hi there! Not formally diagnosed... have been waiting to see my doctor, but I am 90% sure I have this condition... In the meantime a walk-in doctor told me to use hydrocortisone 1% for symptoms as needed. Unfortunately it gets SO itchy I have to use the hydrocortisone, I know it is better not to prior to diagnosis but I really cannot handle not using it. Vaseline itself is not enough, the hydrocortisone really helps.\n\nAnyhoo.... prior to the itching I LOVED biking. I am scared if I bike I will make it worse. I do not itch the area at all \u2014 although it drives me bananas. \n\nI have a road bike with padded chamois. Any advice? Biking made mine worse. However there is a ton of seats out there that can make it more comfortable! I got a noseless seat that has made biking doable for me again :) My doctor told me to try and not bike or limit it. I admit.. I did end up going after this post. I feel okay right now but I am sticking some ice between my legs. I hope I do not regret this later I have a physically active job as a landscaper/gardener and LS never affected my ability to do any of those activities.  \n\nI used to cycle a ton, but I started getting big painful boils on my butt from sitting on long rides, so I cycle pretty rarely now.  Saddle sores are what cyclists call them I guess..? I never figures out any way to avoid the saddle sores, other than not sitting at all.  I even get them if I am sitting for too long in something other than a bicycle seat!  Good thing I dont have to sit for my job.\n\nIf you do try going for a bicycle ride, I would maybe try aplying a thin layer of coconut oil over your LS affected skin before your ride.  Keeping things moist with coconut oil helps the skin a lot in general, and it should help reduce any possible irritation during your ride.\n\nHope this info helps. And I especially hope you are able to continue to enjoy riding! aagh, that itch. Use the hydrocortisone, that is a low dose of the steroid typically prescribed for LS, and should not affect a diagnosis. Or use anything that helps you. Soaking in the bathtub and moisturizing w coconut oil or emu oil helps me. I have not even tried to cycle bc I fear a return of the satanic flare up but hear of women who do with a certain seat. I think once you get treated and it calms down you will be fine. I bike with no problems, and all other activities are fine as well.", "Flare/Pubic Hair Hey everyone,\n\nI have sort of an odd question- and it is purely anecdotal- just something I have noticed with myself.\n\nI have had LS for awhile and it normally does not cause much of an issue. It seems to be mostly contained to one area in the crease between my inner and outer labia.  \n\nOver the course of the last several months, I have noticed something though- if I let my pubic hair grow out, I will *always* have a flare.  If I keep it shaved or trimmed, I have no issues.  It does not happen immediately, but it is like once it gets to a certain length, I have new white patches, thinning and tearing, etc.  \n\nI developed a patch that had quite a bit of tearing. I did all my rx creams, etc, but it did not seem to be getting better.  I finally gave in and shaved everything a few days ago, and it was 90% better within a couple of days.  This is not the first time I have made this correlation. \n\nAny thoughts? It is not that big of a deal, I know, but constantly shaving comes with other issues. I have seen a few people comment that hair can be itchy. I personally do not have an issue one way or the other. But I would recommend using a trimmer instead of a razor, you might have fewer issues with hair regrowth. I keep my trimmed or fuzzy. If I let it get any longer, I get a flare. I dont have so much experience to compare but my derm doctor said exactly the same and sugested to me laser hair removal. I am still confused what to do cause I dont want to remove all mu pubic hair. I also dont see  another option but laser hair removal since razors and waxing are nightmares for the skin I am glad to know it is not just me, but I am sorry you are having the same issue. \n\nI understand. I do not actually want to remove all my pubic hair these days. I am going to use a trimmer in the meantime. I have a bikini trimmer that gets pretty close to the skin without the issue from a razor.  Thank you for sharing you experience. I have never used one but will it cause any damage on the skin? Is it painful? No damage to the skin and not painful.  You will not be as smooth as with a razor, but it is not unpleasant either. I am not diagnosed with LS but I have very similar problems to many in this sub and to OP. That Is why I have decided to laser the hair on my outer labia and between inner and outer labia. It helped me a lot but I am also using creams to treat LS which help me with flare ups.\n\nSo if you dont want to laser all your pubic hair I just want to tell you that there are many different styles to laser. I still have all my hair (on my mons pubis) but lasered the part on my outer labia. It looks like an \"extended\" landing strip and I really like it!", "Is a biopsy painful? Im scared that i might have LS as a slightly visible light patch on the penis head and i read up on it and i heard you need to get a biopsy to diagnose it. Im worried about how painful it could be and how i can take care of it at home until I can get medical care(under lockdown right now) For me, it was not that bad. I only felt the local anaesthetic shots to the shaft at the beginning, which were unpleasant, but after that did not feel any pain during the procedure. When the anaesthetics subsided, it was a bit unpleasant at times and the next few days, mostly during the night, but it was fine shortly after.\nAbout what you can do at home until you can get it checked out, i think not much. If it is not painful or anything, i guess you could just apply a regular skin moisturising cream or skin repair balm every day, that is what i was told to do until further checkup. I heard soap is also a big no,is that true?\n\nalso, is it possible the white spots isint LS and could be something harmless that is goes away by itself. Been panaicking for the past few hours about it I have never had soap come directly in contact with my spot on the glans, so not sure, but i guess i would avoid it.\nAnd sure it is possible that it could be something else, but based on where it is, i think it would be best to speak with a doctor about it asap, even if it could be something harmless. I would advise you to get in touch with your GP about it, even if only over the phone and go from there. I am AFAB so my biopsy will have been different to what you would have to get, but honestly the worst part is getting the anaesthetic injected. It is not a nice sensation I am not going to lie.\nBut equally, it was no worse than getting my armpit, elbow, elbow ditch tattooed.\nPeeing for me was a bitch cause unless I sat specifically the urine would sometimes go over the biopsy site.\nBut depending on where the glans you would need a biopsy, you might not have this issue. Are biopsys always necessary for LH? I am honestly not too sure! The way my dermatologist spoke about it it seemed like it was the most surefire way of diagnosing it. Alright,will see a GP after lockdown, Thanks! Alright,will do. Just one more thing, when you said skin moisturizer in the inital comment does the moisturizer that i normally use for my hands and all that count or are you referjng to something else? Yeah, the one you use normally for hands should suffice, that is what i used and still use sometimes.\n\nAlso, i remember that initially my GP told me to try an antifungal cream. The one i got did not require a prescription, so maybe you could try that first. Good luck. if you have a real bad case of LS and a doc who is familiar with LS its not a must-have. but that is a very specific combination of circumstances.\nif you dont have a really bad case and/or your doctor isnt familiar with LS, i would have a biopsy.\nthe complication rate of a biopsy carried out by an expert and in a proper way is very low. most common is bleeding after the biopsy. the wound heals in a few weeks and depending on the method there wont even be a scar. this by the way says a lot about how minor this procedure is. as a rule of thumb: the smaller the procedure the smaller are the risks. on the other hand you get a highly reliable report that will either confirm or rule out LS and a myriad of other deseases. Thanks, i made the mistake of looking at videos of incisional biopsy and got major anxiety from it lmao. Will try to see the doctor soon and get it sorted out. Just been ensuring i dont use soap on it at the moment. Only thing is i have major exams soon and i dont want to do the papers under that kind of discomfort. But if a biopsy is that important  then i guess its probably for the best dont watch the videos. the is no merrit in it for you, since you wont perform the procedure on yourself. so in the best case you watch the doc performing the biopsy and from your point of view it seems like hes doin everything correctly, or he does something unexpected and you panic. panicing certainly wont influence the whole situation in a positive way.\n\na biopsy is a minor prodcedure that is performed tens of thousands of times each year. if there were serious risks with high probability, physicians wouldnt perform it so frequently\n\nedit: i wish you a shitton of success in your exams :)! by the way: the 3 physicians i asked so far all said that soap is not to be used on your penis. i held off on going to a doctor for months because i am so freaked out by biopsies and general medical stuff. i finally bit the bullet today and requested a biopsy at my appointment. i am a female and honestly the only thing i felt was the shot to numb it. it stung for a second but no major pain or anything. i have not felt anything since (and i held up the sheet while she worked and did the stitches because i would flip if i saw anything). it is been 4 hours so i am sure the shot will wear off soon. i can update on pain, if any, later! please do report! i imagine that there is quite a number of ppl afraid of biopsy and experience reports will help diminishing the fear. I have had absolutely 0 pain! Seriously only thing I felt, at all, was the small pinch from the needle (literally just said \u201coh shit\u201d when they did it) then felt nothing! I honestly feel stupid for having put it off so long. The biopsy was not painful. Felt some stinging discomfort after the feeling came back. Had to adjust the way I sat. Also, I made sure urine did not get on the wound.  I peed in a large plastic cup. The pee really stings. I also rinsed with water and patted dry. Its healed after 2 weeks. Healed after 2 weeks huh, was the biopsy from the foreskin? No. Perianal area. &gt;by the way: the 3 physicians i asked so far all said that soap is not to be used on your penis.\n\nWhy is that? perfumed soap is bad for your skin. same goes for soap that is not ph-neutral. clean water is fully sufficient from a hygine standpoint I do not use perfumed soap.  Been using Dove for sensitive skin.  I asked several physicians too.  Urologist recommend mild soap and water. go with it then. i stopped using soap on my penis 6 months ago and so far im fine. no smells, no desease, no anything \ud83d\ude05", "New Diagnosis age 27 I was diagnosed with LS on March 19th 2021 after months of suffering and have been on a steroid cream for just over two weeks. I do not have any a symptoms on a daily basis other than fusing from going undiagnosed for a period of time. I am however still expecting intense burning and pain after sex. Not during, just within 10 mins after and it lasts until I sleep it off, sometimes into the next day. I have never had health concerns in the past and am having trouble finding resources about this. Does anyone have any advice on how to live with this? Any products to purchase / avoid that will make life easier? Any advice in general with be appreciated. Thank you! :) I used to get a lot of pain after intercourse also untill I started treatment.  I personally chose to pass on steroid creams and instead used a home-made plant-based savle which was able to eliminate all my symptoms and even reverse pigment loss.  I stopped having itching and pain and stuff almost immediately but regaining pigment took a little longer.\n\n-the ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology enthusiast Hi! I am 22 and was just diagnosed last October first and then again feb 2021, by a more knowledgeable doctor. I had the SAME burning post sex that you describe, like exactly that! It took awhile but after staying consistent with the clob/estrogen and borax soaks every say, I am completely okay as long as we use a good lube like slippery stuff or coconut oil. Use lots of lube. Infuse coconut oil with weed and you are in for a real treat lol. I also found dilating a bit helped stretch the skin around the opening so there is fewer issues there. I have never really torn though, so I am lucky there. Idk if this helps, but the pain after sex really does get better with treatment and was actually the first thing to really go away for me! It was just extremely slow for me but I got there and you will too! \nFor day to day comfort, I avoid underwear, take lots of borax baths, pat not wipe after peeing, use lots of moisturizers when I feel dry, and of course follow my doctors recommendations for clob and estrogen. I also cut gluten from my diet which I feel like helped me a bit, but idk. Thanks so much that is actually really helpful and comforting to know someone else had the same symptoms and overcame them. I had no idea about Borax baths and the weed coconut oil is also something I would not have though of either! \ud83d\ude02 Thank you! I will do more research into a more natural solution, I really appreciate the info about your experience. :) As far as know I am the first to use this medicinal plant to treat LS.  I have researched it quite extensively and would love to share more info if you want. Haha yes! It sounds totally crazy but borax is actually really commonly used for LS. If you join any of the FB support groups (except for the UK one lol they have issues w borax idk) they will have loads more info and experiences with it. Basically, you start with a couple table spoons in a bath, and build up from there to a concentration that is most beneficial to you. Some people get itchy from too much (ironically everywhere but the vulva) so they dial it back. I do not really have issues so I had like a cup now! It helps a lot and prevents and even reverses fusing if you have any of that. I did not, so I cannot comment. I really do think it played a big role in being able to have sex again though. Good luck! \ud83d\udc96 \nMale or female? \nBesides the post sex burning, any other issues? \nDo you use any hormonal medications? wow I did not know you could reverse fusing! i was recently diagnosed a few days ago and notice my labia shrinking rapidly. i assume that is due to fusing. it is weird bc i dont have any pain, itching, or tearing, just the white patches and noticing architectural changes/thinner and smaller labia minora. does the borax help with the white patches? thanks! Hi there! Female, no other symptoms besides the pain and I do have fusing although I did not even know I had that until my doctor pointed it out. I do not use any hormonal medications orally, although I do have a Kylena IUD &amp; a ovarian cyst. I have never had white patches but other people on FB have said it helps them with theirs! It is no replacement for clob but when you do both together it is really really helpful to speed up healing \n\nThis Dr has sssoo much helpful information. As does her clinic, and the Instagram below which also has a podcast!! Listen to the episode with Dr.Krapf seriously life changing!!!\n\n Okay great I gave the Instagram a follow, &amp; I will definitely check out the podcast. Thank you!! Lots of lube, communication, and a perinatal cold pack (basically an ice pack pad) after sex. You got this!!\n\nAlso - for me sex is very psychological. If I am worried about the pain it makes it worse. Lots of foreplay, good vibes, and a glass of wine - but I enjoyed all of that before my diagnosis too!", "Tretinoin for LS Posting a quick link to a study on Trentinoin for LS\n\nI have some of this in this concentration on hand for wrinkle prevention and may try this. \n\n", "Itch relief? Itching really bad today. Has anyone found a way to relieve the itch? Aquaphor \ud83d\udc4d On my genitals? I am female and my obgyn told me I could use aquaphor ointment on my vulva. It helps to lock the good moisture in. Yes. Make sure you get ointment. NOT CREAM. I saw a cream version too. Cream can make some people burn. Ointment is good and relieving \ud83d\udc4d Interesting! Thank you!  My dermatologist told me to keep the area moist to prevent itching, and recommended using Vaseline there.  I have been using hydromol ointment for just over a month and tbh it is been a life saver. It is helped take the itch away and I have not had to use my steroid every day!!  I am all about zinc ointment. It is abit messy but it really helps.  taro clobetasol  I use shea butter when that happens.  Clobatasol ointment will be a huge help but while you wait for that to kick in I recommend an ice pack. Its especially helpful when you are trying to fall asleep! I am able to use the cheap anti-itch cream clubs at the Dollar Tree (thankfully) and it really helps my itching a lot, a little goes a long way", "Have the symptoms, would like advice. I have the symptoms, the itching, pretty large amount of skin discoloration. I am in the middle of the most intense flare up. Constant itching so bad I cant focus on anything else. I have an appointment at the end of the month to confirm that it is lichen sclerosus.\n\nI have a couple questions if anybody can help me out. From my research it does not seem like there is really a solid known cause. Have doctors appointments given you any insight into what is causing it for  you, is it different for each patient? Are there other health conditions that you have found to be linked to this for you? A friend of mine who has MS says I should tell my doctor about any health problems I have had recently. Did you all do this? There are a couple of things you can do in the meantime that will not be an issue for you if it turns out not to be LS.  \n\n\n\nOne is to get a sprayer for your toilet like the SonTiy handheld bidet sprayer (that one is metal, there are cheaper ones like it that are plastic) or, if you work outside the home, you can get a portable bidet.  Spray yourself clean every time you pee.  Urine can exacerbate the condition and wiping is not good enough, so spray yourself clean every time to reduce symptoms.\n\n\n\nThe second thing you can do is apply aloe or coconut oil to the affected area for some relief.  This is not perfect and will not make it go away entirely, but it can be somewhat soothing.  Get a product that is as close to natural as possible (I keep my own aloe plants).  \n\n\n\n\nLS is rare enough that there is not a lot of money in it, therefore not a lot of research, so there is a lot we do not know.  The typical treatment is a topical steroid ointment call Clobetasol with a tapered dosage (usually once per day for six weeks, once every other day for six weeks, then twice weekly for maintenance for perpetuity).  It is a treatment, not a cure.  \n\n\n\nFor me, the biggest difference came when I started spraying every time I used the toilet to make it through between the twice weekly Clobetasol doses without a flare.\n\n\n\nLS is thought to be autoimmune or due to hormone imbalance (again, not enough research to be positive).  Your doctor may ask you questions along those lines or about your medical history in general to be careful they are not missing anything in your diagnosis.  If your doctor asks, definitely give an honest answer.  \n\n\n\n\nThis is not really the kind of club people want to join, but welcome!  Best wishes! Yes, it is not proven what causes LS. The three main theories are: genetic/autoimmune, irritant exposure (like urine) and infectious origin (like the tick-borne agent that causes Lyme Disease.) It could, of course, be a combination, too. \n\nI expect it is unlikely that a doctor will be able to figure out what initially caused your LS, but I think what matters more anyway is to determine what triggers flare-ups or symptoms.\n\nAnd yes, you should always tell your doctor about any other conditions or symptoms you have, even if they do not \"seem\" like they could be related. But in particular, autoimmune diseases often co-occur with LS, like vitiligo, psoriasis, diabetes, thyroid diseases, etc. \n\nIn the mean time, I hope you can find some symptom relief! Sitz baths and ice packs can be really helpful for itching. Lidocaine can seriously help the itching until then. It burns there is no way around it but 20 seconds later the relief is real. Thyroid diseases commonly coexist with LS. After getting diagnosed with LS, I was then found to have hypothyroidism and a pituitary tumor.\n\nGiving up dairy, gluten, and sugar has made a tremendous difference. I can do butter but no other dairy products. If I eat cheese or something glutinous, I will have a LS flare within one week and it can last up to 2-3 weeks.\n\nWhat works well for me is using Vagisil wipes and not scratching/touching it at all. 100% cotton underwear or no underwear at all. Nothing tight and bunched up in there. Thanks for sharing the idea of using Vagicil Wipes. I always use wet wipe (usually baby wipes) to clean the area after using washroom, but did not know Vagicil Wipes exist. LS is like satan in your crotch. Moisturizing definitely helps and when the itching is intense I take Benadryl. You can also rinse with just a bottle of water (awkward but it works). I also get relief from soaking in the bath and using lots of coconut oil. Good luck\u2764\ufe0f", "Clobetasol vs Triamcinolone My obgyn prescribed me triamcinolone ointment but a lot of people in this group use clobetasol. Is there really that big of a difference? Clob is a strong steroid. Triamcinolone is a medium strength steroid, but still does the job. I had clob at first, but it was too much for my skin apparently and caused a whole bunch of additional irritation. I use triamcinolone with no issues at all and it has worked beautifully. I used triamcinolone when I was pregnant, and it was effective enough at that time. \n\nIf it works for you, you want that. I would say it depends on your level of severity. I was prescribed triamcinolone and it did nothing for me but clob did the job. Triamcinolone works great for me! I was discussing my Lichen with a friend in her 4th years of med school and she was surprised that I got the Clob before trying the Triamcinologue. I think the Clob is prescribed to stronger cases or if the first one does not work as great. Question, how long did the second medication start to work? I got a lower strength medication yesterday and looking to know how long it takes to set in. I was diagnosed a few days ago and I am confused if I should be putting the Triamcinolone everywhere or just where I see the white? Thanks How soon did you realize that clob was irritating your skin? I am afraid i may be in the same boat It took about a week. I had noticed an increase in pain in the area and at first had just thought that maybe it was a flare. But then I realized it was a different pain in some aspects - it did not itch as much like LS. It was more like a dull, almost constant burning feeling that I had not really experienced before. When I grabbed a hand mirror and looked I realized all my skin was very red and angry, which it had not been prior to starting the steroid. So I talked to my dermatologist and he agreed I was probably having a reaction and prescribed me the triamcinolone to try instead. I waited a week or so to calm my skin down and the irritation stopped after I stopped applying the clob, so I knew that is what it was. Thank you so much! I think I relate to the dull burning feeling, but it is so subtle! I am making an appointment with a new gyno who has info on LS on her site, so hopefully that will confirm if iit's doing any good.", "Quitting the anticonception pill Hi everyone!\n\nI am a 20 year old female and i have been loosly diagnosed with LS by my doctor a few weeks ago. She sent me to the dermatologist for an official diagnosis, and i will get the final results on monday because they wanted to rule out any bacterial infections. I have had symptoms fiting with LS for a few years, mainly pain during and after sex. I thought it was 'normal' but this diagnosis explains everything. I have had wounds for about a month now and it hurts and itches the entire day. I could not get treatment yet, so they could see it well enough in hospital. \n\nI have researched a lot about LS already as well as joining this sub and i have seen woman say they stopped with the anticonception pill to help with their symptoms. I am wondering if any of you have stopped taking anticonception and what your experiences were. Did it help? As mentioned i am only 20 so anticonception is quite important to me but i also rarely have sex anyways (probably) due to LS. I want to know if quitting anticonception is worth it.\n\nThank you all for this amazing and informative sub and i hope some of you might be able to help me out a bit! Hi I also wonder this cause I asked my doctor and he said that it is irrelacant but I am suspicipus about the pills but cannot find any better idea since condoms are terrible for me. Have you had flare ups after pills? It could be worth just trying steroid treatment (after you have had it confirmed) and see if that helps! That way you might not need to stop the pill and find an alternative contraception :).\n\nI did try stopping the pill to see if it would help it get better, but I really think it did not change for me (although everyone is different!). For me, routine steroid treatments really keep it manageable.\n\nI hope you find a strategy that works for you!!! There are a lot of awful and scary stories out there - but for many with LS treatment does give relief and makes life that much easier :) I believe i have done some sort of hormonal cream treatment about 3 years ago (wrong diagnosis, right treatment. Very weird situation). The treatment worked right away back then so i have high hopes for this time. To be honest i have wondered about quitting the pill for a while now for multiple reasons, it is not great for your body anyways. So this could be the deciding factor!\n\nThanks for your response, i really appreciate it! I personally thought it was relevant due to stories i have read, but i have not checked with my doctor yet (i will do that as soon as my diagnosis comes in). I have not noticed any flare ups after i have taken pills. I have also been using the pill since i was around 12/13 years old, so i would believe my body is quite used to it by now. I will let you know if you want when i hear back from my doctor! I would love to, thanks! I have just started to be on pills this year so and having a really bad flare ip since then so very crouis about what your doctor going to say. Hi, I really believe it depends on what kind of pill you are on. Some progestins are anti-androgenic and they indeed have been associated with increased risk of LS, but others may actually be protective and I think most are neutral. I would ask the dermatologist when you see them. If they think it is a problem, get a referral to a gynecologist (or see your PCP if you have one and they are good at this stuff) to switch you to another type of pill or a different method of birth control. Hi I was on birth control for ten years and once I came off it my body was in a roller coaster for about a year. Even though there is no link between LS and birth control I believe the hormonal component cannot be ignored. I have been completely off the pill for four years and I was recently diagnosed with LS. I do not think stopping the pill caused my LS but the years artificial hormones screwed with my body. I am thinking I have a hormonal imbalance now. I am 32. I am planning on asking my doctor for hormone testing. But anyway, the gold standard of treatment is the steroid creams/ointment (clob or triam). Estrogen creams are given to women who are post menopausal who no longer create estrogen but do not really help women in child bearing years. Please google Dr. Jill Krapf and find her info on the pill and LS. She is a leading expert on LS treatment and research. You can find info about her clinic and her posts on Facebook and Insta. When I stopped taking the pill my symptoms noticeably decreased in days. My flare ups occur mostly around my period so I think my LS is definitely related to my hormones.", "For those of you out there that have undergone PRP treatment for LS... Has it worked? Would you consider your case \u201csevere\u201d (whether in intensity or area affected, etc.)?

Thanks! What is PRP treatment? Platelet rich plasma. I have seen a few people post about it on here awhile back &amp; was looking for some personal experiences about its effectiveness.", "yeast infections and steroids Yet another question, folks! My vulva went suddenly quite red and inflamed about five days ago, and I have had three or four instances of finding odourless but chunky globs of white discharge since then. (Sorry, fairly disgusting, but I think in this group anything below the belt goes.) I am assuming this is thrush and I know it is not unusual to get it from steroid use, so I took a one-pill treatment two days ago. So far, there is no sign of it departing. I have to confess I have not had thrush in years so I can hardly remember if it normally takes longer than this for the pill to do its work, but if it is not enough to clear it after another couple of days, am I alright to use an antifungal cream on a day I am not using steroids? Was not sure if it would interfere and it is impossible to see a GP at the moment as they are oversubscribed. I had this problem too when I was on a course of antibiotics! My doctor told me it is fine to mix the thrush cream with Clobetasol! I would apply the Clobetasol first so it soaks in, then use the thrush cream. The anti-fungal pill can take a week I am sure! Okay, thanks! I did seem to remember this was a common issue. I will give it a full week and see if things calm and then get some antifungal cream if not. You can use the anti-fungal cream for some itch relief just now if you think it is a yeast infection! Before I was correctly diagnosed recently with LS I had, what I thought, was a persistent yeast infection so I learned quite a bit about them. My doctor told me the pill only stops new fungus growth, it does not kill existing fungus. Typically the one pill is enough to take care of it but sometimes requires a second dose after 3 days and/or the anti fungal cream. Your discharge sounds like a yeast infection so trying some anti fungal cream sounds like a good plan. If your symptoms do not improve in the next couple days you can have a swab done at a walk in clinic to confirm yeast. Thanks, sounds like a good plan. Was mainly wondering if the antifungal cream might interfere with the LS or the steroid cream in some way, but it seems not! Hi there. If you suspect but are not sure if it is yeast, I would suggest seeing your doctor for confirmation. There are two main types of yeast infections, vaginal (accompanied by the clumpy, white, discharge) and vulvar (no discharge). A rarer side effect of steroid use is yeast, and when this occurs, doctors typically put patients on a preventative anti-fungal regime (often nystatin) or they reduce the potency of the steroid (potentially moving from an ultra-potent topical corticosteroid to a potent or mid-potent steroid. If the doctor finds it is yeast, and if it is recurrent, you might have this discussion with them. I would definitely always get confirmation with a doctor when it comes to yeast, because if you treat for yeast and it is not yeast, this can be irritating to the vulva/vagina. I have not had thrush since I was a teen, but when I took the oral pill for thrush, I think it took 3-5 days for me to feel completely clear.", "Does anyone know what this is?! All blood tests are negative and urine tests are negative as well. But I have this white bump/spot on my urethra. On the bottom left, looks like there is a little bit of redness as well. I have had this for a while. Do not know what this is. LS? HPV? URETHRAL CANCER?  Have you been to a doctor or a dermatologist to take a look at it? It is not entirely clear to me what it could be, but maybe you should post it on r/Askdocs and see if a dermatologist can weigh in and give you better direction. I have seen a doctor for it before, but not a dermatologist, because the doctor did not think anything of it. But it is been there for a while now, and I cannot get into seeing a dermatologist because of this whole pandemic going on right now... idk what to do anymore m. But I have thee issues that are starting to frighten me. Ok, I am not a doctor, but I will say a few things. This does not look like HPV or herpes. I would suspect if it was BXO (what LS is called in males), it would cover a wider area of the skin. \n\nCouple of questions - Does it itch? Does it sting when urinating? Is the skin raised or textured? To my knowledge, skin cancers (no matter where the skin affects) will cause a lot of itching and can appear as a very hard nodule or an open sore that does not heal. \n\nIt does seem very benign to me, but I know just how much anxiety can get to the mind. Often times derms are willing to take a look at images of skin conditions on r/Askdocs. It itself does not get itchy. I get stinging there though. And in my genital themselves I get itchy, but not on that spot in the picture. It does sometimes sting/burn when urinating. It does look like the skin is raised but not hard nodule. And I cannot tell if it is textured. There is another post on my page with other spots. Idk if these look like anything or not?..  Go to a dermatologist or LS specialist? I am sorry you are dealing with this, but we are not doctors and we are here for the same reasons and cannot diagnose you.", "25 y/o Male. Which steroid creams have people personally had the most success with?  32 f here, I have found dermovate (clobetasol) and hydromol emollient to help.

Honestly other a small cut I tend to get right before my period and some white patches I do not have any complications. Because it is not much of an issue for me and it does not effect my ability to have sex and it is not contagious I do not normally talk about it with my partners but I want to share with my current partner as we seem to be going into something more long term and am just unsure how to have/start the conversation. Anyone else have some experience or advice they can share? Thanks so much! I told my husband who was familiar with my dry skin...  \u201chey you know how I have dry skin everywhere? At my last appointment I was diagnosed with ls which basically means I have skin dryness and I tear easily down there.  Also it is like eczema, meaning I have it but you cannot catch it from me.\u201d  Then I basically went into more details while also being like and all the lube please. I say \"I have an autoimmune disease called lichen sclerosus. It effects the skin around my genitalia. Like all autoimmune diseases, it is not contagious.

I hope LS started to form because of the friction and urine and not autoimune im afriad it will comeback after circumsision or in this 14-20 days spread to urine hole since its very close when its not pulled back.

I had a punch biopsy done. My Dr was surprised as I have the white patches and all clinical signs of Lichen Sclerosis. However these two can be commonly mistaken for one another upon physical examination. \n\nUnfortunately, even with long term treatment and everything I never found relief..I struggled for years and years and years with it. Lots of scarring, some atrophy, and severe depression as a side effect. Then I moved out of my main city and to the country. A few months after living in the country it just went away. I had no problems at all except a few UTIs. \n\nNow to last week. 1 week ago I moved back to my city and bam it is a huge flare up. One of the worst I have had my entire life.\n\nAm I allergic to the water here?\n\nIs it coincidental?\n\nAny suggestions on what I can do for relief? \n\nSince I was seeing a vulvar disorder specialist here I am going to go back to her but being gone for two years makes me a new patient...so I have to redo the referral and be put on the wait list for a new patient appointment...I am suffering now. I need relief now. The ER just wants to teste for STDs, give me steroids(oral) and send me on my way. I wish I could get a topical steroid but they said until STD results come back they will not. This is the same hospital connected to my vulvr disorder specialists office so they were able to see all my records. Yet they refused to listen to me and help me. I am in so much pain. I have large fissures, lesions and extreme bumpy skin. The white patches are back. Urination, sitting, standing, breathing, it all hurts. Interesting tbh... When you were in the country it went away completely? How long were you there? I was there just under 2 years. Not a single flareup. I actually thought I was \"cured\". I was diagnosed with LSC or LS they could not tell me for sure, I had a biopsy as well. I did not have any problems until I moved into a new house but same city. I also thought it was the water but every Dr. I brought it up to did not seem to think so. I do not have tearing, white patches or anything like that. Just inflammation and itching. I am seeing a Vulvar Specialist via Telehealth as its the only way I can right now. The Derm and GYN were really no help and just told me to keep using hydrocortisone when I get super itchy and keep doing all the stuff Ive been doing. All free and clear laundry, no dryer sheets, no underwear or 100% cotton, loose pants, 100% pads, no tampons, no sex, vanicream body wash. I did not have any issues prior and I was a lot more careless before. I hope you feel better soon! I will let you know if I find anything helpful out my app is on Thursday. I hope they can get you in fast! Good luck! Is it possible you were less stressed in the country? That is a good point! I have had it chronically since 2014, no matter where I have lived; I have not lived in the country but have moved from Southern to Northern CA and still have it. I definitely was. Or so I think I was less stressed. I have LSC, seems to flare up around my period Stress is a big contributor!!! I was diagnosed with vulvar LSC last year, I feel your pain :( I still have flare ups despite the steroid prescriptions as well. Have you recently incorporated any new shower products into your routine or tight/synthetic fabrics into your wardrobe? those + my period are the main culprits for me.\n\nWhen I am having a rough flare up, I take a bath with epsom salt and a tiny bit of coconut oil, then slather the area in Vaseline and a steroid ointment. Also lidocaine! It burns at first but I find the numbing is worth it to keep my mind off it even the tiniest bit. I will bathe multiple times a week until it fades away. Sending you good vibes, hoping it calms down soon!!", "lubricant recommendations? I have used organic, sensitive skin lubricant that has been HORRIBLE and irritating in the past. I was not treating my LS at the time so it could have changed but I was wondering if anyone had recommendations. A lot of people have recommended uberlube. I have not used it personally, I have been using fuckwater and have had no issues so far so i feel like i have seen people on this sub using coconut oil to moisturize, but i know some people also use it as lube so i feel like it could work and be LS safe. would definitely confirm this though!! we use coconut oil. highly recommend. Uber lube is great! And so is coconut oil Seconding coconut oil as lube! It is the only thing that I have tried that does not burn. (Note: do not use if you use condoms!)\n\nI am interested in trying CBD lube, though, ideally coconut oil based. Has anyone tried that? Have a brand to recommend? Try Sex Stuff lube by Love Wellness. Also their product \u201cThe Killer\u201d has been something like a miracle for me, might be worth looking into Coconut oil is wonderful for this. For just moisturizing, Vaseline and Aquafor. Yes oil based, in the tube (coconut oil burns me)", "LS Bruising Hello,\n\nMy wife has LS and recently found a bluish/black spot on her labia minora. Dr said it is probably just from a tear or from bruising. Just wondering is this consistent amongst others that also deal with LS. We have got an appointment with her OBGYN in a few weeks but would like to get some info to help her. \n\nThanks", "How often do you have flare ups? Is LS consistent or do you have flare ups every now and then? During quarantine I think I experienced my first flare up. I could not go to the doctor but a teledoctor said it looked like Lichen and prescribed a cream that worked. I feel like I am having another flare up so just wondering how often do you have them? Also, do you experience minor bleeding? Flare ups depend on a lot of things. How dedicated you are to your respective treatments, stress, diet, sleep (or lack thereof), wrong soaps, wrong fabric on your undies, you name it! So, that is going to differ greatly  from person to person. But yes, I personally have had minor bleeding with flare ups.\n\nETA I am sure the bleeding is from tearing Thanks! Do you experience the symptoms all the time or only during flare ups? There are very few days when I do not experience some kind of symptom, but if I make sure to use my steroid cream &amp; all the other ancillary steps, it can be very manageable. I do not have it nearly as severe as some people, though. One of my big triggers of flare ups is stress, which for me has been hard to manage lately.\n\nETA have you had a biopsy? Bc I know there are things that may present like LS and the creams prescribed will work (I mean, let us face it, what would not a steroid cream work on?) A biopsy is really the only way you can be properly and positively diagnosed. Thank you for your response! You are welcome! I do hope you get some answers but it is always best go to the doctor. Good luck! I was diagnosed about 7 years ago.  Flare up do indeed depend on a lot of things. I definitely get them if I get lazy with the clobatesol. The summer heat and humidity is also an problem. Yes, I am going to the gyno tomorrow! Hopefully she is able to help make a proper diagnosis or maybe refer me to a dermatologist In addition to stress, mine gets worse with hormones every month with my period, so I make sure to use my cream a bit more to prevent itching and the start of skin break down.", "White dot at the back of my penis Hi all, \nI was diagnosed with LS last year. The dermo prescribed me with a emollient and a steroid cream, after a few weeks of using them everything was in the clear. Since then I have only had to use the cream a few times over the last year. From mid December I found a small dot at the back of my penis, below the head, I did not think much of it and just left it. Few weeks down the line now and it is still there, no change in shape or size. It feels like a spot, I am not sure if it is PPP, or something else. I am using the emollient and steroid for the last few days, but it is not going away. As we are going through COVID/ lockdown I am not sure how quickly I can get a dermo to have a look. \n\nAny advise? Can you take as high res pictures of it as possible with and without a flash and forward to a dermo along with chronological info for a dermo or urologist to investigate? I guess I can do that. All the best bro. Presume you got given Dermovate or trimovate? Thank you. \n\nI got given Dermol and a cream called Daktacort. After the initial diagnosis, it is been working well for the past year. Used it a few times and within a week or so, it is cleared up. Just got tiny spot that is freaked me out. Hello mate, let us know how you go. Glad the creams worked for the initial bout", "Is this lichen sclerosus? I am 25 yr old male. This thing has been stable like this for 2 years since it appeared. It rarely itches. ", "Birth control? Did birth control make anyone's LS worse/better? I am currently on the birth control pill (layolis fe) and I have been on it for almost five years. For context I am 18, female. Never seemed to give me any problems except I gained a few pounds and went up a few cup sizes. It helped my absolutely horrible periods and I obviously like it for contraceptive purposes too.\n\nI was suspected to have LS very early when my childhood pediatrician noticed white spots, probably around age 11, but it was never brought up again or treated whatsoever. All of my symptoms came back circa 2019 and I believe birth control may be playing a factor but I am not sure. Should I get off the birth control pill? My gynecologist said it plays no role but she is been wrong about other stuff before (she does not know too much about LS, I am switching to a different gyno and derm when I move this summer.)\n\nWill birth control make my LS worse/better? Does anyone have any experience with this? I have heard LS is associated with low estrogen levels but does not birth control raise your estrogen? Try to get off of them and use other methods of contraception i.e condoms, pull outs.. etc \n\nIt surely is not ideal for your body.. DO NOT USE PULL OUT FOR BIRTH CONTROL!! Depends how okay you are with an accidental pregnancy. It is about 78% effective, so you essentially have a bit under a 1 in 4 chance of getting pregnant within a year. I was diagnosed with LS after using NuvaRing for a few years. I am suspicious it could have had something to do with causing or awakening (?) my LS, but who knows. \n\nI am hoping to get off birth control (now Nexplanon) soon and am curious to see if the hormone changes help my LS. She is 18. She might have plans for 19 that do not include parenting. Also, she is not practicing any birth control with pull-out. Her partner is and she is hoping that her partner decides to practice birth control. Missed that part where she was 18. Def would not recommend pull-out to someone that young! I had pain and tearing with sex at 18 before I went on birth control. Was not diagnosed until 30, but I went on and off for kids, and the LS is rarely terrible, but it flares and recedes either way. In my forties now and I have been off BC for years, and I still have LS. Had been doing fine for so long and yesterday a big awful tear opened up in a terribly painful place and I am very pissed off and my favorite method of resolving insomnia is currently off the table. \n\nI do not think there was much relationship between BC and LS for me, over 25 years on and off it. I have gotten mixed messages about LS and OCPs. I have read that *anti-androgenic* OCPs are a substantial risk factor for LS, whereas the progestin-only pill (POP) actually lowers the risk for LS. \n\nI did ask my gyno and she said the POP I take is not an issue for LS. \n\nI am pretty fuzzy on which formulations are considered anti-androgenic, but ( says it is these progestins:     \n\nchlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, dienogest, and drospirenone \n\nAccording to the Google, yours (layolis fe) contains norethindrone as the progestin (same as mine.) So I think that one is fine?? But I am way out of my depth in this topic. \n\nAlso, all this is about the risk of getting LS in the first place; I am not sure how much it translates to the progression/management of existing LS. In the paper I linked, they had the patients go off of anti-androgenic OCPs when they were diagnosed, either by quitting OCPs or by switching to a non-anti-androgenic OCP, so I assume they thought it was relevant to progression. \n\nI think your plan to get a second opinion from a different obgyn and a derm is a good plan. \n\nIn case they do want you to go off combination pills, POPs might be a good option for you; I started taking POPs to reduce the frequency and intensity of my periods, and it has helped a ton, but everyone reacts differently to it. It is also less effective for pregnancy prevention than combination pills with *typical* use (although with *perfect* use, i.e. taking it on time every day, the effectiveness is as good as combination pills.) Every day I write down the time that I take it, and my partner and I also use condoms so it is not a big deal for me. But if it is your primary method of birth control and you might not be able to take it on time every single day, then it might not be a great option for contraception. It varies! Some people find it helps because it regulates their cycle or can even prevent a menstrual period, depending on how you use it, and those things help prevent flares for some. For me, it made my LS SO much worse. I wonder if I could tolerate it better now that I have my LS more controlled, but idk... it was pretty bad. I was constantly burning and the pain with sex was SEVERE, and then I stopped the pill and within 24 hours the burning and painful sex stopped. It came back several months later since I had not gotten my LS treated yet, but never to the severity that it was during birth control. \nIt is certainly not true that birth control does not play a role. I am sure some people with LS notice no difference when on the pill, but it is pretty well known that hormones play a role in LS, though they are not the thought to be the cause. You could try going off and see if you improve... I have a Paraguard (copper iud) and its non hormonal and works well for me. My doctor also said it is one of the best choices for LS since it is hormone free I am 21. Was diagnosed with LS at 5 years old. Personally I have way less flare ups since getting on the pill. But the pill gives me chronic yeast infections, and the yeast infections make me flare up if they get bad.\nI read through a bunch of your posts wanting to help you out with anything since you were helpful with my lube question haha.\nI have a lot of the same symptoms/struggles as you. Being well lubricated for P in V sex definitely helps. From my chronic yeast, I have a lot of burning during and after sex even if I am not having an active \u201cflare\u201d of my LS. What helps me greatly is taking probiotics. Even if you do not have a yeast problem, probiotics can help regulate your vagina flora. A shot of apple cider vinegar every day also helps to alkalinize your body and helps regulate vaginal pH from the inside out. Also, either do not use soap down there, or if you feel like you have to, only use something gentle with no fragrance like Cetaphil (I use it both to wash and shave). I also love vitamin E oil for my vulva. Helps with moisture and to heal and soothe tears and irritation. Best of luck to you!\nP.S. most gynos do not know enough about LS. Definitely see a dermatologist and have a biopsy done Thank you. We are going to use the FAM for birth control, along with non latex condoms. So we will be as safe as possible without putting hormones into me lol. What vitamin e oil do you use?\nAnd thank you! I had a biopsy done last week.", "Is this LS? Somebody please help me out! I have had an itchy labia for weeks now. My vulva does not itch. Neither does the vaginal canal. Discharge is odourless. I noticed alot of tiny flaky dead skin cells around the folds between the inner and outer labia. I have been using Clotrimazole 1.0% and Flucanazole alternately but they do not seem to be helping. The only remedy that somewhat suppresses the itch is Tea tree oil. But I do not want to keep using it since it dries out the area. I have also been experiencing some rectal itching. Did a rectal swab and it revealed an overgrowth of Staph and a gram negative bacteria. (But my doctor thinks this is normal?) Vaginal swab came back negative for yeast and BV. I guess my question is does LS cause flaky skin? Somewhat that looks like tiny eraser specks when wiped with tissue? Hi! I personally experienced a lot of \"eraser speck\" skin flaking and got diagnosed with LS (that is honestly the most perfect description and I am sad I did not think of it)- I would go see a specialist (I prefer derm, some prefer obgyn) to get a more precise diagnosis and have them write a prescription for it- the Clobetasol ointment has been doing wonders for me, no more eraser shreds! Yes, it can cause some flaking. At least, it did for me. Returning to your GP and asking for a referral to a specialist might be the next step for you. They put me on clobestasol too, and since then my LS has been much better. I am guessing a dermatologist will be the appropriate specialist right? My Gynaecologist brushed it off when I brought up LS. Thanks for the reply! It depends. Mine was actually a gynaecologist. But in your case, I would say a dermatologist would be your best bet, or perhaps another gynaecologist for a second opinion. Sorry to hear your current one brushed it off. That sounds incredibly frustrating! No problem about the reply. Hope you get it sorted soon. Thanks for responding! Looks like I need to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist ASAP. I am also guessing LS does not have any odor to it right? Basically just flaking and dryness? I guess that is what I will need to tell my doctor to distinguish yeast and the possibility of LS. It is frustrating:/ going to the doctor\u2019s office has been daunting to say the least because of this. I am going to find a new one. Glad you have managed to keep your LS at bay :) No, not that I am aware of. But my doctor did tell me that because LS leaves the skin in a pretty vulnerable condition (especially if its been scratched a lot), it is fairly common to see LS in conjunction with some other infection, like a yeast infection. Would you say the flaking looked like small specks of toilet paper? In remembering a time when I thought there was just some flakey TP floating around down there, but now 6 weeks of clob and I do not see it anymore. (Mind you at my office we have different TP, and during that time I was mostly working from home.) \u2014 I am still waiting on results, but this flakey skin comment has really opened my eyes! Dis you have white patches? Do you think that is where the flaking came from? Eraser specks... that is the perfect description for it! I do not have white patches. Been using Flucanazole diligently now and I noticed the specks went away. I think it was from all the dryness caused by applying tea tree oil. But im yet to confirm it with a dermatologist. It is been quite difficult to schedule for one right now :/ I hope the wait is not too much longer for you. Do you have to apply Clobe everyday? Is it a life long prescription? Thank you :) hope you get your answers soon too! That way we could all get the help we need. How long were you prescribed Clobe? I was told to use is for 12 weeks every day, then I should go down to 1-2 times a week. I feel like I only started to feel a bit of relief after week 6. But I am still very irritated and red. At first, yes, but then they try to wean you off (as it is a pretty strong steroid cream). Eventually you should be good with applying it once a week for the most part. But flare-ups and such can be handled by applying daily for however long as needed.\n\nUnfortunately, it is a life long condition with no \"cure,\" so a life-long prescription as well :( But one tube should last quite a long time! Have you managed to get any answers? My biopsy came back as likely eczema, so my Gp and obgyn believe it may be a hormone imbalance. I have gone off my pill and I am using estrogen cream. I know it could take months, but I am hoping this will be it for me. Painful urination has stopped already.\n\nI hope you are feeling better and have some answers! Hey thanks for the update:) I am glad you got your answer and you managed to find some relief ! I went to two Gynaes and they all think it is some type of yeast or dermatitis. Turns out most of the itching was contributed by the TP i was using. As for for the yeast, I started using tea tree oil diluted with coconut oil. Seems to be helping. No more specks.", "Labia minora shrinking Hello! About 4 years ago I (22F) was told by my doctor that he thinks I have LS due to white patchy, very dry and itchy skin. He did not say I for sure had LS because I was too scared to do a biopsy, he prescribed me clobetasol and I have been using it since then! My skin is fine, no more white patches, dryness or itchiness. However over the past 4 years I have been taking pictures to compare how my skin has changed and I noticed that my labia minora (right side) is shrinking!!!! Is this normal and is there anything I can do about it? It is normal, yes. Structural changes are just another symptom. Not sure what you can do tbh. Talk to your dr. before you lose any more. Thank you! My doc told me that the Mona Lisa laser treatment is an option for slowing down atrophy, you may want to ask about that. Good luck. Thank you! It could be what the other commenters have said but also, ask your dr about the clob possibly thinning your skin! I do not know your specific situation but I know the clob can thin the skin to the point it may look smaller. My dermatologist prescribed me tacrolimus to use along with the clob (instead of using the clob all the time) to prevent this! I went to see my dr and that is what she told me! Thank you", "HELP 22y F Tulip procedure???\n\nHey everyone!!! I have been diagnosed with LS for about 2 years now, and it has gotten to the point where sex is literally unbearable because the pain is so bad due to vaginal wall thinning as well as shrinkage. I have also started having Vaginal atrophy where my vulvar skin is literally disappearing. I am also having so many issues with my clitoris it has become a little bump that has become slightly hardened and my skin is beginning to cover it. I have tried pharmacological methods such as steroid cream as well as sooo many herbal remedies but nothing has worked. Because I am only 22 I decided I need to consider my options and stop the atrophy before it becomes nothing, due to the disease continuing to progress so fast. Therefore i am reaching out to see if anyone has tried any procedures and particularly the TULIP procedure how the procedure went and the results??? TAHNKS IN ADVANCE, IN NEED OF HELP!!!! \n\nHow long have you been on steroid ointment for? for a year and half ://// is it Clobetasol? Have you tried Tacrolimus? My dermatologist prescribed it to me.

There is now a nano curcumin option as well. I have not used curcumin in a long while but if you are taking tumeric for that purpose, do not. Take the active ingredient instead. \n\nI am on an immunosuppressant Humira which has controlled my LS but I would not recommend that rather nuclear option unless you have a primary autoimmune disorder. My doctor prescribed me clobrtasol propionate and symptoms decreased with a day or two.  Now I just use it sparingly. Why do not you recommend Humira? Because of side effects? \n\nHave you tried the other oral meds I listed?\n\nWhat do you mean by 'nuclear'? And do you mean 'primary immunodeficiency' when you say 'primary autoimmune'?\n\nThanks", " FAQ inquiry Hi everyone,\n\nI have been reading over some posts here and it looks like this sub would benefit greatly from having an FAQ list. So, I would like to ask if anyone with like to share any common questions, or things they wish they would known earlier in their diagnosis. I will be putting questions together on my own but every bit helps. Thanks! I think that is a good suggestion. There is a lot of information in the posts already made. But to edit and organize those would be a huge help Perhaps creams/medications/ointments successfully used to help reduce pain and/or itching? I have been using lidocaine 5% OTC ointment (topical anesthetic) and I so wish I knew about it earlier. Especially when every ER or family doctor I went to see before diagnosis always ordered urine tests.. not understanding how brutally painful it is. But I would like to know what other people have been using to manage the pain/itching (aside from clobetasol), just to have more options. Either prescription, OTC, or even natural/herbal remedies. hi! this is a great suggestion. I can tell you right now that besides clobetasol, I only know about aquaphor and using a wet compress to help ease the itching and/or pain. aquaphor is my best friend lol Good to know! Have not tried that one before Was recently told about Protopic ointment. The lidocaine topical is a much for post-sex for females I know for sure lol. Not sure if men get um, severe pain (paper cuts!) . Ffs LS... It is absolutely necessary to use barrier creams/ointments every day outside of the time you are using Clobetasol etc. Also, if you are female, get a urinary device if having issues. Also, find all the remedies like \u201ctucks\u2019 for post-birthing. Seriously, some great tips out there (freezing things, squeeze bottle cold water, etc. ) Would it be possible to make a list with recommendations for doctors? Divided into countries and cities? I do not know if it is to much effort. Aquaphor diaper rash cream? Can you prevent atrophy/shrinking? Can you prevent fusing? Or does that happen no matter what? Can I ask what you mean by urinary device? Are you talking like intermittent cathing? Sorry, I meant one of those \u201cstand up to pee\u201d devices. The p-style was the most helpful so that if you are really \u201csensitive\u201d you can sort of use it while sitting to prevent urine from touching other areas lol. Also sometimes the squeeze bottles for water are called peri bottles, or can look for postpartum bottles. Another thing to note is that TP can be quite rough even when you do not think it is. Again, use barrier ointments (vaseline, unscented is cheap and useful). Oh gotcha! Thank you so much. Also curious", "Has anyone had surgery yet? Any info you could share would be appreciated. I did not even know there was a surgery for this? I have and I have not. I had a frenuloplasty not for LS. However after the surgery it made a really bad patch over the scar.\n\nThis is pretty common so be careful any cuts or scars may form into a patch of LS.  It depends on how far it has progressed. Some womens urethra is narrowed by LS so surgery becomes necessary. Other approaches are somewhat (\n\n\nI was mainly wondering if someone has had surgery and less discomfort afterwards.", "Need opinions - should I find a new gyno? I had an appointment with a gynaecologist on the 18th of March and since then my patch of LS has doubled if not more in size on my perinium. No pain which is good but it feels drier and sex feels like there is more friction/is slightly uncomfortable at times when before this it has not been because clob helped my past flare up. I arranged a phone call appointment with her to discuss it because it has not grown at this speed before so naturally I was very concerned and it felt like she just brushed me off :/ I have also recently had a little bit of discharge that looks like what I get when I have a yeast infection so said about that too.\n\nShe told me to stop monitoring it so much as it is likely causing anxiety, but really I have just been observing the changes daily because it is been changing so rapidly recently. I do not want to be ignorant to what is going on with my body, particularly if it is not normal for me.\n\nAnd said that the discharge could just be overgrowth of yeast that might sort itself out and as long as there is no symptoms it should be fine but the last time I had discharge like this was May 2020 and it is itchy too :/ that sounds like no symptoms to me.. she said that I could take a swab at the clinic if I wanted to/if it gets worse so at least there is that but it will take up to two weeks to get the results back. So I may just do that tomorrow to get the results faster as I do not want it to develop into a bad yeast infection and have to wait ages for results so I can get treatment. \n\nTold me to stick to the steroid ointment daily for the next month which I have been since I noticed the growth (previously I would use it twice a week), and to use hydromol for washing which again I have been. I have not deviated from my routine in any way which is what caused me to want to figure out why this is happening and if there is a way to stop it getting worse.\n\nI enquired about switching to a copper IUD rather than birth control and she said that she could not imagine that birth control would affect LS :/ I have heard different on here\n\nSo yeah, what are your guys opinions on this advice? Have your doctors told you different things that have helped prevent spreading in the past or is this advice good? I cannot comment on the rest, but not monitoring daily does sound like good advice. I found that when I was constantly looking for changes, I had a hard time judging them and was constantly worried about it. It took about 3 months on the steroid to notice progress, so I would continue to use it as directed. After the first 3 months I had another physical exam and both she and I were very pleased with the improvements. Hang in there and try not to stress about it so much... which I understand is much easier said than done. To add to this, I have found that taking a weekly photo of the areas and storing them in a password-protected app helps me monitor things even better, because I can then compare changes and pull them up to show the doctor if needed. I told my fianc\u00e9 I do this and he asked me if I pretend I am Austin powers in that photography scene and now that is all I think about and laugh while I take photos \ud83d\ude02 Did you change part of your diet recently or start eating something new often? I can see why you are considering finding a new doc, being that dismissive is not a great sign. However, if your last appointment was the 18th of March, I can also understand why she is a little hesitant. I would keep up what you are doing for another 2 weeks or so, and if things are not improved then ask her for an appointment. If she refuses at that point, then it is probably time to look for a new doctor. \n\nIn regards to the possible yeast infection, do you ever use boric acid suppositories? I am very prone to yeast, especially since starting LS treatments that locally suppress the immune system. So my doc told me to use a boric suppository every 3rd night regularly, then every night for a week whenever I start to see symptoms. I havent, that is why I am confused abt it because I have not changed any part of my routine ;-; I would be concerned over the dismissing of the yeast infection, my doctor immediately puts me on something for it. The LS may take more time with the clob before improving. A second opinion/doctor is never a wrong thing when it is your health. When I have a yeast infection I also double down on live active yogurt. Hope all goes well. Get a second opinion. Your first dr does not need to know, and then you can compare their attitudes. I am surprised she did not mention a moisturizer? I cannot recommend one, but I have heard talk about that before.  Also, I do not think doubling white patch is ever good. Are you back to clobetasol daily? Also make sure to use plenty of lube during sex, those tiny tears are going to be where it spreads to! Thank you! I tried to get referred to a different gynaecologist who I feel more comfortable with/have seen before this one but she heard about it and called me to ask why and to basically trust her/ that it was inappropriate to ask for a reference to another gynaecologist until I have tried clob for a month. \n\nThey also sorted out a test for me to see about the yeast infection if it gets worse. Prior to this doctors ive seen about yeast infections have always made it a priority to treat it which partly made me want to seek a second opinion. \n\nI might get some live active yoghurt then and see if it helps. I am a retired nurse, the doctor was out of line, it is never inappropriate to get a second opinion, ever. I agree to give the clob a chance it took 3 weeks for mine to go away this flare. I would still ask for a referral on basis that her bedside manor lacks empathy. Personally I like a male gyn, because they do not inject their experiences into my care. Where I live you do not have to have a referral, also your regular GP can treat a yeast infection. Yeah it is understandable! Before this I would take pictures once ever week/two weeks just to see what is up/if any changes have occurred because it is easier for me to zoom in on a pic instead of shining a flashlight on it and squatting over a mirror, but because of how fast things have been changing recently I moved to checking daily to see how much it is spreading. \nWhen I had my first flare up which was way worse it did take a long while to get it under control, i think because the symptoms are different this time round I got concerned about that and did not consider it a flare. (Last time was pain/tearing/redness now it is more skin turning white/patchy and some itchiness so not as bad but had me like ?? What am I doing wrong here)\n\nThank you! I did actually get recommended to this health anxiety therapist but I have not heard back from them in a month so I might try and check up on them. Same here haha, I like to have a record of at least one pic per month just to be able to compare and see how things have changed over time but am like wow if anyone sees this hidden folder ive got a lot of explaining to do \ud83d\ude05 Yeah :( I got really stressed out when she asked why I tried to get referred to another gyno haha, I am not a very confrontational person. I am hoping that this incident will not cause her to have a bias against me especially with how she will be able to see if I try to access another gyno again. \nMy regular GP happens to be friends with her and I think that is how she found out about me asking for this referral so I am kind of hesitant to book appointments with this GP again. They also have a two week minimum wait time for appointments which is not too good :/\n\nThe first time I saw this gyno she was really nice/helpful so I am not too sure what is changed. The only male gyno I had also almost made me cry/leave the appointment midway but I think I may have a search around or try to find a different clinic if things keep going this way. Yeah I do understand her points, I think just because of how much it is changed in size recently I did get very worried. She did book me in for a physical appointment for two weeks time which I was surprised about but grateful for and I will keep applying clob daily until then. (Kind of scared to go to it now though in case things will be awkward)\n\nAnd I have heard of them! I had actually considered them for awhile before I had LS because I would get frequent yeast infections but they stopped so never got round to it. I may acquire about them at that appointment if this one does not go away/the symptoms keep returning like before. Unfortunately I tried to get a reference to speak to another gyno and she found out/said it was not the right thing to do and cancelled that until I try clob for the next few weeks. Which I do understand but I think because I have had bad experiences from being dismissed/not believed by doctors in the past that I always like to get a second opinion in situations like these. \n\nI have been using hydromol as a soap substitute/moisturiser for the last few months if that counts as one? I would use it daily then use clob twice a week but since this flare or whatever it is I have been using clob every day. I do happen to have a plant-based moisturiser that doubles as a lube so at least those bases are covered haha. It is absolutely understandable to be concerned. I was for months until I really noticed the steroid cream was helping and the spots were not growing/showing up in new places. But unfortunately it did take time. I would also suggest following up with the referral. I work in the field and lots of mental health providers are swamped right now, so it cannot hurt to follow up and make sure your info was not overlooked. Best of luck to you, hope it gets better. Yeah, especially since I would never heard of LS until experiencing it and had never experienced a condition with such little research/no cure before so that definitely did not help with the panic. \nSame here, I think that is why I am panicking again because it seemed to be working so well so I was happy about it but out of nowhere it seems to have taken a turn downhill again when I have been doing everything doctors have told me to.\n\nYeah I figured that they are probably very busy (and probably were before the pandemic let alone now) so I will try and ring them tomorrow to enquire about it \n\nThank you so much!", "Alright, here is what is going on I am a male. Around the age of 14-15 I got LS. Not diagnosed but the symptoms match up to what I have been dealing with. I never went to the doctor, told my parents ect. Now I am 18, and have been trying to fix it, I started with a clotrimizole cream. And it is been doing good. No cracking, no itching, no bleeding. For reference I do not have any symptoms on my shaft, just on the sides of my balls, one side worse then the other. Anyways, the cream has actually backed he rash off a large amount on one side, patches included. whereas the other is still looking rough. I do plan on going to see my doctor in 3 weeks (for a depression check up oddly enough) so I plan on getting this thing figured out. If it is LS, well there is nothing I can do except pray that the first chick to touch my cock does not get scared. Any words of encouragement or advice is welcome, this subs a strong one! Hold your head up! If you are seriously concerned, get a skin biopsy done to be diagnosed. I use corticosteroid cream and do not have any white spots as a result. Perhaps you need a proper diagnosis to get a better prescription? Also, if it really concerns you about how your sexual partners will react to tour skin condition, practice disclosure! Something along the lines, \u201cI have a skin condition, it is no risk to you, but it might look weird at first.\u201d You can probably come up with something better :-P I wish you the best! I cannot speak to male LS but I can share my experience with a loving supportive partner. If you have a solid connection with someone and explain ahead of sexual activity what is going on with you then the right person will not care. They will support you and love you with your LS, unconditionally. Something that will help in the interim is to love yourself as you are. Hopefully your counseling with your doctor about your depression will help you along in that department. It does get better friend. There will be ups and downs (such as life) but hang in there. Hey,\n\nFirst of all i think is a good idea to go see a doctor because it could be it but it could also be other things. Try not to worries about it too much before you are diagnosticated properly and even if you have LS it is not the end of the world. Yes you would be different if the skin stay the same (sometime with clobetasol the white patch go aways but I would not count on it).  Many people on this sub is the proof that you could have a good life even with LS. The keys is to talk with your sexual partner and explain her that she have no risk at all most of them would understand. Last point do not forget that treatment is not something that is stuck in the time so maybe in 1, 5 or 10 years someone would find something to help us. \n\nI really wish you the best and that you could find answers to your problems.", "Intense itching after clit orgasm Hi. I have LS, and sometimes after I have gotten an clitoris orgasm, I experience intense itching and sometimes it feels like I really have to pee. Sometimes clobetasol helps against the itching, but not always. The itching ruins al the day... \n\nAnoyone else who experiences this? \ud83d\ude25 I am on a steroid cream that usually helps with that. Lubricant helps a bit just to keep it moisturized.", "F35 newly diagnosed Dr advice and sex advice I am in California but willing to travel to see someone who can help me treat this.  I frequently have lip sores, my mouth is raw,  and having sex is painful even with the most lube, I am torn up bleeding afterwards.  I have jaw issues that make oral sex out of the question and im just struggling with the lack of sex options.  Because sex tears me up its difficult for my husband to be 100% in it even when I initiate it. Because he knows how it has lasting effects for a few days.  Looking for help moisturizing it hurts to wipe and pee most days. When I am on my period it is horrible and my period normally brings diaherra too so its just so painful.

Thank you", "My Lichens Sclerosus looks like this  sorry to pry, was looking at your post history. so it ended up being 100% lichen and not any type of FGM? i was reading the comments and saw that everyone was like yep, fgm I have an official diagnosis after a biopsy do you have a good doctor that specializes in this? yes that is great, they are hard to come by. have they said that your fusing is permeant? They told me that the damage that is done is irreversible. But the treatment will help with the prevention of further progression and using", "LS Diagnosis (Had it for years most likely) Hi, \n\nI am 24 and I have LS. I noticed white patches when I was 20, and they most likely formed years before that. I have a really aggressive form with major texture changes, white patches, and labial adhesion. I was never biopsied. I already started treatment which really ruined my chances of getting a good biopsy. But my concern is if I have LS or dVIN. I am literally so young, and I know that they say cancer takes a long time to form, but if I am young and I have it, then would not it be possible that it could have progressed early? \n\nThis is such an annoying and long rant. I am in the process of dealing with this diagnosis and it is stressing me out. (I am sorry lol) Anyone else get diagnosed super young? Hi there. I am also 24 and got diagnosed recently however I have this probably for a long time too. Have no idea what to do. I found this podcast episode that I have been recommending because it gave some really helpful tips. I was honestly just worried about the potential cancer risks (I am a hypochondriac). dVIN, what i mentioned, is the pre-cancer. But apparently it is only something that happens when you are not treated for YEARS. But anyway, this podcast features a Dr. who specializes in LS. Very helpful. ( Wow thank you so much def. will listen it! I feel like I am stuck with this new life. I always have to check and do certain things to prevent inevitable end. But that should not be the case and I am also aware of it. The initial diagnosis is daunting. I feel this right now. But from what I have read, we just have to put in the work to feel \"normal.\" I am not sure how progressive your LS is and you do not need to be specific because I know that is a personal question. But regardless of how progressive it is, we are in our 20s, and this early detection is crucial for preventing cancers, progression, more fusion, and flares. It is a blessing for sure to have this awareness! \n\nThough, I am anxious and panicky, I feel like the more I have read responses on this thread within the past hour, I feel happy I am not alone. We can all offer tips! Yess this is exactly what I feel in this subreddit\ud83d\udc95 actually mine is not very progressive, I also did not go under biospy for diagnosis. However my symptomst are not very visible. I face with itchy feeling and tearing during sex sometimes. And paper cut like pain around clit and tears occuring under vaginal entrance. That Is all nothing more. But I feel like it is very hard to maintanence a normal sex life which I dont believe existst. However still at the same time I find myself with this stupid toughts \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f how about you? Diagnosed at 20 but suspected it since I was 19! You are not alone Got diagnosed a week ago (23) and I am still dealing with it emotionally and mentally. I had finally just started to enjoy sex for the first time ever after many bad experiences, with my partner, and then the universe gives me this haha What were your symptoms What are your symptoms Inflamed clitoris, purple bruises, tears, white patches around vulva, general pain, you? I do not know what I have yet. I had a lot of pain during sex and cuts that caused my worry which was solved by getting off birth control. But now I feel my vagina is dry and less plump than before and itchy sometimes so I am worried I have lichen. Doctors say no but they do not biopsy and it is hard to get appointments Whole area around my vulva was red and itchy, pain and paper-cut like tears that would form due to wiping after using the toilet, sex etc, sex felt like being cut with glass down there, cuts would open when wiping so blood would be on toilet paper, eventually some of the skin turned white/patchy Talk to your Dr about Thymosin Alpha. I had LS and also had hormone issues so went through an online Hormone Clinic. They suggested Thymosin Alpha to reset my Immune System. That was back in March I think and it has totally taken away my LS. \nIf you look at my other comments in this thread it will give you an idea of when I took it. I was diagnosed at 27, but I started having intermittent vulval symptoms at age 3 so I think I have had it since birth. Neither clobetasol nor tacrolimus has done anything for me, and I have been in constant flare for 1.5 years. I do not think this is very common though, most people seem to respond well to treatment. Can you elaborate on biopsy not being possible after treatment? My doctor did not tell me that. Do you have it under control now??? According to ( even with the biopsy, VIN can be hard to distinguish from LS. But I do not think your starting treatment would make it harder to detect VIN on biopsy; my expectation is that VIN would still be obvious or maybe inconclusive from biopsy, while LS might not show up if your treatment is working (but it still might). But I am not a doctor let alone a pathologist. \n\nI think LS and VIN can be somewhat distinguished from the external appearance, too, depending on the case. So if your doctor took a good look and did not think it could be VIN, it is probably fine. If you are still worried you could get a second opinion on whether it looks like VIN and whether you need a biopsy, maybe from a specialist in gyn oncology. \n\nI have a relative who had biopsy after biopsy over the years, because they thought she had LS but it always looked a bit funny, so they were worried about VIN I guess, and every biopsy was \"inconclusive.\" Now she has been diagnosed with Zoon's Vulvitis instead of LS, which explains a lot. So even biopsies do not always give clarity. I think if the treatment successfully calms down the LS, it can be harder to detect LS on a biopsy, because the biopsy will look more normal. It could get better! The same podcast that I sent you also has an episode on maintaining a healthy sex life for you and your partner! Mine is progressive unfortunately, so i have discoloration and fusion. Thankfully no really bad flares at the moment! This calmed me a bit, thank you! I have an appointment this week to get a biopsy done regardless just so I could have a peace of mind. And also something on my record. What is Zoon's vulvitis? I am glad :) \n\nZoon's vulvitis is an extremely rare condition that is somewhat similar to LS, but it often involves ulcers, and in the biopsy they see lots of plasma cells, which is why it is also called plasma cell vulvitis. I think there are only a few dozen cases recorded worldwide. \n\nI hope the biopsy gives you some peace of mind. It may also be useful in the future if it does show proof of LS, for enrolling in clinical trials or convincing doctors who think you are \"too young\" to have LS. Treatment does not ruin your biopsy result. I had a biopsy done and they told me this. For anyone else this might help.", "Did I do this to myself? So my entire life I have been a sickly person with a terrible immune system. If something is going around I am catching it, and it is even worse now that I have school-age kids. I decided it is not happening this year and went pretty hard on immunity supplements: lots of brewers yeast/epicor, elderberry, immunity probiotics, etc and would not you know, I have not been sick all winter.\n\nThen along comes LS, and in googling I see it can be caused by an overactive immune system. I am wondering if I caused this with all my supplements; has anyone else had a similar experience? Just diagnosed tentatively last week, symptoms on and off since November, been on Clobetasol 2x/day for 4 days and still miserable. This sucks. I am not a doctor, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  But I highly doubt this is your fault. Autoimmune diseases are complicated and maybe there are things you can do to try to help but sometimes they just happen - at least that is my understanding of them. \n\nHave you asked your doctor about it? I am not sure it is worth it to reduce your overall health by not doing those things to try to ward off the LS. Since there is a chance it was not something you did that caused it. \n\nIn any case that really sucks!  You took control of your health just to get a new issue, and that is very frustrating. I hope your doctor is able to help and provide good advice!", "Query I am M(20) , why should i consult with a doc for my potential LS if he is going to recommend Clobetesol which is a steroid cream , as steroid creams are not to be used for long term. Tbh i am not sure even if the doctors in india where I reside even have any adequate knowledge about it. I do not want to get caught up in a bigger mess because of lack of knowledge/ information, nothing else. Steroids can be used long term, just not every day. Usually for LS they are prescribed to be used twice per day for a few months, then around 1-2x per week for the long term future. Most people do not get bad side effects from that, and genital skin is apparently the toughest when it comes to steroids. You could also try tacrolimus instead; it is an immunosuppressant but it does not have the skin thinning risk of steroids. Even if it cant be completely cured it can be managed. I am about 4 months in now and apply the Clob ointment a few times a week (barrier cream on all other days). It is completely manageable and no longer a concern to me. Think of it like brushing your teeth, you just do it regularly and it prevents a larger problem.", "Little to no labia minora? I have little of my labia minora. It has always been that way, probably since I was 12/13 I can remember, but it seems to have flattened out more. My outer labia lips are normal, just my inner labia seems so flattened and almost non-existent. The top, towards my clitoris, is all still there but is followed with white cluster type of bumps on the side that I had just excused for smegma until I realized it did not peel/wash off/go away.\n\nMy other symptoms: occasional itching, pain (towards the end of) sex, after sex pain, feeling like lemon juice got sprayed into papercuts on my vaginal opening and near my labia minora.\n\nI went to my gynecologist, and my local (well, an hour away,) Planned Parenthood and nothing was really said. Cells look healthy, hymen is gone, no stds/stis or signs of yeast. Could they not have noticed my labia minora? Am I driving myself insane? \n\nCan sex be causing my labia minora to flatten? Could it be Lichen Sclerosus? \n\nI can include photographs if need be. If you have pain and itching, there is something going on. If your gyn does not see anything, I would try a vulvar specialist or a dermatologist with LS experience. It might or might not be LS, but pain with sex, feeling you have acid in a papercut, etc. is not normal. \n\nI do not believe sex can cause the labia to flatten. I think my inner labia are barely there, but I am not sure if they were always that way or not. Your doctors may not have noticed or said anything about it because there is a ton of variation in what is normal for labia to look like. In my experience, doctors are a little too quick to say \"yes it is normal\" when looking at the vulva, because they want to reassure us and they have been trained that vulvas have a huge variation in healthy appearance. It is true, but there are still some things that are not normal, like white patches. And pain is never normal.   \n\nSorry you had to travel an hour just to see planned parenthood. I hope you can find someone in driving distance that has experience with vulvar skin conditions or vulvar pain conditions. Even if you do not have LS, if you see someone that knows a lot about diagnosing LS, they will also know about the conditions that can look like LS. Thank you so much. I live in a pretty small town until I move in the summer so I do not have too many options specialist wise, but I will keep looking 110% for sure.\n\nWould you recommend seeing the (same) gynecologist again? Dermatologist? Something else? Hi - I was diagnosed last Friday and my inner labia are gone and will never return...\nI have seen three gynecologist with different specializations and none of them recognized the condition.\nA LS specialized dermatologist has heard similar stories.\nSo I second the recommendation to look for a dermatologist rather then a gynecologist.\nThumbs crossed that you find help! Tell your gynecologist that you are concerned about LS and ask for a referral. They may tell you a dermatologist or a different gynecologist, I ended up with a pelvic pain specialist. If they do not want to refer you that is a big red flag and you should try to find a new gyno. Best of luck! I would not see the same person again if she was not helpful, unless she is someone you can see easily, sooner than anyone else, but I would still try to see a specialist as well. \n\nSome people say a dermatologist has a better chance than a gyn, since LS is a skin condition that just happens to occur on the vulva (and other places too), but I got unlucky with a dermatologist who knew very little and was uncomfortable looking at my vulva so she barely glanced at it. She referred me to a pain clinic far away, but I found someone closer who specializes in LS by googling \"Lichen Sclerosus {my area}\".  I have not seen him yet, but he is a pediatric dermatologist who also sees adults, and he has an area of his website dedicated to LS, and all his publications are about vulvar skin conditions. So I am hopeful that he will be knowledgeable. I hope you can find someone who can help you!

Hey everyone,\n\nSo, I am hoping for some advice on my current situation. It all started in June last year when I had what I thought was thrush. I would been on antibiotics for acne, and began having intense itching, and although I did not have any discharge, I spoke to my local pharmacist and she was confident that it was thrush based on my antibiotic use, so gave me a canesten pessary  and a 2% Clotrimazole cream for external use. This helped a lot, and I assumed that the treatment had worked.\n\nHowever, over the last few months the itching has returned. After some research, I am now questioning if I have lichen sclerosus. I have the intense itching (both vaginal and anal, as the itch seems to have spread), and I also have a very defined white patch, which forms a figure of 8 around my anus and vagina, although at this point the white patch seems to have only just spread to the vagina and is more dominant around the anus, which also has small papercut like splits in the skin. I also have hypothyroidism, which I know can be linked to autoimmune conditions such as LS.\n\nSo, I rang my doctors, who are currently operating a phone call only service due to the covid situation in the UK. They gave me a phone consultation with my GP, and I explained the situation. Her opinion is that I am too young for LS as I am only 27, and it is more likely to be thrush that has not cleared up. I explained that the white patches seem to match exactly with the descriptions of LS, and she said that it is likely to be thrush causing the white patches, which is something I have never heard of thrush causing. I was very forceful in requesting that she see me for a physical exam and ideally a biopsy, but she said there is absolutely no need to see me, there is no doubt in her mind that it is thrush, especially as the 2% Clotrimazole cream eased the itching, which she said would not have happened if it was LS (it soothes the area when applied, but does not stop it returning if that makes sense).\n\nNow, my GP is normally fantastic for me, as she initially worked as a dermatologist for several years before switching to being a GP. As such, I assumed she would be really helpful with this issue, as I know a lot of people get referred to derms. And she did say herself that she is experienced in treating people with LS. But she is just so certain that this is not what I have got, and as such is refusing to see me, saying instead that she will prescribe me an oral medication, fluconazole, which she said should clear everything up. Now, I get that she is the expert, and I am happy to try this, but she basically said that even if it does not help, the most she will do is give me a repeat prescription for the 2% Clotrimazole cream, and she will not see me in person as there is no need. I requested a callback from another GP, and they said that as my original doctor is the dermatology expert they would follow her lead and only treat me as someone with ongoing thrush, and they would not be willing to examine me in person.\n\nMy concern is that if I am right and it is LS, the longer it goes untreated, the harder it will be to get under control. The widespread nature of the white patches and the intensity of the itching lead me to think that it is already quite severe. So my options now are either save up to go private, which is going to take a long time in terms of both finances and the covid situation, or treat myself through getting a prescription online for either dermovate or betnovate. I would do this through a registered pharmacist, it would not be from anywhere dodgy.\n\nEssentially, I am asking for advice. Does anyone know if the white patches I am describing could be due to thrush? Obviously I would follow the treatment prescribed by my GP first to see if I could be mistaken in thinking it is LS. But if the treatment fails and she still refuses to see me, would it be possible to self-treat with dermovate or betnovate? Has anyone else done this?\n\nThank you in advance, and sorry for the long post! Is it very dry where thr white is?\n\nI am sure by now you have looked online to see images of LS. So I assume you know what it looks like, so my advice would be to consult with another Dr re this. Or call your Dr and say that she either sees you, or you will be consulting with another Dr. Can you request a yearly physical so she has to see you. Or book an app regarding another matter and then demand she look at the area. It is so bizzare that she will not take a look and quite unprofessional. Children have been diagnosed with it. It is an auto immune disease it is not really an age thing. I guess it is less likely but children do get it.\n\nYou are absolutely correct in thinking that the longer you leave this the worse it will get so time is of the essence here. \nI hope you can get it looked at asap. I am sorry you are going through this! My GP and gynae thought the exact same.  My GP told me it was thrush for over a year before they finally referred me, and my gynae even had my biopsy re-tested because he was so sure it was not LS because of my age (21f). \n\nIs there anyway you can see another GP? If you are in the UK, could register at another surgery as an emergency patient? I really hope you find the answers you are looking for! I am guessing maybe you may have had yeast and LS both. I think yeast causes white stuff that wipes off, not pale regions of the skin itself. If you have the figure 8, then that is pretty specific to LS. But, LS does not cause problems inside the vagina itself. If you are itchy in there, that could be yeast (or BV etc) on top of the LS or another condition like lichen planus (LP). If your GP is not doing in-person visits, could you maybe send her some photos? I do not know about the self-treatment plan. Will they really give you dermovate (clobetasol) without an exam? The thing is, steroids can cause some serious side effects (although they can usually be avoided with a careful treatment regimen). With LS, it is also important to have regular exams to screen for cancer, since our vulvar skin cancer risk is a teeny bit higher. You certainly can have LS at 27, although it is supposed to be an uncommon age of onset (usually it is in children or post-menopause). I am 28 and I suspect I have had it all my life. If you have the full figure 8, you may have had it for a while. I have a pet theory that because LS is misdiagnosed so much, with many people taking years to get diagnosed, older women are just more likely to have accumulated an LS diagnosis. But I am not a doctor and it is just a hunch. I would consider taking the yeast medication, especially if you have itching inside your vagina, but try to get an appointment with someone else, and/or maybe send photos if you are allowed and they are only doing telemedicine. Over-the-phone diagnosis has been proven to be not very accurate for vulvovaginal conditions. Even if it is an infection it might be BV, trich, etc. These things really require tests like whiff test, pH test, wet prep, and sometimes culture to get right. And that is when you do not have a skin disease. I would just go see another doctor- go to an unrelated derm and get a separate opinion. I had to do it three times before I was correctly diagnosed! Definitely see another doctor, preferably a dermatology or gynecologist. The figure 8 pattern is very specific to LS, and if she is dismissing you because of your age, she is not very knowledgeable. Incidence of LS does peak in menopausal women, but people of any age can get it. Yeast can cause itching and it can cause somewhat of a white appearance of the skin, but that skin will be dry and flaky and usually is not going to appear in a figure 8. It is usually more of a red rash. And if yeast treatment does not work, more often than not, IT IS NOT YEAST. I have found most doctors are severely lacking in knowledge of women\u2019s health and treat every \u201cdown there\u201d itch as a yeast infection, over and over again even when it is clearly not. Unless you get frequent yeast infections that respond to treatment and you know your symptoms well, the doctor needs to examine you before prescribing anything. At the VERY least a doctor needs to be taking a swab for yeast, BV, and trich, and examining the appearance of the vulva. So yeah, definitely seek a second opinion! I am so sorry you are dealing with this! I got diagnosed with LS at 22 after having the same symptoms as you for about a year. That does not mean you have LS for sure but you are absolutely right to want an examination of it!", "LS on anus? Hello!\n\nI was diagnosed with LS on my vulva, but I am wondering people's experience with it on their anus? I have had anal itching + fissures for a year now but i always just assumed the irritation was from the fissures and/or mild hemorrhoids. But now I am wondering if it is LS! I do not have visible white patches, but it is itchy/irritated almost all the time. Gastro doc had me use analpram with hydrocortisone which sort of helps but not much. Anyone use clobestal there? Yes, I use clob there. This is where most of my LS is located and actually what prompted the biopsy and diagnosis. Clob + diet is the best treatment to avoid the vicious cycle of fissures. Although it is important to talk to your doc about the treatment regimen so you do not have extreme thinning of the area or topical steroid withdrawal. Yeah. Just ... yeah. :-( Oh yeah. Big time. Thank you! Yeah I do, I think it is worse for me there. I think it is pretty common but I am not completely sure. I have experienced anal itching, some discoloration (a white/purple color), and a couple fissures in the past two years. I do use clob there. I always thought it was due to minor hemorrhoids too. Curious - mine is in a similar location, do you ever have rectal bleeding after BMs? Blah. Also noticing now I have like yellow pus on it? Is that an LS thing? I am sorry I am not completely sure to be honest. I am super new to LS and learning as I go! Maybe the yellow pus is from a fissure healing?", "Have any of you tried comfrey? Just diagnosed- devastated. The \u201citch\u201d is only a burn and really in a lot of pain. I started the steroid cream but just wondering if anyone has had any luck with any herbs? I try to eat healthy, and take the natural approach when I can. Thanks in advance. steroid sounds scary but in a controlled way it will help; CO@ laser and vaginal estrogen helps as well if needed but herbal remedies can be great for symptom control but do not suppress the disease process or stimulate cellular growth.\n\nI specialize in Lichen Sclerosus so am happy to help any way I can  -- soooo frustrating a diagnosis because so many women get misdiagnosed for years. Also make sure your doctor addresses how to reduce the itch!\n\nHope this was helpful!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaria Sophocles, MD Wow! Well thanks for the response. My doc said I am not a usual presentation- mine is more of a deep burn. She prescribed me a numbing gel- however they did not have it. So I am still suffering and really mind blown. I never had pain during sex- and all the symptoms came on hard and fast and out of no where. I had complete color change in one week. So any advice welcome. Thank you.", "Feeling hopeless. I have been to my GP, a urologist, and two derms and no one has diagnosed me with anything. It all started when I was 17 or so. I am 23 now. I had some skin peeling on my glans and I peeled it off. That was an awful idea because now that part of the glans looks under developed and there is structural loss off my glans. After awhile it turned into a thick white skin lesion. Slowly it just continued to spread and spread. Mind you I am circumcised. I never really did anything about it until now cause I was so embarrassed and did not want to tell my parents. Eventually white skin was on the opposite side of my un scared glans as well. I have tried a bunch of different creams and one even made my skin peel awfully as well and now I have even more structural loss! I do not have much if any pain or itching (use to have a lot of itching) but it just looks so darn awful. I have never had a sex life and I fear it. I tried posting a pic but it was not allowing me. Even if I can get the skin back to normal I still have what looks like mutated glans. Thank god it is just one side of my glans. I have awful anxiety and depression because of this. I am a clean person and do not understand why me. I have had a skin sample taken that concluded nothing. Would that tell if you had LS or not? Do not know where to go from here, I was recommended a dr like 2 hours away but am skeptical last time I was sent to a derm they messed my junk up even more. All my friends and family wonder why i dont hav e a girlfriend. It is like being tortured alive not being in a relationship because of something so stupid. I am in my prime and my sex life is not existent. I would give all the money I own just to have normal junk. Not to mention I am not happy with my size. Man, im so sorry to hear what youre going through.  If you have LS then a biopsy would usually be able to give a pretty definitive positive diagnosis.  You should ask your doctor if they can send your tissue sample out for a second opinion at another pathology department somewhere else since their initial results were inconclusive.  Just try to have them send it to whatever the best hospital is in your area, like a hospital at a good university or something. \n\nIn many cases when they take a biopsy they will remove enough tissue for more than one test, and they will preserve the extra tissue and save it so that it can be analyzed again later if desired..  So, hopefully they will be able to get it analysed again without cutting you up again.  \n\nSometimes people have unusual presentations of a disease that are more difficult to diagnose.  Or in other cases medical professionals just make mistakes or plain fluckin suck at their job. \n\nDont give up dude.   Plenty of people with LS are able to controll their symptoms with treatment and can have fairly normal sex lives.  You just need to keep trying to get your situation taken care of.  LS can develop into genital cancer if its not treated properly, so dont procrastinate on getting it treated. I know you said you have tried some creams already (you didnt mention which or how long you tried them..?), but you should keep trying untill something works.   There are always other options.  \n\nAnd as far as appearances go, a good partner will care more about what is on the inside than the outside.  Feel free to reach out if you need anything.  Try and stay positive! Thank you very much. Yeah some days it is just so hard to stay positive, it is be one thing for this to happen at 40 but 17? It is shitty. But I have tried tacrolinus for a month, pimecrolimus for a month, ala Quinn and duobrii for a short period due to peeling and clobetasol for more than a few months. I think clobetasol helped in less stubborn areas. Its hard to tell what really helped when they keep having you try different things. I am so sorry what you are going through. I also have LS (but I am a female) and I can sympathize with some of the emotions you are going through. Are you currently on any treatment? That would be step one.\n\nAnother thing I will say, is that, as a woman, even before I had LS. If my partner had this condition I would not bat an eye. You will be able to find someone who is supportive of your condition. I would recommend that you try and find a professional to speak to about this because they can help you manage your emotions so you can be happy again. Having this condition is A LOT mentally and physically. I know, I have been through it. I wish you the best. Really would not care about the color of the skin, I have a lot of structural loss on my glans and it looks like a piece of skin was just sliced off. Idk what to do I have seen derms And none of them helped. One actually made it worse. Just really depressed about it. Do not know what you got till it is gone. :(", "Lichen Sclerosus recent diagnosis I recently noticed a white lump on the tip of my penis with some redness around it (no pain or anything, but I have a very tight foreskin which takes a bit of unravelling after sex) and went to the sexual health clinic with tests for HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis coming back negative, a skin doctor looked at it and diagnosed it as lichen sclerosus.\n\nI am a male in my late 20's and never experienced this sort of thing before and the steroid cream prescribed has not seemed to do anything after a couple of months. I am really nervous it could be something like penile cancer but as I am also on antidepressants I appreciate it could just be health anxiety.  \n\nDoes anyone here have experience with how long treatment with steroid cream tends to take before lichen sclerosus dies down?", "Contraception Hey People!\nMy boyfriend and I want to use a contraception other than condoms as they dont work very well for both of us. \nNow I am looking for the right alternative and since I have LS I am afraid of worsening it, so I hope you guys have some advice for me.\nMy LS started when I stopped taking the pill, I guess due to the hormonal changes. Also it reduced my libido and I didnt feel very comfortable with it, so I do not want to take it again. \nAlso I am not too keen on the cupper spiral as it works because it inflames the tissue. I know that LS is not inside the vagina but still I dont need another inflammation in that area at all. \nI gravitate towards the IUD (Hormon spiral).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any good or bad experiences? I have had the mirena iud for a few years now and it works very well. Though I was diagnosed with lichens much after I got it. \"Natural family planning\" has worked well for me for years. I track my cycle and use condoms during my fertile window. Other than that just pull out method. It took me some time to adjust to the idea and I did have some anxiety but like I have said I have done this for years now. I am 25F. The science is there though, yiu legit have dry days were you just cannot get pregnant.", "How long does it usually take to see changes with Betamethasone? I have been using the cream for about 2 days and nothing has happened yet, negative or positive, my prescription is about 4-6 weeks of twice a day usage Hi Dragon, can I ask was the Betamethasone prescribed by your GP or a dermatologist?  It is just that LS in men is normally treated with a stronger, ultra potent steroids in the first case, Clobetasol being the most common.  Steroids such as betamethasone and clobetasone are generally used as part of a maintenance programme or to give the skin a break from the ultra potent steroid treatment. \n\nThe betamethasone will do you no harm and will help somewhat but it offers a reduced likelihood of success. In men using Clobetasol, you would normally see some changes within the first week. \n\nGiven your age, it is possible the doctor is starting you on a weaker steroid to determine effect and save you having to use the ultra potent types.  If, however, you do not see improvement whilst on your current medication, you should push to ensure that you see a dermatologist rather than, and particularly in the US, a urologist and explore using ultra potent steroids. \n\nMy comment in relation to dermatologist rather than urologist is that LS is a skin disease and there is a tendency in the US, given higher social acceptance, of urologist pushing circumcision as the only treatment, whereas in Europe it would typically only be considered as a last resort.\n\n Treatment of men with ultra potent steroids is not always successful but, in conjunction with the use of emollients rather than soap on the genitals and ensuring that urine is not trapped within the foreskin - so if needs be washing and drying after urinating - they offer a c.60% chance of putting LS into full remission. \n\nI wish you all the best. Hi there,\n\nThis was prescribed to me by my urologist on the children\u2019s side of the hospital since I am a minor, so that might explain why I was prescribed a less potent cream. My urologist also did say that if this cream does not work she would recommend circumcision but I did have an option to go to a dermatologist before making such a big decision.\n\nAlso I feel it is important to say that my condition is fairly mild, and she was actually surprised by it since she normally sees very bad cases from kids where it is all over and circumcision is basically the only option due to how painful it is, compared to me where I have zero pain or uncomfortable feelings and the area it is on is nor nearly as big as typical patients Really pleased to hear that your cases is mild and your doctor\u2019s approach makes complete sense as you describe matters. So just remember there is the option to step up a gear if needs be and that you best chance of a full medical resolution, without surgical intervention, is when the symptoms are mild at an early stage of the disease. All the best", "Peeling advice Hello, I am awaiting a gyno appointment (waited over 4 months already, cannot even make an appointment for another few months \u2639\ufe0f NHS is pretty strained rn). GPs have said it is LS or eczema, I do not have and have never had eczema anywhere else on my body before so it seems unlikely to be the latter. The first GP is sure its LS that is presenting unusually. \n\nIve always had skin peeling, soreness etc but lately had months of agony and bleeding and scaring from the skin ripping and peeling away constantly. I have had two tubes of steroid ointment and seen some improvement, no open sores rn, but the skin continues to peel heavily every day. I am using diprobase ointment since I have no more steroid ointment and it immediately gets worse if left bare. Can anything be done to stop the skin peeling?\n\nHow do you guys deal with this issue? Have any treatments worked for you? Greatly appreciate any advice If it is peeling bc your skin is so dry and cracked, maybe try CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser. Yes it is safe to use on your lady parts. (There is two facial cleansers, one is foaming which contains alcohol and that is the wrong one. You want the hydrating cleanser that looks milky). My derm told me to use it daily when my LS was really bad. It helped so much with keeping my skin hydrated and from cracking and bleeding. I use it daily and do not have any more issues with cracking, dryness, etc. I never peeled but I am assuming the peeling could be from the dry skin? It is not dry, it is like wet tissue paper \ud83d\ude1f. I have been told to 'air it out' but not too much since they said if it drys to much it will crack too. Thankyou for the response tho, I am still learning about the condition Have you tried keeping it moisturized with oils? Dang, that sounds awful. I am sorry :( I do not think I have heard of anyone having that issue before. Do you air out at night at least? I normally wear an oversized tee at night to air out since I feel weird during the day doing it. I have never heard of it this way. So sorry you are having to go through this.  Personally I air it out as much as possible, i cannot see how that would dry it out too much. It is not just about airing it out but it is also about not having material up against it. I have problems if I have to have underwear on for long periods of time. I hope you find some relief soon. The Honey Pot Company's vulvar cream has been fantastic for moisturizing, esp if you are afraid it will get too dry while \"airing it out.\"\n\nPersonally, I think an derm is better than a GP, since this is more of their area of expertise and it just happens to be in a reproductive area. Probs worth a shot, since they are usually independent clinics not with the NHS and should have some openings sooner :) i have been diagnosed with LS and have similar issues. like someone else said, using a gentle hydrating wash can help slough the dead skin off and keep things hydrated. for me, the build up of dead skin (smegma :/) is irritating and can get painful so making sure to wash regularly is important. i use cetaphil gentle skin cleanser to gently wash and a detachable shower head to rinse everything away, then pat dry with a cotton towel. if things are feeling uncomfortable and i am not due to use clobetasol i will use a little bit of vaseline to keep things in tact. so sorry you are going through this, i hope this helps!", "Goodbye sex life Been diagnosed with LS for a few years, no ideal solutions other than steroid creams. It obviously makes sex uncomfortable and despite alternate lubes, I am still scared to have sex with my fianc\u00e9 because I never know at what point it is going to turn from pleasurable to painful. Have not had sex in a while and between my depression and the LS (and probably some birth control side effects thrown in for good measure), I do not want to have sex. I knew my fianc\u00e9 was not happy about it but yesterday he told me he felt so unsatisfied, and it broke my heart. He does not want to guilt me, but how can I let him enter into a marriage when intimacy is not a guarantee? I am just so tired of all the trial and error treatments that I would just accepted that life would suck for me, but now that I know it is put up a wall between us too, I do not know what to do anymore. It give up. I just started the Mona Lisa and it seems to be working. My marriage has had its ups and downs but 32 years and still going. Perhaps you might think of alternative ways to satisfying your and your husband\u2019s sexual needs. Go find a Sex therapist and start talking I am so sorry you are dealing with both LS and now your partner being unsupportive. I am in a similar boat, I was diagnosed a year or two ago and still do not have a solution for the painful sex (I have a tear that just will not budge despite usage of the cream). Before my current partner, I was with a man similiar to your fiance who seemed to value our sex life more than my safety and comfort. We inevitably broke up when the pain (both emotional and physical) got to be too much for me. \n\nNot long after I broke up with my ex I found my current partner. He never pressures me for sex or makes me feel bad about not being able to perform. Not being able to have intercourse is a challenge, but we find ways around it. I am not saying you should absolutely break up with your fiance, I just want to stress that you deserve someone who will be kind and understanding. When I was with my ex, I did not think I would ever find someone who valued me more than my ability to perform sex acts. But things are so much better now that I am not being guilted into harming myself through intercourse. \n\nMy main point is mostly that you deserve love and support. And that you are worth more than the sex you offer to a partner. I felt I needed to mention all this because I really wish someone had told me that back when I was in a bad place with my ex. Again, I am not saying to break up with your partner or that your sex life is unfixable. And I do understand your partners frustration to some degree. But I think for me at least, things got a lot better when I felt like I did not need to force myself into painful sex. Anyway, at the end of the day this is less advice and more me trying to stress that you deserve support, love, and kindness. Give almond oil a try! I use it alternating with the cortison creme and it really helps.\nEdit: make sure to use cold pressed one though. No added chemicals! Have you tried borax? I feel your frustration. I am at this point where my all time low libido could end up ending my relationship with my partner. I am going to see my gynecologist for the first time in almost two years next month and I am hoping they can offer some hope. It is not even the fear of pain or injury for me anymore, it is just lack of desire. Really depressing shit. Hope your fianc\u00e9 can at least have some understanding.   My (M53) wife (F59)  has LS and in the past 5 years it has really disrupted our sex life.  She has tried the prescription creams/pills and has stopped all of them cause they do not make her feel normal.   \nShe uses Hoba Oil (JOJOBA OIL) just so it does not rub raw since after menopause things dry up , but that is not the fix for sex, but it does make her feel more normal with the thinning of the skin cause of LS.\n\nThe depression of not feeling sexy cause of LS is probably the biggest thing, it is hard to feel sexy when it hurts to have sex.\n\nThere are a number of lubes and such that we have tried and some work well, where she does not tear which is painful, and these lubes are pretty standard.  We have had a number of conversations and have discussed other ways of having sex which is not always PIV.   So it is about finding other things that can make both of you satisfied.\n\nSorry if this sounds rambling but, I hope that your fianc\u00e9 can understand where you are and loves you regardless.  I would go visit your gyno. Unfortunately, dealing with this disease does require some trial and error, which can be horribly frustrating.\nThere is hope! A normal sex life is absolutely possible. With some care and attention from you and your fiance, you can make it happen. Finding the proper treatment and maintenance for you, is important though. That is the first step. \nI am married and have had two kids in the last 4.5 years. There was a point in my life where I did not even think I could have sex anymore... Let alone get married and have kids. I do have flare ups, and they do suck. But proper communication is important. It is also good to try to find ways to be intimate that might not include always have intercourse. Communication is key. \nPlease do not feel that this disease is the end of the world. It does not need to run your relationship, and it absolutely does not mean you and your fiance will live a sexless, intimate-less life!   There are solutions. Talk to your doctor, or find a dr who specializes in this (they exist... My Gyno does).\n\nGood luck to you. Also, I do recommend therapy or some sort. You mentioned being afraid to have sex. Aside from the physical aspects of this disease, it can also cause psychological issues, and fear based around sex. Our bodies can shut down from anxiety and fear around this, where it can make it physically painful to have sex. I had this happen years ago and it was not due to the actual LS! It stemmed from being in an abusive relationship at the time. Seek other forms of help if you need to. There is no shame in this.", "What are the healing stages of a punch biopsy like? Hey guys. I had two punch biopsies done on Oct 26th so it is been 5 days. I have been putting on neosporin 2-3x a day so that it can heal, but I am unsure if it is infected. The hole on my left side has some sort of white/yellow gunk in it but I cannot tell if this is what it is supposed to look like while healing. It is not oozing out or anything, so it is not pus or discharge. Did anyone else experience this?\n\nAlso, has anyone else put neosporin on and it turned out alright? Yea, it may look funky, but it is going to be alright! Yes, mine turned green and white. It will get very itchy at some point. It took mine 2 weeks to heal.

Hi, I am having a really hard time at the moment trying to figure out what has been going on down there. Sorry for the very revealing photo. I first went to the doctor with itching and what looked like a lesion and we automatically assumed it was herpes. I got tested and it came back negative. Howveer, I was pretty convinced and went ahead with treatment anyway. Now two months has passed and I am still having the same symptoms of itching and stinging and any minor thing causes little cuts in my vulva. I have psoarisis already which I have read can be related to this? Also I have an immune disorder. I went to the doctor again earlier this week to get more swabs done for any other possible infections and again they came back negative. I have no idea what to do! I am in so much discomfort thought perhaps lichenclerosus could be a possibility? Thank you for any opinions or advice! Also as you can see it is quite red and irritated at the moment I do get white spots. The bumps are definitely more raised and there is almost a line between where my vulva and regular skin meet due to it being slightly swollen. Are you more concerned about the bumps or the white patch? It is hard to tell if it is hypo-pigmentation or just the flash from your camera...\n\nYour symptoms definitely align with LS, did you ask your doctor about it when you were there this week? Try and keep it as moisturized as possible and avoid scratching. Try a borax bath and use some Aquaphor and ask your doc specifically about it next time. If you are like most of us, you will be put through the ringer before an official diagnosis. Good luck :) Go see a dermatologist. It does look a lot like genital herpes to me. Have you had a full test for STIs? It does not look like HPV to me, but have you been tested for that?\nEarly on in my lichen sclerosus battle, I had blisters that looked somewhat like this. Your best bet is to see a dermatologist. Most gynecologists are unfortunately not very knowledgeable about LS Hi, I had a swab done as soon as the last sore bit appeared and it did come back negative. Due to how it looked I did go ahead with treatment for herpes. I have now taken a high dose of antivirals 3 times for 10 days back to back and the symptoms just seem to persist. The lumps u see in this photo are not blisters and are not sore I think the flash just really highlighted them. I think it is maybe glands that have become slightly irritated now by what is going on. I also got swabbed for any possible other stds and it was negative. I am honestly so stumped and have no idea where to go from here.  I asked the doctor if they could do bloods for herpes they said it was not possible. They do not seem concerned with what is going on at this point and I am in so much discomfort it is really starting to upset me. Hi, thanks for replying. There bumps are not concerning me too much as I think the flash has just captured irritated glands/ follicles. More the redness and there is a white rim around the redness. The flash does slightly confuse the photo.", "Please help you all!!! What can I do for this biopsy pain?! This shit HURTS! Procedure was 2 hrs ago; 2 biopsies taken  I took Tylenol and honestly just time is going to be your best friend. I know it sucks, but it will get better!! I used lidocaine.  That helped. Time! Where did you have it done? Oh man I had a punch hole biopsy on my vaginal lichen....shit was not cool. I could not even one without crying for days and I have a high pain tolerance. I did find baths comforting and learned if I pour warm water while peeing it really helped! That is if you had a vaginal biopsy tho lol Ice pack They gave me Vicodin. If they did not give you that or Tylenol 3, then Advil would be my next recommendation. Four 200 mg every 6-8 hours and an ice pack. My doctor also said you can take 2 Tylenol and 2 Advil but not more than every 6 hours. \n\nAlso I recommend a squeeze type water bottle to use after bowel movements! My doctor gave me that tip and it was so helpful Two biopsies from the labia minora area. One in each side, near the hood \ud83d\ude2c", "How do I clean? Two days ago I (M) started with clob ointment before going to bed. But when I shower the next morning I wonder how I should clean it up. I should only clean my penis with water, but the ointment is very oily/fatty and does not really come off with water. \n\nOr should I first whipe it clean with a cloth before showering?", "How long did it take for you to notice a whiye figure 8 pattern or white patches Is my vagina abnormally white ? It changes in pix throughout the day and I am just not understanding why it looks like this....\n(\n( It does not really look like patches does it itch at all Can you dm me", "Finally made an appointment (22F) Hi everyone.\n\nI have been having problems for 3 years. It all started with a yeast infection when I was 19 that persisted for 6 months straight. I went to several gynecologists who prescribed fluconazole and sent me away. I was so depressed and desperate that I cut out all sugar and carbohydrates for 2 months, but even that did not help. A blood test concluded that I am *not* diabetic, so I became convinced that my birth control pills were the problem and switched to an IUD (kyleena), which I have had for 2 years now.\n\nAfter that, my infections finally eased up, but sex became excruciatingly painful, like someone is pouring acid into my vagina. I tear every time, no matter much foreplay, how much lube, how turned on I am, etc. Even the slightest touch results in tiny rips that feel like little paper cuts. It seems like my labia have lost all elasticity because they keep getting longer, which is uncomfortable and makes me really self-conscious. I have considered labiaplasty to fix it.\n\nA month ago, my yeast infection returned, and I  have been so itchy and sore both inside and on my vulva that I cannot walk or sit comfortably. Medication is not helping, as usual. The itch is unbearable and I cannot help scratching at it. This of course results in swelling and more cuts. \n\nThis shit really gets me down. Not only is it extremely painful and uncomfortable just living my day-to-day life, but I also have a very high libido and it is *so* frustrating and saddening that I cannot enjoy sex anymore. I feel like I am broken.\n\nI did a little digging online and came across lichen sclerosus, and now all of a sudden everything makes sense. Yesterday I called a dermatologist and I have an appointment in a few weeks. It is a bit disheartening that there is not a cure, but with treatment it cannot get much worse than this...right? I am scared, but for once I have a little bit of hope. \n\nThanks for reading my story. Any words of encouragement are appreciated &lt;3 Same as you (22F) after over a year of hell I got diagnosed this summer back after a biopsy. Was super upset to hear no cure and the first cream I got gave me a reaction. BUT, second cream did help a lot. I had a follow up at the dermatologist and she said things looked so much better and it is a lot better. Unfortunately it has not gone completely away for me and is still uncomfortable at times. But treatment DOES HELP. It still feels so much better than it used to. LS sucks super hard, and I totally get the feeling of hopelessness but treatment helps, and you can feel better. Best of luck with your appointment!", "What sort of things can you to flare up? I am 26f, suspecting that I have LS after talking to a doctor online, waiting for covid to die down in my country before heading straight to the doctor\u2019s office :( \nI have discolouration (like 3 shades lighter than my skin tone) with slight cuts and \u201croughness\u201d running down my vulva and intense itchiness that gets worse and better randomly. I am curious though, are there any specific things that cause you to flare up? Stress seems to be the biggest reason, but some people have found sensitivities to foods and detergents. Other than stress it varies widely person to person! I was just diagnosed in November but I have noticed that every time my period comes, I have really bad flare-ups. I have to be really careful about staying clean and dry and even then the pain and itching can get pretty bad. Hey there! I also get flare ups around my period. At first, I obsessively kept my vulva clean and dry. Horrible advise!!! Vulvas/vaginas with LS need to be kept moisturized. The pads and tampons I was using were zapping my moisture and causing flares. When I switched to a menstrual cup, 90% of my period problems went away. It collects the blood instead of absorbing it. Others say cloth pads or period underwear work as well. I also put on extra moisturizer (Emu oil or prescription tacrolimus) during that time of the month. Thanks for the tip. Everything is so sensitive these last few weeks even a menstrual cup sounds painful. I was considering buying period underwear but I think I will go for it now. \n\nI have not found a moisturizer I like yet. I have heard petroleum jelly works well too. Have you tried that? I am so reluctant to put anything new on the area since my dermatologist just switched me to halobetasol because my legions have been getting worse even after 6 months on clobetasol I could bathe in this: (\n\nIt is an excellent moisturizer in between steroid doses. My prescription for tacrolimus also works well. Im a fool and broke a 4 year dormancy by waxing. Yes. I know.", "LS and pregnancy? I have been diagnosed with LS since 2020, (21F) and treatment with eumovate (clob) ointment has worked really well for me, I still do have lighter patches but they have not grown and I do not have pain anymore.\n\nI do not plan to have kids for awhile, but I saw today that you cannot use clob while pregnant? If I am being honest that could make me not want to ever be pregnant because the idea of my LS getting worse is terrifying to me with how painful it used to be. \n\nIf any of you have had LS before pregnancy, how was it? We are you able to continue using clob? Did things get worse/better etc?\n\nMy LS is right on my perinium so I would also wonder if I would have to get a c-section to prevent tearing if that would make the LS worse.", "Does my clitoris look normal or could this be LS?  This definitely could be LS. That is exactly how mine looks", "Does it get worse or itchier in the shower? I have had an itchy spot on my scrotum for years now, it only gets itchy when I shower &amp; I have to scratch it for a minute or so before the intense need to scratch it goes away. \n\nI do not know if it is lichensclerosus or BXO or something else. I am uncircumcised and occasionally get BXO &amp; mild phimosis on my foreskin but it generally goes away, however the itchy spot on my left testicle remains. \n\nAny ideas on what it might be, and how to remedy it? I have seen some comments that circumcision stops BXO, and while I am open to getting circumcised for aesthetic reasons, and the benefit of not getting BXO would be a bonus, I am not 100% sure I am ready for such a permanent solution. Could be a slight water allergy or too warm of water! That happens to me (female) sometimes. BXO is another name for LS  (but specific to the penis) right? \n\nIf you have it on your testicle, circumcision will probably not be curative. It is often curative for LS when it is only on the foreskin. Steroid ointments might cure it, and if not, they will probably control it. \n\nEither way, you should definitely get it seen by a dermatologist or maybe urologist. If they suggest circumcision, tell them how you feel and ask what your other options are.  I am not sure, I guess it is. I just wondered if the LS on the foreskin is somehow transmitting it to the testicle skin.\n\nThe urologist I have already seen did not think it was LS when I saw them about epididymal cysts, hydroceles &amp; phimosis. They can basically fix it all in one surgery: epididymal cysts, hydroceles &amp; circumcision, idk if it would be too much? Maybe it is all related and would fix the problem. Do you have LS? Does it happen in the same spot every time?? \n\nI literally have to get a brush and scrub for a good 30 seconds before the urge goes away. Unfortunately the skin has gotten thicker over the years, possibly contributing to epididymal cysts and hydroceles. :(", "Adhesions from steroid cream? I have not been diagnosed with LS, but I have Crohn\u2019s disease that affects my skin and has affected my vulva. In the past it was ulcerations on my inner vulva but last year i had extreme inflammation, redness, pain and itching. I was bounced back between the gynecologist as dermatologist. I came back with a very high ph and no lactobacilli. I thought I may have desquamative inflammatory vaginitis which is an extra intestinal manifestation of Crohn\u2019s. \n\nI was prescribed clobetasol and then Tacrolimus (prograf) ointment. I did the clobetasol for a few weeks then switched to Tacrolimus and then would alternate between the Tacrolimus and hydrocortisone every few weeks. \n\nI stopped following up with my dermatologist because he was wanting me to go to a specialist and I could tell he was getting frustrated. Lots of issues with insurance and I finally have a referral appointment a year later. \n\nAnyways in the meantime I switched my Crohn\u2019s meds and then got that mostly under control. And then I started to worry about the constant use of the Tacrolimus and hydrocortisone so I just stopped them hoping things would not get bad again.\n\nMy local GI convinced me to go to the gynecologist again (I had only seen the NP and am also dealing with hidradenitis suppurativa). She was very helpful and said she did not see inflammation anymore but asked if I had been using a lot of steroid cream. \n\nI said yes, can you tell? She said yes, did you use it up near the clitoris because you have fusing there. I told her that was the area where it was the most inflamed. So she gave me an estrogen cream prescription and said it should resolve in 6-8 weeks and that steroid cream lowers the estrogen in that area which causes fusing. She said she sees it in breastfeeding women and peri/menopausal women. \n\nI am wondering if anyone has ever dealt with adhesions before and if the estrogen cream really did help. Or did you have to get surgery and if so did that help? Just looking for experiences. \n\nAlso is it really the steroid or the inflammation that causes the adhesions? I am curious about her saying estrogen is lowered where you use the steroid. I have never heard of that. Adhesions are a symptoms of the LS in both men and women. I did have an experience the other night where after applying the mometasone, the two areas of skin where I would put it went quite raw and then tried to attach. I am still slightly sceptical as to whether my remaining issues actually \\*are\\* LS, to be honest, so I am wondering if steroid cream may be compounding the problem, but I am sort of screwed until I can see a professional again to ask.", "New doctor after 4 (or 5) visits with my dermatologist, telling her is suspect LS, and 2 biopsies, everything came back as inconclusive. last night i had another issue which led to me finding a new gyno today. just by looking she mentioned LS before i even did. \n\nroller coaster of emotions going from thinking i had it, to being told no, then being told they have no idea and now back to thinking it is LS. \n\nhopefully will find out more soon but just needed to vent a bit i guess. I know how frustrating it can be with docs. Stick with it and keep your head up!", "What do u guys think? NSFW nsfw !!\n\nI know these are not pretty pictures. I have seen many gynecologists in the last year and a half and none of them know what is up with me. It is basically just real thin skin, I get the little tiny tears, I get really really red and inflamed. I cannot rly masturbate and I definitely cannot have sex. No itchiness and I have 0 infections. The texture is new-ish. I have always had a lot of Fordyce spots but not like that. Anyway, if anyone has any input please let me know. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Definitely seems like LS or something similar. I would look for a specialist or a OBGYN or dermatologist with experience in treating LS so you can get a diagnosis. Be sure to ask before going in if they have someone on staff familiar with treating it before wasting your time on an appt. I have seen 3 so called specialists that specialize in LS and they do not see it, and eventually, and I do mean all of them, tell me I should see someone else because they are not sure lol Have you requested a biopsy? Yes from multiple doctors. They all say no cause it is too close to my clitoris. Which is understandable but at least try to treat me?? Idk Geese, yeah, it sounds like the docs you have seen have no idea what they are doing. Even if they are not 100% sure it is LS, they should try you on Clobetasol (the steroid we use) and some Estrogen cream to see if it helps. I would check out the LS support groups on Facebook. They have lists of docs they recommend sometimes and I found my specialist this way! One doc did put me on clobetasol when it was not too bad, told me \u201cuse this for two weeks and you will be all healed up.\u201d And then had no idea what to do when all my symptoms came back after ceasing use altogether. Lol. I have had a fun time with doctors, truly. I tried to join a LS group and they just.... blocked me? Would have been nice though. Thank you for all your responses \u2764\ufe0f If you still have the clob or can get it back, not medical advice, just... knowledge to do with what you wish - the typical treatment is to apply it 1-3 times a week for life (pea size amt rubbed in after a warm shower and dried is best cause it helps absorb!) \n\nI usually use mine twice a week, but 3 times if I am extra flare-y. I also find the following things to be helpful: reducing stress (ahhahaha), drinking enough water, not using ANY soap on my labia (just warm water and my hand or a super soft washcloth), using dye free and scent free laundry detergent and dryer balls instead of scented dryer sheets, wearing loose comfortable clothes, all cotton underwear, the smaller the seams the better, taking warm baths with a little hydrogen peroxide and baking soda dashed in every couple days, using all natural paraben free water based lube, and changing my underwear before bed and in the morning. \n\nA healthy diet can help as well, esp high protein and dark green leafy veggies, avoiding lots of sugar and yeast and dairy, but like... I cannot do that. I love food. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI hope that helps. It cannot replace a good doctor, but maybe can reduce your symptoms and flares until you find one! Thanks so much. I do all that except for the baking soda baths and the steroid ointment obviously, also going without underwear as much as I can at home (which is all the time and I never wear them to bed) helps me a lot too. I do not eat sweets or fruit, do not add sugar to my coffee etc. I eat salads and chicken and occasionally might eat mexican but I do not eat flour tortillas. Sorry to give you a rundown of my diet but I eat generally healthy and maybe it would be a lot worse if I did not.\n\nI am just afraid to self treat I guess. I would just LOVE to have a doctor that knows what is wrong with me and we can treat it together. I am tired lol. Thank you\u2764\ufe0f ...two weeks? \n\nStandard LS treatment is high-dose clob for several months. After that, frequency and/or dose is tapered but continued indefinitely. If it improved with the clob, why do not they continue you on the clob? \n\nre: your pictures, the pale areas on/around your clitoris look potentially like LS to me, but I am not a doctor so take it with a grain of salt. \n\nYou also have very pale mucosa around your vestibule/introitus. I have that too and I am not sure what it means.\n\nThe skin to the sides of your vulva also looks kind of bumpy and scaly; have eczema and psoriasis been considered? (Maybe those are just the Fordyce spots you mentioned; I had to Google that.) I would also consider Lichen Planus and Zoon's Vulvitis.\n\nI would recommend seeing a dermatologist if you have not yet, since it sounds like the gyns have failed you.\n\nWas the LS group you joined the Facebook one? They commented on my post here to join their group in order to see their list of specialists but I have not tried yet. I feel weird about doing personal health stuff on FB... and I do not have a diagnosis yet (derm appointment is in January) so I do not know that I am even allowed. Went to a derm and it seemed like she would have rather been anywhere else and examined me for 5 seconds, not kidding lol\n\nI noticed the paleness around my entrance too and it is certainly new. I have been pretty familiar with my vulva my whole life and I recognize none of what I look at now. Thanks for all your input, I appreciate it so much. And yeah it was that LS group. I am a guy but found your issue quite similar, I too have Fordyce spots on my penis and scrotrum. The white spots near your clit and labia are Papules which can appear on both penis and vagina and I have those inside of my foreskin. Recently I started seeing smaller cracks that looked inflamed especially after masturbating and my skin would get dry and also would itch sometimes. I thought I had LS. I started applying little bit of oil there and changed my soup and within couple of days it went away. With that said I just wanted share my thoughts as I found your issue similar to mine but I will recommend you to consult a Gyn or dermatologist. I have been to about 9 gyno\u2019s and 1 dermatologist. I do not use soap and I have tried all sorts of oils lol. Thank you ! I hope you find the right treatment and it goes away. I am sure you would have but try finding out what causes it or when it happens. Well, it never goes away. When I do not treat w oils and stuff it gets worse and it gets worse with prolonged use of underwear and when I try to masturbate, but it never heals or anything. I have had it every day since summer \u201819. Thank you for your input \u2764\ufe0f Yaa wearing underwear for long makes it worst. Well I would say keeping searching for a good dermatologist until you find the one.", "Post Biopsy blood loss ", "How long did it take to not be able to handle sex after symptoms started showing? I just had a biopsy today to try and find out if the discolored spots are lichen sclerosus. My ob/gyn highly suspects it is because I have other autoimmune disorders. I am only 25 but I love sex. I could do it 3 times a day and be happy. So possibly losing that aspect of my life is devastating. I do not want that to happen. It how I feel truly connected with my husband and is really important to me. I do not have any pain now and I only have a couple discolorations and no other symptoms. If the biopsy is positive for LS, your doctor will probably have you start a treatment like clobetasol, which works for the majority of people. It should prevent progression. I know a lot of people post here about painful sex, but that may be because A) they are in the minority for whom treatment did not work well or B) they already had an advanced case or bad symptoms by the time they were diagnosed or C) they could not or would not use proven treatments due to lack of insurance, personal beliefs, crappy doctors, etc\n\nAlso, not everyone gets symptoms, even without treatment. I have relatively mild symptoms but very obvious signs (extensive white spots, fusing etc). I think I have had LS for many years, although I only got diagnosed in March, and I have never not been able to have vaginal sex (although I do get some discomfort especially with certain positions, which might be explained by LS). I feel it is also worth noting that there is lots of gratifying ways to have sex that do not involve vaginal penetration, so even if that were to become prohibitively difficult, there are many other ways to have a fulfilling sex life. It is different person to person. Painful intercourse is something that will eventually happen but the timeframe depends on the severity of your case and how well your body reacts to treatment. Everyone is different the main things you want to start is vaginal moisturizer and finding a good lubricant to prevent irritation. Irritation will cause a flare up that causes scaring which leads to an inability to become wet and in turn causes painful sex and more irritation which starts a vicious never ending cycle. Personally extra virgin coconut oil is my go to but see what works best for you. I was the exact same way sex for hours multiple times a day was normal for me and my husband.. I was not aware of my need to lubricate because my natural lubrication was excessive to say the least... If I could go back in time I would have used vaginal moisturizer and used lubricant from the beginning.. I only recently found a regimen that enables me to have sex again; Before I could only have intercourse once a month but with dire consequences my lesions would be HUGE as wide as my pinky on both sides, from top to bottom and urinating took an act of god!  It has been a rough year to say the least. Regular check-ups are a must, avoid harsh cleansers and over washing down there. Stay on top of your medication and if it stops working tell your doctor immediately. Although there is no cure it can be manageable you just have to find what works for you. You will also have to be flexible what works for you now might not work for you a year from now. Keep doing research and stay up to date there is always new studies and medication and maybe one day a cure. Until then keep your head up you are lucky you found it early. Having sex is good for blood circulation. Use silicone lube! I almost stopped having sex with my husband and it was a big mistake! I increased my frequency and felt better after a month or two. Hi, just wanted to reply to your comment and say thank you. I was diagnosed a few months ago. 24f and I have been so extremely worried about fusing etc. But your comment has given me hope. Thank you A diagnosis does not mean you will not be able to have sex. Everyone is different, so you need to accept some uncertainty (which sucks). I have been diagnosed for almost two years and besides a few times where my skin was in a bad flare, my sex life has not decreased. One of the things I do to avoid any negative impacts on my skins is to just plop a bit of Vaseline on the affected spots before sex. It is sticky, and still stay in place and removes and friction from that skin. Lichen Sclerosis- beating the disease by Ginny chandoha. Saved my life.", "I seriously do not know where to turn. I use to have all the key symptoms of LS. I am 23 and it started when I was 15/16.the head of my penis started flaking and I was young and dumb and made the worst mistake of my life to peel the skin off. Now one side of my glans looks under developed and ridiculous. It looks like a chunk of skin was torn off and that is because it basically was. From there things got horrible. Hard white skin would slowly spread and still is to this day. The skin on one part of my gland is so frail and thin. It looks awful. Blotchy, red, brown, white. I have been to dermatologists, urologists and one actually made it worse. I am losing hope. Never been with a girl because of this and it is so embarrassing. Self conscious about this and my size. My self esteem is Garbage. I just want to be able to have a normal sex life but my penis looks like a freak show. Some days I am so sad and depressed about it. I was very healthy I use to lift weights, blah blah blah. Now I am a fat slob. I have had skin samples taken and nothing was diagnosed. Id give all the money I have to have a normal looking penis. It looks worse than lots of other LS cases. Maybe it is not ls, derms do not know what it is. What is the point in living if you are by yourself? When I was young I asked god why he gave me a small penis. Well he showed me it can be much worse. Really cannot get much worse other than a STD. All my friends have girlfriends and when they talk about their sex life I just feel so empty. I love life but god, you really do not know what some people take for granted. I just want to be normal :( What treatments have you used? \n\nIf money\u2019s not an issue look into stem cells. You can regenerate the skin and heal/reverse the LS. It is a miracle of a procedure that is changed my life. The website talks mostly about vulvas but the procedure can and has been performed on male anatomy. I cannot recommend it enough. It is offered else where but dr Newman is truly the expert in the US. \nCheck out his (\n\nCurrent cost is 6250 USD but birthday month can get 10% off\u2026 \nYou could also look into the coyle institute but I am not sure if dr coyle treats make patients. Good luck with everything. It is possible to surgically resurface the glans using tissue from the inside of your cheek however it requires, I understand, the patient to be circumcised for the procedure to be successful. It is complex work and requires a very good and experienced urological surgeon. The key thing is whether the LS is still active. Have you symptoms progressed? If you are in the UK I can give you a couple of leads. Even if you are elsewhere it may be worthwhile writing to these doctors, with pictures, and asking if they know an appropriate surgeon nearer to you. I wish you all the best. Also, I would investigate counselling to help you process this. Whilst surgery or other options suggested may be able to improve appearance, it may well be that you will not achieve an entirely \u201cnormal\u201d penis. The truth is, there are a lot of people out there who will simply not care. They will look at the total package and buy that. So think about talking to someone, getting back to the gym etc. I am sure you have heard this all before but it will help. I wish you all the best. This is interesting - can anyone else vouch for this procedure? I am going to have to look into this forsure! I am in the us. I am circumcised and have been my whole life. Thank you man. Truly has effected me in a bad way. Just to be clear, have the various doctors actually diagnosed you with LS? If you call Dr Nathan Newman\u2019s office they can add you to a FB group with former and prospective patients who also share their experience with the procedure :) &gt;:)\n\n:) They both said it could be LS but I never got a confirmed diagnosis A good dermatologist should be able to diagnosed however biopsies are more commonly undertaken in US than over here. A complication in your diagnosis is that you are circumcised whereas many of the symptoms relate to the condition of the foreskin. I think you should persevere with getting a diagnosis - frustrating as they may be - and getting appropriate treatment. The research into other procedures can run in parallel. I wish you all the best. Woman with LS here! \nMaybe it is because I also suffer in my nether region, but I promise you that your penis would not bother me or most women! I had an ex who did not care that I had nearly no labias, and the mixture of colors. \n\nBiopsy is the only way to confirm LS. LS causes white, redness, or light brown hyperpigmentation. I have had it all. I am curious if you can try clobetasol ointment and see if that helps! \n\nI am sorry you are experiencing this. But I can assure you, I know many women do not care about size. I have had sex with really small penises, we just do different positions. And it was a fun time tbh because it was still good and I also really loved the person. \n\nKeep pushing for that LS biopsy! Thanks. Yeah I have all the tell tale signs regarding the symptoms but both dermatologists I been to said it could be ls but were not sure. They even took a skin sample and found nothing. Not really sure how to proceed. I have tried clobetasol it did not really help. Derm thought I did. I did not notice any improvement. Guess I just have to accept what I live with. Clobetasol needs to be in ointment form for it to completely work. And you need to soak before application. This is the standard treatment for clob according to my LS doctor:\n1. For 1 month - apply once at night (soaking is ideal but if you cannot do that, put a wet warm washcloth there to soften the skin. \n2. For 1 month after that - do every other night \n3. Forever, to prevent flares and also improve skin - twice every week (3 days apart). \n\nYou have to use it for months for it to really work. What do you mean by soaking? Have you tried other ointments? I have tried tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, ala-quinn, duobrii and clobetasol. Probably tried each one for about a month. Clobetasol for like 2-3. Doc claimed he saw improvements. I did not really notice any. So the reason why soaking is important is because LS affects the basement membrane of your skin. When you soak in warm water, your skin softens &amp; your pores open up. LS thickens the skin, which makes it harder for anything to penetrate deep into the basement layer. It is also important to rub the ointment in as opposed to just slathering it on. I did not do this for the first several months of my treatment. Dr. Jill Krapf and Dr. Goldstein are leading LS researchers and specialists, their studies are what prompted me to try this method. My color is coming back on my vulva because of this and I am pretty stoked about it. \n\nI have not tried anything else because the high potency steroids (Clobetasol &amp; Bethametasome) really worked This is good to know! Thank you.", "Fairly certain I have LS and I would really appreciate some guidance. I have an appointment with my OBGYN Monday, so I would appreciate any tips on how to discuss this without making it sound like I diagnosed myself (29f).\n\nThis year I became prone to cuts and tears down there. Was not bad enough to cause concern. \nThen I started getting what I think are flare-ups. It happened twice so far. A white, plaquey patch appears on my vulva along with pain and itching. It disappears in a day, leaving behind white spots and streaks in my creases. Those become red sores/irritation before fading. \n\nThe second incident was worse than the first and more painful. Also, the skin of my vulva is lightening. It went from pink and red to white with a little purple. \n\nThis sounds like LS to me but I would appreciate all opinions. I am honestly terrified. I know many women have success with treatment, but others struggle so much. The idea of fusing and architecture damage and not being able to have sex is so crushing. And I worry that since this condition is progressive and I have it at an undulating young age, that just means it has even more time to get really bad. Ok, I will try to stop panicking now. Any thoughts or advice? Those sound like the textbook symptoms to me. I have only very very recently been diagnosed so I am navigating this stuff myself too\u2026.\nYou are definitely not the only one that it panicking about the anatomy fusion and shit. I literally almost got sick when I read that the first time. But I have taken the advice I have found on this subreddit and have started using coconut oil to keep things lubricated down there Thank you so much for responding. I hate to see other women suffering but it is good to know I am not alone. \n\nDo you know if coconut oil is just for symptom relief or can it help prevent scarring/fusion/all that terrifying stuff? So far, my symptoms are mild outside of flare ups (excluding the discoloration). My understanding is that if things are kept lubricated, it kind of prevents the skin from sticking together as bad. I have read a few cases where it is helped reverse some peoples fusing as well. I am personally taking precautions and either using my steroid cream or coconut oil after I get out of the shower. This combo seems to have been helping the flare ups too. \nI hope someone else can weigh in on this and help us out lol I am going to let you know that 29 is not unusually young. I am 33 and 28-29 is when I started having symptoms and it seems like late 20s-30s is not an uncommon age for onset. I think medical texts tend to state older because so many people are embarrassed and it takes a long time for them to seek treatment.\n\nI would just go in and be sure to let them know everything you have been dealing with in that area (especially the cuts!), how long you have been having symptoms, and let them know if you have already tried yeast treatments (I was told it looked like a very bad yeast infection - first test for yeast came back positive but we were a little confused cus candida usually does not cause an infection that bad (and I was negative for other fungal infections), the second one came back negative). In fact, tell them everything you have tried - if you have tried to change soaps and detergents, if you have tried oils, suppositories, etc.\n\nThey may want to outright treat for yeast regardless, and I would press that they at least test, especially when you have been having cuts. From there if that treatment does nothing or just barely takes the edge off, go back and ask them to run more tests. Unfortunately this may be how it will have to go, and going forward I would expect at least two visits for diagnosis of anything other than an infection.\n\nIn the second visit, you might ask them if they are willing to biopsy so you can know for sure what is going on. Be aware that it is going to hurt after the local wears off but in my experience past the first hour or two it was not anymore painful than the disease itself... and then you will for sure have an answer cus biopsies are unfortunately the gold standard for diagnosis... but obviously they are not going to want to do one at the initial visit (it took me 3 doctors). Hopefully at this point with all the discoloration they will want to do this anyways.\n\nBe aware that the biopsy is going to hurt for awhile so if you can, schedule that for either your weekend or the last day of your work week (ie. After work)... get an ointment (like Vaseline or Aquaphor) to seal and reduce friction to apply whenever you are going to need to do a lot of walking around. Beep. Boop.

Message me for bug reports.)  Jumping in to say those sound like classic symptoms of LS. I got diagnosed at age 5 and even then my mom was told it \"really only affected menopausal women\". And lo, here I am a menopausal woman that had a flare after 40 years of it being dormant, so just know that everyone is body is different.\n\nBecause mine came on so early I do not think I developed some of the architecture (no labia minora to speak of) and it did not negatively affect my sex life or prevent me from having 2 healthy children. So, yes, it is a scary diagnosis and it might take some time to figure out your right treatment but you have got some good advice here for your appointment.  Hang in there! Hi- I have LS! I am 23 and was diagnosed just over a year ago. It has not been easy and it is been a total rollercoaster. I am currently undergoing stem cell therapy and have had some good results and if it does not do the trick I will be looking into the TULIP, a laser procedure for LS. I am not trying to overwhelm you, I just want you know what your options are so I will link these therapies at the bottom. \n\nSo let us talk sex! For me it took months of daily steroid application for it to be pain free. Since you have vaginismus you may want to try dilators once your skin heals a bit more. I still have times where I am flaring and sex is a capital NO, but for the most part I have an active sex life and I am no anomaly. Many women with LS have normal lives sexually. I like to use vitamin e suppositories beforehand.\n\nSome comfort measures you could try- \n\n- borax/baking soda/apple cider vinegar/Epsom salt/ or even plain baths\n- ice for burning \n- v magic moisturizer \n- aquaphor \n- key e vitamin e suppositories \n- coconut oil, plain or infused with cannabis \n- make sure your steroid is an ointment not cream \n\nI would also check out some of the FB LS groups, they tend to be more active and helpful than the LS subreddit, but that is a good community too and can be less overwhelming! Avoid online pictures or horror stories- those are lot of worst case scenarios.  Not everyone experiences every symptom or issue associated with this disease. I have no fusing or architectural changes. Take it easy, breathe, listen to doctors direction, and take this one day at a time. You will heal and get better.\n\n(\n\n( Yup, they say it is more common in younger and older individuals (pre-puberty and post-menopause). For a long time they thought this was strictly hormonal, which is why estrogen was a treatment for a long time, but have come to the conclusion that it is inflammatory and likely autoimmune.\n\nAfter about five years of having this I have had a little bit of reabsorption of my labia minora, but nothing extreme (not even sure a doc would know this has happened already, the only reason I know is because I used to kind of tuck and overlap the labia when this started to reduce friction and cannot do that anymore) --- so while it can progress pretty quickly for some people it does not always... and treatment is generally VERY effective (like the stats are 90%+ in medical texts) and should stop all that in it is tracks.\n\nI agree that what OP is describing sounds pretty classic - and hoping for answers and good, effective treatment. Thank you so much for such a detailed write-up! I actually do not have vaginismus (someone else commented that they did) but for now, I am still able to have sex normally outside of flare-ups. I really hope that does not change. \n\nI definitely should not have googled pictures. It sent me on a bit of a spiral, but I cannot worry myself sick over worse case scenarios. The first step is starting treatment, and I will look into Facebook groups as well! I am not surprised that I was misinformed about the average age. It seems like there is so much we do not know about LS. I swear I have read every article in the first 10 pages of google search and still feel like I know nothing. \n\nThank you for the advice! I am so happy to hear your treatment is going well! Thank you for the reassurance about treatment generally working. \n\nI have spent hours every day reading about LS and I think it is just making my anxiety worse. Half the info articles out there emphasize how progressive it is and make it sound like getting worse and worse is inevitable. I really hope I respond well to treatment. Thanks so much for reaching out! This subreddit already feels like a godsend &lt;3 I do not blame you there. I have read a couple meta-studies and I am still a bit confused, but I also figure knowledge is power so imma keep reading till I feel like I understand. Maybe that is a bit obsessive but after being diagnosed with one inflammatory skin condition before this, I feel totally blindsided by this diagnosis. Yeah it is kind of alarming and I came here like \"Is there any hope at all\" and was really relieved to hear that people were able to have sex after a few weeks to a month of treatment. Also was incredibly relieved (after trying Protopic for two months with poor results) that the Dexamethasone (topical steroid) the gyno prescribed did not burn like fire! You are not alone. I was literally diagnosed yesterday. Still navigating this. I started Clobetasol last night. 2nd application this morning. I am already feeling some relief. I have got other concurring issues, due to menopause, and did not even realize it was a separate thing going on with my nether-region. Just thought due to my age (51) my vagina basically wanted to dry up and die. Even going to the doc at all was a personal triumph.\n\nI am in the stirrups and doc says, \"I am going to hand you a mirror\"...\ud83d\ude33 I was like, oh shit, wtf? \n\nMy husband has now heard the words \"vagina and vulva\" more times in 24 hours than he has in his lifetime! \ud83e\udd23\n\nAs a good friend reminded me right before I went in, \n\"You got this. You are in charge. She is  not the boss of you. You get to navigate what is best for you. Whatever happens, you can handle. You can do the hard things.\" \ud83d\udcaa \ud83d\udc83\n\nAdvocate for yourself and take it one step at a time!!! When I searched \u201cwhite patchy areas on labia\u201d and LS popped up, I felt like I would finally figured out what was wrong. Do not worry about not trying to diagnose yourself. I worry about those things too, but after many appts for the same problem (extremely painful sex and always tearing/bleeding after intercourse) I did not care anymore. I asked specifically for a biopsy of the area and it came back with evidence of LS. I think my doctor was relieved we finally figured it out.\n\nI am really sorry, it is definitely a terrifying thing, but it is much better to finally have an answer and begin treating it. You can do this!!", "Newly diagnosed (f22) Hey guys, I have just been diagnosed at 22 and honestly lichen sclerosus seems very scary. I am currently dealing with the intense itching and pain at the moment, my biggest fear is the impact on sexual functioning. any advice or support would be much appreciated, \n\nThanks all! I was diagnosed about 6 years ago. I can only talk about my case but I can say that if you keep on top of things and note the things that seem to irritate, it is manageable. When I get flair ups, it affects me quite a bit, the overall discomfort is hard to deal with at first. Penetration can be impossible (I am a woman) and having to explain to a new partner that I am patchy white is not pleasant. But with time, you will understand better how it affects you. If you got clobetasol, use it as prescribed. In my case it makes a world of difference. I also use zinc ointment (like for diaper rash) when I flair up. It keeps things cool!  I try to \u201cair out\u201d my vulva at night. I cannot imagine sleeping with pyjamas or anything like that. I have also found that using a diva cup instead of tampons or pads also helps. These things work for me but you will quickly understand what works for you. Good luck! I would advise that you make sure you get into a routine! If you have been prescribed clobetasol use it! I was also prescribed an emollient to help keep things moisturised which actually helped a lot with the itching, pain and discomfort.  I use a numbing cream at night when I am having a bad flair up because sometimes you do not realise you are scratching!\n\nAs for sex, you might find it impossible for a while because of the discomfort or you might find its not too bad, either way I would always say that a healthy amount of lube will help!\n\nPersonally speaking, I use my emollient twice a day (once a day when I do not have a flair up), and clobetasol once in the morning and once at night. I sometimes find that the steroid can cause me to itch a bit more which is where a numbing cream comes in handy! Check with your dr/pharmacist before using a numbing cream for a prolonged amount of time though! I did get clobetasol prescribed so I will be making sure to use it regularly. Thank you for your advice around what to use for periods. Slight overshare but I am currently on my period and using tampons is too painful right now and pads are flaring it up even more so I will definetly look at getting a diva cup! Hopefully it helps. Penetration has been impossible since my flare ups started, intense pain, with treatment will penetration become possible again? I know my situation is different to your but any advice helps. Yeah the numbing cream tip helps thanks! Since the flare up my partner has woke up a few times in the middle of the night because I have been scratching and he thought I was masturbating in my sleep. At least with sex there is a chance that it is just too uncomfortable for a while, not forever. I will talk to my doctor about a numbing cream when I see her next week to see if I could get it prescribed even. Currently I have been prescribed clobetasol once a day, my doctor has referred me to dermatology so she does not want to do too much until I have had a dermatology review for it, because in my country apparently that is what they need to do. As long as I do not forget my clobetasol, I am fine. Mine was caught fairly early, so I do not have any scarring or other issues, and I do not have any problems with penetration. It took 3-4 months of using the clobetasol every day before it was under control; now it is 3 times a week. \n\nI am older and have normal hormonal changes due to my age, so I also use an estrogen cream two days of the week when I am not using the clobetasol. I know we are all a little different in how we react. I will sometimes use shea butter in the summertime on the days I do not use the clobetasol. It makes sense for them not to do too much until dermatology has investigated. It let us them see the situation as is.  It is a horrible condition. To have but you will find your own way to deal with it.  I also find if I have too much sugar etc over the course of a few days, it causes a flair up! 3-4 months is not too bad though, thank you for some idea of a time frame, I definetly think we all respond different but it is reassuring that it can be managed. Shea butter is a good idea as a barrier cream option though so I will look into it. Thank you for sharing your advice with me. Good advice on the sugar, I will try to avoid it. I do agree it seems like a good idea to wait for dermatology, the problem is the pain until then! Sorry for the second reply but I just wanted to tell you I got a diva cup! And since I started using it since the pad I have had less pain! So thank you so much for that advice! You are welcome. For the longest time, I could not figure out what was going on down there; I thought I was having back to back yeast infections, and my doc did not catch it (in her defense, I guess it is fairly rare). She did send me to a gynecology specialist, though, and that doc biopsied it and treated me. Your doctor should really be able to help you with the pain.  I had seen 4(!!!!) male doctors who just palmed me off telling me that I had thrush - it went on for years! Eventually I got an appointment with a female doctor, she had one look and was able to tell me what was going on. She was horrified that the other doctors had not investigated further.\n\nI am lucky in that I have not \"lost\" a significant amount of tissue, but still, its a daily battle sometimes!  Yay, little victories! I am very pro Diva cup, my friends can attest to that! \nAs for the other stuff you will get to understand what triggers it for you. Good luck. I have a patch on my perineum as well. It has never bothered me. I am currently on clobetasol 6 nights a week and the rest has improved but not there. But it does not itch or scar either, I am not sure why. Thankfully I think my doctor will be on board with helping with the pain, as I have an amazing female doctor, the second she saw my scar tissue she basically said I know this is lichen and we need to get on top of it. I was very thrown when first diagnosed so did not ask for any pain help, really I didnt ask for much. The afternoon after my appointment I had to fly to a different island in my country to see family and I am still up with family so I cannot see my doctor until I am home so I have a few days of pain until I am home. I was diagnosed when having an iud check up and I was the same, I just thought I had a yeast infection and it would be a quick fix, thankfully my doctor is familiar with LS so she knew what she was looking at, I have been referred to a dermatology specialist (because I am already a dermatology patient due to having psoriasis) as my doctor felt I would be seen quicker by dermatology. I will be getting biopsied once dermatology sees it, my current patch is based around my vaginal hood area although there could be some non itchy patches I have not noticed. Little victories that reduce pain and itching are are good. It will be a bit of a journey to figure out the triggers but at least we have got one under control! Thank your for your advice :) My gyno recommended using coconut oil on the areas between use of steroids!  Keeping it moisturized will really help.  Also important: use the steroids correctly when needed.  I have found using clobetasol right before bed does the trick, but even if the symptoms stop overnight I will need to use it a few nights in a row to stop a flare up.\n\nWhatever you do, do not scratch.  Even it feels good, you will pay for it.\n\nKeep an eye on how things look and ask your gyno all of the questions you have!\n\nAs far as sex goes, a supportive partner will understand how it affects you.  Personally I cannot do any heavy rubbing from the front, being penetrated from the back feels a lot better and avoids rubbing any areas that can flare up.  \n\nA lot of the time it feels like something is wrong and cannot be fixed, but you have got this! My gyno said pads, specifically Always are the worst thing you can wear with LS. I have been using panty liners to save my panties from the medicine. Wonder if i should not be using those ??? Hmmm My gyno told me panty liners are the worst thing you can use.  I never really used them before anyways, but it is more about making sure your skin can breath.  Make sure if you are using liners they are unscented.\n\nThe steroid cream I have is clear so I am not worried about staining, but cotton panties wash well and keep things airy when you wear them! Thank you.  That makes sense.", " Looking for additional moderators, subreddit feedback/suggestions, helpful resources etc. Hi Everyone :)\n\nI have been a mod here for well over a year after I requested the subreddit from an inactive moderator. But I am not particularly knowledgeable about LS, although I do have it, so I would love to bring aboard some more mods that are in a position to talk about it.\n\nEqually, I would like to get a sticky post and/or a wiki going on this subreddit so that we can serve as a source of information and help people out that have maybe just got their diagnosis or suspect that they might have LS. \n\nIf anyone would be interested in helping out with that please get in touch :) I have suffered with lichens sclerosis and now lichens planus for the last 26 years.\nHere is what I have found out.\n\nIt starts as episodic....every few months a flare up that most drs do not recognise or understand\nIt is hereditary \nIt affects both male and female\nIt is classed as an auto immune disorder \nSteroids, heavy steroids, particularly creams are beneficial during a break out\nAs you get older the symptoms become more widespread and constant, no more episodes, it is there all the time\nCan lead to blisters and abscesses\nHas I am my case lead to extensive nerve damage and subsequent pain\nThe creams no longer work for me..for the last four years I have had 4-5 monthly nerve blocks inserted under general anaesthetic.\nBiopsies and repair work are usually done at the same time.\nI have been married 31 years, sex is almost non existent these days.\nAs the lichens spreads, skin tears easier.

I have had terrible itching in the labia areas for months. Pretty much ecetughing has been ruled out however I do not have any white patches. Did anyone have this as well?\n\nThanks Are you asking if you can have LS without white patches? Bc if you are, then yes. I have LS and never got white patches. (Which can also appear around your mouth and nipples) My only symptoms were intense itching, burning, dryness, and fissures. Only way to know for sure if you have LS is to see a dermatologist. Good luck :) Me, I was diagnosed by punch-hole biopsy a month ago. No white patches but my doctor said I had a little thickening of the skin on my vulva. I had mostly intense burning and itching. No fissures that I could see or that were noted by my doctor. I saw my gynecologist btw, I did not see the derm because I thought I was having constant BV or a yeast infection. How did the dermatologist diagnose you? I got a diagnosis from one dr but want a second opinion before getting a biopsy. :( I just set up an appointment, explained my symptoms, he took one look with a light and that was it. No biopsy needed. I guess he knew what he was lookin at since he is a dermatologist. I suggest you see one since they specialize in skin. I would not waste your time with a general doctor Thank you! I will look into that. :)", "Anyone else losing/lost their libido from LS? I feel like ever since I have been using the clob (6 weeks) I have mentally and physically felt nothing down there. I have not really been turned on at all for the past few weeks, and the last time I tried to orgasm a few weeks back, it barely felt like anything. I do not know what is going on :( I could have literally posted this same thing. Mine has been weaker or will not happen lately. I am hoping it is just stress because I cannot find any fusing. I am sorry you are going through the same thing, it sucks. I am really hoping the steroids have not like messed with the nerve endings down there, making it numb Same issue here but I am almost 100% sure it is from anxiety That must be so stressful for you. I feel mine is just from sadness lol Yup, me too. I am terrified of looking down there or going anywhere near there. Just makes me lose all interest in anything sexual. Same here, but I was not feeling all that sexy with the itchiness either. Mine went into remission after 2 months of clob treatment (I am near end of month 3 now) and I have felt some stirrings, so not giving up hope. Steroids can weaken the skin but I am not aware of them doing anything to the nerves. Are you taking any other meds? Prozac, for instance, can make it really hard to orgasm. \n\nHopefully this is mental and therefore temporary. I know that the more I am worked up about my LS, the more that sexual contact makes me think about LS instead, which is not a turn-on. I am not on any other meds so not that, but I know the other night during sex I was thinking about everything else but sex. Just a distracted parent I guess Have you tried solo? When I am alone it is okay I have a long case.  Skin ulcer still unhealed after three months.  I do not think I can ever have sex again.  (Yes I use clob and tacrlimous).  Please do not feel unsexy, it can be so much worse. Same. Even thinking about sex is depressing.\n\nedit. I did not mean clinically depressed but who ever sent me the reddit care concern dm - bless you. You are a wonderful person. Absolutely to all this. When diagnosed, in my first flare, I was 1000% sure sex would never be enjoyable or even possible. My lover was not concerned. As my body &amp; mind healed a bit my libido returned. Soaking in the tub is a good time to moisturize &amp; check yourself for changes &amp; such. Coconut oil &amp; a smoke helps xo The steroid does not have an affect on libido. But it sure is hard to get turned on and feel sexy when you have LS. That is been true for me. Orgasms and being aroused in general are all mental things. Just wanted to add my 2 cents...I recently was diagnosed and just got my clob down finally to where I am feeling normalish and got my libido back....was able to have sex and it was the best I have ever had....really I never realized how much LS was holding me back making me feel pain it is amazing . There is hope! I have struggled for years! That is amazing! I am so so happy for you, that is such a big deal and must feel so freeing! That gives us all a bit of hope, Thankyou for sharing. Out of curiosity how do you all maintain intimate relationships with partners? Honestly I only got diagnosed 3 weeks ago so I am still trying to navigate. I still have sex but I use a lot of lube. I try to \u201cplan\u201d sex before my administration of clobetasol. If I am feeling too irritated I take care of my partner and that is it. I have not felt \u201csexy\u201d or into it in a while. I think it will improve once my symptoms are under control.", "Has the clob worked for people Can anyone make me feel like if I get diagnosed with LS (pretty sure I have) at my next appt, it will not be the end of my sex lofe. I am really depressed and I do not want to not be treated and have to live with it haha and discomfort for life Clob does not solve everything, but it helps and must be used as directed (usually 1-3 applications a week, after a shower to open the pores and help absorption) to work. Make sure to use lots of foreplay, plenty of good water based, sensitive skin lubricant, take your time and adjust the idea that sex might look different sometimes. Penetrative sex is not everything and does not need to be an every day thing. Spice things up! Does it relieve symptoms of itch It does. Soak baths also help. Warm water, not too hot. Add a little hydrogen peroxide and baking soda (just a splash of each) and sit for about 15-30 minutes. Good luck! Finding a diagnosis is tricky, but some OBGYNs and dermatologists can diagnose you visually depending on the severity or with a biopsy. I have had LS for over 12 years and I have been using clobestosal and estrace cream it definitely helps. It is the one of the first line of defense against it. But like that other person said biopsy will be the best option to really know. Good luck in your journey. Have you noticed any atrophy? Yes I have half of them are gone. Do you manage to have sex still Yes I used Clob for around a year but stopped and switched to CBD oil and i feel less itchy and my skin is less fragile and thin. I know my move is risky but right now i am just happy that i can have sex with my partner again. There is a lot of different opinions on Clob in the medical industry and i therefore trust my own body more than different doctors saying different things. I get checkups every half a year by a doctor to check that i have not developed cancer.", "Lichen on anus? Hi everyone, I already have lichen on my vaginal area but lately my anus had been feeling dry so I checked it out and I think I found a white patch on it and the skin around it looks discolored like grayish. Is this possible?\nAlso, what kind of doctor would I even go see for lichen on the butt? Yes, it is possible. This is where my LS started. My gyno treats my LS. Thank you I have it on my vagina, all the way down a little past my anus. Not very fun lol What kind of doctor do you see? \nAlso do you use the same treatment Yep quite common. At this point I would say mine is actually worse on my butt than my vulva.\n\nSame treatment, so if you are on a steroid just put it there too. You do not need to see a new doctor. \n\nKeep in mind that this can put you at risk for anal fissures, so be gentle with your poor booty. If you can get a bidet attachment (like $30 on amazon), it really helps. Thank you! Same  My PCP diagnosed me and prescribed me Clobetasol 0.05% to use over the entire area. I recently saw a dermatologist for something unrelated and asked for a second opinion, and to inquire if the steroid cream was the best option. He suggested I could try Tacrolimus ointment if I was concerned about steroid side effects. Would not you know, right before I got it filled, began the worst flare up of my life that has lasted almost 3 weeks now, so I honestly do not have a good idea of what is or is not working at the moment, unfortunately :/ I am sorry to hear that! Anyone has concerns about how to put it? As I understood steroids /clob should be put only on affected skin but with this and lesions becoming bigger I worry about spreading clob too wide.. Did your doc say anything about that? My doctor told me only on affected skin and to put a very thin amount on. I did not listen and a part of my labia minora got so thin it is just not even there anymore!", "Depressed by dilators Looking for some reassurance/words of wisdom from other people who have successfully used dilators. I am 2 months into the steroid treatment and everything seemed to be looking much better, to the point where the doc cannot see any signs of active LS, but I am still struggling with the larger sizes at this point. (The raw feeling and redness around the opening of my vulva seems not to be going even though all the pale patches have.) The second largest burns a little, and the biggest is just impossible. Can anyone shed some light on what their experience was like? Sex feels impossible to me at the moment, and it is depressing me as it never used to be something I had a problem with. Hi there. I have had incredible success with dilators. I went over 10 years suffering from LS symptoms before getting a diagnosis. Early on, my main symptoms were pain with sex. This progressed to tearing with sex, fissures, stinging, burning, itching, fusing/architectural changes, discoloration, etc. Not only is my LS in complete remission (no active signs of LS + symptom-free), I am finally able to have pleasurable, non-painful penis in vagina sex. No more pain, no more burning, no more stinging, no more tearing and discomfort.\n\nI worked with dilators during two distinct phases of my journey. Phase 1 was quite early in my journey - shortly after being diagnosed with LS. I have a few blog posts on dilators, which you can browse through at ( but definitely check out this piece on why I initially stepped away from dilators and when you may need to take a break with them here: (\n\nI have not made any content about phase 2 yet, but I will be blogging about this, and I have multiple videos on my YouTube channel (check it out here: ( ) planned on phase 2, my success, how to use them + the protocol that worked for me, pelvic floor physio, etc.\n\nBriefly, though, phase 2 which latest maybe 4ish months was successful and brought me to a place where I can now have pain-free sex.  I followed the dilator protocol by Dr. Heather Jeffcoat in her book 'Painfree Sex' (you can order online). Later on, I teamed up with a pelvic floor physiotherapist to help with the transition from dilators to penetrative sex who actually herself has LS. Further, throughout my entire journey, I worked with a sex therapist who REALLY helped with the mental component of painful sex (lots of content planned around sex therapy and the lessons I learned there as well).\n\nThere is definitely hope, I have seen it with many folks with varying levels of LS who have found success. It can, however, take time. It is important not to rush the process. You can completely come back from this. When I was diagnosed, I thought I would never have sex again that is how bad the pain was, and now I have sex on average 2-4 x a week, no pain, no flares, no issues.\n\nSome questions: is your LS in remission? How are you treating? Do you have symptoms in general or literally only with the dilators? How long have you been using them for? What protocol are you using? How long have you been using the biggest dilator? Did the other dilators burn initially? Hi,\n\nThanks for this! You do seem to be the font of all knowledge with LS, I should have known you would have a response! I guess I am just being impatient. I suspect I have had LS for about 5 or 6 years, but I had no symptoms other than redness and on-and-off itching for most of that time, so it was not picked up. Things only really got worse this summer, after I got the second covid vaccine. To answer your questions in order: 1) I am not sure, I certainly have no visible white patches and my GP insists things look normal, but as far as I can see things still look red around the vaginal opening. 2) I did a month of daily clobetasol, a week of daily mometasone, and am now doing every other day mometasone. I am 2 months into treatment. 3) For the most part, everything feels pretty calm most of the time, though now I am sore and inflamed again after trying that larger dilator. 4) I have only started using them recently, the first three do not give me any issues at all and never have, and in the past I have been fine with the second-largest one, too, which is why I figured I would attempt the next size!\n\nThanks! That blog post about stepping back is kind of what I was hoping to read, thank you Gotcha OK, thanks for clarifying. TBH two months in is still pretty early in terms of LS really settling down, the skin healing, and for it to go into remission. That does not mean you cannot use dilators, but it may contribute to why the current dilator is not going over well. Since the first three dilators are OK for you, you could always continue with those if you want if they cause no reaction. Or, you may opt to give your vulva another month or two to really just let the steroids work and the skin repair. If you do continue, know that most pelvic floor physiotherapist have a rule about pain and dilators. If your use of dilators results in pain between level 1-3, you can continue (gently and mindfully, of course. If it is a four or higher, remove the dilator and continue with the next smallest dilator. Aw, great! I am glad to hear it! It was easier for me to link it than to type that all out plus my initial comment, lol! Thank you! According to that rule, it is only the largest I should be avoiding for now. I might wait for another month of treatment, though, and see where that gets me.", "26M Unusual growth on penis head along with red spots. Is it Lichen Sclerosus?  (\n\nI have had it for about 6 months and did not look into treatment because I thought it was just an enlarged vein or something (stupid I know). I believe it also disappeared for a little while and came back, unless it was just really unnoticeable. What prompted me to ask for help was that I was having sex yesterday and when I looked at my penis afterwards this growth was very inflamed and I freaked out (was not painful though). Although I have not had any symptoms directly related the growth, I have had some slight ED issues (I believe this is psychological and unrelated as it has happened before) and 1-2 episodes of minor ball ache. I only noticed the red dots after sex but it is possible they could have been there for a while.\n\nOther medications I am taking: Finasteride, Methylphenidate\n\nGoing to see a doctor soon but just wanted some piece of mind. I will also test for STIs/STDs.\n\nPossibilities based on my research: Lichen Sclerosus , STI/STD, Mondors disease, penile cancer?\n\nThoughts? Doesnt look like LS or BXO to me. More like a vein. But get it seen I do not *think* LS patches are usually raised like that. Mondor's disease apparently affects the dorsum of the penis; is the main vein on the top of your penis thickened or hardened? I do not know of any STIs that present like that, but I do not know very much about those. Penile cancer is really rare, and even if it is that, you have probably caught it early and treatment would be relatively easy. If it were LS, it would likely be very treatable, and Mondor's disease can even go away on its own. Or it may even be a vein enlarged within the spectrum of normal. You are right to get it checked out, but I do not think you need to worry too much in the mean time. It does not look too scary and of the many things it could be, they are very treatable. \n\nBy the way, testicular pain and erectile problems are listed as side effects of finasteride. If they started or worsened after you started taking it, you might want to talk to your doctor about switching to something else.", "Goes LS under this when it comes to covid vaccine and priority groups?  Sorry, I am confused. Are you wondering if you should be able to move to the front of the line for a vaccine? Or are you wondering if maybe you should avoid the vaccine? It does not put you in a priority group. This refers more to people getting treatment for cancers, or organ transplant recipients. Also, if you are using clobetasol, that does not count as a strong enough steroid- they are referring more to regular oral steroids (I.e., prednisone, etc.)\n\nThis is all per 2 of my doctors and the nurse who gave me my vaccines. Hope that helps. just fyi I had both doses of moderna vax with no effect on my LS just fyi I had both doses of moderna vax with no effect on my LS A topical steroid probably will not count. The concern is more with systemic immunosuppression Thank you&lt;3 Hey! I have figured it out. Steroid does not count. And people have taken the vaccine without any effects on LS. Hopefully I will get the vaccine soon\ud83d\ude4f Good. I received the vaccine with no side effects and no change in my LS.", "(NSFW) is this LS/LP? Dermatologist said it is, been on clobetasol for almost 3 months, no more itching but these white lumps keep multiplying and further into my vagina. My next appointment is in 2 weeks, I will ask for a biopsy, but feeling anxious and thought to ask here  Although it is tough to tell from a picture, I do not think this is LS or LP. Both of those generally cause white spots that are relatively flat, not raised bumps like you have. Also LS/LP does not affect the actual vaginal canal, only the outside. This looks more like genital warts (HPV) to me. Best of luck with your appointment. Not LS. Can you get in sooner? I think you want an STI screen ASAP.  That is not a dermatologist job, that is for planned parenthood or your obgyn. Thanks for your response. I originally saw my gynecologist for it, she said she thought it was HPV warts. She did a swab for herpes but it was negative. I live in France so for HPV warts you have to go through a dermatologist for treatment (who are also VD specialists). I had previously seen a dermatologist a few months earlier for a fleshy growth on the outside of the vulva / front part of the vagina. I was told it was a skin tag, and they froze it off. Then I saw a different dermatologist for these white patches / bumps, and she said it is not HPV warts, it is not anything sexual, it is LS. She said she could see patches where I had been scratching which were not where the bumps are, more like the inside of my labia. I did not know about LS and how to diagnose it at the time so I did not think to ask for a biopsy. A few weeks later I saw my gynecologist for a Pap smear, and she told me she did not think it was LS and that I should ask for confirmation when I go back in April to the dermatologist. Unfortunately she is booked up until my appointment on the 12th. \n\nI did have an STI panel done in 2019, which was all negative, before getting into a monogamous relationship with my boyfriend 2 months later, who has no clinical signs and claims he did a test after his ex... but if not HPV warts, is there another STI you think it could be ? \n\nThanks for your help :) That is what my gynecologist thought before she sent me to the dermatologist ! I will be sure to press for the biopsy so that I can be sure. Being on clobetasol would not help things if it is HPV... Yes, definitely push for that biopsy! If it is HPV, clobetasol might actually make things worse because it reduces activation of the immune system in the area where it is applied. Not a pro by any means but I have looked at a lot of pictures of LS and I have not seen anything like this whatsoever. Definitely not LS. Good luck! ):", "Question about Taro-Clobetasol Hi everyone! So here is my (28 F) backgound. Feel free to skip it to the questions part. I always thought my vulva was normal. Sure, I would seen porn, and pictures, and yes the inner labia  always looked a bit \"fuller\" than mine but I have always been told that \"every vulva's different and beautiful\" so I did not really think much of it. I would never been to the gynaecologist.\n\nUntil I decided to get an IUD. So, I went in, ready to do some yoga breathing, cramp a bit, and go on my merry way.\n\nHe took one look at my vagina and went \"hum, your labia minora is fused to your labia majora.\" \n\nAnd I was just *shocked* He showed me where they are fused, but I just cannot fathom how it would look. It is just *skin*.\n\nThen he showed me a (minor) tear in my perineum and, yeah I knew about that, but in terms of symptoms, I would sometimes get a little itchy and I get tears easily, but I just assumed was not lubricated enough, or that it was the condom's fault, etc.\n\nHe also showed me spots that are \"not normal skin\". But now I look in the mirror and just cannot see what spots he was referring to... it just looks all \"normal\" to me lol. Maybe it is a little whitish?\n\nAnd that is my problem: he prescribed the taro-clobetasol 0.05% to put on twice daily for 2 weeks and twice weekly for 3 months after that and to come back in 4 months (and glaxal base cream to put everyday). But... \n\nAnd here is the question part:\n\nWhere does it go? Everywhere? On the \"spots\"? I put it everywhere on my vulva yesterday and this morning, and he said it is sting but it does not. Am I lucky or is it just not working?\n\nHe said it could go back to normal. How likely is that? I am 28 and I do not remember my vagina ever looking different. That is unlikely, is not it? \n\nDid you guys gets get good results from that ointment? \n\nThanks a lot for any help! The cream has never stung for me. I have mild symptoms though.\n\nMy white area was located around the clit hood and after using clobetasol its going to pack to pink and the fusion has recovered. I do not think the labia can unfuse though. I have some minor structural change on my right labia but my gyne did not say that would return to normal. Thanks for sharing your experience! Do you know how long you would had the white area for? 7 months before I got treatment. I am just over a year now of first noticing the change. Ahh, I see! I never noticed any change so I think I have either had it since I was a child (I remember my mom saying I had some lesions on my labia when I \"ate citrus\", yet she never brought me to the doctor, she would just rub some cream on) or very soon into adulthood so I really do not see think the cream will repair anything for me... I am glad that I will get regular appointments from now on to monitor the situation though :) Curious if you are feeling better? Have you done a biopsy?", "Lichensclerosus in visible areas - any tips on covering it up? Hi everyone,\n\nThis is my first post here so sorry if I have not formatted correctly.\n\nI was diagnosed with lichensclerosus when I was about 11. I am very fortunate that I have not got it on my genitals and it has never been a major issue for me so far. It used to be super thick, white and almost scaley but I was given steroid cream and moisturiser and it cleared up massively and I have not had any issues other than occasional itchiness since I was about 14.\n\nHowever, there is still discolouring there and people often think it is a bruise or I have something wrong with me when I go swimming or if they see me in underwear (It is on my groin/thigh area, sort of under my underwear line so very visible). Obviously, it is not fun to explain no it is not a bruise, no you cannot catch it and explain it to them. I am going on a girl's  holiday this summer and I am starting to worry about people seeing me in a swimming costume and having to explain it! My close friends know I have a skin issue but that is all they know.\n\nWhen I was younger I was given a special waterproof foundation and setting powder to cover the area up for when I went swimming or on sleepovers. I think it was with the British skin foundation through the nhs but as I was young I cannot remember and sadly my mum is no longer around to ask how we got that. I am body confident in everything except the LS and I am hoping some people here could give me some advice.\n\nDoes anyone else here have lichensclerosus in a visible place and have any tips for covering it up? And any advice for talking to people about having LS too?\n\nThank you! I do not know about makeup, and it seems like anything like that might upset the skin and potentially make things worse! Hate to upset the apple cart - if your skin is doing ok, do not smother it!\n\nMy shortcut is \u201cIt is kind of like mild psoriasis\u201d (or eczema). It is autoimmune. It affects the skin. It does not look awesome. It is completely not contagious, not due to bad hygiene, and nobody\u2019s fault, and anybody that gives someone crap about psoriasis is a jerk. Everybody seems to kind of know that about psoriasis. You just have something a lot like it in an uncomfortable place and wish it would f*** right off, but it does not, so here we are. Autoimmune, not contagious, no longer anybody\u2019s business. \n\nDoes mean that now people are picturing psoriasis on the vulva and going OMGGGGG... but if the patches are visible, guess that clears it up for them. Especially since yours are not actually genital. \n\nIt is not fair, but from an old person here, it just is not worth it it to hide it. Good friends are not going to give a rip, dudes who get scared off are no good for a good relationship, anybody who has a problem after understanding it is not contagious is a crappy ex-friend. That frees you up to go swimming and have fun with your friends without having to worry about what anybody thinks, and unless the whole group is built on something super shallow, that attractive confidence far outweighs a stupid skin condition. I think, anyway. \n\nI hope you find a way to be comfortable and enjoy your vacation one way or another. And, f***  LS!", "Just wanted to share my story... Mabye you find some of the story irrelevant of LS, but I also need to share my frustrations...\n\nI was diagnosed with LS by a skin-specialist in summer 2016 after my gynecologist did not know what to do with me. The diagnose was based on the symptoms and the effect of the treatment - so no biopsy. \n\nI was also diagnosed with overactive bladder by specialists in 2016. Mostly because of the itch, pain and pee urge in my bladder.\n\nI was also diagnosed with herpes genitalis shortly after I started treatment for LS, because the treatmet triggered it. And it was very extreme... The first outbreak lasted for over a month, and the following outbreaks had only 14 days beetween each outbreak... So for 2-3 years I have been very plaqued by herpes, but this year I only had a couple of small herpes outbreaks and no longer need medical treatment for it. \n\nFor 1 1/2 year I was not able to have sexual intercourse with my partner because of the pain, but after a good proces with excercises from a fysio, I slowly became able to be with my partner again. \n\nI still often experience itch and pain in vulva, vagina, bladder, etc. The pain/itch 'under the skin' was/is the worst.\n\nI have continuously been wondering why I had these symptoms when it was a skin-disease. \n\nFriday I was finally examined by a very competent Vulva-specialist, and she concluded that I suffer from Vulvodynia... so that pretty much explains why the treatment for LS did not work very well and also explaims the pain/itch 'under the skin'.\n\nI have been mistreatet for LS in over 4 years... the vulva specialist did not even have to take a biopshy to conclude that I suffer from Vulvodynia and not LS. When I was teenager I also thought that I suffered from Vulvodynia, but no doctor would confirm that... So I was right, after all... \nIf i was not mistreated for LS I probably would have been without all the trouble with herpes.. and the medication for herpes and overactive bladder... etc...\n\nI will complain about the misdiagnosis...\n\nSo.. if you have just a little doubt about your LS diagnosis I hope you will manage to seek other specialist a lot faster than I did.", "Feeling hopeful I have had off and on but fairly consistent irritation for a long time now. I am not even sure how long, but the more I think about it, the farther back I can remember what seems like it was a flare up.\n\nI am never quick to address things with doctors after having a few who had the invalidating attitude of \"you are young and therefore healthy and fine\". \n\nI switched to all cotton underwear and I tried to wear mostly dresses or looser fitting pants when possible. As time went on, it started getting worse. I considered it could be eczema (I have elsewhere) or allergies (moved in with a cat) but medicine was not resolving the persistent tears in the skin. It would sometimes calm down a little but seemed connected to my menstrual cycle and would always come back.\n\nThe doctor suggested trying sitz baths and a cream in case of yeast infection. The sitz irritated me more and the cream did not help. \n\nDuring my follow up appointment, the doctor prescribed mometasone once daily. I have been using it for a 5 days and have noticeable improvement already! I still have some itching, but for the first time in months, I have not been woken up itching and slept through the night.\n\nI have not had a biopsy but the doctor is confident in the diagnosis. I have spent a lot of the week worrying about worst case LS scenarios - future relationships, steroid side effects (acne already) prognosis, remission etc. Today, my brain has given me an anxiety break, and on top of getting proper sleep, I feel grateful.  At least to know what is going on and have medication, I feel hopeful There is less side effects to worry about with a topical steroid than an oral steroid, so you may not notice anything! As long as you keep on top of your treatment you will find much relief from the steroid! Is it a cream or an ointment? Sometimes people notice irritation from creams, so if that happens try the ointment version to see if that helps. And of course we are here for you! Very happy to know you are feeling better already :) I have started with a cream that I am to use 1/day for a month, then twice a week for 8 week. So far no issues with the cream, but I have heard that ointment is preferred, so I will bring that up if I have any irritation, or at next follow-up.  I have also been applying Vaseline whenever I notice any itch. \n\nThe steroid skin thinning worries me a bit, as I am already concerned about tearing/fusing (though I know that does not happen for everyone). I am sure the panicky moments will lessen as I adjust. \n\nBut otherwise it is like magic. I am just so glad I do not have to leave the room or wake up every hour to try not to scratch while \"gently\" itching.\n\n&gt;There is less side effects to worry about with a topical steroid than an oral steroid, so you may not notice anything! \n\n Thank you for this reassurance", "Self care (and shaving?) I am in need of some self care treatment.\n\nI am not diagnosed officially, but my (old) gynecologist suggested I have lichen sclerosus, and I do not doubt one bit that I do. I am in the process of changing gynecologists, and I will be seeing a new one 3/31. Until then, I am in some serious need of self care. Right now, I am just showering daily and using Aquaphor.\n\nAlso, does pain feel worse/more symptoms occur shaving or not shaving for all of you? (Shaving pubic hair) I would just be careful doing that. If the skin is fragile it can cause some tearing or splits. I would personally leave the area alone. What you can do is put A&amp;D ointment instead. Make sure to wear just cotton underwear. Hi there, \n\nFor shaving it can cause irritation for some people, so some of us prefer trimming to a non prickly level to minimize both hair and shaving irritations. Since both the hair and shaving can be irritating, some also opt for laser removal, but that is an investment since it is not covered by insurance. All in all, you just have to find what works for you, if shaving does not make you worse then it is probably okay. Just make sure to use a clean/new razor each time and use a sensitive skin shaving cream. I shave about once a week, maybe more, because that is what feels best for me until I can decide on if I want permanent removal, which I probably will do. \n\nSelf care: \nThere is a lot that I do, I was just diagnosed this year so I have not gotten it under control yet, so this is what helps me. \n\n1. Baths! God I love my baths Idk where I would be without them. Add borax, Epsom salt, coconut oil, baking soda and it is just relief heaven. \n\n2. If you read borax and thought wtf, it is ok I did too when I first read about it but it works. It helps with itching and even prevents/reverses fusing and other damage. Start with 2 tbsp in a standard tub and work your way up, i use about a cup now. If you have a sitz bath, you would use less so look that up. Some people also use a cotton ball method so they do not have to sit in a bath, you could do this while laying in bed. But it does MIRACLES for some people, it is crazy. \n\n3. You need a good moisturizer/topical. Aquaphor is good, but it does contain glycerin and it is ingredient list isnt ideal, I prefer coconut oil, as it is also more moisturizing. V magic (Amazon) is AMAZING, emuaid/emu oil is also good (but not cruelty free), some people like Perrins but it burned me, aloe is also okay, vitamin e oil. There is lots out there to try until you find your fav! \n3. Intercourse related: idk if you have PIV, but in case that is something you would like, then things that help with that are dilators to prevent narrowing (unless your sexually active relatively consistently, bc that works too), ice or bath after, use lots of lube (uber lube, coconut oil, and slippery stuff seem to be the top choices for quality and low irritation). For me, the Carlson vitamin e suppositories were life changing! They really really really help with sex, could not do it without them and now it is almost painless and my other symptoms improved... That just shows how much the products you use can help! \n\n4. Cannabis. Do not know where you are located but If you are in the US, then CBD is legal which helps so many of us! You can ingest it or use it as a topical oil, lube, or suppository. The brand foria is recommended a lot. It did not do much for me, but some people say it is life changing. I found relief with a homemade THC coconut oil my bf made me though, so if you are in a legal state you can actually buy THC lube which is even more effective for pain relief, both sexual and generally. \n\nFeel free to message me if you need any guidance, I have pretty much got a PhD in LS at this point... good luck! Thank you so so much!!! Thank you! I think it is better to leave the hair alone. I grew up before that was considered gross or whatever. Shaving causes problems and I do not need problems. \n\nTrimming shorter seems a good balance - helps with periods and in hot weather, too. But shaving always leads to ingrown hair and pain and itching. Leaving it alone, or simply trimming it? Nicely cushioned and very functional. Natural protection against irritating clothes. I do not shave because of irritation - at best, I trim. I do not know if you menstruate or not, but I find using a menstrual cup has been a huge help for my LS during periods. Tampons were very uncomfortable for me and pads *really* irritated everything down there. My menstrual cup is much more comfortable internally and I am spared the mess, irritation, and anxiety about leakage that comes with pads. Just a thought! For some reason I never quite got a hold of the menstrual cup, but this is my sign to start trying it again lol. Thank you! Right. I do not find hair gross at all, I never understood how people did as long as showering happens, but to each their own.\n\nThank you! Your welcome It is a bit of a learning curve so completely understandable! I started off with the Diva Cup but struggled with removing it (curse the combo of short thumbs, a high cervix, and being inflexible lol). I found the Flex Cup which has a loop you can use to pull down and break the seal and it was a game changer. Been using it for about a year and will not look back. Good luck to you if you give it another shot! :) If you cannot, period panties work well too. I shave practically every day, but I have a more mild case. When I have flare ups I use over the counter hydrocortisone cream till I see my Dr (his recommendation), it helps with the itching for me.", "Is LS causing pain during sex? A year ago I was *finally* diagnosed with Lichen sclerosus, after a very long battle with testing and my poor OBGYN being clueless as to what was going on with me. I have been on a Betamethasone that I use every night, which has given me wonderful results and I can finally lead a normal life again!\n\nThe problem is after sex I am very sore and 'raw' around my vaginal opening for 24-48 hours after. We never have rough sex, my husband is extremely gentle (sometime too gentle! Haha) and he has ridden this roller coaster of my Lichen battle for years now without any complaints!\n\nIt almost feels like there are tiny lacerations. Urinating and wiping make me hold my breath and cringe. We always use Lush Water lube and it does not seem to matter what position we do, I always end up in pain after we are done, never during. Unless I am just in the moment and I do not notice it until we are done.\n\nHubby does not know it is every time that this happens, only that we cannot have sex for too long. If we have sex for more then 15-20 minutes (actual intercourse, foreplay is not an issue) I will be in unbearable pain for days and have literally cried while peeing before. \n\nI LOVE having sex with my hubby! He is an amazing, compassionate and giving lover, but to have this hanging over me makes it hard to do more than once every other week. Which as you can imagine has put a strain on our sexual relationship.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! The title should say AFTER sex, not during. Sorry about that! Yes, unfortunately.  It is very likely that your discomfort following sex is due to the LS.  I have the same problem.  I have found some relief in hubby wearing a lubricated condom instead of going bare and to limiting how frequently we have intercourse.  It is not an ideal solution, but it gives us the chance to continue having intercourse instead of eliminating it from our relationship altogether. \ud83d\ude2b\n\nDamn this disease! We have always had a great sexual relationship and to have this ruining everything just sucks. I feel like if I talk to him too much about my discomfort after sex he wont be able to happily have sex knowing I will be in pain after. He is a very sensitive guy and I know he would put himself through the suffering of no sex to save me from the after effects. I would recommend talking to him about it to see what options you both can come up with.  Maybe a stronger lubricant would work, or try lubricated condoms.  You could also put aloe on the area immediately following sex (if you do not have the plants, look for the most natural product possible, not just any aloe with additives).  There is some research backing for aloe being effective, so that is why I recommend that specifically, but if you have something else that helps when not specifically medicating, you could try that, as well.  \n\n\n\nAnd damn this disease, indeed! Thank you! I have some aloe, I will have to check but I think it is just plain aloe. \n\nAny recommendations for a stronger lube? I actually do not have a lot of experience in that realm other than to say that a water-based lube is not as thick as other types.  Something that is not water-based may be a better option, but some research may be in order. hey! i went through this too. it was actually how i was diagnosed the \\*second time\\*. (just wrote a piece about it - ( \n\nfor me, using the cream eventually led mine to clear up so it is not a problem anymore, but agree w other commenters - lube definitely helped me. i just used the cheap stuff that came w a sex toy, but imagine it is best to just test out one and then try another if it does not help. keeping up communication is key, though. and you could always use it as an excuse to make your sex life a bit more interesting - try different positions, try going super slow (which might hurt less), etc. good luck!! It definitely probably is. I get that way at times too. When I was diagnosed, my OB told me that during sex, it is likely that micro-tears occur during intercourse that LS wreaks havoc on. I wish I had some advice to give that is not just solidarity. Same with my foreskin. Feels like lots of papercuts. Very painful. Thank you. I hate this disease with every fiber of my being. I feel like there should be something, anything, that works better then the steroid ointments. \ud83d\ude23 That sounds terrible and at the same time very similar to what I am going though. Super TMI but I have found that having my partner pull out makes a huge difference. I still experience some discomfort, but it helps a lot. I also take showers or a bath after, because the hot water always makes me feel better. You are not alone!", "Searching for answers I am a 39 year old male with a lifelong history of compulsively scratching at my groin, specifically the area beneath the scrotum and to the sides of it, near the legs.  To begin, I do not know if I have lichen sclerosus, but I do have an appointment with a dermatologist this Tuesday.\n\nAbout four years ago, my habit of scratching at my groin started to yield skin flakes on my fingers from the left side of the perineum.  This had never happened before.  At first I enjoyed it, but then became worried that I might be doing damage to myself.  The area seemed irritated, grayish.  Sometimes it seemed covered with light snow that I could rub off of me.  Sometimes it actively flaked like if I had a sunburn, and I could peel off the skin.  When I would shower, the flakes would go away after washing, but would be back usually that evening.\n\nI decided to try to address the itch, and bought an antifungal spray.  The spray made it worse, turning the area red.  It looked like I would burned myself with the spray, but I kept doing it because I thought if I got rid of the fungus, it would not itch anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, now I know there probably is not a fungus -- the itch did not go away.  After I finished with the antifungal spray, there was what looked like a big flakey burn mark on my groin underneath my scrotum, more like psoriasis than the grayish flakey thing that was there before.  I started to apply various creams and moisturizers for the next two years.  They would help sometimes, but the area would not stop flaking.  Eventually, a much smaller area on the other side of my groin that I also used to compulsively scratch started to flake, though never got so bad as the area I treated with the antifungal spray.\n\nI decided to mentally train myself to stop compulsively scratching myself, even though it itched and has itched for my entire life.  It worked -- I stopped scratching, but the flaking still happened.  The area where I would applied the antifungal spray flaked almost every single day, but the other area that had started flaking only flaked once every week or two.\n\nI do not know why I did not see a doctor about it -- I guess because it was an injury I would seemed to cause myself from scratching so much, and so I did not think it would cause any other problems.  I went about two years going through all the various creams.  Then, in June 2019, I stopped ignoring it and looked it up on Google.  I started putting olive oil on it in the morning after reading about lichen sclerosus, since that is what it looked the most like compared to all the other skin conditions I looked up (the area I would treated with antifungal spray also sometimes resembled inverse psoriasis).\n\nMiraculously, the patch I would treated with antifungal spray stopped reddening and looking like psoriasis occasionally, and it would go a few days without flaking, instead of flaking every day.  The smaller area that I would never treated with antifungal spray simply stopped flaking entirely.  I then started applying olive oil in the morning and at night before I went to bed.  The flaking stopped entirely.  I did this for a month, and at the end of the month the area looked mostly normal.  The skin had lightened after years of flaking and irritation, but the skin was so astoundingly normal-looking otherwise (except seeming somewhat thinner than the surrounding skin) that I thought I would successfully treated it.\n\nI started checking my groin area every week.  The flaking went away and did not come back for 11 months, without any sort of treatment.  It still itches sometimes, but I do not compulsively scratch it anymore.\n\nThis past May, during a very stressful time, there was some flaking from the area that I would treated with antifungal spray.  I put olive oil on it for a few days, and the flaking went away.  There was also some very unusual flaking near the tip of my penis that May, along with a few raised bumps that I thought were the beginning of warts, all of which disappeared within two weeks.\n\nSo, since May, there is been one other incident when the area I would treated with antifungal medicine started flaking, but also two incidents when the area surrounding my anus turned entirely red and was irritated, but did not flake.  The anus rash went away pretty quickly both times, but I started putting olive oil all over the area as a precaution.\n\nUnfortunately, next to the patch that I would treated with antifungal medicine, on Sept 30th I noticed a growth with a scabbed center toward my leg.  I tried to pop it, put warm compresses on it, put olive oil on it, but it is been the same for a month and a half now.  Yesterday I saw a doctor about it.  She told me I have to go to a dermatologist, who is probably going to have to biopsy it.  Her guess is a cyst in a hair follicle, but from pictures online an epidermoid cyst, a pseudocancer called keratoacanthoma, and a skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma are sometimes indistinguishable by sight alone.  Yesterday, bizarrely, also, an inch-long line of pigment emerged on my leg next to the lesion, so the area is changing.\n\nLuckily, my appointment is this Tuesday.  I am also going to tell the doctor about the problems I have had with the flaking areas -- I seriously did not think it was anything to see a doctor about, since I seemed to cause it by scratching the area so much.  But, because the lesion emerged next to the area that looks like lichen sclerosus, I am very worried it is cancer, and after a ton of internet searching that the irritated patches were Bowens disease all along, though objectively I do not think something like Bowen's disease would simply disappear with the application of olive oil, like I have read it helps lichen sclerosus.\n\nI am posting here for basically any information and guidance anyone can give me.  This time around in my searching I read that lichen sclerosus can sometimes turn into or encourage cancer, which I did not read the first time I was looking up information.  Has anyone had experience of this?  The perineum groin area seems like an unusual place for lichen sclerosus in a male, but I did used to scratch the area religiously, sometimes till I scratched into the skin and bled.  The area's never bled by itself though.\n\nThank you for any responses.  I am sure the dermatologist is going to be able to answer my questions, but if this sounds like anything anyone on here has gone through, I would love to hear from you. Hope you get the answers you are looking for! Do keep us posted. I am also trying to get a diagnosis. I had skin flaking too but it went away after I applied antifungal cream. The hydrocortisone must have helped. But i still have itching at random times during the day. I guess you have seen your derm now, so I hope it was helpful. What you describe sounds a lot like psoriasis to me, with all the redness, itching, and flaking, \"snowy\" patches, plus improvement after moisturizing. Also maybe you were allergic to the antifungal? \n\nI have psoriasis and today I got a probable diagnosis of LS. I heard they often occur together. If you do have psoriasis, you should check out r/psoriasis. It is a very active and supportive sub. Hi.  Yes, I did see the dermatologist.  He diagnosed it as lichen simplex cronicus, basically the best case scenario when it comes to potential for developing into malignant harm.  He said the lesion was probably from a trauma, and has actually shrunk in size since I saw him.  I am supposed to see him again in a month after applying an ointment for a few weeks -- desonide, specifically.  I am curious to see if it works better than olive oil.  It does not stop the itching, I can say that at the moment, but I do not think anything really does. Glad you got an answer. Hopefully the ointment will help the skin to heal. Have you tried taking oral antihistamines to help with the itch until then? I also wonder about sitz baths, maybe with colloidal oatmeal. I did not see them recommended for lichen simplex chronicus specifically, but I know that they can help with a lot of other itchy conditions.", "Emuil? I have seen, never used it..OPINIOBA? My Dr. And Gynecologist are not familiar....only familiar with lt?", "How much does vulvar itching affect your daily life? I am asking to you all suffering from this plague... Are you troubled in your daily activities? My itching is only at like 4.m so I cannot sleep!! I have completely changed my diet and used turmeric and coconut oil on the area and it is been a huge life savor!! i only really get itchy at night so it does not affect me during the day thank god Before using Clobetasol, I never wanted to leave home. I cried every night instead of sleeping bc I was up scratching so much I bled. My anxiety got worse and I was on 3 different meds for it. \n\nNow I forget that I have LS. I only get flare ups when the weather changes or I sweat too much at night and my underwear gets too wet. It really depends. When I am flaring, sometimes I literally cannot fall asleep. Some nights, I will wake up and realize that I have been itching in my sleep. Some days I will not be able to sit in my office chair because it is physically painful.\n\nSome days though, I pretty much forget that my LS exists! Underwear is a huge trigger as is inconsistent steroid use. \n\nUnfortunately I am in a flare up right now but that is because....inconsistent steroid use. You would think I would learn my lesson lol. Could you explain more? How do you use the timers and coconut oil? What is your ratios? Any help would be appreciated. I literally put like a tablespoon of turmeric into a little container and then mix it with like 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and apply in the morning after my shower, so it absorbs into my skin. A little goes a long way as it is super oily and will stain everything. I put some on at bedtime too What were your symptoms of lichen before diagnosis? Any atrophy", "Hey everyone. Im new to this group and been having some sypmtoms that seem like they could be linchen sclerosus. I have an appointment with my doctor, does this look like lichen?  Your penis seems fine, circ scar and colouring are fine. Can you please mark this as nsfw?\n\nCheers bud and good luck Thanks for the reply Goodluck in your journey aswell. It looks to me like the skin adjascent to your glans has less pigment than the skin just beyond it.  Has your pigment changed or do you have any other symptoms that could be LS related? I have always had the slightly white pigment I bieleve. I have just had unexplained burning pain off and on around my penis. I do not know if it could be a pelvic floor issue or not. I use to masturbate and get friction burn and sometimes I wonder if that could cause LS See what the doctor thinks, keep a close eye on the pigment and keep photos from various angles for comparison if you feel like it will help.  \n\nIts probably also a good idea to get familiar with all the symptoms of LS so you can watch out for them.  I didnt realize itchy anus could be caused by LS until I had done quite a bit of reading after my diagnosis.  I guess the symptoms of anal involvement dont get talked about as much.  My pigment loss was only on my penis, but I had the itchy anus for years before the other LS symptoms started on my penis.  I suspected the itchy anus was due to intestinal parasites, especially since it happened more at night, but tests for parasites continually came back negative.", "Nobody takes me seriously So 21F here. I have had type 1 diabetes for going on 9 years now, and I have had a multitude of complications with it. \n\nAbout 4 years ago, I started seeing signs of LS. Constant, non-stop DEEP itching, thinning skin, painful sex, and awful vulvar fissures and tearing. Worse than I have ever seen on any LS images. And because of the diabetes, they would take forever to heal. I would sit on the toilet and tear. I felt like I was splitting open all the time, forget about sex. My blood sugars were not where they should have been, due to stress, diabulimia, and family issues. Doctors did not take me seriously, and because of the diabetes, every swan test showed signs of slight yeast. So they chalked it up to that. Got rid of the yeast. Still had symptoms. Changed doctors. Gave me a steroid cream I cannot remember, that just burned and did not do much. Tried another one. Same story. \n\nGave up, and dealt with it. A year later, I finally saw a dermatologist for the first time. She looked at it, prescribed me a VERY expensive cream (even recognized it just helped to soothe, did not do much else) and said there was no point in biopsy because it would worsen it by taking skin. \n\nEvery doctor since has blamed my diabetes, no matter how under control it is. The itching has almost gone away completely, but I have to use a wand vibrator at night to make the itch go away so I can sleep. \n\nThe tearing and thinning has gotten so. Much. Worse. I am scarring now. No labia fusion yet but I am so worried... I have now started seeing the white patches. I am so sick and tired of this. I have tried so many things. I am so scared it is going to get blamed on the diabetes again and it is going to just destroy me. I am scheduling an appointment tomorrow because I cannot handle this anymore. Any advice or tips/tricks? I would go see a labia specialist or an OBGYN you do not want that to get worst. If you have A&amp;D ointment put some on. Try putting ice pack on the area and take Benadryl for the itching. I have labia fusion already a lot of it is gone. Use free and clear laundry soap and nothing with perfume and only use cotton underwear or as much cotton as possible. Oh I am also a diabetic and I was getting a lot of yeast infections. You just have to find the right doctor.\nI did a biopsy after 10 years of this they can do one after they prescribed something to make the tissue healthy first. It is awful and annoying but there is treatment to help. This is extremely frustrating to deal with. It is hard enough just to have LS, but misdiagnosis and blaming it on another disease has got to be ten times more frustrating than LS alone. \n\nI definitely second seeing a specialist, the dermatologist was probably a good step but it is frustrating they did not do anything to actually help. If you can find a more specific dermatologist or perhaps a gynecologist who is knowl about it will help. \n\nI suggest explaining this whole thing you just explained to us. Let whatever doctor you see know that it is worse and perhaps you can get clobetasol but if steroids did not work there are other options. Fight for your right for a correct diagnosis and then if the first treatment does not help then ask for another. You deserve management of this disease! Thank you for your kind words :) Unfortunately it was a specific dermatologist (just a shitty one) as well as gynecologists :/ I feel like because I am a \u201ccomplicated\u201d case due to my other conditions, people want to write it off as something else so they do not have to deal with it. see other dermatologists until you get the right help. Oh geez that sucks. Yeah it just sounds like you have been seeing lazy doctors so far.  I hope this new doctor proves more helpful! I know the feeling. I have not had much proper treatment. The last gyno I saw just wanted to treat for a yeast infection, despite not having one. She hoped it would treat the outer labia, but it did not. Just burned. Sent to a dermatologist who seemed really uncomfortable even examining down there and was more concerned with removing a mole than treating me for the problem I came in with. She gave me a sample bottle of Eucrisa, recommended cortisone and that is it. Ran out in a week or so then the Covid thing happened and I have not been able to go back to try and get an Rx for it. \n\nI bought Emu Oil soap and Emuaid balm. I am on day 4 of use, and I have to say, I am about 40% better and I am going to continue using the emu oil products. \n\nI am also type 2 diabetic, have PCOS, Hidradenitis Supportiva, and folliculitis. A variety of other auto immune issues on top of it all as well. LS has been miserable and it is ruining my relationship and the last shred of self esteem I could have had. I have had it for about 2 years now. I have started doing an auto immune protocol diet along with low carb to help get my blood sugar under control and the inflammatory issues. I am hoping that I can get it under control and stop scratching myself to death. \n\nBest to you. I hope you find something that helps control the pain. Try out the emu oil products, if you have not already. I have not been using cortisone creams with them. Just emu oil and I am already noticing a difference in just a few short days. My guess is that I will have to use it forever and it will be expensive, but I am willing to pay whatever at this point to just have a little freakin relief. Emu oil and coconut oil daily HELPED ME SO MUCH!!! Highly recommend! I am so, so sorry. I sometimes wonder if having had chronic yeast infections triggered LS for me (still awaiting diagnosis because I cannot get in to see my sexual medicine doc because of covid). Interestingly, a lot of my sex pain issues began after I started dating my boyfriend who also has T1D (I was also shortly thereafter diagnosed with HPV from a different hookup and developed chronic vaginitis after going on antibiotics for my skin so I do not think his diabetes is the issue!) however I wonder if just being exposed to candida and other vaginal pathogens more often than average can contribute to an autoimmune event that causes LS... or if maybe there is another LS-Diabetes connection that nobody is aware of. I have read in a peer-reviewed journal that some people with vaginas develop a disproportionate inflammatory response to low levels of candida so that they get symptoms from regular colonization that is not even a yeast infection. I also worry that maybe I made my problems worse by using boric acid for vaginitis bc there is not that much research about it. I am so sorry you are going through this. You are dealing with a scary problem that severely affects your quality of life, and your condition clearly does not fit into the usual \u201cdiabetics get yeast infections sometimes\u201d category. You deserve to have a devoted and brilliant healthcare team who will fight for you and think outside the box.", "Is fatigue normal for LS? Hey everyone! It takes me at least 1-2 hrs to \u201cwake up\u201d after sleeping, and after work I feel so done. I have a physical job, but it is only 3-5hrs a day.  I am not sure if it is the autoimmune part of it, or maybe something else. Sometimes I have good days, but most I feel bad for feeling lazy or something.\n\nI am a 28 year old female It may be common for LS sufferers to also suffer other conditions.  I have a few myself.  With LS being a condition of the skin, I would not expect it to cause fatigue, but we do not know enough about it to say for certain.  I suggest going to see a doctor about your fatigue. This is the right answer. I was having an issue with being tired all the time too and got my thyroid checked but it came back fine. It was my vitamin d that was low so now I have to take an extra supplement once a week but I have not noticed any changes yet. every single morning for the past few weeks I too have had difficulty waking up. Does not help everything is closed and I cannot help my condition! I feel you man. Cannot really walk into a doctors office right now. My fatigue goes through waves, where sometimes I will be fine, and other times I am dragging my feet daily. I do not know if it is linked to depression or not, but I have not been diagnosed for anything like that. What about you? I can definitely relate with you on the depression. Its depression yet, I cannot find a clear reason for it. Before my symptoms worsened I was depressed in waves but since the condition has progressed it has really affected my mental well being in general. I have been feeling tired alot too. I am not sleeping at nights either. After having a good chat with my brother I came to realise that my depression and anxiety have worsened and having this knowledge means I can try to change that. I would advise to find a good trusted person or a therapist to talk all your feelings through and then you may feel better. I have joined this discussion group and I do not feel so alone.

I have not had one in a at least 4-5 months. I am wondering if the extra hormones from the pregnancy has brought it on. I finally got the okay from my gyno to use the ointment Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1%. I was curious to know if any other women experienced LS during pregnancy. I also used triamcinolone while pregnant. I only had a couple of flares and that was enough to take care of it. It worked. \n\nI hope it fixes you up, pregnancy is hard enough without that on top of it. Good luck! When I used to have LS it was exacerbated by pregnancy. It was horrific. I got a cream for it though but I forgot it is name. Will look through the cupboards and update this later. Thank you! Happy Cake Day!\n\nI am sorry I do not have advice on this as I have never been pregnant. But I do hope you find some help! I find that my LS gets worse at some points during pregnancy...mostly in the first trimester and later in the third when there is tons of discharge. I have been given the green light to use my Clobetasol, but I am timid to do so; however, my OBGYN (who also treats my LS regularly) says that in some situations, the benefits of the medication outweighs the drawbacks. I just try to focus on keeping everything as dry as possible down there...swapping out underwear when it is damp, and even using barrier creams in places that are problem areas, plus going bare at night to let the skin breathe. It could just be a temporary shift in hormones.", " Seeking new moderators and suggestions for the sub! Hey everyone, I know we had a post pinned by the previous mods, but it was old.

Please delete if this post does not meet the rules of the group, just wanted to share my LS experience. \n\nI am 31 and about 10.5 months postpartum. The years leading up to having a baby I started to experience painful sex and once I got pregnant sex became very uncomfortable like nearly impossible. Obvi while pregnant my OB is doing many exams of the vaginal area and never brings anything abnormal up. It is not until my first POSTARTUM visit that my OB explains to me that I have labial fusion. (I ended up having a cesarean for unrelated reasons). \n\nMy first thought is \u201chow can you be telling me I have labial fusion now?\u201d I mean she is been looking at my vagina for months and not one word (yes I complained about painful sex to her in the past). \n\nAnyways, she tells me I have LS and prescribes me the Clob. Tells me there is not a lot of hope that the clob will fix the fusion, but should help prevent it from getting worse. Then she tells me to see a uro gynecologist who takes one look at me and says \u201cyep, you have LS\u201d and pretty much I am going to be on the clob forever and surgery will not help bc it will just fuse again. \n\nI joined a LS support group on FB and found a great doctor in my area...essentially he is \u201cthe lichen doc\u201d and after an exam he tells me I do not have LS, but that my painful sex problem is coming from vestibulutis. \n\nI am now SUPER CONFUSED. the doctors that told me I have LS are Northwestern doctors! I end up finding a vulvar specialist at University of Chicago who tells me that she does not think I have LS given my symptoms (no itching, but just white patches, thin skin, etc) but only a biopsy will tell. I also saw a labial fusion specialist at UofC that also told me she doubts I have LS but that I can have surgery but would need to be off the clob for at least 2 months....clob can actually give you LS looking symptoms... it thins your skin, can make it white, etc. the reason I would need to be off of the clob is to make sure my skin is healthy and plump and prepared to withstand surgery. \n\nI have now been off the clob for about 4 months and in that time my labia has returned to its normal color, no more white/thin skin. And just yesterday I had my labial fusion surgery AND they did a biopsy (I was asleep so may as well), and turns out the biopsy confirmed that I do not have LS. Also I saw an AMAZING pelvic floor PT that has really helped my vestibulitis/painful sex problem and that is no longer an issue. \n\nIf there is anything I have learned is to get a second and even a third option when dealing with any disorder, but especially LS bc so many docs just tell u something based off how something looks. Even if you go to a really great hospital group... literally Northwestern is one of the best in the country but two doctors there were completely wrong! \n\nThis post is not to brag about not having LS. It is just that I wish someone would have told me this when my first doc told me that is what I have. Why did your labia fuse? The docs think that part was fused since birth, but what made it worse was postpartum drop in estrogen (I am still breastfeeding). There was part of the fusion that was \u201cnewer and thinner\u201d (postpartum related) and the rest was fused thicker (since birth or at least for many many years). Glad you got it figured out!\n This is exactly why biopsies should be done, then you can get a proper diagnosis. Would you be willing to share the doctor you saw at U of C? Feel free to pm me. I am currently at Rush and wanting to seek a second opinion for somewhat similar reasons. At my last appoint I was told \u201cthis is as good as it gets\u201d in terms of pain/discomfort.

PMd", "24F, just diagnosed \u2014 gyn seemed to think it was chill, but internet is making me freak out ! hi ! sadly confirmed LS thru biopsy today :-( my symptom onset was very sudden, i went for a long bike ride in early dec, and experienced itching/tenderness around my clitoris. i waited a week, still itchy, so took a hand mirror and noticed a tiny white patch next on my upper labia (closest to the clit, kind of on the attachment from the hood to the labia). figured i would better check w my gyn, just in case it was cancer or smth. no cancer but it was LS in the end. gyn will call tomorrow w treatment plan but i made the mistake of googling and everything looks absolutely horrific ! does everyone progress to that level ? my itching has been really very mild, mainly at night when i am lying thinking about nothing, i am like, o the vajayjay is itchy again a bit ... and the white spot was so small it is not noticeable at all &amp; basically got wiped out by that vulvar biopsy anyways. \n\nbasically on the phone my gyn seemed super chill when he confirmed it was LS, he was like it is like psoriasis or any other skin condition, just keep the flares down it will be fine. he never even used the term \u2018disease\u2019 ...\n\nbut everyone on the net seems majorly worried / sample photos i saw while searching the condition seem terrible ! i am super worried i am going to end up like that ! has anyone just had like a mild case of LS that never led to anything serious ? does it always progress ? i am a totally healthy 24yo otherwise &amp; i am majorly freaked this is going to be the end of my sex life or smth Other than uncomfortable itching, there is really nothing to work yourself up. Use cream for flare ups. You will be fine! Some people do not have severe symptoms. I very rarely have itching. The downside for me is that my LS grew over my clitoris, so I cannot experience sexual pleasure. As long as you get it under control it should be okay. Do not wait as long as my sexually repressed self did to get these things sorted out; it is too late for me, and I will probably be undergoing a second surgery soon. I also do not really have much itching but my clitoral hood has fused quite a bit, reducing sensation. Sucks, because I have been using steroids for years and the fusing happened after/during use. I was pretty inconsistent about it the first couple of years, though, because first my doctor told me to use them as needed (and I do not get itchy, so that was not happening much) and then she told me to use them a few times a week but I was in denial about having LS (negative biopsy, no itching). Finally accepted the diagnosis when I noticed fusing. It was really emotionally tough at first, but I have accepted it now. So sorry to hear yours has gotten so bad. I hope surgery can help! Can I ask if insurance covers it? I got diagnosed in my early twenties and was super freaked out about it for years. But I really do not think most people\u2019s progresses to the point you see on the internet. Just follow your doctor\u2019s instructions, and you will probably have a relatively normal life. Find a new treatment/doctor if you are noticing things getting worse. I tried a few steroids before I found one that seemed to work for me. \n\nAlso, Vaseline is super helpful imo! Apply after you use the restroom and before bed. did you ever get off the cream or do you actually have to use it every day for life ? ;O i am sorry you are experiencing this !! :-( wishing you the best of luck with your surgery &amp; hoping you can find other ways to engage sexually ! when my partner experienced some sexual dysfunction in the past we had to get creative but it still worked out :-) sending good healing vibes your way ! Definitely not every day! I would go months with out using it thinking it was cleared for good, and then it came back. But truth is, it is much milder than it ever was. Maybe with age? Now, with menopause, it is hard to tell if my symptoms are from the LS or menopause. I was diagnosed in my 30s more than ten years ago. Clobetasol knocked it right out. \n\nEvery once in a while it comes back, always at the MOST inconvenient times. I have learned to pack clobetasol for any trip longer than two nights just in case, even if I have not needed it in a year!!\n\nI have a handful of flares in a year. They are generally a nuisance - but quickly quelled with a couple of days of clobetasol, and then I am good again. \n\nIt is determined to eat my lips, but it was largely halted once I started treating. They are smaller than they used to be, but everything is fine. As shitty stupid conditions go, this one, for me, is livable. I guess \n\nThe shitty thing is that when it itches or burns or hurts like hell for a day or two, it is awfully difficult to explain to people. YES I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM BUT I CANNOT FOCUS ON YOU WITH MY VULVA IN POISON IVY OR SOMETHING, catch me tomorrow, okay?  Hah. People are so awkward about genitals. Those days suck. And they always come when you are already overwhelmed because that is what this type of condition does: it kicks you when you are down. \n\nBest bet is to stay emotionally and physically healthy and rested, pay attention to any signs of a flare and man it early, and you will likely keep ahead of it a-okay. Google is not your friend when it come to LS. That is my experience anyways. All the images are of very advanced cases, which do happen, but do not seem to be the most common expression of the disease. While it can be very frustrating to get it under control, and for sure really scary, it is manageable and you do not need to think your life will be wildly different moving forward. You just need. Take care of yourself with a new set of guidelines. &gt;sample photos i saw while searching the condition seem terrible ! i am super worried i am going to end up like that ! has anyone just had like a mild case of LS that never led to anything serious ? does it always progress ? \n\nAbsolutely not, especially if you follow your treatment regimen. Those scary pictures are probably of people who got diagnosed really late in the progression of their disease or did not have access to treatment (and also the most severe cases tend to make it into journals and textbooks, not the mild or even typical ones.) You got diagnosed early because you noticed changes right way and got them checked, which is truly awesome. LS is *very* treatable. It is a disease that can be stopped in its tracks most of the time, and you are stopping it very early. Clobetasol works well in the vast majority of people with LS, and if it does not work, there are several alternatives. Okay so do not freak out bc it does not always progress that much and it is not the end of the world (that is not meant to sound harsh lol). I went three whole years with intense itching to the point I scratched so much and so hard at night that I had blood under my fingernails... gross and awful I know. My gyno kept telling me she could not see anything and said I was probably making up symptoms and upped my anxiety meds sooo I went even longer thinking I was imagining it until I saw a dermatologist who confirmed LS. He started a clob regimen for me and after just a couple months, my symptoms pretty much went away. BUT I noticed that it all started when I started taking the Depo birth control shot that has no/low estrogen. When I got the LS diagnoses, I quit taking the depo shot and went on the pill. I have noticed over the years that every time I try to lower my estrogen via birth control, I get a lot of flare ups. So I am stuck taking medium birth control pills but at least no flare ups and I am living a normal life again \n\nIt is funny that you say the itching is mostly at night bc that was exactly what happened to me too! It was terrible at night, I was not getting any sleep. \n\nSome tips that may help you... stop using wet wipes and feminine washes if you are using them. The wet wipes can spread it to your butt. Go buy Lichen Sclerosis Beating the Disease Book by Ginny Chandoha, read it, practice it, and your LS will go away.\n\nLS can get really bad. It got to the point where I could not have sex w/o pain.\n\nI am pretty much free of LS now besides occasional flare ups. it is funny you mention poison ivy, because i react just AWFULLY to poison ivy, i am still recovering 6mo later from a bad run-in w the stuff in july. i think i must have a hyperactive immune system because no one i know has ever gotten it that bad \u2014 thank god my LS is not that itchy ! my labia are longer than most so i feel like it would be a weirdly anomalous feat to have them absorbed but i will stave it off w the cream i hope ! thanks for sharing your story, this is really helping reassure me !\n\nedit: do you follow a \u2018maintenance\u2019 clob routine even when you are not having a flare ? or just use it when you are flaring &amp; taper off to nothing in between flares I am sorry to hear that :( are you using clob ointment? \nI am not sure if insurance will cover it; if it does not, I will not have the surgery. I had one surgery two years ago, and insurance covered that. But this next one would be plastic surgery, and I have a feeling my insurance would turn it down as \u201cnonessential.\u201d If I have learned anything, it is that female sexual health \u201cdoes not matter\u201d when it comes to things like this. That is very sweet \u2014 thank you! I am hoping that I am able to find a straight man who is *willing* to get creative, because my ex was not. Between my LS and my vaginismus I just was not enough for him, and other men I have met have turned on their heels when I have told them about my conditions. Nope with care my disease has lessened over the 8 years yes I have flares but dealt with and back to my normality\n \nI did make changes early on with body and hair products and pants. Was diagnosed about 8 years ago. I remember freaking out as well based on my search of the internet!  Reality is, I think, for many of us is to be consistent with the clobatesol.  It works well and keeps the itching down. At first I would use it but would stop when things felt better. I now have very little labia left, but my clit is intact! Really working hard to save that!  Good luck! did you use the clob all over your vulva, or only on the affected areas ? ~ My gyno says to apply everywhere. I usually keep my cream by my bed because I found that once I was in bed I never wanted to get back up to apply. &amp; just like every day forever ?? i feel like part of me is not understanding how such a long course of such a strong steroid (like forever of using it ?! potentially 50+ years lol??) could possibly not be awful for ur vagina lol :-( does not it thin the skin horribly ? Im currently on a daily schedule.  The goal is eventually go to maintenance of a couple of times a week. It is annoying mostly because you kind of have to plan sex. Ugh! But I am seeing good results so it is worth it. My skin has not thinned at all. plan sex because ... the steroid affects your partner ? can you do the clob in the morning &amp; have sex at night ? Im not sure the cream is much of a turn on for her! It is best to apply at night because you get a longer period of time for the cream to penetrate the skin. I pee too much during the day. Only when I feel a flare. I do not want to use it too regularly - even though the docs say it is fine to use on skin with no hair, it is a potent steroid. So, I use it a few days in a row a few times a year. I just have to try to pay attention. I am a male diagnosed a year ago. \nJust wanted to tell you about the recommanded treatment, that I 've read on professional websites and what I ve gotten from my dermatologist:\nUltra potent OINTMENT (not cream - class 4 or at least 3)\n- every night for one month\n- every other night for another month\n- twice a week for the last month\n- use emolients several times a day. I use parrafin/vasselin after urinating.\n- no soap, ...\n\nThan go back for check-up with your dermatologist.\n\n\nThat helped for me. I now use a class 3 once a week. I am really consistent in using the emolients. The internet freaked me out as well.\n\nI think i will need to use the ointment once a week for a long time. Some people (like myself) are asymptomatic, so no itch does not mean LS is not active. I noticed some small white patches. The white is not completely gone, but definitely less strong.\nI 'm ok with using the ointment once a week, because it gives peace in my head. \nI use a different steroid. Clob did not really work for me. The one I use now seems to work as long as I use it fairly regularly. \n\nUgh. I had a feeling it might not be covered. Our healthcare system sucks. Hope your doctors can pull some strings with their wording and get it covered! You may want to reconsider because you really should wash your hands after applying clob to prevent it from absorbing into the skin on your fingers!\n\nI have this same problem of not thinking of it until I am in bed and then having to get back up to apply. It sucks. I got diagnosed with very mild LS when I was around your age. I googled myself to death basically and that was before I found the Reddit page. My doctor was the same exact way and told me dont panic. Mine is more towards my anus and I think it is because I ripped there with child birth. I used to have a white figure 8, but that completely went away! I very rarely get itching a few years later and I have not seen any changes to my skin. Since I am so mild (confirmed with biopsy)I used clob as needed. Just listen to your body and apply clob. \n\nI do have a few other autoimmune diseases so I spent a while working on my triggers and that seems to keep it in remission too. Leggings seem to irritate it too. \n\nBut you are in good hands here! Mine started after Mirena so that is interesting. \n\nBut I have never heard of wet wipes spreading it.. I do not think that is true? What is your source on that. My dermatologist. It also happened to me and a few people here have mentioned it I am glad you have found something else that works! \nAnd thank you! I hope so too. And I hope that one day things will change and women\u2019s sexual health will be taken as seriously as men\u2019s is. Yeah I have also never heard of this. And was told it cannot be \u201cspread\u201d. You have LS where you are going to have it, it just might not be active yet and can come up later with time. I still agree with staying away from feminine washes tho and wipes can irritate. I am 27 and was just diagnosed. Freaked myself out researching as well. Still freaked out by my lips and clitoris disappearing. Definitely make sure you have a good and educated dr though. Mine has been terrible and now I am on a wait to see a specialist. So I am still confused about applying the clob because everyone is instructions are so different. I also had this happen while on the depo shot like the person above and others. So my dr prescribed estrogen cream and I seem to look back to normal now. Just concerned with the future anatomy and atrophy like you are. There is a Facebook group for women with LS that has a lot of different topics and info on it. As well as a podcast. They can be overwhelming but also helpful. How did it start affecting ur clitoris and could you have prevented it scarring iver I was not diagnosed until I turned 23. I had barely ever looked at myself before I turned 22, because of my religious upbringing. It was not until I started masturbating (with a great deal of guilt) that I noticed something was wrong. I was not feeling much pleasure, and could not find my clit. I spent hours examining myself and comparing myself to lots of different diagrams and photographs and finally went to a doctor and asked her if she could help me find it. I would had a few pelvic exams before, but for some reason doctors do not exam the clitoral area unless you ask them to. This doctor was shocked to find that I \u201cdid not have one\u201d and initially told me that I had probably been a victim of female circumcision. (You can imagine how it felt to hear that; I went into literal shock and became very sick afterwards.) It took visiting two other doctors to find out the truth \u2014 that my clit was indeed there, but that it was buried beneath years\u2019 worth of scar tissue that could have been growing since early childhood. \nThe moral of the story is: do not be afraid to ask your doctor questions that might feel embarrassing. Our healthcare system also needs to end the stigma against female sexual pleasure. And religion sucks. Im 27F and having a biopsy in a few weeks to confirm but my doctor also told me not to google - which I obviously then went and did and have also freaked myself out about how bad it can potentially get... at the moment I just get a few cuts and it itches for a week or so and then goes away for a few months.\nThe steroid creams she gave me also seemed to make it worse so now I am not using it and have been given an oestrogen cream type thing to use until the biopsy, which has calmed it down and I have no itching anymore. I am worried the biopsy will confirm and I will have to use the horrid steroid creams again... If the biopsy confirms it, ask about Tacrolimus/protopic! It is an alternative to steroids. I use it and it burned the first two times I applied it but since then has been totally fine", "Nsfw - is sex even possible Hey everyone! Not going into major details but with my LS I have lots of 'splits' in the skin, it also tears very easily all over the vulva and the bit of skin between the vagina and anus, I forget what it is called. Even with lube I find any time we try anything the skin just immediately splits and begins bleeding. This means that since my symptoms started a year ago, we have not actually been able to be intimate with out me crying in pain from the skin breaking. I am wondering if any of you have experienced this and how you get around it? Obviously LS sucks but this aspect is particularly depressing Sex is possible. \n\nI have skin fusing and growth over my vagina, and over my clitoris.\n\nSlippery stuff lube, masturbation/fingering before to open up your vagina helps so much. If you are tearing, you might have fusion too, and even if you are not fusing it is good to keep everything open. You want to do exercises to open up your vagina. Try vaginal dilators or a dildo as well, before sex slowly with lube if possible. \n\nSome sort of barrier cream like Desitin or Aquaphor (if glycerin is not a problem, I will elaborate on this in a second) before and after sex. Right at the opening of the vagina, on your clitoris, and on your labia minora. \n\nSTAY AWAY from lube with glycerin. I know for me that is what causes (extra) tearing in the lube with sex. You would be surprised, glycerin is in basically every lube. Water lube works best for most but some people have had more success with silicone lube (Like UberLube). \n\nI order my lube from Amazon, slippery stuff is the brand. It literally feels like spit and glides on the best. Have you tried sliquid? How does that compare to slippery stuff if you have? I am having major problems with lube that does not just dissapear. Do you use an estrogen cream? It can help plump up the skin and reduce tearing. Borax soaks can help too. \nThere is also Mona Lisa touch or stem cells/PRP which have helped people with those issues... but they can be pricy I have not tried sliquid. I really, really recommend Slippery stuff, and f*ckwater (if you do not get irritation from Glycerin) because they are both pretty much the same texture as typical vaginal fluids or spit. They also do not leave residue and are not too sticky. I was in this same boat- could not get though missionary without crying. emu oil is the only thing that has helped me and I also started using cerave moisturizing cream. I had sex with my partner last week- I was on top and everything and did not even have to think about tearing myself. I cried from relief as this has not happened in close to a year. Follow the advice here and stay on top of your treatment. My wife did not and now it is too late.", "Doctor's advice - question, m Anonymous account.\n\nI am an underage male, whom has had LS for about 2 years now. It is tightens my skin, but it does not itch, or cause pain. It is uncomfortable at times and it does not look nice. I recently went to see an urologist about the issue, and he recommended me circumcision. In a nutshell, he said that it will not go away on it is own, and it will progress slowly. He told me that he could prescribe cortisol creams for me if I wanted them, but that they will not remove the issue, and just keep it still. They could however, lessen itching and such (which I do not have) so I did not take them.\n\nNow my circumcision in on the line here. And thus I came here to ask for advice. Should I go ahead with the operation, or get the cortisol creams?\n\nYeah it is only on the foreskin, and he said it can be fully removed with surgery. \n\nHere is my amateur advice, **do not wait**. Do not wait. It can also turn cancerous in the long run. Take care of it while your young! Yeah definitely get it! If I could just cut my parts off,  I would trust me (female). Do it, and move on with your life! You deserve the best quality of life you can have. Best of luck! \ud83d\udc95 Wait he said circumcision wont make it go away or the steroid wont make it go away? Because i read in many places that circumcision offers cure in many cases I think it really depends on how you feel about your foreskin. Both circumcision and steroids *can* be curative/cause remission, with circumcision having a higher chance of being curative. Since your LS is only on your foreskin, circumcision is especially likely to be curative. If you personally value your foreskin and want to keep it, I think it makes sense to try steroid ointment for a while and see if it works. But if you would like to be circumcised anyway, it makes sense to just go ahead with it. \n\nThe British Association of Dermatology recommends trying steroid ointment for 1-3 months, and if signs persist after that time, recommending circumcision. Some also recommend using the ointment after surgery, like once a week or so, to prevent relapse. \n\nI am not totally clear on how much steroids can improve the signs of LS, like the appearance you mentioned, but if it works for you it should definitely prevent progression of that, and it should help with the discomfort and tightness. It is not just for itching. If you decide against circumcision, I would suggest that you consider using the clobetasol even though you do not have itching. I am not circumcised and I am 72.\nI have had tight foreskin as you describe, a few times, and caused by antibiotics allowing fungal/ yeast infections.\nLast time 3 days on betamethasone fixed it !\nI would advise you that all the circumcision information is very one sided here in  the USA. I grew up in England. Came here when I was 28.\nNo I do not think you should be circumcised. You will lose that natural protection and sensitivity. 10% of males suffer from ejectulation issues during PIV vs less than 1 for un circumcised males.\nBTW after this my dermatologist informed me I had LS, mainly on glans and base of glans. As far as I can tell I have had this since pre teen.", "(M) urine retention? I am wondering if anyone has experienced urine retention? I thought one post may have mentioned it? I have just started to notice it in the last few days. I have probably a 15-20 (feels like) seconds delay at the moment. I am uncircumcised and the foreskin is also closing more.\n\nI am on betamethasone cream, supposed to apply once daily on the glans where I have a shiny patch about an inch square.", "Acupuncture Has anyone tried acupuncture for LS? I have heard for autoimmune conditions acupuncture is really effective for stabilizing things. I am really curious in holistic approaches that treat the cause more than the symptoms! This sounds really interesting! I have an appointment with my acupuncture therapist so I will def ask her for you/me ! Thank you so much!! I hope it helps you! I think that is anything to help your mental help and to help you relax will do wonders. Stress makes everything worse. I need to do yoga every week or find some way to relax otherwise I can get very stressed and make things worse.", "Is what is happening to me normal I found out I I gave LS on the 28 of Dec and i am just curious if anyone else have issues i am having.\n\nIt appear along with the inner thigh itching I also itch INSIDE my virgina?\n\nThanks in advance LS can definitely appear outside the vulva, like on the thighs like you said. But not usually inside the vagina. \n\nIf you have itching inside your vagina, you probably have something else going on. You might just have something like a yeast infection, or another skin disease like lichen planus (LP.) It is possible for one person to have both LS and LP.", "Flare up? Hi everyone! I got diagnosed with LS when I was 18, I am now 23. First 2-3 years I applied clob once a day then once every other day then once a week then for about one year it was once every 2 weeks. That worked fine until I noticed my right labia minora started to fuse or shrink (I am not sure, I just checked one day and half of it was gone) my doctor recommended that I stop using clob because my skin looked fine and she thinks clob was the reason half of my labia was gone. I have not used clob for about 2 years now but this past week I have been extremely itchy in the area where my labia fused. Is this a flare up? Would I need to go back on clob? Or does this mean it is fusing more?", "Anyone have any natural remedies? Been diagnosed for about a year now. Dermol ointment works okay but seems to still flare up every now and then. Wondered if anyone has had any luck with natural remedies? Any help would be much appreciated!! I do not know if its just all in my head but going gluten free made me feel better overall. I do not stay up all night scratching, I finally got to really sleep for the first time in 3 years (I kept getting misdiagnosed for 3 years so that was hell), and I do not have those intrusive negative thoughts anymore. I feel normal again. It is worth giving it a shot. It is not that hard to do. Some will argue that it does not do anything but what the heck, if you are desperate you will do anything. Overall I feel healthier and the burning/itching has stopped completely.  I have gotten some relief from emu oil. I usually use just the plain oil but I keep Emu Joy pain and rash creams on hand for when when flare ups get really bad.  In 2012 I had an anal fissure that I soothed and healed with frequent sitz baths and wheatgrass cream. Just like reenuhh I cut gluten and that helped, too. From what I have been reading for the past few days that anal fissure might have been caused by my newly diagnosed lichen sclerosus. I do not know since the colorectal guy who diagnosed the fissure just wanted to cut me up and was not super interested in what might have caused it. So maybe try sitz baths and wheatgrass cream? I have never actually stopped doing the baths but I am considering trying wheatgrass cream for this. It cannot hurt and it might help. Aloe directly from the plant. \nI got LS when I was six, and had a gallon-size plastic bag full of steroid creams that never cleared it up. My mom started giving me aloe to use, and it went away.  Coconut oil helps soothe it and protects from bacteria and fungus/yeast infections ", "23f - undiagnosed, should I try mildly treating? hi world! thanks for taking a look.\n\nI want to see a medical professional as soon as possible, however I am a recent/covid graduate still job searching and off my parents' insurance - which means no health insurance rn. (maybe this is an additional question but if there is a resource you know of for me, I am be rly grateful to hear!)\n\nmaybe for a few months now, I have been scratching at night, maybe once or twice a week during daytime. no pain other than the burn against my sensitive skin when wiping. only recently I think I am bleeding ever so slightly from a bad scratch. my perineum would be a bit pink, but only today have I noticed it drier/paler. I should have taken pictures over time but I cannot tell if my skin tone/general darker pigmentation there is making me paranoid about it looking whiter?\n\nanyway -after some research here, I think I will get some aquaphor to start applying. I looked way too much into vagisil and cortizone-10 fem tonight without professional guidance. I read that olive oil and emu oil are handy too, but I am not too comfortable with oils as wearing cotton underwear is sorta a must for my comfort.\n\nthis is probably getting too long now - but I thought I would just add some additional context. I am wondering if wearing tighter/fitted pants is making a difference...as well as all the stress over the past year. I am definitely going to stop using my aveeno body wash (slightly scented and it is yellowing my tub anyway). I appreciate any thoughts.&lt;3  If you are in the US and you are not insured, Planned Parenthood might be a good option. If you are a student there is probably a campus clinic you can go to. \n\nWhile waiting you could try an OTC yeast cream, but if it does not work, you probably just do not have a yeast infection (so no need to try other brands/doses.)\n\n Aquaphor or another bland moisturizer is usually a good idea. I do not know about the vagisil- it sounds like it is a symptom treatment only, and it can be irritating, but I do not know a lot about it. If the itching is bad I would try ice or a cool bath sooner than vagisil. And yes, tighter pants can definitely promote irritation. Try wearing loose pants or skirts and skipping underwear while you are at home. Def see a gynecologist as soon as you can. Until then use unscented everything-laundry detergent, body wash, toilet paper. Moisturize your vulva with coconut oil, aquaphor, emu oil, olive oil or what works for you. For the itch use OTC anti-itch stuff like Cortisone or diaper rash cream. Wear cotton undies or none and looser fit clothing. Do not ever use vagisil or a scented douche product. Our miraculous vaginas clean themselves naturally unless there is an infection or such (odor or discharge). We need to normalize taking care of our genitals as much as we do our hair and body", "Hi everyone! Looking for support/any advice anyone could give me Hi! I am a 22 year old female and I was \u201cdiagnosed\u201d with lichen sclerosus in January. The gyno I was seeing before examined me, told me it was LS, gave me clobetasol and told me to use it every day, and told me to Google what Lichen Sclerosus is. I was not happy at all with how he told me to just go home and Google my condition. So I made an app with a new gyno, and I see her the end of this month-hopefully she is more helpful. However, its been a couple of months without seeing anyone or knowing how to manage my symptoms besides just using the clobetasol. The pain improved, but the scaring, hypo-pigmentation and the bruises only got worse. It is been hard to deal, as I am sure you all know. I am very happy I found this forum because I had not had anyone to talk to who could understand exactly what I am going through. I am hoping to be able to get some advice from people who have been dealing with it longer or who are also knew to life with this condition. Welcome!! I am a 24 year old woman and I was diagnosed when I was 22 as well. It is been a journey but the official diagnosis is a huge first step! I encourage you to read through this forum to get advice about moisturizers, periods, and sex. Your life is not over and your sex life is not over either. The most important thing you can do is see a provider is who an \\*expert\\* on LS. Not just a typical gyno. I have actually had better luck with dermatologists. You can call offices your insurance covers and ask if any of the doctors treat lichen sclerosus, say you are looking for an aggressive treatment path. I have had doctors who dismissed me, kind doctors who did not know a thing about LS, and am finally at a place with a true expert. Steroid shots have saved my life and I am saving up for the laser treatment.\n\nYou are valid, your pain is valid, and you are on the right path. Thank you so much! I really appreciate the advice and the welcome! I am hoping she is helpful and if she possibly knows derms who have experience with LS and can refer me to one. And hearing that my sex life is not over is needed, I do not have a partner and I have been resisting meeting new people because I am scared to have sex. I have not had sex since before my symptoms appeared but I am very hesitant because I am scared of the possible pain : ( I am 22 with LS. the first year attempting to get my diagnoses was wonky but now most days are normal and sex life is same as it always was! Very fair thoughts. I thought I would just have painful sex for the rest of my natural life and have to fake it for the sake of my now fiance. Since you are not seeing anyone, I would recommend working on self pleasure. Invest in (small) dildos, vibrators, and good lube. Figure out how to pleasure yourself. A pelvic floor physical therapist can help you with dilators if your vaginal canal is tight like mine. I just use a dildo as a dilator in between sex to make sure I am staying loose and relaxed. With the proper treatment, positioning, and a perinatal cold pack just in case, our sex life is great. Also, there are more ways to have sex than vaginal penetration. If my LS is flaring but we are in the mood, giving some consensual enthusiastic oral sex always helps. Get creative! That is awesome! That is makes me really happy to hear and gives me hope I was just diagnosed at an urgent care a few days ago. I have an appointment on Thursday to confirm. I do not have any tips yet but I am just letting you know there is someone out here who is feeling the exact same way you are, you are not alone. I am really glad I found somewhere like this too. I am so depressed right now honestly. I was feeling very depressed too when I first began experiencing symptoms, especially when I noticed the significance of my scarring. Hopefully overtime with the mental support we can offer each other it will help with the depression. I have seen many people saying from experience that LS can improve, and it will not be the end of your happiness in life. \ud83d\udc96 I shared some thoughts that may help you here:\n\n Hii! I am 22 and got diagnosed last summer! I truly hope you are doing well \ud83d\ude0a It will get better and you are far from being alone \u2764\ufe0f Best advice I can give you is to stick to the treatment, moisturize every day (my doctor recommended me to use vaseline). Avoid wearing anything too tight such as jeans, thongs, etc. It is best to wear something loose, cotton underwear and to sleep with no underwear/pants at night. Use fragrance free product,soap, laundry detergent.. When it comes to sex make sure to use lube, it helps a lot! Thank you!! I really appreciate! I started using coconut oil, Vaseline is a good idea too I will try that. Do you use clobetasol? If you do is it ok to use clobetasol and moisturizer at the same time?  Coconut oil is good too!! Yes I do use clobetasol, the ointment! I found the cream to be too irritating for me. Personally, I have never used them at the same time, BUT some  do, some people find the clob too strong and so they mix it with a moisturizer (but I would talk to a specialist/gyno before doing that).  I do not apply the clob every day anymore but when I do it is at night time and so in the morning and during the day I will moisturize if I need/feel like it. On the days that I do not use clob... I will use vaseline at night instead! Idk if that makes sense or helps hopefully haha!  But honestly you said you have an appointment with the new gyno, that is a good question to ask them just to make sure! \ud83d\ude0a I find that it is also good to keep track of your symptoms (write them down in a journal), to see if something might be triggering it and it can also help you find what can potentially help! If you have any other questions feel free to message me\ud83d\udc95 Just remember that what you see online is not always the reality of things! I know it sucks,but you will definitely be okay:) Goodluck!!!! Thank you! I am 29. I have been struggling with what I now know is LS for about 10 years. I was just diagnosed a couple months back and OMG thank got the clobetasol! However, I was told to only use it during a bad flare because it can thin the skin (even more). So now, for example, after recent intercourse, I am all skin tears and so raw. The perineum is completely broken down.  Would you call this a flare? It does not look like the start of a new white patch, but the wounds and pain are so bad. What do i do!? I think I would consider that a flare, I think you should try a cold compress and keeping the area moisturized. I tried coconut oil but it kind of irritated the skin so I switched to Vaseline and that feels a lot more soothing for me. Also what kind of lubrication are you using? I have been seeing others say that water based is best and you can neeeever use too much lube. I started using Vaseline and it is a lot more soothing, thank you! I got prescribed the ointment and I am picking it up tomorrow so I am going to start using that instead of the cream. Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe I use water based lube and it helps a little. And thank you, I will have to try Vaseline!  Glad I could help \ud83d\ude0a good:) might take a bit to see changes but the ointment definitely was better for me (and for lots of people from what I have read)!! Yes fingers crossed\ud83e\udd1e Hey there. I would def call that a flare. \n\nMy dr (he is a vulvar pain specialist who focuses on treating LS) said that he never recommends taking long breaks on the clobetasol bc it allows flares and then you end up having to use more to get it calmed down again than if you just used it regularly but sparingly (grain of rice size). \n\nI use it twice a week or every 10 days depending how I am doing and occasionally a few days in a row\u2014 for the last 7 years and never had any issues with the skin thinning, but my LS has stayed under control and I have had no new damage. \n\nI think you might need to consider using the clobetasol daily, even twice a day at least till you get this flare under control and once you are better, wean it down to every other day, then add days in between until you find your threshold which you will know by if you are itching or in pain. Everyone is a bit different so you might end up at twice a week or once a week or every 10 days. Do not let it get itchy- that means it is active. You want it inactive using the least amount of steroid to keep it that way. \n\nAlso, estrace cream can build up the skin and toughen and heal it- if you can get prescribed it. I use a grain of rice size at least a few times a week to daily. Sooo helpful! Thank you!!! You are welcome. I hope it helps. Sorry you are having to deal with this! Hey girl! I wanted to ask if your scarring has gotten better? I am not diagnosed but I have scarring on my bikini line that itches and I think it is LS - I am sooo self conscious and wondering if yours has gotten better?", "Doctors knowledgeable about LS? ", "Has anyone thought to get their thyroid checked? I have been doing some research lately because I have been having odd symptoms on top of a lot of flare ups recently and I came across an article over a study they did that mentioned 30 percent of those who had LS also had thyroid issues. I started researching bc a lot of women in this fb group I joined mentioned always being tired and having fog brain. Which is something my bf experiences and he has hypothyroidism. I went to the doc Tuesday to get my thyroid tested but waiting to hear back on results. I had a female pcp who actually knows what LS is and I am hopeful she can give me some answers I do not know yet. For now she told me to just take a multi vitamin daily and maybe extra vitamin D if I am still always tired. I know a lot of us here are just trying to figure out what LS is in general but if you are also experiencing fatigue, weight gain or weight loss, temperature sensitivity and constipation or diarrhea on top of LS, Id recommend you check your thyroid. But I am not a doctor, so. I found out that I am Hypothyroid last month. I feel a lot better now that I am medicated. I struggled with fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, dry hair and skin for years! Ahh! Someone who has both! I know it sucks but I am kind of happy there is someone who can share their experience! How is your LS now that you are medicated for your hypothyroid? It is nice to meet a fellow sufferer of both! I apply steroid cream once every couple of days, but I no longer wake up to itch in the middle of the night. I did not have access to healthcare until recently so my thyroid has been off balance for years. \n\nI used to feel so miserable, fatigued, itchy. My hair and skin are bouncing back too! I could not survive an entire workday without several cups of coffee. Three years ago I restricted my calories (1000-1200 a day) and barely saw weight loss. I did not have the energy to finish workouts, and did not feel energized or good after workouts, only more exhausted. I have heard that some are looking into a link between hormone imbalances and LS. \n\nThanks to steroid cream and thyroid pills I feel a lot better and I am using the cream less. You will feel so much better once you start thyroid meds! I have both ls and thyroid problems. They started roughly at the same time, too. I am still waiting on my labs to come back so idk if I have thyroid issues yet. I am just always super tired, cold, I lost a ton of weight but my doc claims I am actually super healthy where I am right now (I guess I just prefer having curves) Ive always had super dry skin and use lotion a million times a day... never knew that was a symptom so I am curious about that now! When I swapped from birth control pills to the shot, my LS started. I had no idea what was happening and for three years, I continued the shot and my gyno could not figure out what was causing my LS symptoms. I ended up going to the dermatologist on my own and he told me it was LS and gave me ointment and I went back on the pill and my LS pretty much clearer, I felt normal again. I only got flare ups every 2 months or something in the last year and it went away after a day of using ointment but the flare ups have been happening quite often now. I kind of do hope it is a thyroid issue also that way I have answers to what is going on with me. Sometimes I feel a bit crazy lol That is very interesting. How did you find out about your thyroid? My mom had some issues and they found out she had thyroid issues. I had fatigue symptoms and figured that I should test for this, and yeah, hypothyroidism. Has being on medication improved your LS symptoms? Did you experience any hair loss? My SO has hypothyroidism. For a long time he always complained about being exhausted and napped so much it was really taking a toll on the relationship. Then he started noticing thinning hair and he wanted to see a specialist for it. But before that even happened, he ended up going to the doctor for something and I asked they check his thyroid and he started rolling his eyes at me and sure enough, results came back and I was right! Now I am experiencing hair thinning and it does not seem to want to grow at all either. The thyroid medication has not helped with ls, unfortunately.\n\nI do not have hair loss, thankfully. Mainly problems with losing weight. Dang, I was hoping to hear from some that it does help with LS. I was diagnosed hypothyroid before LS and interstitial cystitis. I do think they are related based on what I have read/heard. My mom has thyroid issues and I am pretty sure she has undiagnosed LS.  I am diagnosed and now curious about how my thyroid is doing. If you have the health insurance, I would get it done just to be sure. But as for your mom, she should definitely get the possible LS checked. It should not go too long without being diagnosed due to fusing and possible vulvar cancer.", "Has cortisone 10 worked for anyone? ", "Retracting you are foreskin at all times helps treat BXO I am my experience it works For all our information,  Lichen sclerosus (balanitis xerotica obliterans) or BXO", "Looking for tips for a biopsy on my clitoris :( Hi All-\n\nI have been lurking in this sub for the past 2 weeks to research symptoms and am finally (possibly!) joining the LS club :( I am a 26 yr old female and my issues started 3-4 months ago when I got a micro-tear on my clitoris (unknown trigger- happened after a typical run). I had no other symptoms except it turned the left side of my clit almost completely purple, like a blood blister. My GP told me to put Neosporin on it and it healed up, only to tear again a month later- triggering a ton of itching, soreness, and discomfort with it that never went away. Although the tear mostly healed after the 2nd time, it turned the left half of my clitoris almost completely white and very tender to the touch. After 2 visits to a vulvar specialist, I have now been diagnosed with BV and tentatively LS as well based on a visual exam. I have been on \"the clob\" for about 3 weeks now (prescribed after 1st specialist visit) and a BV antibiotic for 4 days (prescribed after 2nd specialist visit). While only on steroid &amp; lidocaine ointments, the discomfort and itching was still pretty unbearable but improved slightly once I started wearing 100% cotton underwear. Since starting the antibiotic, the white area on my clitoris seems to be improving and the itching is almost completely gone. \n\nI have a biopsy scheduled for next Thursday and am looking for any tips others have- How should I prepare beforehand? How should I care for myself afterwards? How long is it before you can have sex again? Unfortunately I do not have the obvious white patches on my vulva so they may have to take directly from my clitoris- I am pretty scared that it will further ruin my sex life and disfigure it even more than it already is. My partner is really supportive but it has already been 3 months since we had sex.\n\nRight now my biopsy is scheduled for 11 am and I have an important work meeting at 3 that afternoon. Do you think I will be okay to attend the meeting via zoom? Should I delay my biopsy to a day when I can take the entire day off and recover on a subsequent weekend? Sorry for all the questions! I just read horror stories of biopsy recovery on this sub while lurking and am looking for reassurance that proceeding is worth the risk of a rough healing process, even though my symptoms have improved dramatically in the last week. Firstly, I am sorry you are in so much pain. \n\nBiopsy\u2019s sound scary and I do not blame you for feeling nervous. I have had more than I can count and I still get disproportionately nervous about them. In reality, the most pain you will feel will be the anesthetic needle and then you can relax.\n\nYou will probably be a bit sore once the anesthesia wears off so I suggest you take some paracetamol shortly after the procedure and be really strict with a paracetamol schedule. 2 tabs every 4-6 hours, even if the hour falls at 2am, keep your pain killers next to your bed with a glass of water and put an alarm on. In saying that, do not panic too much about the pain after the procedure, you will be less anxious once it is done and it will feel more manageable. Get some saline solution to squirt on the biopsy site morning, night and after doing a wee. \n\nThe vagina/vulva is a magical organ. It is very fast healing. You might be surprised at how quickly it goes from looking bruised and battered to being healed. Remember a biopsy is one step closer to a management plan, every day you are one day closer to relief. \n\nGoodluck my friend. They took 2 punches from very near my clitoris yesterday and it only hurt for a few hours afterwards but it was so bearable that I was shocked and had to ask my doctors if they were sure I had no pain medication inside me. Now it only hurts when i touch it, the same kind of pain I feel when touching a bruise. I was really scared after reading some stories here but when it comes to me, having a needle in my vein was way more painful and troublesome. Good luck! how did it go?", "Tips on applying cream? Female here, I have to apply the cream pretty much everywhere: in my vagina, around the clit, everywhere. Does anyone have any tips? Do you leave a bit of a layer on or just totally rub it in? I have a lot of discharge so it seems difficult to rub it in. Looking to hear what others do, thanks! What kind of cream is it? Topical Corticosteroid. Or at least that is one name on the package Hmm I use clobetsol a steroid too and I always have to leave a thin layer. How often do you reapply? I feel like every time I pee I just wipe it all off.. I do mine 3 times a week for maintenance I do mine before bedtime and when you wipe just dab gently Hmm okay. I have to do mine twice a day as I have just started with it Less than you think. A small pea sized amount should be enough.  It should soak in within 10-30 minutes so do not worry if you use the restroom and wipe off the remains after that. Similarly try to avoid sexual activity for about thirty - sixty minutes and wipe off before intercourse. If it is prescription, there is a fair amount of evidence suggesting that those using the ointment rather than the cream achieve remission quicker. I had to do that to when I stated my mine 12 years ago When I get flair up then it is every day for two weeks. All of this exactly. Not sure if this is an issue - but ointment (a little or a lot) seems to work better than cream for me, but applying it always leaves a mess under my nails. I keep disposable gloves in my bathroom to apply the medicine.", "Does this sound like LS? Any ideas welcome. Hi there! I am a 25 y/o female and I have been dealing with intermittent vulva and vaginal itching since October 2020. Since then, I have been treated for ureaplasma, BV, yeast, etc and yet here I am still all these months later still dealing with the exact same sensation of itchiness.\n\nI do not have any white patches. Upon looking at the skin, I would say (and docs say) it looks normal. But every so often a few times a day I get these random pangs of itchiness. Best way to describe it. They are almost like itch palpitations? That sort of shoot up randomly in my labia. Like, the skin is not itchy similar to yeast infections/herpes/etc. it is just these seemingly random itch -pangs- It is so so frustrating and uncomfy!! I went to my derm and she thought it could be LS. But I have no white patches at all! Is that necessary? She put me on clob &amp; tacrolimus, and nothing seems to have calmed these itchiness pangs. \n\nHave any of you felt similar symptoms with LS? I am tired of the misdiagnosis and want to get off any unnecessary meds. I have been wondering if it is a reaction to certain foods? I do not know. Thanks for any help. The way you describe your itching makes me wonder if you are experiencing some sort of pudendal neuralgia-type issue. I think I understand what you mean...it is not like a normal itchy feeling, it is more like a sudden attack that feels like it shoots or crawls? Yes, it definitely feels like it shoots and crawls. But it is not a pain! It is closer to an itch. If i just like put pressure on the area for a second it is totally resolved, and then I feel totally fine. But the crawly itch can last for a few seconds. I have never heard of pudendal neuralgia, but it seems like that is more of pain shooting? Nerves can do weird things! I thought about the pudendal nerve because your description reminds me of something I feel - I have radiculopathy from some damaged nerves as a result of multiple back injuries and a failed back surgery. Most of the time I feel sensations I would classify as pain in my legs and feet, but sometimes I feel something similar to the way you describe it: this weird, sudden pang of itchiness that seems to suddenly shoot across my foot. I also have to apply pressure to get it to stop and then it is fine. Because of where it is happening, I know it is coming from my nerves because I can trace the path of that nerve using a dermatome map to it is origin at the nerve root in my spine where I have the damage. \n\nObviously everyone experiences things differently and I do not mean to imply it could not possibly be LS or another issue, but your description just sounded so much like the weird itchy sensation I get I wanted to mention it just in case all the other paths you investigate end up not being the reason for what you are feeling. \n\nDo you notice the itchiness at any specific times or if you are in a specific position like sitting or something? Keeping a journal of the time and what you were doing when you notice the symptoms is super helpful to establish patterns. You could also keep track of what you are eating to see if there is a pattern. No, that is super helpful, thank you! I will definitely bring it up to my doctor. Unfortunately I have not been able to pin it down \u2014 it seems like maybe at night it is worse, after showers it is worse, and occasionally after meals? I have not pinpointed specific foods however. But thank you so much! Try getting your B12 levels checked. I would get these weird tingly feelings shooting from my foot to my lady bits. I have not had it happen since I supplemented with B12. Wow this is super interesting. I think my levels were rather low at my last physical, so that really could be something! Hi! Did you ever get a diagnosis ? I have the same symptoms as you (and currently waiting for a ureaplasma retest to make sure the antibiotics got it) No I did not! I am still dealing with the itchy pangs, albeit less frequently. I have found when I am sweaty it exacerbates it. What are your symptoms? i have shooting pains and weird palpitating sensation when i do not apply protopic for a couple days, it used to kill me before i started medication, then disappeared when i started. i ran out of the ointment for a bit and it restarted. seems worse after masturbation.\n\ni am a dude btw", "Tentative diagnosis and confused about different approaches from different doctors Hi everyone,\n\nI have been reading through some of the posts and this seems like a really helpful and supportive place. I could use some support right now, feeling a bit overwhelmed right now.\n\nI \\ currently have a tentative diagnosis of LS. I first went to my GP late 2020 and she said that while I have some LS symptoms, it does not look textbook, so it could be a lot of things. I have a white patch of thicker skin on the left side of my clitoris. I do not have any itching, burning, or inflammation. She prescribed me really mild corticosteroid cream and I used that (along with a lot of vaseline) for 4 weeks. It did not do much. She referred me to a gyno/derm, whom I will be seeing late March.\n\nThen a few days ago, I discovered a small lump on the top/left of my clitoris, healthy pink-ish in colour, but definitely new. After a bit of catastrophising (lump = cancer, thank you Dr google) I called the gyno who advised me to go to my GP as it was not possible to move up my appointment. Unfortunately my GP, who had been my GP for almost 10 year, is specialised in gyno and menstrual issues and whom I feel really comfortable with/trust, left the practice. My new GP's approach seems completely different. During the visual inspection she said that she was not sure that it was LS, because other than the white patch, my skin looks very healthy. She thankfully did not think the lump was anything to worry about. But after the exam, it seemed like she made her mind up that I do have LS and prescribed me a much heavier corticosteroid cream. It feels a bit unsettling that it went from 'hmm not sure' to 'yep LS' in a few minutes. She also did not take a lot of time to explain it to me and ended the appointment quite quickly.\n\nNow I am a bit all over the place. My first GP had a plan of action that we were carrying out and the next step was the gyno/derm. The new GP, however, thinks I should start applying the cream once a day immediately and wants to follow up with me in two weeks to see if it has had any effect. Will it be harmful to use the cream if I do not have LS? Has anyone else had a little lump appear due to LS? It feels a bit like I have two different plans of action from two different doctors. I guess I will follow the new GP's plan as she has the most up to date information but the difference in approaches is a bit jarring. And I am still a bit worried about the lump.\n\nI am not sure if anyone is able to answer any of those questions but it feels good to have typed this out. I would love to hear any similar or totally different diagnosis stories! Any thoughts or suggestions would also be really appreciated!\n\n\\\n\nEdit to correct who/whom - haha thanks RossGellerBot", "Cortison treatment without confirmed diagnosis ? Hello everyone,\n\nI am new to this topic because I have just discovered that the recurring yeast infection I am treating over 10 month now\n_may_ be linked to LS. (I have read of LS before, but I did not thought of it regarding myself.)\n\nMy background:\nI am 32f. I have discovered a small shiny white area located above my urethra opening at the beginning of this year, but thought nothing of it initially. Back than I started checkin my vulva regularly due to my YIs and I thought I have noticed thr area growing a bit, but I tried to dismiss that due to my overactive anxious mind. I have never asked my gyno, who I see nearly once a month because of the YIs, because I was afraid of getting told that it is normal and just my imaginiation. I tried to not look at my vulva to much in the last 3 month in order to try to remove my mental focus from my YI hoping that reduces my stress a bit. So I did not look for changes anymore. I have visited my gyno again this wednesday with my regular YI problems because the office is closing for some weeks now due to vacation (good for the doctors and the staff :) ). I gathered all my mental strength and asked her if she could look at that spot because I am curious if that is normal. She did not notice all the month before but she said now I told her, she knows immediately what I mean. She than said it coud be LS, but she hopes for my sake that it is not and that we will observe it. (I did not mention LS to her. She brought it up herself.)\nToday I have looked at the spot myself for the first time in month and I have noticed that it is bigger and not just above the urethra opening but also around it. (I am a bit annoyed by myself that I did not look before the gyno visit because now I have to wait some weeks to tell her that I am sure it grows.)\nAt the moment the most YI itching is gone but it still itches a bit and when I try to locate that area I have to admit that it originates from the white shiny area. And maybe that is where it has been itching when my YI have cleared up for time weeks but I still had itching.\n\nWhat I would like to know: \nI have read that it is not recommended to just use cortisone just on suspicion of LS. But I would like to try (when my gyno is back) before getting a biopsy. What is your experience with this - did you get cortisone cream before you hs further testing?\n\n(Addition question if anyone likes to answer: Is there a chance that the white area will disappear if it is treated early enough or is that already scarred skin? I do not mind it at the moment, but of cause it would be nice if it would grow healthy again to prevent further problems with my urethra.)\n\nThank you. :) Please go and see a dermatologist who is familiar with LS.\nRead threads on here. This is treatable.\nThe two most used corticosteroid creams are betamethasone and clobetasol.\nMake sure you are dry after using rest room. \nRead articles online. Btw this is XCB OR XOB in Europe wheren you are searching.\nGood luck. Thank you.\n\nI have found a LS society online from switzerland  that seems to provide good information in my language. Therefore I know it is somehow treateable and like with all autoimmune diseases it is health impacts depend on everyones personal health / immune system.\n\nI will look into finding an LS dermatologist. And continue reading here. What I have read so far here it seems you guys and gals are very civil with the topic and try to prevent people from beeing afraid of having LS. I like that. :)\n\nWhat do you mean with \"XCB\" or \"XOB\"? Sorry I got it wrong\nLichen Sclerosus, also known as Lichen Sclerosis or Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans (BXO), My Gyno straight up diagnosed me with LS \u2014 I did not have any white patches, but some texture which confused the doctors during my biopsy. Upon further internet investigation, I noticed a lot of people have this as part of their skin texture. Though I was also experiencing YI symptoms, and was treated many times for it, my vulva was so red and sore, and the Gyno told me my inner labia has disappeared. (As far as I can remember, I never had an inner labia. Everyone is different.) I was prescribed Clobetasol even before I could get a biopsy. I highly suggest you start treating it as soon as possible, if you do have LS. Apparently the ointment can make the white patches disappear over time. Try to see a dermatologist that can get you a biopsy. I am still waiting for my results, but using the ointment. Some days I feel better than others, it is a bit confusing. I have also seen stories of people having skin yeast, which would also be shown in a biopsy. Best of luck! Thank you! \n\nHow does it feel for you mentally to have LS? Since I cannot have a gyno all I can say is this was misdiagnosed by 3 GP's over 25 yrs. My dermatologist thought I knew I had it ! The diagnosis came several years later when I had an issue following a yeast infection, foreskin shrunk and gave me betamethasone. Later when I had pain with an adhesion she said what it was and the cream did not help. Well I only used the cream for 3 days till foreskin was restored. We then tried the cream again on 2 twice a day 2 weeks then twice a week indefinitely. If a flare up back to twice a day 2 weeks. It been slow going but adhesions that have been fused for 25 yrs at least are finally improving, if a bit painfully. Been a bit over a year.\nBTW my new urologist does not have any other Male patients with LS I always get a little nervous to say this on this subreddit, but the use of corticosteroids is absolutely not curative and can be incredibly damaging over the long term. After 6 years on high-potency steroids, I developed vascular insufficiency that is directly attributed to my use of these creams, and my LS 'came back' with a vengeance. After having, treating, managing and loathing LS for the past 14 years, I absolutely recommend you look into 3 things.\n\n1. A very good acupuncturist that you could affordably get treatment from on a weekly basis (in my personal experience, I used an acupuncturist who had a specialty in fertility and women's health)\n2. A gut healing diet, like GAPS or AIP or Dr. Wahl's to treat gut/whole body inflammation.\n3. Low-dose Naltrexone\n\nEdit: To add to this and answer your question specifically, treating early is essential, but I do not think I would advise steroids. They are great to use for the immediate reduction of inflammation, but they are simply not the solution long-term. That white patch can heal with the treatments above, but the long-term damage caused by steroids, including scarring, loss of architecture, etc. cannot. I also would suggest you invest in some high-quality emu oil. It can be great for irritation and inflammation when applied topically. It feels horrible. For about 2 weeks I was severely depressed, could not even eat. Some moments throughout the day I am in pain, some days are worse than others, and that really puts me down. I have not slept fully through the night, I guess anxiety wakes me up. But I suppose I am getting better as time goes on. I have accepted that I have this regardless of not having a true biopsy answer yet. Just to make it easier on myself. Hopefully things do actually get better. It is a bit rough, as my Gyno told me to use Vaseline for dryness, yet the hospital that gave me the colposcopy told me not to use anything else but the clobetasol and some estrogen cream. And my Gyno strongly advised against the estrogen cream. It is hard when you cannot get proper help and answers, but I guess there is a learning curve to see what works best for everyone. I hope that helps. I am sorry to hear that it is so hard for you. I hope it get's easier soon. I wish you all the best. \ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf3b\n\nETA: Thank you for your honest answer! I appreciate that very much. Thank you! I hope it gets easier for you as well and you can find the help and answers you are looking for. \ud83d\udc95 Thank you for sharing your experience.\n\nI have read about the problem of long-term steroid cream. The medical articles also share your opinion of steroids being a problem that need better replacement. I have read about the suggestion of Pimecrolimis but it is not approvef for general use at the moment (where I live) and there are no long-term experiences with this treatment yet.\n\nI will keep your diet suggestions in mind. As always a healthy diet/lifestile can help with a lot of problems. Thank you!\n\nI am afraid it is easier at the moment until the anxiety hits me when/if I get (near) an official diagnosis. But life goes on... It sucks that you have been misdiagnosed for so long and that the miscommunication with your dermatologist caused you several more years. \n\nI wish you that it continues to get better with the treatment. \ud83c\udf40 Yes indeed, life sure does go on! It is what I keep telling myself every day. Do not be a stranger to get in touch if anything, it is definitely nice to talk to others that are going through the same thing. Thank you that is very kind of you! \ud83e\udde1\nI hope you have someone to talk to. \ud83c\udf3b\n\nI think there is still a part of me that hopes that I am on the wrong track and it all goes away, because it was just a short talk with my gyno, it is just a suspicion at the moment and I have been wrong in the past with other health stuff. Also it could \"solve\" my 10 month yeast infection problem if we now the \"cause\" or at least a part of the cause. So short term it feels like a good thing to get an explanation for the yeast problems, but that blocks out the long-term problem at the moment... I feel the exact same way. Most people are not lucky enough to get an answer, and if LS is the case and never found, it could be dangerous. Unfortunately a few years ago I had a GP send me to get a biopsy and see a Gyno suspecting \u2018cancer\u2019 because I did not have an inner labia. (I never remember having one) but they found nothing. So after getting all these symptoms years later, I have been a little angry at the carelessness of doctors, but at the same time I am glad it is not worse than it is and this could possibly be the answer. It is reassuring to have a possible name for it and to know more doctors are becoming aware. I really hope it gets better, as most say it does. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udf38 I have noticed most doctors will not touch sensitive subjects unless you bring them up or use a word they can then use. I do not blame them, we live in a strange world sometimes. Sometimes if someone looks for something specific like cancer cells they overlook that there is something else. It sucks none the less.\n\nI wish you that it gets better. \ud83c\udf40 I am curious to know if your white patch has a different texture. What does it feel like to the touch? Is it thicker skin? It does not feel different to me. It is even with surrounding skin. Is looks just white. \nBut I am not sure if the area located above is different - more uneven/rutted (i do not know the english word). I do not know if it is normal for me at that location because I have not examined that skin before my yeast problem.\n\nI am sorry that I do not have a more clear answer for you. Can you give a link? What language is it in ? Thanks (\n\nI read it in german, but it proveds different languages. I added the link for the english version.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Sorry, for the late reply) Thanks have opened link and bookmarked!  Downloaded some docs. Will move them to my computer and read or print. \nGood luck !", "Biopsy site swollen? I have had my biopsy near clitoris done about 32hours ago and my doctor looked at it today in the morning and said it looked fine, but looked very superficially and quickly so I would rather make sure by asking here. Was your biopsy site swollen for a long time after the procedure? I made the mistake of disturbing my site after a few days and it swelled, but I left it alone/cleaned it and it went back to normal. If this is a perpetual issue, maybe try leaving it alone and ensuring that it is clean to see if the swelling goes down. Additionally, it is going to be a bit swollen no matter what for the first couple days. It is an injury to the skin and the body will treat it as such. \n\nIf the issue persists, I would advise speaking to your doctor about it and relating your concern in a way that cannot be disregarded. Mine was massively stolen. My left labia looked about 4 times the normal size. It ended up getting super infected that I spent most of the night in emergency. Make sure to keep it as clean as possible. Good luck! Thanks! It got smaller after a few days and now it is almost the normal size so I think I am okay luckily.", "Newly Diagnosed Help wanted Hey!\n\nI am 18 and after being in unbearable pain for the past 2 months I was diagnosed with LS. My doctor prescribed me mometasone and told to use it once a day till my flare-up cleared. I did so for about a week and a half and I felt back to \u201cnormal\u201d. Then I started my period and I use pads and a few days into it i felt like my skin was getting itchy and raw again and my labia is swollen and sensitive and realized that the friction and the material of the pad was irritating me. I am going to switch over to cloth pads and I have started using the cream the doctor prescribed to me again but I am curious about what are some things that can trigger a flare-up for you all and if there is anything I should be aware of? Also my doctor did not say anything about fusing or mention following up for fusing but should I be going in for follow ups to check for fusing?\n\nAlso can I apply a moisturizer over the steroid treatment? Like emu oil?\n\nI am just new to this and looking for some guidance. I cannot speak for the ointment question but when I shower, I use CeraVe hydrating cleanser. It is meant mostly for your face but you can use it on your body. (The green bottle, not the sea foam bottle. One has a shampoo type texture and the other is like foam with alcohol which you do not want) I use it like a feminine wash per my dermatologists recommendations. It helps keep my skin from drying and cracking. It is the only thing I use now unless I am having a flare up from sweating too much or salt water(then I use Clobetasol ointment). I used tampons when I was first undiagnosed bc like you mentioned, the friction and the moisture from the pads. Using tampons made things much more bearable. But I know not everyone is comfortable with tampons or cups. Whatever you do, do not use wet wipes bc it can spread the LS to your butthole. It also makes your symptoms worse. If you need to \"refresh\" yourself, just take a wet paper towel to do it. Okay, Thank You! Salt baths. Unscented. Warm but not hot water. The paper pads for my period DESTROY me. I have cloth ones for night that actually are amazing for absorbency. And then I use a diva cup during the day. \n\nAlso the steroid cream does not have to be everyday. My dr recommended vaseline or Shea butter or coconut oil just on the irritated areas and it does help. Steroid cream is much more effective for actually treating the flare ups so I am not recommending to replace that entirely with the alternatives. But those alternatives are super helpful for irritation on non prescribed cream days I have not heard of this \u201cspreading\u201d LS with wet wipes. That is interesting. Just wondering how that is different from a wet paper towel? My doctor actually said it is helpful to carry a pack of unscented/simple wet wipes for the days I am irritated because dry toilet paper could irritate it more ... Emu oil can be used before or after applying your medication. I prefer to use it before so it helps spread the ointment and I only use the tiniest amount that way. Switch everything that touches your anogenital area to natural fabric/cleansers. My period was a huge source of flare ups, so I got an IUD to stop them. A few months later I had my first exam without further damage - something I had not thought possible after almost 8 years! My flair ups are always around ovulation and period times... I cannot use pads at all.. only wicking material and I use a divacup that has helped a lot.. unfortunately I didnt catch my LS until I had a lot of phimosis and scarring already done.. staying on top of the treatment is the best option.. for me too much moisture is just as bad as pads so I try to keep fairly dry under bits and just use the cream and I shower with just water and maybe baby soap if I feel I need it but that is like once or twice a month. Thanks for the information about emu oil! I am on nexplanon and I hope my period will stop in a few months Good to know. I think I am going to change my body wash to avoid extra irritation Will definitely keep up with the alternatives when not using the steroid treatment My physiotherapist recommended Filofax diaper cream, I am pretty much in constant flare up nowadays and my skin is super thin so I am hesitant to use the steroid cream too much. The Filofax provides me with some pretty serious relief but does not do anything for the flare up. I think I have had LS for a lonnngggg time but it was just discovered in May so I do not really know what I am doing. Just waiting on a referral for a specialist that has more experience with it. I am frustrated and uncomfortable with the whole thing at this point.", "Does this sound like LS? Hi everyone, I have been experiencing some symptoms for the past couple of months and I am wondering if anyone in the community can say if they have experienced something similar.\n\nI am 21F. Lately, my vulvar skin has become extremely sensitive. I had an STD scare so I have become very self-aware of my body. I was tested for everything and came back negative (although I would be lying if I said I still was not the slightest bit worried about that still. But that is for another sub\u2026) \n\nAnyway, my vaginal opening, posterior fourchette, perineum and anal areas are consistently dry. Sometimes there will be white, flaky skin. But the most concerning of all is that I get cuts down there - ALL the time. The slightest irritation (toilet paper or wearing a thong) will tear me apart, or even if nothing has happened to the area at all. I have not had sex since March, but ai think if I did ai would be torn apart. \n\nThe cuts will usually be in the exact same spot. This happens multiple times per week and usually they will heal within a day or two and just come back. They will sting a little when I go to the bathroom or wipe. My labia majora also looks more wrinkly, and there are spots there, my moms pubis and my groin area that look like little craters that the skin is very thin. \n\nSo what do you all think? Has anyone experienced similar and what helped with the irritation and dryness? I am at a loss. I would definitely see a doctor about this. This sounds similar to my story. Sex was always painful for because, because, as I learned later, LS can cause the skin to Crack, fissure, tear, etc. due to changes in the skin from the inflammation caused by the LS. That and dryness were my two chief complaints. I was young and did not understand why I was so dry down there but I kept being told nothing was wrong. I have an awareness and information page on Instagram  which is the name of my blog since I lost my Labia minora to the disease. Feel free to message me any time to chat. But the white patches, and stinging from the cuts are very classic LS symptoms. Ideally, your doctor would perform a biopsy for differential diagnosis, but a biopsy is not necessary for LS. Because I went untreated for over a decade, my LS progressed so much that by the time the doctor I have now saw me, she instantly knew it was LS. Regardless of if it is LS, for the dryness, I would suggest using an emollient. I use coconut oil, cleo by damiva, and yes ob, but you could also try olive oil, castor oil, vmagic etc. For the stinging on the fissures when you pee, try using a peri bottle bottle to clean after urinating instead of toilet paper. Thank you for this insightful comment. I just checked out your Instagram, you are a beautiful person who is helping so many people! :) I am going to message you I also experienced the dryness, and irritation. At first when I got looked at by doctors they said I looked completely fine but I did not feel fine! You can read more about my diagnosis in my comments and posts. I was the same way for years. Chronic itching and burning irritation at first. Then the skin became very thin and shiny looking. Micro tears formed and toilet paper felt like razor blades. After awhile it started to develop excessive skin cells which I later learned was squamous hyperplasia on top of the LS through a biopsy. My GP did not take my concerns seriously and gave me diaper rash cream as treatment. Seriously?? Forget the family doctor and go straight to a gynaecologist who can better identify these types of skin diseases. LS symptoms can go undiagnosed for years and can later develop into VIN if left untreated for a long time. VIN is a precancerous condition so you definitely do not want that. LS and squamous hyperplasia together as I had also increases the risk of it developing into cancer which happened to me. Hope you get some relief as LS is an autoimmune condition and must be managed for life. Good luck. This sounds exactly like how my LS started when I was 22/23. Seems to be in remission now, definitely see a Dr if you can. Hydromol for washing/moisturising is a god send. I found swapping baths for showers (although baths feel soothing at the time) definitely helped and not wearing underwear/pants to bed. Also switching to non-bio laundry tabs.", "Not LS  Could be LSC (lichen simplex chronicus). But it does not come with the white patches. Have you considered vulvar eczema? I do not think it is either of those if I am honest with you. Images look different to mine, so confusing and something that constantly plays on your mind Have you considered genital psoriasis? I hope you find the answers you are looking for! I have seen two different gynecologist nurse practitjoners and two different dermatology nurse practitioners and all of them dismissed me for lichen sclerosis.\n\nI have clearly definined white patches on the both labias right before it separates from the mons.\n\nI have itching that comes and goes, this has drastically decreased after I stopped shaving and switched to dove sensitive skin for cleaning.\n\nThe skin is wrinkly and thinner on my labia and slight discolored.\n\nWhen this flare up initially started two years ago I had tearing, itching and the white patches came out of no where.\n\nI am in the same boat as you, keep getting dismissed but obviously I think something is wrong, personally it looks like early stages of lichen to me but I am not sure.\n\nI will be demanding a biopsy at my next visit. Could be some sort of allergy. Start first by take a antihistamine. Maybe look into diet. Gluten and dairy no bueno. Genuinely wondering about getting a biopsy done if not actively flaring up? Is that even a thing? Asking because I regret not getting one done when I really should have. \n\nI *did not* because I was a terrible, horrible  mental state... It was bad. By the time I got to see a specialist as recommended by my first gyno, I was in the thick of a flare up that nearly broke me. I was *literally* climbing the bathroom wall from the pain. If I was not gripping and climbing the wall, I was frozen with fear of how much it was going to hurt if I peed.... either paralyzed or hysterical. \n\nI shuffled into the clinic that day SO scared... When I saw the doctor and she asked how I was, I managed to smile and tell her that today was a good day because I actually managed to put pants on that day.... kind of of because I had to, lol. \n\nAfter getting the exam and breaking down crying from the mental anguish, I actually ASKED for a biopsy... Because I also have HPV history and knew it was important... However, I, in my really broken head space, allowed myself to leave without one. \n\nWhy? Because the specialist advised that I was SO raw that she did not want to add further trauma to my lady bits. She thought it was highly likely LS as my gyno suspected... and told me that the CP ointment should help and that we can revisit   when things calm down in my knickers. I was alone and did not want to risk driving home after a biopsy down there. I mean, I was trying to \u201cfloat\u201d my ass over the driver seat getting to the specialist that day. \n\nSo, I left with no biopsy... And am kicking myself for it.", "Anyone who have been using both dermovat and protopic/tacrolimus? Experiences?My doctor put me on protopic (3 months) and I have used it 2x daily for a month now. No change in white spots at glans, theyre as visible as before. Could dermovat be a better option to cure discolouration? I am a male btw  Dermovate would be a better choice. Tacrolimus tends to be a fall back option if dermovate does not work or steroids are not appropriate generally due to some other condition. Is there a reason your doc chose tacrolimus? Clob is usually the first line treatment. \n\nI was on clob 2x/day for vulvar LS but switched to tacrolimus 2x/day, but my dermatologist said I can even use both if I need to. \n\nIf it is not working, you should definitely ask your doc about switching. But, no change in the white spots does not necessarily mean that it is not working. In fact, if they have not grown at all, that might suggest that it *is* working. \n\nI am not sure how much discoloration is expected to improve with treatment, but my impression is that treatment should mainly assuage symptoms and prevent *new* discoloration. I was on clob for about 1.5 months and I have been on tac for a few more, and I do not think my white spots have changed much. Did you ask your doctor about the discoloration tho? If it is permanent or not?\nSome people say that it takes time but they will eventually fade away with treatment! \n\nGood luck on your recovery! He said they were scars so permanent, but I cant understand how theres no treatment for that. I will try borax baths I think", "23 M - A few questions Hi,\n\nI have been diagnosed with LS after a long drawn out process with GP and hospital appointments. \n\nAfter 10 months and the hospital forgetting to inform me about my approved funding for surgery, I have finally been put forward for circumcision but they said this could still take 2 years to happen (even though funding only lasts a year).\n\nI have a few questions for any man (women can also help!) with LS, both physically and mentally related.\n\nDoes it spread? The whole back of my head of the penis is white, I can almost see it from the front, and there are a couple areas on the front which are going a bit pale. If these turn white my whole penis may as well be white.\n\nThe inside of my foreskin is also white (like 70%), however the skin is going rubbery, making it worse when pulling back the skin.\n\nDoes continuing to use the steroid medication encourage it to spread to unaffected areas? \n\nDoes the condition improve after circumcision?\n\nIs there any chance the whiteness can go back? (Probably a stupid question, but I am genuinely asking out of desperation)\n\nWhat was your sex life like after being diagnosed? How do you go about telling a girl without freaking them out and them thinking it is an STD or something they could catch? \n\nAlso does LS impact fertility? I have tried looking this up but no answers.\n\nAnd mentally, how do you guys cope with it? Recently I have been struggling loads just thinking about the impact this could have on my life.\n\nI appreciate any help, gp and hospital has been borderline negligent with me so I just need some reassurance. Lady here! I will try and help with the things that I can hahah\n\nI do believe LS has the potential to spread but if you treat the skin delicately and sensibly you can reduce the chances of it covering more of your skin I am sure. Just bear in mind it is an autoimmune condition and skin in particular can be quite unpredictable.\n\nI am not so knowledgeable on the impact of LS on men but if you feel your foreskin has gone rubbery making it difficult to move I would recommend applying something to soften the skin when you are not using your steroid treatment like a non-perfumed emollient (like medical level) or something like olive oil or coconut oil. \n\nI would not imagine that the steroid medication encourages spreading of LS as it is proven to heal skin, manage flare ups, slightly reverse discolouration in some people and stop it from turning into something more sinister so I would say steroid treatment is your friend for now! \n\nI have seen other men post on here that circumcision can help keep the area dry and clean etc and if the LS is primarily on the foreskin it can make a real improvement for them so I think just giving the tip of the penis space to breathe will be good I guess haha (I will leave that to a man to tell you for sure though) \n\nMy drs have told me steroid treatment can help put more colour back into the skin but it differs from person to person.\n\nFor the intimacy and sex situation, do not do anything you are not comfortable doing, this really will be for a man to talk with you about but honesty is the best policy and be clear and honest with your sex partner that this is a chronic condition, they cannot catch it, it is not an Std, there is nothing you have done to get this condition. If she reacts badly or makes you feel weird, head for the hills, you do not want to associate with that. \n\nI think a lack of apparent information about LS and fertility works in your favour here! As it is a skin condition and can appear anywhere, I do not believe it has an impact on male or female fertility at all, it is simply just intrusive and can make sex uncomfortable if not managed or treated respectfully so I guess that is a natural birth control? Haha, but no I think you are fine on the fertility front! \n\nI cope with this condition by surrounding myself with like minded individuals (you lot) and try to help others with the things I know I can. The information I share is what my medical professionals have told me or things I find work for me. You can always seek a therapist who will give you tips to manage your worries or low moods. But if you are not so keen on that option, we are here to help as best we can! \n\nHope this helps! Honestly thank you so much for this response.\n\nI try to not think about it too much but it is been a frustrating time dealing with the hospital recently and they have not exactly been reassuring (the consultant who saw me was the worst I have ever dealt with in terms of being disrespectful) so I think that has overwhelmed me a little with my condition.\n\nI will definitely look into getting some oil or something sensible to apply to the area as I remember being told not to use the steroid cream for prolonged periods unless told to. \n\nMy condition can flare up quite a bit which is when the mental side of things hit, so even if a slight improvement of colour happens that will help.\n\nI guess the whole sex thing can be down to maturity and experience as a whole, but glad to hear that it is not necessarily a fertility issue as I do really want kids at one point in life.\n\nI have considered some form of therapy, probably at the back of a very long queue in terms of getting it on healthcare and I think I am priced out of private therapy so will just have to keep looking around.\n\nI appreciate you taking time out of your day to reply, it is helped a lot! :) Honestly it is not a problem! I was told before I began my treatment that prolonged use of steroids is not advised but when I got my diagnosis that changed because there is no other effective treatments currently, and they would far rather cope with manageable side effects of steroids than a painful autoimmune condition that destroys you physically and mentally!! \n\nTake care of yourself man, you are doing great!! Hi sorry to hear about your LS. it can be difficult to get diagnosed it needs to be seen by a dermatologist or urologist with a understanding of the condition. hopefully now the condition has been diagnosed it will improve with treatment. at the moment the steroid cream is you best option on tell you circumcision the steroid cream should slow if not stop the LS from spreading. I think you have it quite extensively on your glans and foreskin so I would push to get circumcised as soon as you can and maybe even privately if possible. Hopefully it should improve after the circumcision and the discoloration might fade but it all depends on how badly your affected. \nSex life can be uncomfortable with the LS the foreskin can become sore. You should talk to your girlfriend and explain about your condition it is not infectious so you cannot give it to anyone and it should not affect fertility.\nTry not to worry too much about it as this can make it worse. there are some helpful forums like this one you can get some advice from other guys who have gone through the same thing. Be strong Man \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Hi! I have vulvar LS.\nMy vulva was mostly white but after using the steroid ointment, I am mostly my normal color again! Continued steroid use (twice weekly\u2026 3-4 days apart) is strongly recommended for the rest of your life to not only keep flare ups at bay and reduce symptoms, but to lower inflammation! \n\nI was honestly so insecure about having sex with this because aesthetically I know my vulva does not look like a porn star\u2019s vulva. I was with my ex before my diagnosis so I was all white and it was funky down there. He did not mind and still had oral and penetrative sex with me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so some women really may not care. I would not! But I am also biased clearly lol sex was less painful for me the more I treated my LS. I am in remission now. My med schedule went:\n\nOintment every night for a month \nOintment every other night for a month\nOintment two nights a week (Sunday &amp; Wednesday, or Monday and Thursday) for life. I know that sucks but it really keeps this thing under control!\nAlso soak before applying to soften the skin. LS is the thickening of skin, it is inflammation so you want to soften the skin up and then apply the ointment!\n\n\nLS does not impact fertility! Many people I know from support groups have had children. \n\nTo cope, I am still learning. You are not your illness. I know I am not either. Some days are good and I do not think about it until I have to put on my meds. Other days I cry because I cannot believe I won the draw and got this crap. But having a community or a support group helps!\n\nSending love! Always open to chatting &amp; answering questions! M37. Just my own observation, but the affected areas seem to be localized to where some irritant (likely urine) can sit. In my case I have some \"after drip\" after using the toilet and the affected areas exactly coincided with where a small amount of urine could potentially sit over a period of time (under the foreskin, on underwear, etc). I dont think you need to worry too much about spreading beyond those areas, but do whatever it takes to keep the areas clean (barrier creams can help as well).\n\nAlso, Clobetasol was extremely effective in my case, just give it some time.", " looking for guidance I am due a biopsy to confirm diagnosis of LS but due to coronavirus that is not possible at the moment. We think it is this, but not confirmed.\n\nI currently have a cream \"lotriderm\" which is betamethasone steroid and clotrimazole but does not seem to help much. There was talk of stronger steroids after diagnosis. I also have \"Dermol 500\" which is a microbial emmolient cream. \n\nMy current symptoms are redness, a raised white area on the top of my foreskin that is really sore when trying to retract the foreskin, and the foreskin as a whole is tighter and much harder to retract. The skin is starting to crack and break around the white area. I am hoping to get a phone/Skype consultation with my dermatologist soon, but due to the circumstances I am not sure when.\n\nWhat can I do to help loosen up the foreskin, try to reduce/remove the white area (which I assume is scarring/fusing) so that I can retract and clean under my foreskin. I am concerned about getting an infection (due to tight/cracking foreskin) to further complicate this, especially during such an unfortunate time for medical issues - any advice warmly welcomed! I am female with LS, so my advice is somewhat limited in regards to the foreskin, but I use aloe vera daily to avoid hardening and ease symptoms.  There is some clinical backing for aloe as a treatment, though more studies are needed.  Look for the most natural product you can find without additives.  Some companies will add green dye, but avoid those.  Aloe vera gel is very pale and not very green.  I use a product from Seven Minerals I ordered from Amazon (in the US, not sure your location).  They have an option to order it by the gallon, which I do since I use so much of it (my LS covers a large area, plus aloe is good for sunburns, burns, and some other maladies).  You can use the aloe while also treating with steroid.  I use the aloe in the morning and the steroid before bed.  When things are particularly bad, I also add aloe in the afternoon.\n\n\n\nIf you wear briefs, consider switching to loose boxers to limit irritation from clothes.\n\n\n\nThe good news for men is that, if it is LS, removing the foreskin usually eliminates the issue.  Of course, that would probably have to wait due to current circumstance, but at least there will be a light at the end of the tunnel for you.  Good luck! If your dr offers prescription steroid ointment clobetasol, take it. My dr said that if it is effective then that confirms the LS diagnosis Thank you very much I have a biopsy scheduled for Thursday now! Fingers crossed it is able to go ahead hydrate it h24.\n\nI use a first aid cream multiple times a day. Basically always have cream on my penis. Helped me tremendously over the last 3 years. \n\nWhen/if you start using cortisone, continue to hydrate it. You can even mix the 2 creams together. It is my daily life nowadays. good luck Is not the cortisone cream already hydrating a lot? I do not use cortisone often because its thinning the skin overtime. I keep it for when it hurts more than usual. I am a 40 yo female, diagnosed at age 26, with extensive fusing of my labia. I have been \u2018treated\u2019 with everything in the book, and nothing allopathic has worked at all. I have been on a very looong journey, but recently stumbled on this borax treatment, and it is completely working for me.\n\n\n\nI use a saturated solution 1x per day, and afterwards, I use emu oil, fresh aloe, or vitamin e oil, whatever\u2019s in reach, to provide a little skin lubricant to prevent the raw skin from refusing to itself. Each time I very gently put pressure on the skin to help it along. I have made the mistake of being impatient and forcing the skin, but this is a very slow and steady process, allowing the skin to unfuse just a thin crack where I can see raw pink skin, and then heal a bit, then a little more. I am literally regaining labial architecture that has been gone for years and the white patches are growing smalls! It has not been without pain, but I am thoroughly impressed. I do not have a foreskin, but I would think the process very similar.", "Timing of Flares Women in the group: do you typically flare at the same times in your cycle? I feel like I do during ovulation (which is a major bummer) and right before/during my period. Both of these would make sense because of the dip in estrogen I think. \n\nSometimes my flares are absolutely awful, but sometimes they are just mildly annoying. Is that still a flare? I am so confused by this condition and my dermatologist has not explained this super well. I have redness on the clitoral hood almost daily no matter what, and I have this feeling of fullness and soreness often. \n\nI am so afraid that I will never feel normal again. Been dealing with these symptoms almost 9 months straight (after the birth of my daughter) with only very small periods of relief. I continue to have such annoying irritation and burning with urination. I have noticed lately that I flare about 10 days before my period and then about a day before my period and through my period. I have a similar experience as you wherein sometimes they are mild and sometimes severe. \n\nI also noticed that my other autoimmune condition (interstitial cystitis) flares at the same time. \n\nI am trying to figure out something to ease my symptoms during this time. I have been taking baths and also looking into some products that were recommended by someone on this subreddit. Right now I am back on my clob regimen as well and avoiding alcohol and sugar. Helping slightly.\n\nYou are not alone Thank you so much. I really appreciate it! I flare right before my period and occasionally right after. I use my steroid twice a week normally, but if I am flared up I will use it daily for a few days which usually takes care of it. I call any increase in symptoms a flare and just make a note of the severity. Sometimes they are mild and other times they are fairly bad. \n\nOn the days that I do not use the steroid I make sure to keep the area moisturized with almond oil. It is really helped me with irritation overall. Thank you!!", "Punch biopsy I get a biopsy at the end of the month. How was the experience? Pain? Healing? Washing your body? Stitches? What was it like? I am terrified of needles and my doctor was not great at preparing me for the biopsy as far as what to expect, recovery, etc., so I had a terrible experience at the doctors office. Do not let that discourage you though, because the pain was not bad, I just had a lot of anxiety leading up to the biopsy. They gave me two numbing shots first, which was the only pain I felt. The biopsy was not painful at all, but there was more blood that I expected when I sat up afterwards. Did not require stitches and healed very quickly. My doctor prescribed me estrogen cream to help it heal but I did not even use it. That night I stayed on the couch because I was afraid moving would be painful, but the next day I was totally fine. I think it was helpful for me to look down there with a mirror, because the actual incision was much smaller than I expected and already looked better the next day, which was a big relief for me. It is been around 6 months and I still have a little scar/bump there. Looking back, it was a much bigger deal in my mind than in real life. i was so scared of it and put it off for months and months but i really did not think it was bad. numbing shot was the worst part and i would only give that a 2 or 3 out of 10 for any pain. i got dissolvable stitches that fully healed up in about 2 or 3 weeks! pain afterward for me was minimal to none. washing my body i was just very careful not to touch the stitches, and after going to the bathroom i rinsed the area with water to keep it clean. applies occasional neosporin as it was healing and took it easy on physical activity for a couple weeks. It was not painful at all! Do not be scared of it. Peeing was a bit painful afterwards and I still feel that there was something done down there (my biopsy was yesterday). There was a little bit blood in my pants yesterday but not worth worrying about - keep your head up and do not be too afraid - you can do it! For me getting the local anaesthetic was the worst part, that was pretty stingy ngl. But no worse than getting a tattoo.\nThe biopsy was fine, I could feel a tugging sensation when the nurse was stitching the wound up, but not in a painful way, just weird.\n\nAfter the anaesthetic wore off I was pretty sore. Peeing burned unless I sat on the toilet in a really specific way (chest nearly touching my knees)\n\nIt gradually got better and less painful every day.\n\nWear loose fitting clothing if you can and try not to over exert yourself.", "Cloudy white patches (not raised) on penis head Hi there! \nI have (21, M) had cloudy white patches on the head of my penis between the frenulum and urethra which has increased in size over the last 2 years or so, I have no pain but sometimes after I orgasm I notice a very slight burning sensation\nI masturbate daily (mostly without lube) and am sexually active (no chance of stds as we are both each others first partners but a precious experience with balanitis in the past) \nCould this be LS? It could be, particularly given the location on the glans ie a location where urine might naturally drain/get trapped. I would advise you to see a dermatologist to get it checked out. The sooner identified, the more effective the non-surgical treatment. I wish you all the best. How worried should I be? \nI have read/seen some bad things about this disease - at what point would it get bad to the point I cannot have sex/masturbate? - will it happen regardless of treatment?

Circumcision is c.90+% successful however I personally view Circumcision as an unattractive option (UK based where it is not common)\n\nIdentifying any disease early is always a good thing. I am in complete remission via steroid creams. It would be best to book some time with a dermatologist with experience with LS and establish what is actually your situation. Final question(thank you so much for the info)\nDid you go through your GP to get to a dermatologist? I am also in the UK I went privately to see a guy called professor Christopher Bunker - you can goggle him and he is on all the medical insurance panels - who is the leading clinician for penile LS, based in London. He will need a referral from a gp or other specialist. I was referred by my urologist who identified the condition and respected  my very visceral rejection of circumcision as a  treatment option. Bunker charges c.\u00a3300 for initial meeting and c.\u00a3180 thereafter. He is worth it. First it is now generally recognized circumcision is not a cure for this.\nMy worst white scaring is where you have it.\nI was prescribed betamethasone ointment by my dermatologist and it took about a year to remove.

To help each other out with what we found works, does not work, irritates or soothes! \n\nAny other questions I will gladly try answer them for you, but defo make that doctors appointment. Nothings for certain yet so try not to worry about the what ifs, it will drive you mad lol As you point out since this is rare you need a dermatologist that knows and treats this.\n GP's dont know this disease. Dont blindly get a circumcision. The steroid ointment will get rid of the phimosis. I have issues after using antibiotics and get fungal infections giving me phimosis. The steroid ointment fixed this in under a week. This lead to me being diagnosed a year later. \nAs pointed out this is not something that is cured. You treat the symptoms. After circumcision people get relapses ie it doesnt fix it forever.\nRead other posts on here. Yes everyone is different.\nGood luck.\n PS I got diagnosed 2 yrs ago but have been seeing GPs since 1980's with this. Progression is not inevitable; treatments like steroids should stop the progression in its tracks for most people. \n\nCircumcision is a common treatment for penile LS, even in early stages, because it is not considered to be a very invasive surgery and because it is pretty effective, not because it is absolutely necessary. Some people with penile LS just use topical treatments and do not get surgery if they do not want it. The only pictures for males that I found online looked like the LS was untreated for about 20 years or had progressed to a cancer. In a treated state it will look mostly normal. The only place I have found any pictures of mild cases or early cases is actually on this channel. My best description of LS is that the coloring looks \"sickly pale\" or \"off\" and the skin is thickened, slightly raised, and splits easily. If left long enough the coloring will become more pronounced. The white band around the foreskin eventually becomes unmistakable, but by that point its quite bad.", "How I am completely reversing my Lichen sclerosis naturally \n\n\n\nI know what your thinking, What BS is this. There is no way to way to reverse this disease. I know exactly where some of you are. Depressed, hopeless, alone. I was there. I hated my life. I have had lichen sclerosis for almost 2 years now. At first it was not bad, but then all of a sudden it got worse. For 8 months straight, 24 hours a day I was in pain. uncomfortable is a huge understatement. For 8 months I had no relief. Not one second. The little tiny bit of relief I got was when I smothered clobetosol on. It barely helped tho. It got to a point where I hated my life. My penis head went from pink to almost all white. The whole damn thing. It was so bad I could not even jerk off, let alone be with a women. If I did it was not fun and my symptoms were worse for the next few days. Nothing worked, I tried every diet from vegan to no sugar to no gluten to low Oxalate diet. Nothing worked at all. Ive always been a healthy guy. I have played sports and worked out my whole life. I am 23, it did not make sense and I had no clue why this was happening. I have always been a happy person and in the span of 8 months I am sad to say I genuinely hated living. Every day was a struggle from the time I got up to when I went to bed. My whole penis was turning white and I was actually concerned I might not be able to use it properly ever again or hell even lose it at that rate. I had been putting clobetosol on every day for months which ik is terrible but I did not care I just wanted that tiny bit of relief. Finally I knew I had to stop. I got this book a few months ago and never read it and decided I had nothing to lose.( man I wish I read it earlier) however I do not think I would have incorporated it if I were not in such a bad place. The Book is called \u201cLichen Sclerosus beating the disease\u201d by Ginny Chandoha. Since I finished the book and started \u201cthe healing protocol\u201d within it, I am a month and a half in and barely even notice my LS anymore. I was feeling real, natural relief within 2 weeks and it is been like my body is just healing itself since. I will say, it is not easy. It is a whole lifestyle change. the hardest part for me to accept was giving up all medicine( clob, tacrimulis, etc). I already know some people are ganna get mad at this and say not to tell people to go off the creams, and that there is no cure and I am not a doctor but idgaf. This shit fucking saved my life and If I can help just one person get better from what I learned no amount of money could replace that. I know what it is like to feel completely hopeless, and I do not want that for anyone. Think about this. The US makes up 5 percent of the world population but uses 65% of all prescribed medicine used in the world. All medicine prescribed and researched in the US is made to relieve SYMPTOMS, not to cure you. That is for any health problem. The medical industry is a billion dollar business. They do not want to cure you because then you have no reason to feed them more money. Doctors want best for you yes but they simply are taught to give you these pills and prescriptions. Tacromulus and clob will certainly help some people\u2019s symptoms, but your basically just putting a blanket over the real problem and turning a blind eye to underlying causes, while also maybe causing other problems down the line. To give a run down, a big part of the diet the book gave me was that, yes I had to eat \u201chealthy\u201d but EVERYTHING has to be organic. I am not ganna get into why because this is a long post and reading the book explains it all so well. Along with that it gives you suplements to take, detox teas, natural medicines that have worked wonders for me, and eliminating chemicals from your life. The idea is that America has 80,000 chemicals that are everywhere form your food to Beauty supplies, cleaning supplies and anywhere else you can think. These chemicals were introduced within the past 50 years or so( I forget exactly when) but new diseases and diseases that were very rare are rampant now. I read the book 2 months ago so I do not remember the facts very well now but the research done by the lady who wrote it is incredible. She turned over every stone. Anyways, through what I have learned in the book and applied, I barely ever notice my lichen sclerosis. That is incredible to me. I have my life back. I can go to the gym and not be in pain, put clothes on normal without a second thought instead of gingerly and dreadfully. The lifestyle is most certainly inconvenient and a good chunk of money, but I am in my body 100% of my life, no fucking break from that. I will spend the extra money without the bat of an eye to be healthy, especially when it comes to my lil soldier. No amount of money would make me go back to where I was. I cannot even describe how happy I was when I started to realize this was working. No creams that were ruining my penis skin or suprressing my immune system, just natural healing. She talks about this in the book, but I also had other small health problems go away that I thought were just part of life. This includes stomach pains, I was getting sharp cologne pains, a rash on my thigh disappeared. I also had just gotten diagnosed with vericoles veins which is when your vein in your testicles enlarges. It made my testicles swollen and hurt often and the doctor said could affect me from having kids. He said there is no cure for this except surgery which does not always even work. I shit you fucking not that is gone now. I have only been doing this for a month and a half 2 months. 2 months ago I was in constant pain, was told I might not have kids, my penis and balls in terrible shape, now I am healing. I think some pink is returning to my skin too, but honestly I am just happy to not be in pain. I still cheat and get hammered here and there and that usually leads to drunk demolishing of any of the old good foods, but it is hard to be perfect. I notice a slight back track but then I am right back on it and healing again. I went to Florida for a few days for work and could not eat organic and had drinks and I noticed it got slightly worse for the few days following as well. Sucks but just shows I have to stick with it or it is right back to where I was. Again, I am also only a 1.5 months in so I might be able to get away with more when I am more fully recovered. I am no where near fully recovered but on a great path. As I stated before the book has a year long healing protocol. It is also a little hard sometimes dealing with it in social situations and even family members who do not know why I eat organic. They just think I am a weird health nut but You cannot care what others think. I know a lot of you have spouses and it will be a lifestyle change for them too with cleaning supplies and detergent changes as well. If they love you they will support you. Tbh I am terrified to ever get a gf and have to explain why tf I have to do all this but that is life man fuck it. Do not care what others think go for what you want and do what you have to do to live YOUR life healthy and happy. There is a lot more things from the book that I have not explained but I have said the main parts. Please ask me if you have questions or concerns about this but I hope you guys try it and if you do let me know!!!It is changed my life. Good luck to all of you, things get better I promise. I am here to help.\n\nbook- lichen sclerosis beating the disease by Ginny Chandoha Is this for real? I am glad you are at least aware and know it sounds too good to be true. Yes it is true, I am amazed no one has talked about this book in the forum, it changed my life. Plz ask questions if you have any I would love to help. You said you applied steroid cream pretty often and you even believe it caused some skin damage. Since this whole protocol thing, how has that improved? How has the LS in general improved specifically? Yeah I think I was starting to get some atrophy but I used it for a long time with no breaks. My white patches are dulling, new spots stopped appearing and the old are starting to blend in more with the skin around it, less noticeable Hey dude, that is super awesome that you are getting good results from goin all natural and organic.  I totally believe in the benefit of that stuff.  Thanks for sharing your story.  I have had pretty bad pain in my nuts for a couple years now.  This is the first time I have heard of this in LS patients.  I have had terrible pain around my psoas muscles/ inguinal lymhonode area for even longer..  you have anything like that?   Could not hurt to try, I do want to stress that there is soooo much more to the program in the book than just eating organic so do not expect to just only eat organic and be good If that pain is lower stomach area which I think it is then yes I used to get random very sharp pain. I forgot about that I have not had that either The pain im talking about is more like in the front of my waist area. Its bellow the stomach, right where my hip bends in the front. Flexing my hip flexor or psoas muscles makes it hurt more. \n\n Anyway,  its too bad it does not sound like a very easy solution you found.  Most people just want a simple fix without having to drastically change their lifestyle.  You know, like the people who get their stomach stapled instead of doing diet and excercise.. I have dropped clob too and is feeling much better. I have grown up eating organic so i am used to that. However, i switched out all sugars with artificial sweetening products vecause it helped me tons, but i guess they count as toxins too \ud83d\ude28 I might buy this book if my current method stops working. I find it difficult to not be scared of not using the clob, we have so many years ahead of us, what if not using it will ruin our futures!? I guess all i can do is trust the signals my body is sending me even though my health care professionals thinks I am crazy...  Yes I had the same pain for over a year before this shit came to the surface. This could be an important key for understanding more about this. For me it kind of all happened at the same time, months after my lichen sclerosis was really bad, I got the vericoles, then the sharp pains I believe. The sharp pains went away immediately with starting to eat organic and non processed if I recall correctly. It is been a while i do not think about lichen sclerosis really much at all anymore. I feel absolutely great even better then when I posted this originally. This works. HEY EVERYONE I am also someone who read Ginny's book, AND IT CHANGED MY LIFE AND CURED MY LS.\n\nJust throwing some support down! Just found this thread.\n\nedit:\n\nso heart breaking and frustrating this parent thread / OP has been downvoted. Guys - the cure is out there. It is in this freaking book. Stop fighting it, let go of your ego, and read it!", " Do you think this redness and exposure near the entrance of my vulva is caused by LS? I have burning and itching there, and it feels very fragile. Before a few months ago, it did not used to be like this. It was closed and not so red.  I sent my doctor a message about it, but wanted others thoughts in the mean time. Should I be putting clob on that area? It feels like it is stretching when I wipe or move a certain way, too.\n\nIn case the pictures did not post right.\n\n   Extremely difficult to say, it is certainly not obvious to say yes.\n\nA trained eye is needed buddy.\n\nIf clob provides relief and all other areas have been tested (yeast sti etc etc, which no doubt you can/have already ruled out!) then there is a chance it could be ls but medical care is the best place to go.\n\nAll the best", "Did steroid cream help you? I was told by my gynecologist that there needs to be a balance since we are trying to thin the skin down there, but not too much. She wants me to use it everyday for 4-6 weeks and then 3x a week afterwards if things go well. Then we plan to stop using it and hope for the best if things go well.\n\nDid the steroid cream treatment work for you? Is there anything I should be aware of? Thanks guys! Yes, it worked! In two weeks, it turned around years of pain and itching. Dramatic, almost unbelievable relief.  I used it twice a day those two weeks, then three times a week, then not at all unless there is a flare. \n\nOver the years I sometimes have trouble differentiating between a flare starting versus a yeast infection. Sometimes it is obvious, sometimes it is not. Sometimes a mirror and a close look tells the tale: if everything turned white and purple, whoops, missed a flare getting started and it got bad. \n\nI generally only need the steroid once or twice a day, for a few days in a row, a few times a year. That knocks it back down. \n\nUnfortunately, the flares occur when life is shitty or stressful. Because having your vulva rip open is the perfect way to relax when you need a break. \n\nI was worried about the super-potent steroid doing permanent skin-thinning damage, but I am twelve years in and so far I am grateful as hell. I have not had any problems from the cream, and it quiets LS quickly and thoroughly, for me. \n\nI have never needed to use it every day for 4-6 weeks in a row. That sounds like more than most of us here have been told, from what I have seen. That initial two week stretch was the longest stretch I have needed. Everybody is different, but if you improve dramatically in two weeks, maybe that is worth a call back to the doc to check in. \n\nHope it works as well for you!! I was put on the same regiment and it did help. I did not have any problems or side effects so far. Yes- It was amazing, years of suffering relieved in just three days. And here I was, convinced that I was convicted to a life of suffering.\n\nThat does not sound too unusual- I was told to use it twice a day for two weeks, then once a day for two weeks. Now, I have an ointment for an LS flare \\*and\\* an ointment for a yeast infection for when things occasionally go south.\n\nGood luck, hope things work well for you! YES. Twice a day for two weeks and for flare ups.\nThen twice a week for maintenance. I have adhesions that are still un-sticking, not circumcised,  and 72 yr old male. Been on treatment for about 15 months.\nI use betamethasone ointment (augmented).\nThe Augmented stays put longer than original ointment. Wow that is awesome to hear, thanks for all the feedback! I am glad that you do not need to rely on it to much - it is probably lifted a weight off your shoulder. \n\nIs a flare up basically just when things start to get really itchy again? \n\nAnd thank you so much, I really hope it works. I am a little nervous because the itching used to be really bad for a straight year and a half, then got better the past few months with decent amount of itching throughout the day/night. So I am not sure if the steroid cream will be too strong for since I am not experiencing tears like I used to, but we will just have to wait and see. Awesome, glad to hear that! 3 days?!?! That is amazing, congrats on feeling comfortable in your own body again :) is the ointment you are using for flare-ups still a steroid or something else?\n\nThank you so much! Got it, so sounds like a normal routine for steroid creams so far. I am really glad to hear the treatment has been working for you!! Yep, its the same one used to treat it, clobetasol. The doctor told me that it suppresses the reaction, and that I should use it whenever needed in order to suppress. But it never fully goes away :(", "I  got diagnosed today and I am terrified Hi all,\n\nI went to the gyno because I thought I had a hell of a chronic yeast infection (mostly red and itchy around perineal and anal area, but a tiiiiny bit on labia minora). He said it is almost 100% LS, because the symptoms look textbook. \n\nI am terrified. I am reading posts about people\u2019s vaginas fusing and their clits disappearing and I am so so so so scared that my sex life is going to be ruined forever. Is the fusing stuff only if it goes untreated? Can this be something I barely ever think about if I take good precautions? Or is this something I will really carry with me everywhere I go? \n\nI have a lot of anxiety about illness and disease so I have been crying for 5 hours now. Will I be ok? Will I be the same most of the time, or am I necessarily going to undergo weird vaginal changes? I am told you will be able to have sex and look mostly normal as long as you keep the treatment up. I have been diagnosed a year ago, had it long before then, and I have no symptoms whatsoever since I got treated. Obviously every case is different, but there is no need to overreact. Thankfully this sub gets more attention right now, so maybe just read through the existing posts. Good luck to you. Please do something nice for yourself in the next days, do whatever makes you happy. I know it is shocking to get this diagnosis, but you will have a very normal life, do not worry. I am in my forties and was diagnosed around age 30. I hardly ever think about it. I have had babies, sex is fine, and it is not something that hits me every day.  Have to be AWARE and not go for vigorous sex if you are flared. \n\nI probably have not kept up with treatment as well as I should, so the labia are smaller than they used to be. Every once in a while I will jostle something and it HURTS for several days. Sucks. Or sometimes, the itching, aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhgggggggggg. \n\nWe are talking about a few times in more than a decade. It sucks, but it does not suck very often. \n\nUse the steroid cream, it makes allllll the problems go away. Other than that, just take care of yourself. It is not likely to do anything awful to you any faster than aging would anyway - you caught it young. It is a stupid shitty bullshit disease, but ... in my case, it is an afterthought, not a major player in my life. Hope you get through the initial shock and come out OK! I got diagnosed around the same age as you. It can be terrifying. I have had it ten years now and as long as I use my steroid cream when I need it, I have no issues. Keep up with your annual appointments and take care of yourself down there (cotton undies, no perfumes or harsh soaps) and you should not have much trouble with it. It is something you get used to having and managing but can live a normal life with. Like PP said I would not recommend vigorous sex while you have a flare up and personally I had no issues during pregnancy or birth. Best of luck and do not worry yourself too much!! I went three years without being treated bc no one could figure out what was wrong. I would scratch until I bled and had skin under my nails. I did not sleep for three years bc I would be up all night scratching. My vagina looks normal, sex is a little painful when he first puts it in but after that it is enjoyable. I think every case is different bc it depends on the severity. I started Clobetasol on a regimen that was 3 times a day for 2 weeks, then 2 times a day for 2 weeks, 1 time a day for two weeks and then I did not need it but once a month for a while and now I put it on maybe once every 3 months bc I get a light flare up from something like using a wet wipe, forgetting to use my CeraVe hydrating wash, etc. just listen to your doctor and follow his instructions. This is so reassuring !! Can you tell me a bit more about the CeraVe wash? I want to stock up on everything I need to take preventative precautions. Thanks!! Do not be anxious, (I know easier said than done!) but I am only a few years older than you (female) and my vagina has not gone through any weird changes. Use the cream they have prescribed for you, try to stay away from thongs if you can, and for me (although I love them) not taking baths has helped a lot. Sex does not hurt, and the only time I have ever really had issues is during a flair up when the itching is insane. You will be good 90% if not more of the time! There is not much to use beside your ointment your doctor gives you but there is a cleanser called CeraVe Hydrating cleanser you can use as a feminine wash. You just wash the outside of your vag with it(like the lips, do not put it inside) it just helps your skin stay soft if you have cracked flaking skin which is sometimes a symptom. There are two kinds of the CeraVe wash though. You want the one that says hydrating! One contains alcohol which will make your symptoms worse. I have attached the link of the right one that you want to get. Also, do NOT use wet wipes. They are bad for LS. Do not use them on your butt either bc it can spread LS (per my dermatologist) do not use soaps to wash your vag either. Try to go some nights without underwear if you have a super bad flare up. It is just crucial to use the ointment your doc prescribes you and not freak out. It is not the end of the world. A lot of us here might have minor skin scaring but for the most part, we are normal. Yeah it sucks having LS but you can live a normal life. You are not about to die from it and your sex life is not ruined. But like I said, every case is different. Some of the women here have it worse than others but just listen to your doc and do not freak out unless it is truly necessary. \n\nnot sure it is called this exactly anymore, it might just say hydrating cleanser. This is an old bottle.\n\n We have an all female support group on FBook if you would like to join:    ( My wife  has been  suffering  from  LS   for 30 years  we have  tried  everything  surgery  injections  creams ultraviolet  b nothing . Finally  we  went  to  Los  Angeles  to Dr Newman .  She is  had 3 stem cell  treatments  and  it has never  been  better aww poor you, you are so young, but do not despair. Try and keep a healthy diet (no sugar) to keep inflammation levels in the body down and do the steroid treatment, I also freaked out at first (I am only in my early 30s) but I plan on changing my whole lifestyle to get it into remission. There is lots of options out there Why are baths a problem?", "Lichen sclerosus Hi im 27 years old F \nIm scared to develop this kind of disease, can somebody tell me what is the very first symptoms and how many days, month, or years to develop into sores. Please thank you Mine started suddenly with a persistent itch. I thought it was a yeast infection. Treated it and it did not get any better. The itch was tolerable but after weeks and weeks of not getting any better, I began scratching so often that I was causing little tears. Once that happened, it all got worse. \n\nTwo years later, I have not found much relief other than a little with emu oil. Steroids and other topical creams did nothing but burn. :( Do white patch is the cause of itch? Even if it small? Can cause itch? \nDid you notice white patch before itching? Sorry for more questions cause i am really scared right now and thanl you for your response I did not develop white patches for months after the itching began. Maybe 6-8 months after itching is when I started to develop the white patches. Do you have white patches without itch or itch without patches? Small white patch but not really visible it is in my private part and did not cause any itch or pain, though im scared to develop sore someday or i hope it is not LS Your best bet is to set an appointment with a gynecologist and have it checked out. Hopefully it is normal and nothing to worry about. Do not over think it and start scratching out of paranoia. Just leave it alone, monitor how you are doing, check in with gyno and do not fret over something that has not happened! You might be just fine. :) Thank you very much Sorry Last question after you notice white patch .. Is it small at first? Then how many days to spread or to be large? Terrible itching and pain to the point I could not sit down. I went to the gynecologist and she did a punch biopsy and that is how I was diagnosed.\n\nIt all depends though. I had the white patches for years but it was not until the itching and pain became unbearable that I sought medical advice. It cannot hurt to bring it up during your annual exam with your gynecologist. So what can I add as a man who has this.\nThere is evidence that this condition is caused or made worse by an autoimmune response to urine. \n(The only men that can not get this are circumcised at birth.)\nso whether this is true or not, there is some discussion,  personal hygiene will help.\n\nI hope this helps, and please see a dermatologist or gynecologist that has experience in this condition. So sorry to hear you have not found much relief. This can be so uncomfortable. The creams work for me luckily but I went almost a year without them and could not stand it! The things that helped me were a baking soda bath, coconut oil, cotton undies or none when possible. I also noticed when I had my period, would stress or sweat it would flare up so summer was awful! I switched my BC to skip my period all together which helped a lot. Hope you can find some comfort soon! White patches are symptom but not cause of the itch. Mine do itch and have different sensitivity there, but it is not \u201cbecause\u201d of the white patches, but because of the processes in the tissue. Mine started five - six years ago, and I had this whitish area which would itch for no obvious reason. Then it was like - at the second part of my cycle I would feel a bit itchy all over, like I am about to get yeast infection, but I never did. And fast forward five years, flare ups are more intensive and white patches are more sensitive to touch and pain. \n\nBut what you are exeriencing does not have to be LS. It is best to try and see a doctor who can look at it. My doctors consider diagnosis of vitiligo, because they saw white patches. There are more reasons for having white patches. Not every white patch means LS - try not to stress about it and find someone to look at it :) I wish you al the best :) I have read some articles about LS being autoimmune by nature and others about urine as irritant factor to LS, but none that it is actually urine that triggers autoimmune response. Could you share some links, cuz I would really like to read this? Nothing I have found is clear cut. I suggest you search online perhaps you can find more than me.", "Sudden Extreme Stretch Marks Hello,\nMy Dr put me on clobetasol for my LS about 3 months ago. A little over a month ago I noticed some stretch marks appearing on my inner thighs, they grew very quickly and my thighs hurt where they touched each other. I told my Dr and he had me cut down the frequency of clobetasol. Now, I have been on the reduced dose for about a month, and more sudden and painful stretch marks have appeared on my upper hips and butt (where the clobetasol could never have possibly touched). I have not gained any weight. I do not have any marks on my belly, which is where I would usually gain weight if I had. Any ideas what is happening? Following, as this has happened to me as well! Really dark purple, wrinkly looking ones. my doctor has a skin condition herself, which she had to treat with strong steroid cream for years over a large portion of her body. She was explaining to me the maintenance regime I should use, applying the cream weekly when I am not having flareups, and I asked about skin thinning. that is when she told me about her own issue.\n\nShe said if you use strong enough topical steroids regularly enough (daily) you can get systemic absorption and it can cause thinning in areas you never directly applied the ointment to. But that just applied on the genitals, once a week, this should not happen. \n\nof course in a flareup I got to up it to twice a day for two weeks, once a day for two weeks, and then back to maintenance. \n\nAsk your doctor about systemic absorption of topical steroids and your maintenance schedule maybe. Not all docs are experts either so finding some quality scientific sources might help too. \n\nSorry to hear you are experiencing this, whether or not it is related. It is a good question to ask though. It is definitely the ointment. My doctor told me to use it twice daily for three months :( \nI have tapered off, I am going to stop completely for awhile and see how things go, keeping in mind that I can go back on it if needed. \nI am mad at the doctor. And doctors in general. I had to do so much research to self diagnose, go to multiple gynecologists and specialists, just to finally get help. And this is what I get.\nI am just so tired. Oh jeez. Yeah iunno mine suggested it has to be application on a large percentage of your skin coverage to cause this... But twice a day for three months still seems like maybe a lot. And maybe application to genital skin is more likely to absorb than tougher epidermis areas? This is worth looking into maybe someone has researched it.\n\nA pea sized amount once a week seems* maintainable. I am still on acute application although I forget more than half the time to apply it so instead of once a day I am like 4 times a week at the moment. Going down to once a week come February. I will let you know if I develop stretchmarks on that regimen... It is a while since you posted this but this has happened to me too. It is quite extreme and I had no idea it could happen. I wonder if you have had any luck with preventing further marks? Hope so. I have been thinking about protecting the skin that comes into contact with the cream by some kind of cloth barrier. Sounds ridiculous but last night I chopped up a pair of leggings into 'tubes' to wear around the tops of my legs! I would be interested to know if you have found any good solutions in the last few months. Thanks :)", "Clobetasol? How long before it starts working? Hey! I got diagnosed recently with lichen sclerosus after about a year of not knowing what I had. I have been prescribed the clobetasol cream by my doctor. I started more than a week ago on the 24th of august. I still experience itchiness, burning, and irritation. Is this normal? Do I need to give it more time? Thank youu\ud83d\ude0a I got a lot of relief within two weeks, especially from itchiness. Some of the irritation might take a bit to heal. Hang in there. \n\nIf nothing good is happening after two weeks i would call the doctor back and say so. Clobetasol is (in my experience of one person) the silver bullet. If it is not working, doc should know. It does not seem like there is much improvement to be honest\ud83d\ude05 I will wait to give it more time, if not I will call my doctor! Thank you\ud83d\ude0a I am glad it all worked out for you!! I had the same experience as the above user, and mine has generally stayed at bay after that first round of clob. About 2 or 3 weeks I noticed change. Not to sound like a broken record, but I also saw improvement around the end of the third week. \nI have done two rounds (slacked off at the end of the second one) and had some itching so I used it again once and that helped. I am willing to bet you have done this already, but have you tried a yeast treatment?  It is hard to separate the symptoms sometimes. Right thank you\ud83d\ude0a!! I thought about it but I have not! I actually just had to take an 11 day course of antibiotics! So maybe it could of caused me to have a yeast infection\ud83e\udd14? How can you tell the difference? I can never tell?\ud83d\ude05 I hope your doctor checked for yeast or staph infection, along with the (I assume) biopsy that confirmed your LS. Having LS does not prevent secondary conditions, or comorbidities. I got tested multiple times for STD\u2019s/infections but they always came back negative. But who knows maybe I could have an infection now as well! Thanks for the input\ud83d\ude0a I really cannot at the start of a flare. Both are itching and burning. If I have been super stressed out and/or my belly has been having problems lately, or if I am cracking open and bleeding and splitting, it is LS. If I just took antibiotics, I start with anti-yeast cream. If my first try fails I go to the second try!\n\nThere might be a better way to tell the difference in an early flare, but if there is, I do not know it. I never really did. Told my doctor and she switched me to a different kind of topical steroid, which works much better for me! Maybe just call your doctor and ask? I hope you get relief, soonest! My relief happened in about a week but I was at the white scarring stage and already over the itchy tearing stage when I started it. The dermatologist told me to apply it 2x a day to start to knock it out fast and then taper down to 1x a day after a week or two, then every few days when I was ready.\n\nSo maybe you can call and ask them if you should be applying it more frequently to start? i noticed a change in 48 hours I am applying it once a day at bedtime. Maybe it would work better if I did apply it more frequently. Thank you:) Alright thank youuu, I will definitely try and call my doctor if I do not see improvement soon. Which topical steroid is it? It depends on the woman and her situation. For me it was the OINTMENT and it worked very quickly. I have heard a lot of women talk about the cream burning and causing red angry skin. Join us at ( the norm is daily 2 to 3 day a day (pea sized amounts using the clobetasol ointment (not cream) for about a month; then, taper down to once daily and continue tapering down until you are on a once a week maintenance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n( Can anyone tell me something about reddit?

So weird question, I know, but I have been wondering about if disability is available to people with sever LS  or if there are programs to help people with a chronic illness.

It is getting better but I have also been unemployed for the last couple months and going pantless with low activity to try and get some relief, it has worked to an extent but I am afraid that going back to work is going  to put me in an awful flair again.Ive had to call out more than onve bc I can hardly walk, and I am afraid of interviewing for a new job and having to explain why I might need accomidations or even disclose I have a chronic illness.

Hey, so I have had LS since October 2020 and I have come such a long way. My LS is so much better now, with the occasional flare up here and there. I am so grateful that I have a loving boyfriend that has been with me since day one and helps me through not only the physical pain but also emotionally. He has been super patient especially after starting treatment in November 2021, once my sex drive dropped significantly it got harder and harder for me emotionally. I felt like I was not able to form that intimate bond with him and I felt like he was losing those feelings for me because of it. It definitely was not the case though.\n\nThere was a point where we were living together for 4 months because of university (Sept-Dec2021) and I would just be in constant pain everyday. I went into that initial depression of just realizing how permanent this condition is and I started losing hope very quickly. Our emotional connection is so strong and we have been through so much together. He was so supportive and I knew I could rely on him for anything. But I feel like I put too much on him and he is exhausted. \n\nOnce we were not living together anymore (past few weeks) communication lacked and we had many burst out arguments due to not being able to see each other physically in person and me having the occasional flare up stressed him out. He told me he felt extremely stressed about me being in pain all the time and just the amount I reply on him for that emotional support. He is at his breaking point with this and I try not to bring it up to him as often even though I am in pain during my flare ups. He told me how stressed it made him and how he cannot handle it anymore. I have just felt so bad that he brought it up the way he did. Since then he has apologized (which I did not expect him to do because I do understand how frustrating this could be on an intimate partner) and told me I can tell him whenever I am in pain but I always feel so bad so I try to avoid it now.\n\nI do not have many friends to talk to about this because it is personal and I would love to be able to share the way I feel with someone as well as hear about another persons experience. My LS has definitely gotten so much more manageable and I would love to help anyone else having a hard time with it emotionally and physically. No one deserves to go through this alone.", "Does LS affect areas further than the vulva? I have LS on my labia minora, but I noticed redness/lighter color around my labia majora as well. If my legs were not open, your could see a small ring of an outline around the slit opening of my vulva. It is still where I grow pubic hair. Not sure if this is normal? Symptoms are not as severe as on my labia minora. \n\nAlso, does the pre-cancer or cancer happen when it is untreated for years? I am worried about developing it because my case just feels so progressive. I am so anxious about it. I was biopsied on my labia minora for it and it came back negative, but not on any other area. I am married to a woman with LS and yes, it can spread in the way you describe. Hers has spread even further. Ahh okay! and if you are aware, does the ointment help those areas and minimize spreading? I am really not aware, unfortunately. She did not get diagnosed until she would had it for at least 6-8 years and clobetasol has not helped her much. I am sorry to hear that. I am on the same boat. Certain things help most women: estrogen, ointments, baths, and dilators. My clobetasol works best when I soak in a bath before application. She may want to try that. Many LS specialists suggest that because it softens the skin. Also, it is crucial to use an ointment as opposed to a cream! She may already have an ointment but it does not hurt to double check! Wishing her well. This disease is awful but having loving and supporting partners makes it much better. &lt;3 :-) Diagnosed with LS in 2010 or so on my vulval area and in 2016/2017 was told it has spread to the skin around my butt. Punch biopsy both times to confirm it. I am also married to a woman who has LS and she has it on those areas as well. The clob ointment did help in those areas. Mine is worst around my butt and even up to my lower back Yep, it should help in all those areas and control spreading. If not, you may want to try an alternative like tacrolimus. Do you notice that anything causes that progression? Or is it pretty random? For me it tended to spread and get more aggressive when I forgot to use clob before I was supposed to stop taking it. Ah I see. So the ointment would help you with stopping the spread as soon as you noticed you were losing pigment?", "Depressed &amp; Lost  \n\nHello, everyone. I have recently been diagnosed with this unfortunate  condition. I have long suspected that I had it but was unable to access  medical care. A few months before I had my first appointment I began  having very bad flare ups much worse than anything I had experienced previously. Even using my usual sensitive skin fragrance free soap would  cause burning. I already had noticeable changes in appearance before  this flare up which I had gotten used to and was making peace with.  However, things have completely changed for the worse since. My skin  thinned very badly and I lost structure, as well as more drastic changes  in color, tightening, and decreased sensation. I also experience daily  pain and tenderness. I feel as though I do not have a vagina anymore. My  vagina seemed otherwise normal aside from appearance previously but now  it does not even seem functional and I do not know what other problems I  will run into.\n\nI already had  depression but after this happened I fell into a very deep depressive  episode and whenever I think about my vagina or look at it I become  incapacitated with anxiety. I am in my twenties and a virgin and now I  am unsure of how I will ever loose my virginity, experience the sex life  I always wanted, or find a partner. If anyone ever got into a  relationship with me I would feel guilty. Right now I am venting but I  also want to know if there is any hope. I have never felt this overwhelmed  and helpless before and I have no idea what to do or how to go forward.  My doctor prescribed me with clobetasol for six weeks but I do not see  how much good it could possibly do at this point. My case seems very  advanced and frankly I am scared for what is to come since this seems to  only worsen over time. I can barely bring myself to read up more on the  condition without triggering a panic attack. When I found out that I got it, I was panicking because I was reading about worst scenarios and looking at images online. It was really not good period and for two weeks I was complete ruin. Then I decided I will no longer explore stuff like that, because I needed time to deal with my own diagnosis and my own feelings, and then to do my research on the LS (although I knew a lot because doctors suspected I have it years earlier, but then, wrongfully, concluded it is not LS). My husband knew my symptoms and they have been affecting our sex lives for years, but I could not stand him knowing the name of this condition - cuz I was afraid he is going to look at the images and worst cases. \n\nIm still dealing with emotions and everything, but stepping away from research a bit and concentrating on how to make myself feel better right now - has helped. \n\nI am also looking for a therapist because I think this is something I should talk about with someone. If you have not considered it - think about that :) Also - I forgot to add smt which really helped me a lot- I realized LS is nothing new in my life. I had it for years. Knowing what it was only meant now I can make my life easier, because I was already having flare ups and did nothing about it.\n\nIt is not new. I had it and I lived with it. And now I can start dealing with it finally. Finally there is hope. Sounds like you have got a double whammy of anxiety and depression! That sucks. And it does not help to have a chronic condition where there is little you can do. \n\nMy main recommendation is to tell your doctor about your concerns. How long have you been on the clobetasol?  It might help a lot more than you think. \n\nAlso, if you do not have a therapist, you should get one. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health and I hope you can get help there. \n\nAnd your comment about soap, is it that just your body soap?\n\nHave you done the small things that help? Loose clothing, cotton underwear or none is possible. Consider a bidet? Moisturizer like coconut oil? This reddit has a lot of tips hidden throughout, but it takes some searching. Throwaway because this will probably be long and I do not want to censor myself.  Everyone is cases are different, so some people will experience milder symptoms and some will have more severe symptoms.  Do not assume you are headed for the worst-case scenario, and do not think anything's wrong with you if someone told you they just switched to organic cotton and seaweed underwear and fixed everything when that does not work for you.\n\nFirst, the fact that you are diagnosed and have a prescription is a great start!  I know it probably feels overwhelming (I have struggled with depression too so I hear you) but starting to try solutions gives you a greater chance of getting your symptoms under control.  And maybe clobetasol does not end up working well enough - you can continue to talk to your doctor and try different options.\n\nSecond, make sure you feel comfortable with your doctor and trust their expertise.  I have had some bad experiences with doctors who either never heard of it or assumed they did not need to learn anything else after reading a chapter in. a textbook in med school.  If you are concerned, ask for a referral to a dermatologist.  Also make sure that your regular doctor understands that you are battling with depression as well so they can take that into consideration when communicating.  u/2353563 recommended a therapist, which sounds like a great idea.\n\nNext up, sex!  It is possible that your symptoms will place some restrictions on your sex life - although continuing to work with lifestyle changes and finding a topical medication that works for you will greatly reduce this problem.  The main thing is to approach your sex life with a positive mind set.  Most people cannot do all the things in bed that they want to do, but if you just accept the fact that maybe you cannot do everything you see in porn but are still sexy and capable of giving and receiving pleasure, you will feel a lot more comfortable and empowered with your sex life.  About a year into my relationship with my now-husband I had a heavy onset of symptoms and sex was super-painful for me most of the time.  It was frustrating for both of us, but communicating openly about it and being accepting and supportive allowed us to still have a great time in bed and took the pressure off of me.  Later, my husband struggled with erectile dysfunction and I was able to reciprocate being non-judgmental and creative in finding sexy ways to get us both off.  In both our cases, the risk of either of us getting in our own head about it posed a greater obstacle to a happy sex life than any physical limitation.  If you end up with a partner who cannot agree with that then fuck  them (figuratively).  If you want to play the field a bit and have daring one-night stands, you can still do that without relying on the old vanilla \"penis in vagina\" stuff.  \n\nGood luck, and keep us updated! Hold on tight and take it one day at a time, you are still young. Treatments might help more than you think, you just need to be patient.\n\nTry to exercise and eat well, that can only help with self esteem and depression.\n\nAlso breathe whenever you feel stressed. I know that sounds stupid because it is so simple, but breathing exercise can be tremendously beneficial in many ways.\n\nCheers!", "My procedure to keep LS in check for several years now Hello fellow redditors, I wanted to post this, since it helped me quite a bit.\n\nI am now in my forties and had Lichen Sclerosis since at least 30, I think, without me knowing what it was. It was slow progressing but sped up as got older. I got regular slight bleedings of the glans of the penis and a lot of skin loss / skin shedding. My foreskin started to constrict, which was never an issue before.\nI want to add here, that my urethral problems were very slight, not much pain there, but even in the urethra it started to get worse.\n\nSo with the symptoms described above, it definitely got worse and that was around when I turned 36(or 37). I went to a doctor and got the LS diagnosis. The doctor even said, that maybe we will have to do the circumcision if it does not get better.\n\nWhat I understood from the doctor was, that there is no good treatment for this.\n\nSo I researched online, and after weeks I found a good hint in a german online forum (devoted to this topic), sadly I can no longer find the original posting.\n\nSo what helped me a lot was to separate the foreskin from the glans of the penis. Basically to pull the foreskin back, wrap a thin, stable, hygenic tissue around the glans of the penis, and the fold the foreskin back over the glans. So that the tissue paper gets stuck between glans and foreskin.\n\nTo be honest, I just use the tisue paper that is sold to sneeze in (paper handkerchief), because it is easily available and stable enough. Normal toilet paper disintegrates to easily. But it works nonetheless, and sometimes I use it, if I have nothing else on hand.\n\nIn my case, I have no more skin shedding, no more bleeding and the foreskin stopped shrinking. Using the procedure for 4-5 years now.\n\nHope this helps someone.\n\nMaybe this does not work in more severe cases, I do not know.\n\nOther stuff that I do:\nwash the glans with a mild cleaning solution at least every second day and apply some coconut oil, which is specifically sold for the genital area.\n\nIt would not hurt to get vitamin D levels checked, since it is related to autoimmune diseases (like LS is), I personally take a supplement from time to time.\n\nFinally the Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional, this is not medical advice. Just my personal experience.\n\nBest wishes to you all.", "discharge after biopsy ? it is been two days since my biopsy and now i have thick white discharge. i had a punch biopsy on my upper inner labia. i never had discharge like this.  wondering if this is normal post biopsy or an infection :/ idk if it is a&amp;d? or coming from a&amp;d? i am using the a&amp;d on my inner labia on the biopsy site Symptoms of infection - redness like a sunburn and increasing, not decreasing, pain or tenderness. Odour, discharge that is green, grey or yellow. have you gotten a biopsy before and had discharge ?  there is redness but that is just because i just got it done Some \u201cdischarge\u201d is normal - the wound will heal itself and it produces some moisture as it does.  If you do not notice it getting more painful or smelly then it is likely fine. Infection turns the tissue around the biopsy very sore, swollen and red.

Feel free to cleanse the area with water and pat it dry with a clean towel. \nYes I have had a biopsy before myself, in addition I work in healthcare and I am very familiar with what signs and symptoms of infection are. okay thanks !! i just got worried because like it seemed like a lot especially when i have never experienced anything like that . i do not think it is an infection because there is no immense pain or itch and most of the discharge seems to be on the side of the site. there is a smell but it is not like crazy pungent and i expect there to be some smell from the wound You might notice it get a little itchy in a few days.

I have been diagnosed with LS for about 2 years and it is so frustrating. Not only the irritation and soreness down there, but also the constant worrying. I was diagnosed at 23 after having some pain during sex, nothing else.

Everything feels so hopeless and I am so scared  I won\u2019tfind a partner that will stay with me cause I am not sure if I will be able to have sex again, ever. I am sorry you are going through all that. If the clobetasol is not helping, as it does not for about 10% of people, you may want to ask your doctor about trying a different treatment. There are several other options, like tacrolimus for example. \n\nAs for sex, I can assure you it is possible to have a fulfilling sex life without having vaginal sex. I think when you find the right treatment, you probably will be able to again, but it is not necessary to have a wonderful and healthy relationship. Many cultures make a big deal out of vaginal sex, but for many couples, it is not even their favorite thing to do. And a good partner, even if they really like vaginal sex, will love and accept you as you are and find ways to make it work. \n\nIf you are feeling hopeless a lot, especially for more than two weeks or so, I really recommend seeing a therapist. It is something I wish I had done earlier in my life, and now that I see mine regularly, I am glad that I have them to talk to about LS.

I have molloscum and I have been using zinc zulphate to help with the bumps. About two days after using this appeared. I am 20 years old It is more likely that it is a reaction to the zinc and/or a reaction to the molluscum virus. It does not look like LS to me, but still worth seeing a dermatologist.

I can feel that it is prickly and it does not bother me too much during, but afterwards I am SO RED I have never seen my skin look so bad. It is slightly tender and if I put my finger on it it will burn a little. \n\nI just want to see if anyone else has dealt with this and how you resolved it, and to just know I am not the only one :) I may just ask him to shave clean or commit to growing it out again. Well I will just say I am a male with LS and my female partner without LS has told me numerous times how bad my face feels when my beard is at the length you describe.  I try to keep my beard trimmed so the hair is about 1-2cm long and it does not irritate her skin or mine (skin on my face does not seem to like a close shave anyway). \n\nIf a scruffy beard feels bad on my female partner without LS, I can only imagine how bad it would feel on the skin of somebody with LS. That makes me feel a lot better, thank you for commenting! No problem.  I also recommend just being totally open with your partner about everything that is goin on.  I am sure a good partner will want to do whatever they can to help minimize your pain. I hope that it is just the beard stubble for you, but in my case it seems to be the saliva that causes a flare.

I know I will be numb but I am nervous about the process and recovery. Any advice? It is not that bad! You only feel a slight tugging. Worst part for me was the needle used to numb, but that lasts less than a second. My recovery was pretty straightforward, it was sore for about a day and a bit but was barely noticeable after. I put some polysporin on it to help it heal and cleaned the area every day. You will do great. What does the shot feel like? Do they just inject near the area? It was a slight stinging sensation.

I absolutely worried myself sick about it and it was not nearly as bad as I had anticipated it to be. Good luck, you will do fine! Most folks that have a biopsy say the injection is the toughest part. Discomfort day of, but gets better soon after. Most say it takes about a week to heal. Make sure to write out any questions you have for your doctors ahead of time in case you are nervous and forget. They should give you a list if aftercare and what to expect, if not, ask then. Some folks take an ibuprofen or Tylenol the first couple days. Take it easy afterward and listen to your body. Good luck; let us know how it goes. Was not as bad as I expected, just stinging and some pressure but if I can make it through anyone can I had it this morning, the biopsy site is still bleeding six hours later, is this normal? Mine was bleeding for a bit, not profusely but if I dabbed with toiler paper there was some blood. If it is a concerning amount I would defs call your doctor and ask! Okay it just looks like I have light flow on my pad. If it persists tomorrow I will probably call Glad to hear it was bearable. Hoping you heal up quick and do not have to wait too long for results. It ended up being positive, I definitely suspected it would be I am glad you got your results quickly. I hope they put you on a good treatment plan. Dm me here or on IG  (I have a blog and YouTube about LS, sex, mental health, and medical info) plus volunteer for a LS nonprofit if you need support.", "Just been diagnosed after MANY years of having LS. So first off I am still learning about this condition. And it seems there is way more to know than I thought. \nI am actually really upset that I have had this for over 20 years it seems, seen many ob/gyn\u2019s in that time, gave birth three times, miscarried twins and had a D&amp;C. Did a surrogacy pregnancy and had a hysteroscopy. Had yearly check ups.... and no one mentioned I looked different down there.  Ok except one female OB/GYN that did not really explain it and kind of freaked me out, especially with wanting to delve right in and do a biopsy which freaked the shit out of me. She said something about no Labia minora and tissue paper skin.... But in my head so many drs had had their faces down there and not mentioned anything then it must be fine. I know for a fact I had white patches in my late teens (over 20 years ago) and went to family planning about it, the whit patches actually Disappeared. But I also know I did not have a Labia minora at that time and am wondering if the white was from that disappearing. But I do not remember ever having one. (I never looked at vaginas so did not know what I should have down there lol) right now My clit can hardly been seen. I went to an ob when I had itching down there (my husband actually thought I was cheering on him because I was uncomfortable down there I did not want to have sex very often. I now know it was the start up of this huge clear up) maybe 2 years ago and he said nothing was wrong. At times intercourse has felt like my skin was tearing, mainly depending on the angle. But I could still get pleasure thank goodness! I would just tell my husband to change positions. \nSo..... I could have had treatment years ago but now have a lot of white scaring and a clit that can hardly be seen. \nThe reason I was diagnosed was my husband noticed white patches down there. This was maybe 9 or so months ago. He thought it was aging, and even though I wanted to get it checked out, it took me some time. I finally went to an annual skin check and wanted a skin specialist to look. She straight away knew what it was and if two biopsy\u2019s \ud83d\ude1c. She just could not believe only one dr noticed it. She even tested her OB/GYN friend on my symptoms to see if he knew what it was. \nShe gave me clobetasol jell 0.05% twice a day for two months, then I will have a check up to see if there are any changes. The clobetasol seems to be stinging down there a little. \nI think my biggest concern is scaring turning into cancer. I know LS does not cause cancer but the scaring can turn into cancer cells. My father died of melanoma and I have had moles taken off with abnormal cells. Not the same as LS, but still skin related. Next is my near non existent  clit. And of course finding the right treatment to stop it getting worse. I think my husbands biggest concern is cancer and it affecting Intimacy (understandable, I mean what guy would not worry about that right!!!!). There has been a lot more white scaring since he first noticed it and my clit has  disappeared even more. So I think he is worried I will eventually not get pleasure from intercourse. \nSo I guess I just wanted to get my story out there. \nI have read about some different treatments. \nThings about Eliminating foods like sugar, and dairy. I just started Keto. Nothing to do with having LS. But I have been eating a lot of dairy. Anyone have info on dairy?  \nAlso anyone had success bringing back their clit??  ", "LS bruising and spots Hello,\n\nMy wife has LS and recently found a bluish/black spot on her labia minora. Dr said it is probably just from a tear or from bruising. Just wondering is this consistent amongst others that also deal with LS. We have got an appointment with her OBGYN in a few weeks but would like to get some info to help her. \n\nThanks Anyone? LS does increase chances of genital cancer and other random ass infections but like you said, it is prob just some bruising. Get it checked out anyway Thanks, hoping it is nothing related to the big C. I was just curious to see if anyone else had similar symptoms with LS. Based on some research it does seem to occur and are benign. Yes, bruising is common in LS. According to a paper I found today (which reminded me of your post) it is medically harmless, even though it can definitely freak you out.\n\n&gt;Purpura or ecchymoses are typical and harmless but for some patients distressing features of LS.\n\n( Thank you very much gave me some relief, hoping that is it. Take care Hey,\n\nJust an update for others that might need this. Got it checked by OBGYN and a vulvar specialist she said it is completely normal with lichen sclerosis. It is hyperpigmentation from tearing. Basically said live with it and lichen is a condition that could be managed to ensure living a normal life. Thanks Glad to hear it! Thanks for the update. \ud83d\ude09", "First time here. If you see this, please read Female/ 28 yrs / Single / High risk HPV\n\nI am just as clueless as a headless chicken...\n\n\nI have not done a biopsy yet. Just wanted to confess this in advance. Two different Gynecologists have said that my labia looks like there is \u201cLichen Sclerosus\u201d. (This will only be justified once I get a biopsy, I know).\n\nA doctor has mentioned that he already sees \u201ca little bit of fusion between my labia and clitoris\u201d. However I can still have clitoris stimulation. I still have feeling and I can somewhat easily orgasm from clitoral stimulation. The only thing is, in recent times sometimes my clitoris hurts (as If it is bruising) .But I have never had a vaginal penetration orgasm. If I do have LS, would that be the reason why?\n\nAlso, I keep reading that women have \u201cflare ups\u201d \u201citching\u201d, and occasionally using ice packs. But I do not have any of those symptoms. In fact I do not have any pain or discomfort. The only symptom are fine white patches on my labia and a little bit of a shiny coat, and, if I stretch my vagina sideways I can feel a pulling motion; the same feeling like skin being really stretched out.\n\nOverall, not only am I confused but I am worried. I am worried that my clitoris will be fused into my labia that I will not be able to ever have an orgasm! I am scared that I will not have a good sex life. I am also scared that receiving oral sex will never be possible.\n\n\nIf someone could send me a DM or tell me here more about LS, I would really appreciate it.\nThank you so much! Hi there! It sounds a lot like you do have LS, I have had for 2 years now (diagnosed 5 months ago) and at the very beginning I also had no major symptons, it did get worse with time though so you should get that biopsy just in case! \nAbout vaginal orgasms I cannot help you since I have also never had one \ud83d\ude01\n\nIf you have any doubts I am more than happy to help with what I know. There is also a Facebook group (female only) where you can find lots of subjects LS related. Thanks for the reply! :)\n\nSince you have LS, are you using the steroid cream? If so, does it help your symptoms or does it make it worse? I do not want the cream to make me itchy. \n\nI think I have already come to terms that I have it. And it is what it is and there is no going back. I would love to know how I got it. Do you know how you got it? Yes, I use one called Psorex (I am in Brazil so the name may be different in your country), it has helped A LOT because I was always itching/burning. I have been using it only 3 months and my clitoris is no longer fused.\n\nI got it through yeast infections that were not correctly diagnosed by a previous doctor of mine. I went to her and said something was wrong because I was itchy but she only advised me to change the soap I was using. My yeast infection got worse and to feel some form of relieve I scratched myself and I started to get some micro tears. My skin (as a form of protection) started to get thicker and lost elasticity, making penetration unberable. Now I feel way better and sometimes can have penetrative sex, my case it is a little bit more complicated than the average girl because I also developed vaginismus in the process of trying to understand what was wrong with me and that also sets me back sometimes. \n\nI think the cream would actually help you a lot since you seem to have a very mild case of LS. Thank you sooo much!\n\nHow crazy is that, that wrong prescriptions and wrong diagnosis can cause LS? I thought it was an autoimmune disease. I guess I have to figure out how I got it. But you know, I did have a reallly really bad yeast (Candida) infection last December. The discharge was yellow/green. Unbearable pain. The stress and itching could have caused it. \n\nAnyways, I will write down the name of the cream you suggested. And I hope I can get it sorted out. Like you said, I do hope my case is mild. Hi, I think there are some important things to clear up here.\n\nFirst, you do not need a biopsy to confirm LS. If you are on treatment for several months and nothing improves, then you may need a biopsy to find out if it is something different. But if your doctors do not think you need a biopsy now, there is no reason to put yourself through that. It sounds like you have clear signs that they are able to diagnose visually.  If you do have a skin condition, that could make healing the biopsy difficult, which would just add to your problems. \n\nSecond, vaginal orgasms have absolutely nothing to do with LS. Extremely few women are able to orgasm from vaginal stimulation alone. Of course it is very hard to accurately test this kind of information, but estimates range from around 6-30% of women are capable of orgasming without clitoral stimulation. There is nothing wrong with your body, your partner, or anything else if vaginal orgasms do not happen for you because they do not happen for the VAST majority of women. \n\nFinally, no one knows why we get LS. I know a lot of people speculate about their own experiences, and that is okay, but there is no scientific evidence that points to a real \"cause\". It is likely to be a genetic autoimmune disease, which is worsened by hormonal changes, but even that is not set in stone because there is not enough research about this disease. A lot of people believe they got it because of yeast infections, but there is actually a much simpler explanation. Most people with LS will experience itching, burning, and other unpleasant symptoms before they are diagnosed. When they go to the doctor with those complaints, most doctors just assume that it is yeast without putting in the work to actually test for it. So they are misdiagnosed with a yeast infection when there was never any yeast to begin with, it was LS all along. \n\nPlease be careful about misinformation and take good care of yourself. Hi there. \n\nI appreciate your honesty. Thank you. \n\n1. Actually both doctors recommended a biopsy just so we can be 100% sure of the diagnosis. I mean, for all I know I could have eczema or vitiligo.\n\n2. You are right. Thanks for clearing that out. I was really scared that LS was the reason. But I think it is more a mental thing. I also need to find the right guy and fall in love in order to start exploring the g spot and being comfortable during sex.\n\nAgain, thank you for being honest. I appreciate any feedback. LS does not affect the vagina, so I do not think it would affect one's chances of a vaginal orgasm.  If you do have LS and stay on treatment, you can prevent progression and it should not hinder your ability to orgasm. And even if it ever does become more difficult to orgasm, that can be frustrating but there are many ways to manage it. It just might take more skill or more power (like a good vibrator.) I also do not think LS would prevent oral sex. I think you would be fine to have oral sex unless you were having a really bad flare. Just do not have oral sex right after applying the steroid ointment so your partner does not ingest it. \n\nAs for biopsy, some doctors feel that every case should be biopsied, but some think that typical cases can be diagnosed without one. If two different gyns thought it looked like LS, especially if they noticed it without you bringing it up, that is probably not a coincidence. I am not saying you should or should not have a biopsy done, just do not feel like you have to \"confess\" to not having one.\n\nAs for the symptoms/flares, surprisingly, some people with LS experience no symptoms, meaning no itching, burning, pain, etc. They only have the visible signs. Other people have super intense itching but hardly any visible signs. Personally I have mild symptoms (occasional itching, mild pain with sex, occasional moderate pain with daily activities) but I have pretty substantial labial fusion and clitoral phimosis. But I think I have probably had it since I was a child and only found out a few months ago, so it had a lot of time to progress. It sounds like you have caught yours early and now you can stop it in its tracks. Hi there. Thank you for all of the info :) \nI have a couple of questions, I hope you do not mind answering them. If it is too personal, you can send me a DM:\n1) By any chance do you know how you got LS?\n2) Do you apply the steroid ointment 7 days a week? What is the dosage like?\n3) Does the cream make the skin more itchy, or does it do the opposite?\n4) Every medicine has a side effect- does the steroid cream have one? \n5) How has your mental health been since you started treatment? Can you still live a normal life with LS? (This is one I fear the most \ud83d\ude30)\n6) What is one thing you do (it could be diet, body wash, activity..) that you found really helps decrease your inflammation and overall helps your LS?\n\n\nSorry for the questions. I just want to hear from someone who is going through it. 1- It is unknown what causes LS, but it can seem to run in families, and my grandma has a similar condition. I noticed that you mentioned your HPV status. I know that link has been explored by researchers and I do not believe any connection has been found with HPV or any other infection. LS is probably not because of anything you did or did not do. \n\n2. For now I apply it twice a day every day. It is 0.05% clobetasol propionate. Usually, after three months or so and remission of symptoms, the dose or frequency will be reduced to e.g. once or twice per week. \n\n3. I do not find the ointment itchy. Ointments are made up in a neutral base similar to vaseline, so usually they are not irritating. A cream formula could be, depending on how you respond to what is in it. And if the treatment works, one should have a reduction or remission of any itching caused by LS.  \n\n4. Yes, steroid ointments can cause the skin to get thinner and develop stretch marks. Supposedly this rarely happens in LS treatment, but that is one reason it is important to follow directions exactly when dealing with steroids. I think they also increase risk of yeast infections if you get them in your vagina. My dermatologist told me not to have penetrative sex right after applying it, or to at least wipe it off first, since that could push the ointment into the vagina. \n\n5. I have only been on clob for a month, but I guess it is been the same. Many people respond well to treatment and have remission of symptoms, so I guess it would not affect their life very much as long as they stay on treatment. As for a \"normal\" life, everybody has things that they deal with in their life. But it is totally possible to do daily activities like most people and to have a fulfilling sex life.  \n\n6. Leggings/tights really aggravate symptoms for me, so I think avoiding them has helped. I bought a garter belt and cut the waist off of some of my leggings so I can use them with the garter belt. I also just cut the crotch out of some of them, so I can keep my legs warm and have them stay up but not trap moisture in my crotch. I also stopped wearing non-cotton underwear. (Both cotton underwear/no underwear and avoiding tight leggings/pants are generally recommended to people with vulvar and/or vaginal conditions.)\n\nI hope that helps. I would recommend trying not to worry too much or assume the worst. If you google LS, you will find all kinds of scary pictures, but these are not representative of the \"average\" LS case. It is the most severe cases that end up in medical journals. It is totally possible to have mild LS and you will not necessarily ever have serious complications, especially if you stay on top of treatment and get seen regularly. This was very helpful. Much appreciated for taking your time to help me. I screenshot your response, just so if I ever need to go back and remember what you said. \nThe yeast infection makes sense (since the cream/ointment can change the PH). It is just the matter of being smart about when you are applying the cream and then when you are having sex. That is something I will keep in mind, so thank you for mentioning that. \n\nAnd YES cotton underwear is a savior for not just LS, but for every vagina problem. It is helped me a lot! ", "Had a doctor tell me this? I had an obgyn tell me that my labia minora disappearing and flattening was normal and \"just happens sometimes, even without LS.\"\n\nIs this true? Sure, after menopause. I am 18, awaiting a biopsy for LS... so I just found it interesting she brushed off that aspect of LS so quickly with \"oh, the flattening is totally normal!\" Ask for another doctor, for some reason I have gound males to be more compassionate in this field. So sorry that happened. My obgyn told me the same thing. Can just happen over time. After childbirth or whatever as well. Who knows tho. I have found that doctors are a little too ready to say \"that is normal\" with vulvas. The  dogma now is that tremendous variety exists in normal vulvas, and that is true, but it does not mean everything is normal. I think they want to be reassuring but it can end up just making patients doubt themselves more and not get treatment for things that really are not normal. Still, I do not know how your doctor came to that conclusion. Relatively flat labia could have been your normal, since some people have small labia, but flattening/disappearing over time is a totally different story.\n\nI would never heard of progressive flattening being normal, so I looked Googled it. I found this paper ( It seems atrophy is common after menopause with low estrogen, like INAC said above, but even that usually needs treatment with supplemental estrogen. At your age, I do not know how progressive flattening could possibly be normal. I think it is pretty strong evidence for LS. The good thing is, if it is because of LS, treatment should stop it in its tracks. Thanks so much. It is a relief to hear that treatment should stop it.", "What helped me with LS **(A little background info)** \\- I was diagnosed with LS a couple years ago and was prescribed a topical steroid cream. It definitely worked to help heal up cuts I would get from attempting to have intercourse. But even if I was all healed I would try to have sex and I would end up getting cuts/itchy/sore after sex. The inside of my vagina was also affected. I felt like I was swollen on one side about 2 centimeters inside. Even when I would put a finger inside I would get stinging pain. I had this pain for over a year. It was so long that I cannot even decipher when it actually started to go away. I think it was caused by me accidentally ripping out a tampon. (I had the tampon in for hours and thought it would be more wet than it was, but I believe this is what caused the ongoing pain).  \n\n\n**So the first thing that helped me** was I stopped taking all of my medications to try to figure out if that was causing the LS. (I am not telling you to do this. This is only what helped me figure out what was causing my dryness. Obviously consult your doctor before you do anything drastic) At the time I was taking birth control, topical steroid cream, allergy medicine (zyrtec), nasacort, and asthma medications (albuterol and fluticasone propionate). To make sure my asthma symptoms would not flare up I started in the spring because I usually only have asthma during winter. I stopped taking everything (not all at the same time but eventually). I slowly started to get more wet down there and even though I go through at least 3 boxes of tissues a week it is all worth it. I noticed the allergy medicine was the culprit the made my hands and feet dry and cracked. The birth control definitely dried out my vagina and I have lost 20 lbs since stopping. With the albuterol I do not notice any side effects. Ive been taking my asthma medicine since it is winter but I recently started taking the fluticasone propionate and I have been dry ever since I started taking it. Breathing is obviously more important though.  \n\n\n**One last thing that everyone could try** is unbleached, chlorine free toilet paper. I personally use the toilet paper for my bum, but I actually dab with towels after I pee. I was having recurrent yeast infections for the past year and figured out that when I got out of the shower I would feel completely fine no itching or burning, but as soon as I would wipe (angel soft/charmin) I would get irritated. Thanks for sharing! Good idea re: toilet paper", "Do your LS white lesions turn to red color after applying steroid cream? ", "COVID vaccine? I have a (thankfully) mild case of BXO (caught it in time and the doctors knew what it was, so was never allowed to get beyond a certain point).\n\nI am due to get the COVID vaccine this week (Pfizer). One of the questions I was asked in the pre-screening was, do I have any autoimmune conditions? I answered no, but then remembered that LS/BXO is thought to have an autoimmune origin. Obviously I have reached out to my urologist (no reply as of yet) to ask for his opinion, and if I do not receive a response, will bring it up at the place of vaccination (although I imagine they will not have heard of LS).\n\nHas anyone else's medical people told them not to get the vaccine if you have LS? I would not worry about it unless you are taking systemic drugs, and even then it is probably still fine. You can still ask, and if they do not know about LS, you can say it is similar to psoriasis (inflammatory, likely autoimmune, disease of skin.) My dad has psoriatic arthritis and is on a major immunosuppressant and he still got it. My grandma has Zoon's vulvitis (previously thought to be LS) and got hers too. \n\nAccording to the CDC (below) it is not *proven* to be safe in people with autoimmune diseases. But I do not think LS would be likely to be relevant. They would be more worried about people with systemic autoimmune diseases that affect your internal organs, like lupus.\n\n( I received both doses of the Moderna Covid vaccine, and I am doing just fine. My LS did have a flare after the second dose though. I was able to treat it with Clobetasol for a week and now it seems to be better. Thanks for the info, how invasive is your LS generally? How common are the flare ups? My LS started in October. I was not diagnosed for 2 months. It was mistaken as a yeast infection. After starting clobetasol I have had four or five flare-ups where I needed to apply clobetasol every day for four or five days for it to calm down. I have one spot that is white and is  a small size. However, I have itching and burning usually everywhere. May i ask about your symptoms and what therapy you used/using and how have they helped? If you dont mind ofc Sure, in 2009 I developed this white patch on my foreskin - around the part that is usually at the tip (when the skin is not rolled back). I decided to get it checked out if it did not go away after about a week. It did not, so I went to a sexual health place and got diagnosed with LS.\n\nThey gave me Clobestasol and told me to go easy with it, because it is strong stuff. That rapidly improved it and basically stopped it from progressing. I do have some of the slightly gray/white misty effect on my frenulum and the top of the glans, although it really depends on the room lighting. In strong sunlight, the effect is more obvious. I have actually had routine sexual health checkups with doctors who have no knowledge that I have LS and they have never commented on it, so it looks almost normal. I did also give the white patch a scratch when it first appeared, which in hindsight was a mistake, as that is now scar tissue that can play up and get red from time to time (clobestasol clears it up).\n\nI have considered just getting the foreskin chopped off since that would take the scar tissue with it, but it ultimately seems counterproductive given the loss of sensitive erogenous tissue and functionality. In my view a complete penis with some occasional mild irritation is better than losing all the functions of the foreskin.\n\nIn hindsight, the signs were there from childhood. When I was little (maybe 3 or 4) I had some pains down there and got checked out by a doctor. I cannot remember what the conclusion was, but I also remember having some small minor cut-like marks on my foreskin when I was 7 or 8 which gave brief sharp pain when I was going to the bathroom. Probably all the same thing.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions about this. I think it is a more common issue than people think - a lot of people are squeamish about showing a doctor their junk and live with crippling issues for decades just out of some puritanical embarassment, so I am sure it goes totally unreported sometimes. Mine did the same with Pfizer! But nothing uncontrollable", "For people on clobetasol I just started using clobetasol on Wednesday and my junk is smelling pretty funky now. Is that something you guys experienced? I would get that checked out  Since I am posting in a subreddit for a rare auto immune disease that amounts to leprosy of the genitals seeing doctors on the regular is a given. I have an appointment on Tuesday to find out the results of my biopsy. Do I have vulvar squamous cell carcinoma or am I just missing parts of my labia (which apparently are not no big thing)? By posting my question I was hoping for reassurance from other users of this corticosteroid cream I am rubbing around my already traumatized pudenda  Yeah I do not have a labia minor that is why I am in this sub, but clobatesol did not make me smell weird. I was answering your question. Thank you. Your original reply did not actually answer my question but this one did. When did you find out? Are you still angry? I have been, obviously, pretty much a ball of fury for days now and I do not like that some of my friends are saying shit like \"well no one has to know except the people you show it to\" about my junk and some people are overdoing the empathy - like trying to make me cry. I do not want to cry. I want to have a normal vagina and sex and maybe punch you in the crotch. \\*you as in my touchy-feely dipshit friends who mean well, not you, nuclearoyster. It did not smell funky but it smelled slightly different. Not pleasant but not funky. It went away after a couple weeks.  I have known for about a year and a half. I was never really mad, but sad that it took so long to diagnose correctly and that it went so far. I can still have sex so it was really just getting over that a part of my body was gone.  I did not experience a smell personally,  but I have heard that yeast love the steroid. Does it smell like a yeast infection?\n\nAlso, there is another steroid you could ask about if this one bothers you too much. It is called triaminolone, and I switched to it when I was worried that clobetasol would be too strong. I have never had a yeast infection but there is not any discharge and the smell is not yeasty (reading about yeast infections mentions discharge but says they do not usually cause odors). It is also not fishy like bacterial vaginosis would be. It just smells different and weird - a bit like the end of menstruating - instead of just nothing like I am used to. I am seeing the doctor again soon so I plan to ask. Thank you for the reply!", "I just found out about this disease, please help! I am using a throw away account because I am mortified and this is going to be long. So I have had some white skin on my clitoral hood for as long as I can remember. Never thought much of it. Was raised very religious, so we did not talk genitalia. Fast forward to my marriage and I realized I do not orgasm easily at all. I do not have a lot of sensitivity on my clitoris?!? (Masturbation was a son) Weird but, hey whatever, I guess some women do not and we just have to focus on being good wives and I still enjoyed sex. Fast forward to now after two kids and a de-conversion to atheism. I am like, why is there more white skin on my clitoris, why cannot I feel much? Why is there white patches in my labia and my anus? Why is it all so itchy? It comes and goes. Thought I had ring worm actually, but nope. So me, like an idiot, finally googled this shit and read all about lichen sclerosus and now I am a mess. I am not sure I am even putting my thoughts together well. What if I have scarring and that is why I cannot feel as much on my\nClitoris. Like wtf. I approached my mom and she said I used to get white scaly itchy skin on my perineum when I was really little and she would put oil on it and it would eventually go away. Like thanks mom for not taking me to a doctor.  I am not one hundred percent sure I have this but it sure as hell sounds like I have it. What do I do now?? Why did not my OB notice this during my pregnancy?? \n\nTLDR : I just discovered this disease at 31 years old and I think I have it and I am worried about permanent loss of sensation.", "Reassurance pls So my symptoms are quite mild at the moment, slight itch during the day for a few mins then it passes, a small tear on my perineum that is not giving me too much bother but I had a peek and my skin looks like dark red/deep purple and I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this? \n\nI looked at some (reputable) sources online that say this is a common appearance of LS affected skin but I am still learning and just need some reassurance that it is okay. I am supposed to see my gyno in a month or so but I am a bit insecure at the moment and have a bit of anxiety around my current state lol.\n\nI am moving onto the twice a week treatment with Clobetasol and think maybe my treatment is not working as well as I would hoped.\n\nAny reassurance or sharing of experience would be great because I am feeling quite isolated right now Your symptoms sound the exact same as mine. Exact same. I am very very new to this LS stuff too. I feel like it is normal, for LS anyway. I really hope someone else can jump on this thread and shine some light! Just knowing you are the same has helped ease my breathing a bit! Thank you for replying!! I am also still new to having LS, but that sounds very similar to my experience. My skin did eventually go back to pink after a few months on clobetasol See mine has only just recently starting turning purple occasionally after using Clobetasol for 2 months already haha Few months? Is not it not recommended to use steroids for more than 2 weeks? Especially in the genital region? I have seen people saying this a lot but my Gyno has put me on Clobetasol for 3 months. First month twice a day, second month once a day and third month twice a week. \n\nPeople keep saying that steroids thin the skin which is true but also I have been told and read from various sources that LS thickens the skin so Clobetasol helps to soften and thin the skin that is thickened. Steroids tend to thin healthy skin which LS is not, paired with thickening so it balances out. What is important here is to not become entirely reliant on steroids cos the tolerance builds up and they become less effective. \n\nAlso I am on it for longer because they have not been able to diagnose me for 5 years and I had symptoms before that too so she wanted to get it right under control. My case has already progressed to the point I have no labia minora so she wanted to really get at it cos its been pretty bad. I understand your pain completely. I have been diagnosed with scrotal dermatitis (eczema) after being misdiagnosed for 2 years. I understand the hopelessness. I have been prescribed a protopic (pimecrolimus), but the recovery is very slow. I want to give clobetasol a try, but i am absolutely terrified of the withdrawal effects and side effects from it if I use it too long. But it is great that you have no issues. For LS, a few months is standard for 2x daily application (and less frequent use for potentially the rest of one's life.) The genitals are actually tougher than other areas of the body, although for a long time doctors believed the opposite and were hesitant to prescribe steroids for the genitals. I started with only two weeks, but after I stopped using it the symptoms came right back. So now I am trying to slowly wean myself from having to use the clobetasol every day. It is been taking a while to find the right balance, though. I think bruising is pretty common with LS. It can look really scary but it is actually not a major issue. You could always call your gyno and ask about if though, just to make sure. \n\nI think it can take a little while to get the full effect from clobetasol, but hopefully things will keep getting better and not worse now that you are diagnosed and treated. And if clobetasol does not work well enough (in the minority of LS cases it does not work well), tacrolimus is available as a plan B. Mine has always been more red/purple than white, if that helps! Also the steroid has got rid of the itching and most of the soreness, but it has not made the skin a uniform pink again, just made it less purple\u2014I am also at the every other day stage, in month two of the three month treatment. I think it does take a while to get things fully under control. Okay, thank you! I am just beginning to feel like my LS is looking more like LS than it has before. The itch used to completely subside with the steroids but the past few days it is not really done much for me and I still have a small tear that I am hoping will heal in it is own time now that I have cut down the steroid use. \n\nIdk, I just hope it will start improving again soon Just to add, I did find that after a month of clobetasol daily, it was too intense for me and was making my skin go redder, so my GP swapped me to mometasone which is still effective for LS but is less harsh. Excellent thank you again! I will see what my gyno wants to do when I next see her, hopefully cutting down may ease some of the symptoms for me for now Thank you, that is helped me a lot. It is like a deep purple that looks like how veins can look under the skin too so I was a bit suspicious about it. My gyno did say that if this does not make as much of an impact that she has tonnes of other ideas to try so tacrolimus is probably on the list haha I posted the same thing to another post and it fits here as well: \n\nYou are not alone. I was literally diagnosed yesterday. Still navigating this. I started Clobetasol last night. 2nd application this morning. I am already feeling some relief. I have got other concurring issues, due to menopause, and did not even realize it was a separate thing going on with my nether-region. Just thought due to my age (51) my vagina basically wanted to dry up and die. Even going to the doc at all was a personal triumph.\n\nI am in the stirrups and doc says, \"I am going to hand you a mirror\"...\ud83d\ude33 I was like, oh shit, wtf? \n\nMy husband has now heard the words \"vagina and vulva\" more times in 24 hours than he has in his lifetime! \ud83e\udd23\n\nAs a good friend reminded me right before I went in, \"You got this. You are in charge. She is  not the boss of you. You get to navigate what is best for you. Whatever happens, you can handle. You can do the hard things.\" \ud83d\udcaa \ud83d\udc83\n\nAdvocate for yourself and take it one step at a time!!!", "Disappearing labia minora, or was it just never there to begin with? My story \u2014 and I would like to hear yours. I am curious to know if ladies have gone through losing their entire labia minora?\n\nMy entire life \u2014 I have never had a labia minora. There was literally nothing there ever, and I just thought this was my normal. Everyone is different.\n\nLast year I started getting symptoms of itching/burning vulva and urethra. As well as frequent urination. I started to investigate by visiting multiple urologists because my family doctor thought my urethral caruncle was causing all these symptoms. I went through a cystoscopy, everything was normal. I was constantly told I had IC, until one urologist told me that is not what it was, but never really told me how to fix the problem.\n\nI pushed to see a gynaecologist. I was swabbed for yeast, and STIs at the clinic \u2014 all normal. When I saw the gynaecologist he immediate reaction when she looked at me was \u2018OH DEAR!\u2019 But I knew exactly why she had that reaction. I knew I did not have a labia minora, and no one ever had concern about it my entire 13 years of having Pap smears. I recall being a child, getting my first period, losing my virginity \u2014 all this time I never had an inner labia. I even asked my ex boyfriend from when I was 17 about it. He told me I never had one. \n\nSo I am curious to know \u2014 have any ladies out there who have lost their labia minora to LS \u2014 how does it look? There are literally no signs on me that I ever had a labia minora. I have a small clitoral hood, but no bumps or lines that indicate that I ever had any lips. Is it quite possible that I was born this way? Or did LS take away my lips as an infant? I am just totally confused. I just do not understand how someone can base my diagnoses on how my labia looks after seeing it for the first time, and adding in my symptoms into the mix. Who\u2019se to say it is not just cytolytic vaginosis, an deeper infection that needs other testing or anything else like that?\n\nI have done a biopsy and it could take up to 3 months for me to get results. I feel like I am still struggling to find relief, that my discharge has changed and something else might be to blame. I just cannot stand living in this discomfort and getting dismissed when I ask for further testing in the meantime. I cannot sleep at night over this.\n\nI would simply like to know if there are others that have gone through the same experience as me. Never actually having an inner labia vs losing their inner labia? I have seen plenty of ladies that naturally do not have an inner labia either. I know everyone is different, and this just makes it so much harder to get help and find clarity.\n\nThanks for sticking around if you have read all of this. \ud83d\udc9e I have lost about 75% of mine and trying to make sure I do not loose anymore. It is a fighting battle 12 years and counting. It is possible that you had LS as a very young child, and had lost them then. I have had it when I was 3 and i had completely lost mine. Then it went into remission and came back in my adulthood with only itching and other signs. Sometimes, people have it as children and it goes into remission for a long time until it resurfaces when they are adults. Interesting. Did you have symptoms when you were 3? I have never had any symptoms before. Though I know it is possible to have LS and not have symptoms either. Do you have any folds to show where your lips may have been? Do you have white patches since you have had it for so long?\n\nI feel like I might be misdiagnosed with this as I also have abdominal pain. Covid and all is really slowing everything down and I just want answers. \n\nThanks for sharing! When i was three i did experience itching. I dont really have any folds where my lips may have been but i do have scars. And yes, when i was three i was diagnosed only because of the white patches and shiny skin. The odd thing is, the white patches in my vulva seem to have healed but i now have patches in the perineal area. Oh that is interesting! I am really confused since I have never had any symptoms all my life. Never even had lips ever. I do not even have white patches. I feel like my symptoms are more urethra based too. It just seems so coincidental. Thank you so much for sharing with me. I am actually at the infectious disease walk in today to rule out anything else it could be. My biopsy results could take months and I have been using clob for 7 weeks with some improvement but I am still in so much pain. Take care lovely! clob I have heard is really helpful for LS fusions and such. Good luck with the biopsy! Thanks. I actually do not have any fusion, I just never had any inner lips before ever. So there is nothing there to really unfuse. I have just been told it could take 3 months to just book my appointment to get biopsy results. It is so long and I cannot stand waiting that long", "Any advice would be appreciated Hey all\n\nI had an yeast infection in the month of February. According to the reports, it is clear now. I do not have any discharge either. But I still feel itchy sometimes. Not bad enough to wake me up at night. But it is still there. Can it be lichen sclerosus? My dermatologist says she does not see any white patches down there. I do not have any tearing either. Should I consult someone else? Should I give it some more time? Did it feel a lot better after the yeast treatment? \n\nIf the itching is mild, I would give it time and be extra careful to wear loose clothes and cotton underwear, with no underwear at night, and wash with gentle unscented soap or no soap, pat dry gently, and moisturize after bathing with an unscented lotion or vaseline. Hopefully it feels better. If it keeps bothering you or it gets worse then I would go back and get seen again. Yes. It is getting better but it is definitely taking a lot of time. And my skin has become super sensitive down there. Any soap irritates it. Lasts for about 5 minutes though. I will try what you said. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f I have honestly never had white patches. And fortunately no tearing either. But the skin does feel thin. I definitely have LS, even without the patches. But it is concerning that that dermatologist does not think it is LS. \n\nIt is probably safe to wait and see if it progresses and keep an eye on things. Like, literally. I would regularly look to see what the skin looks like when it is and when it is not itchy, to see if there is a difference. \n\nBut of course if things get worse, definitely go back to the doctor! My itching is mostly on the area where there is hair. And whenever it is moist( as in during my periods of if I apply some cream), it feels better. Can it still be LS?", "42F dx with LS after 20 long years After 20 years of painful sex and a cavalcade of doctors (GIM, Gyn, and Urogyn), my current Gyn (who has treated my painful sex before with vegetable oil and a shrug) was examining me to remove an IUD (with a fresh-faced resident assisting) and said it is not cancer (um, did you say cancer?).  She said it looks like LS and she hates to use the word disorder (but cancer is easy?). She grabbed a mirror so all three of us could look, and I hesitantly looked at my vagina for the first time since I read The Color Purple (the 80s).  She showed me the white spots, spoke of cigarette paper skin, and shrinking lips (they use a cancerous product as a descriptor and did she say shrinking lips?!).  I asked if it could contribute to painful sex.  She said absolutely, but it is treatable with steroids (triamcinolone acetonide) for several months.  \n\nDay 2 of treatment and my head is still spinning.  Googling like mad for more info.  Read about a statistical but not necessarily correlative link to cancer.  Any recommendations for emollient cream?  Does that include coconut oil?  A product from which I have received some relief in the past, but that the Gyn above had previously said can be irritating - per a conference she attended.  \n\nThe painful sex has been a huge obstacle in my marriage that takes a lot of communication, creativity and some tears. I have been with my HS sweetheart since the mid 90s, and his head is spinning, too.  I am hopeful to find some relief.  When I saw the Urogyn, we thought dilators were the answer.  After months of trying, no dice.  The other answer was lidocaine, just numb it so I do not feel anything and it transfers to him.  Seems so Handmaid's Tale.\n\nHopeful and grateful to find this subreddit.  Pardon the throwaway, but there has been so much shame and embarrassment. \n\nThanks for listening Do not be ashamed or embarrassed. Those doctors should be ashamed. LS is NOTHING to be embarrassed about. Sorry that the sub is kind of dead, it is a pretty rare condition. As for emollient creams, some people like coconut oil, I personally like epaderm (you can get it on Amazon). You use it during bath time as a cleanser, as a lotion, after letting the steroid sink in.\n\nI know you have been googling so I am sure you have come across this guy that explains a lot about LS: \n\nThe video is super informative. Once you have things under control with the steroid cream (which may be a lifelong struggle and not resolved in a few months) you can start making a list of triggers that make your condition worse. A few of mine are:\n\nAlcohol\nToilet paper\nSweat\nLaundry detergent\n\nI hope you feel better and I am glad someone is finally listening! You might have to keep pushing for treatment but it is so worth it.\n Thank you, it feels good not to be alone.  I did read that it is a rare condition.  That is some excellent advice about triggers and creams, and I will watch that video. I am not new to sensitive skin, I have had eczema and allgeries to \"everything\" for years. It really is so crazy that it is taken 20 years for them to finally diagnose you. You probably know better than anyone what you are allergic to and what will make your condition worse. I really hope you feel better! Thank you, I am feeling quite hopeful. Steroid cream is going to work great. Lots of us use it. Do not let the fear of the word steroid scare you away from using it. Do not use coconut oil instead. The steroid cream helps your skin thicken again and get back to normal. It helps prevent tears and sex will become normal again. Mine did not get so bad that I had white dots but it did look ashy like I needed lotion. I use CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser (dermatologist told me to use it, said it is so gentle it will not hurt), the milky one, not the foaming one, to use as a cleanser on my vag so that I can feel cleaner and helps keep it moisturized down there.  Maybe you should see a dermatologist instead of going to your doc. She seems like she does not know much and kind of rude. Dermatologist will know what to do with LS, I promise.  Thank you for the feedback and recommendation.  I was definitely looking for something in addition to the steroids.  I have seen my dermatologist for this, but I will go back with the dx and see what she says.  Thanks I just got the diagnosis today and my doctor told me to take the steroid cream in the evening right before going to sleep, shower only once a day (before using said cream) and also to get some kind of healing cream (like oil based or moisturizing, I did not quite understand) and to use that in the mornings and throughout the day as much as I want/need. If you have that cream on and need to use toilet paper, the toilet paper will wipe only the cream away and not irritate your skin. I\u2018m quite new to this so sorry if anything is wrong :/ The steroid cream completely cleared all of my symptoms after 3-4 months. Since I am old, I will likely be using it as long as here. While it was still itchy, I would apply shea butter on the days I was not using clobetasol. If you do decide to use shea, use it without any additives; it melts in your hands, then you apply it.", "Lichen sclerosis MALEA not getting better help Lichen Sclerosis Male Not getting better\n\nI am 23 and I have had lichen sclerosis for a year and a half now and it is not getting better. A year and a half ago I first got a small white spot that I did not even notice but it hurt to pee so I went to a doctor. The urologist told me I had genital warts so for 3 weeks I was absolutely miserable and hated my life. I just found a girl I really liked and could not bring myself to tell her so I started to avoid her and when we would go out I would pretend I got too drunk so I could not have sex. The guy referred me to a dermatologist and so I was waiting for the confirmation. I walked in and right away she goes no that is lichen sclerosis. I would never heard of it before but I did not care what the hell it was, I did not have an STI. I actually started crying right there on the spot. Due to my relief and joy I do not think she had it in her to tell me what I was dealing with, and if she did all of this might of been saved. She gave me clobetosol and said come back in 6 months. That is it did not tell me anything else. I thought it was curable. I used it and it got better and I stopped and did not think anything of it. Fast forward, I love lifting and me and my friend decided to try SARMS which is somewhat like a steroid. WORST mistake of my whole life and I have not been the same since. Idk if it messed my hormones out of wack but by week 3 my lichen sclerosis was much worse and now spreading all over the head of my penis. I was now and still to this day 6 months later uncomfortable every second of the day. I am mentally defeated. 3 months in I could not take it anymore and broke down sobbing to my mom. She is tried to help me and all I do is try to put on a fake happiness that it is getting better and I am okay. I am not. I am in my last semester of school and idk how I can have a full 8 hour job everyday in this much discomfort. What girl is ganna want me? My whole penis head is practically white and I cannot even have sex without my whole head getting inflamed and red spots all over it. I feel like a monster. At least girls can get sympathy but I am supposed to be a strong guy, what girl is ganna want a guy like this. How can I do this. The only relief is when I put clobetosol all over my head, but I cannot keep doing this it will thin my skin off. Literally the day I stop clobetosol it gets way worse again and my head starts to look more bruised. It is only the head of my penis that is uncomfortable. I am on my last legs. I have lost 25 pounds and lost a ton of my muscle I have worked years for. I am eating everything organic, no diary or gluten. My diet is bland as can be. I just bought 4 pairs of expensive silk underwear for 170$. I am buying all the most expensive shit I can find trying to be as healthy as humanly possible but nothing helps. HELL I was even circumcised at birth and have been extraordinarily healthy my whole life never out of shape or overweight. It does not make sense. I still workout but I cannot enjoy it the same as I am in pain the whole time. sorry for the long ass post but I just needed to get this off my chest I do not talk to anyone about it any suggestions welcomed. 95% of this is on girls which makes it more frustrating. I have always been the happiest guy in the room and now am on the verge of depression. Id love life if I could just get this shit to stop hurting and burning all the time. I do not even care at this point if my penis looks different I just want it to stop hurting. Any suggestions for guys? Could it be balantis or yeast infection on head? Idk I am not a dude but I feel your pain. I similarly stopped the clob and tried to only use like once a week and my symptoms started again. I also am afraid of the thinning of the skin that is already thin to begin with. I just restarted on a once a day basis. I am sorry you are going through all that. I know a lot of people feel like they have to be \"strong\" but I think that just makes things harder. And you would be surprised, lots of women want partners who are in touch with their emotions (and others' emotions). I know I do. I feel like I cannot establish emotional intimacy with someone if they cannot talk about their feelings with me. I want to date a person, not a granite statue. \n\nIf you feel depressed for two weeks or more (and it sounds like you are) I would definitely consider trying therapy. I know I have been glad to have my therapist to talk to about the LS diagnosis process I have gone through recently. \n\nCan I ask how long you were on the clobetasol before you tried going off? I think twice daily for \\~3 months is standard. You have to get it under control before you start tapering the dosage, and then you might still need to apply it 1-2 times per week. Definitely do not go cold turkey with it. If you are tapering, go from twice a day to once a day, then every other day etc. Do not stop all at once. I would definitely ask your doctor for input.\n\nUsually people do not have bad side effects with the standard regimen, but another option is a steroid-free treatment like tacrolimus. I actually just switched to that one because I might be allergic to clob. If you start to notice skin thinning that is always a plan B. \n\nHopefully with better treatment your symptoms can get under control and you can have sex without pain. I do not think most women will be too concerned with the white spots. If someone asks, you can tell them it is a skin condition like eczema which has been treated, just the discoloration is left, and it is not contagious in any way. But they might not even notice. My vulva is like 100% obvious textbook LS and most doctors would not even notice it, let alone sex partners. \n\nI know it sucks to feel like you did everything right, like with exercise and diet, and this still happens. It is probably hereditary and just bad luck. Taking care of your body is still a great achievement and it has probably protected you from many other diseases. Still, I would not try too hard to eat \"perfectly.\" Gluten and dairy and so on are not problems for everybody. I would not cut one out unless you specifically noticed that it was a trigger. If you are not eating the things you like, or worse not getting enough to eat, you are only going to feel worse.\n\nDid your doctor suggest anything to deal with the burning? I know ice packs are popular for people with vulvar skin problems, especially at night. Soaking can help some skin irritations. And moisturizing is very important. Any morning or night you do not already apply clob, or after a shower, I would apply vaseline or something similar. Where do you feel the burning?\nDoes the white patch itself itch or hurt?\nWhat do u mean hurts to pee? Where exactly is it hurting?\nHow things were when you used clob? How long did u use it?\nDo you have pictures?\nDid all of this start after sarms or sarms was afterwards? The burning is on the head of my penis, but it is more so just uncomfortable and not burning if that makes sense, like it is just always inflamed. the white patches that they did a biopsy on are on the shaft and those do not hurt or cause any discomfort it is all the head that is causing problems. my head is more so just turning white and when I stop the clob it seems to progress again, last night looking almost bruised. I have been using the clob for I would say 2 months, once a day, but upped to twice a day for the last 15 days which helped with symptoms a lot and I was starting to feel better, but my doctors said they would not prescribe more so I am on my last tiny bottle. I took a day off and my whole head started hurting more again and was turning black and blue ish almost. I was diagnosed before but was no problem at all and I had no symptoms and was not affecting my head at all. 3 weeks into taking the sarms my whole head was so uncomfortable and everything was just downhill from there Thanks for the reply, I was only doing once daily for about 2 months I would say, was doing twice a day for the past two weeks but then my doctor said to stop. I took 1-2 days off and it got so much worse. I used it again last night and symptoms are better again this morning. Not sure if it matters but I got a tattoo and feel like that might have been a bad time to go off because that messes with your immune system\n\nThey prescribed me tacromulus as well but that never seemed to work for me, It is as though it is just always inflamed and the steroids just ease the inflammation for 12-24 hours then it is back Oh and it no longer hurts to pee but it was like on the inside not even right where it exits where it normally would. Sorry to hear the tac did not work. I think it works for fewer people than clob so that is why it is second line. Could you try seeing a specialist that knows about LS? Yeah I want to try and find a better doctor mine does not seem very good on the subject, so hard right now with COVID May I suggest stopping masturbation/sex for a while (months?), avoiding any urine contact with your penis and let it rest and heal? In the meantime go to a derm (to get a proper diagnosis) and discuss with them thoroughly a treatment plan and stick to it and relax and be hopeful (i know its hard)\n\nMight be any skin condition \n\nAlso tacrolimus takes weeks/months to show effect in case you have judged it prematurely.\n\nBest wishes mate", "Clitoral hood agglomeration - reversable?!

But you should talk to your doctor as sometimes it can be indicative of other things (e.g., abnormal cells on your cervix). This can be fairly common because the skin can micro-tear due to thinning, I used to have it often before I even knew I had LS. But it also could be something to do with your cervix, so it cannot hurt to ask your doctor, especially if you are concerned! I have the exact same happening to me right now..very light pink after sex..even after lubing up..pap smear clear..no contraception..no pain..my dr cant see me for 3 weeks..sitting thinking the worst \ud83d\ude35", "I am sooo dryyyy Hi guys! I was told I had LS about 5-6 years ago. I was using clob once every 2 weeks for all those years but my labia minora started shrinking or scarring to the rest of my labia?? I am not sure, but my gynecologist told me to stop using clob because my skin looked good/ to stop my labia from shrinking even more. That was about 6 months ago and now I feel sooo dry! She told me to just use lube but it dries out in an hour. I tried vitamin E oil but I noticed I had sooo much discharge while I was using that and I have tried The Honey Pot vulva cream I believe it is called but it kind of burns. Does anybody have any other recommendations? (I do not want to try emu oil) Hey! I stopped clob on my own and my derm recommended I use aquaphor since I am dry and worry about cracking! Give it a try and let me know. Do not use aquaphor if you are allergic to lanolin which is sheep fur or something. If that is the case try Vaseline. I have crazy sensitive skin and aquaphor saves me every time. I will try it, thank you! I like to use coconut oil to keep my skin moist.  It will keep me moist down there for much more than an hour.  Vaseline is a petroleum product. Idk, but I just dont like the idea of rubbing petroleum based stuff on my body.  Organic unrefined coconut oil works great for me. I will try it out, thank you :) Why do not you want to try emi oil? I would just prefer something that is vegan and cruelty free Estrogen cream!! Would I need a prescription for that? yes Thank you i second either estrogen cream or aquaphor! Thank you! Vitamin e suppositories and estrogen cream help me Thank you!  \nlisten to this for some knowledge on the clob ointment! I am literally spreading this podcast like wildfire because it is so helpful \u2764\ufe0f Coconut oil daily, if you do not want to use emu oil. Also ask your gyno about a low dose estrogen vaginal cream to be used a few times a week. I will listen to it, thank you! I started using coconut oil and so far I like it! Thank you", "Carbon Doxide Laser \n\nHello everyone \n\nI heared that Carbon Doxide Laser or CO2 laser could treat lichen scleroses even in sensitive areas for both males and females, I just wanted to ask if anyone in the group tried it and why not?\n\nThanks, I am trying to find the effects/results of this as well! I am seriously considering it! i read that it provided complete cure for the people that did it but I am very shocked because I did not find anyone who tried it to tell us his experience and I do not know why!! and I think it really works but there will be pain after the laser for about 1 week but who cares if it will provide a cure for ever for this disease! Eh, not a complete cure. It requires annual treatments to continue the relief. For some people it does not fully relieve you, but helps a lot. For some it is a miracle. For some it lasts a year and for some over a year. Since everyone is truly so different it makes me nervous to see this  golden hope and find out it did not do anything to help. I am staying positive and thinking about doing it. I would also ask around about pricing - different doctors that offer that laser treatment have unlisted prices for patients that are using it to treat a condition rather than to simply rejuvenate. I say this because it is not covered by insurance in the US. I have heard some people pay out of pocket 2k and for my doctor the clinic is charging 250 for lichen sufferers (one treatment though). And do not go to a medical spa... make sure it is done by a medical professional that knows the condition and your body whether you are male or female. I am interested to know long term effects and if there is any risk for vulva cancer due to the laser itself or any disfigurement later down the road. That sounds scary and intense, but that is why I am so hesitant. I read 3 studies that are saying it provided long term/ complete cure for the patients. Do not be afraid of cancer because it can come to anyone not only people of LS. believe in god and do your best to treat this disease and I believe that there is a treatment for this disease. This laser works by making a complete new skin/ resurfacing that is why I believe it will work. your immune system will not attack the new skin anymore because it is new and if it will attack it it will be at least after 20 years I got it!  It definitely does not offer a cure, but it releases some of the scar tissue that can cause some issues.\n\nThe surgery released the tension along the bottom part of the vulva, where it transitions to the perineum.  I no longer tear there during sex.  We also did an incision on the clitoral hood, as it had fully fused closed, covering the top of the clitoris completely.  After surgery, it is back to normal again! \n\nIt does not stop the inflammatory process though, I still use clobetasol ointment at least once a day, as well as an estrogen cream, to improve the integrity of the skin in the area. This was really helpful! How often do you use your clobetasol? Are you afraid of using it daily due to the idea that steroids thin the skin with too much frequent long term use? I am trying to be open to the idea that vulva mucous membranes is not the same as skin skin so it is not effected the same but i still get anxious over it... any input helps! I do know the treatment inspires collagen in the skin so it is very VERY interesting to me. I am glad I could help!! \n\nI use it daily, but I was having a flare recently and increased to twice a day for about a week.\n\nIt is funny, when I was first told that the treatment was a steroid cream, I had the question on the tip of my tongue\u2014literally I had taken the breath to ask, and my doctor jumped right in and assured me that it would not thin the skin.\n\nUsing the clobetasol has not only helped decrease the burning sensation with sex, it is allowing the skin cells to heal.  Now that the cells are healthy, they will be able to actually uptake the estrogen cream, to further plump the skin. How about labia minora? One more thing: can there be a no point of return in matters related to fusion?", "My Flare ups have been almost constant for the past 7 months. Even with Clobetesol. I am not really sure what to do. I eat extremely well and have changed my diet to be completely anti inflammatory. Anyone have any suggestions??  Are you letting some air get to the area? If your usual remedies are not working, maybe get in touch with your doctor if you have not already Have you tried any other meds, like tacrolimus? Sadly clob does not work for 100% of people did tacrolimus work for you? i think the protopics work at such a slow rate compared to steroids. I am honestly not sure because I have more signs than symptoms, so the timescale is slow. Tacrolimus definitely worked immediately for my perianal psoriasis, though (my psoriasis itches like mad so I can easily tell.) My elbow psoriasis, on the other hand, responded faster to clob and not to tac. It is kind of a tossup. \n\nI think steroids work for a higher percent of LS patients than the calcineurin inhibitors, but sometimes calcineurin inhibitors work in the people for whom steroids did not work. I have celiac disease and if I accidentally ingest gluten it makes my LS flare like crazy. Do you have any additional issues, allergies or anything like that could be causing inflammation? I am personally starting to think that the clobetasol is contributing to a portion of my irritation. I noticed a pattern that I would feel very irritated my steroid days \u2014 I think I might ask to be switched to a less potent steroid. Perhaps try to see if there is a pattern for you? I have not yet, will be seeing a GYNO soon, so hopefully they can try something else on me! have not tried that yet! but I will suggest it, thanks! my worst symptom is itching, its pretty much constant and has been for the last few years. Guess I will just have to try both, thanks! I also have a gluten sensitivity and if I have any gluten or alcohol it seems like it goes nuts. I eat a very healthy diet but am going to get some more allergy testing done soon to see if that could be a factor. Thanks! I made a post a day or so ago. Phototherapy is a remarkable treatment. I mentioned that directed narrow spectrum uv-b light can lead to remission in that area rather fast. If clobetesol or a relative do not work. Tacrolimus is another treatment that works for some people and not for others. The difference is that tacrolimus really limits the immune system in that area. More so than a steroid. This in turn can increase risk of (be it a small % mind you) of developing skin cancer. The immune system fights off cancerous cell development and hindering it increases the risk of it developing. As a dermatologist told me at my appointment, the next level of treatment if steroids/tacrolimus have failed, a DMARD is the next candidate. You do not want to be on a DMARD if you can control it with other methods. That is why I mention phototherapy. My daughter was on the DMARD methotrexate and it is not a nice drug family. Methotrexate is the DMARD you would likely be put on and its nasty.\n\nTry and find a dermatologist that offers phototherapy, ask about it. If it makes sense to you, try a portable unit like the Dermapal. No I do not work for them, it just happened to work for me and it is easy to use and it decreased the flare up quickly once I used it consistently. As I read, it does not increase the risk of developing skin cancer more so than L.S. already does. \n\nEdit: Just remembered I should mention as a pro, steroids thin the skin through atrophy while phototherapy would not. Steroids did make things feel super sensitive for me. It actually does thin the skin more due to it is atrophy inducing effects. This last bit is not accurate. Topical corticosteroids run the risk of thinning non-LS skin/healthy skin. But the dermis of patients with Lichen Sclerosus differs drastically from the dermis of a healthy patient - this is illustrated in biopsy comparisons. Because the inflammation caused by LS leads to sclerotic and fibrotic tissues (scarring and skin thickening), our skin is different. Thus, if I apply steroids to my non-LS skin, I run the risk of dermal thinning, however, because the dermis is different in my vulva, this risk is not there.\n\nCheck out this paper on absorption and side effects of topical corticosteroids here: (\n\nWith that said, not everyone tolerates ultra-potent steroids. In that paper, there is a list of different potency classes for steroids. You may need to try a different steroid/potency. Not everyone can tolerate Clobetasol, and even if they can, it may not help everyone. I know some folks have a lot of success with Halobetasol, Betamethasone, Mometasone, etc. Steroids are the first-line treatment because thus far, they are the only treatment to demonstrably show a statistically significant reduction of inflammatory markers on biopsies. Because LS is a premalignant condition, it is crucial to address the inflammation. However, the second line, and perhaps this is something to consider is calcineurin inhibitors (this is a non-steroidal cream). In a study that compared Pimecrolimus (a calcineurin inhibitor) to Clobetasol, it was found that upon blinded examination or pre and post-treatment biopsies, both showed a statistically significant reduction of inflammation (although Clobetasol was superior in this), thus, this is a great alternative. &gt; As I read, it does not increase the risk of developing skin cancer more so than L.S. already does\n\nOh, neat. I have not come across this in the medical literature. Can you link the study that examines Lichen Sclerosus, Phytotherapy, and vulvar cancer? Sure, I hope this is helpful. I typed it out in word.  I do not know if I covered all your answers. I just went to Google Scholar and did one search and got an older 2001 study. I then did a search for newer research. I did not learn about this from one study but rather a lot of different studies. I also found this just as a pretext:\n\n( which is a clinical trial from last year it looks like using the Mona Lisa laser so that is cool.\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nI could not copy and paste what I wrote but I wanted to point out, some studies point out cancer risk to UVB some say there is no increase if you look at each link. Pay special attention to sample size (n), confidence interval (CI), and p-value (p). If there is a greater than 95 CI, it is too broad and not good data or there is no link between causation/correlation. A small sample size insanely skews data points. Unfortunately, being a rare condition, your not going to see really good data on it. Basically, try things, it might work it might not. Pay attention to risk vs benefit. My daughter is at an increased chance for cancer development, specifically lymphoproliferative disorders because her white blood cells are being produced at a rapid rate. This increases the chance of errors in DNA replication. So when we get meds for her, it says side effects which have been noted have been carcinomas and leukemia, lymphoproliferative cancers. The medicine cannot be excluded from a cancer correlation because rheumatoid arthritis in and of itself also increases the risk of these cancer. This is the same argument with regards to autoimmune skin conditions. I hope this helps. This is fantastic, thank you so much for all of these. I am going to slowly work my way through them over the next few weeks. Yeah, unfortunately small sample size is an issue for LS with all studies. One of the largest to date is the 507 cohort study by Fischer et AL, but on average, of the studies I have read, the mean seems to be 20, which, as your rightly note, is low. Can I ask how many treatments you have had and if treatment requires follow ups or is it a 6 treatments and your done for life? And I agree. Risk versus benefit comes into play with every single treatment option out there. There are risks and benefits to all current treatment options. I got the device early in the year. It started with whole body treatment but wearing like a gown. They gave me high spf to rub everywhere I did not want to get exposed to the light. That bothered me and I said, is not there another option because it seems ridiculous to do my whole body and put so much sun block on and worry about cancer risk to healthy tissue. The dermatologist said we do have this hand held unit but insurance likely will not approve it but we can submit for it anyways. \n\nThey did and because LS does not cover my whole body, it is extragenital so I am luckier than a lot of people here. I got it on my neck in my 20s back in 2001 or 2003 and the VA misdiagnosed it and just shrugged their shoulders. It got bigger and bigger. I also had it on my back but I did not realize, pretty big too. I decided to finally go to a dermatologist at a private sector health system which came back as LS. From that point forward, I have the presumption of LS for any white/shiny area on my body. Now, the area of my neck gets random extensions while some of it burns out. My back is now dormant but I got new areas around my knee and my groin. I decided to use the light more aggressively and it has been remarkable in the groin area as it is newly active. I am experimenting on the areas of dormancy to see if the skin returns to normal which it has been shown to. \n\nIt is basically a cat and mouse game. I was doing followups but once I got the prescription..and moved, I do not worry about that. I just moved to Arkansas and the dermatologist here had not prescribed such a treatment and suggested tacrolimus. I read about the increased risk of cancer using this ointment and do not use it but I have a whole tube of it. It is basically a cream version of enbrel or humira. I hear time and time again not to blunt the immune system if you absolutely can help it. He said if tacrolimus does not work, then it comes down to methotrexate. I was like hell no. If I had it in the ano-vaginal area, I can definitely see someone using MTX because that would be a danger zone for anyone. I would take it until that resolved and then get off of it and stay on top of any new lesions with phototherapy. Steroids thin the tissue and that in and of itself is bad for such an area of the body. I have my light and I have my prescription card so I just stay on top of it. They have such limited knowledge of this disease and with a bit of reading you can have as much knowledge as them. I also work in healthcare so I have a good amount of knowledge. Amazing. You are clearly great at advocating for your body and your values! Ugh, moving almost always throws a wrench in our treatment plan. I am very familiar with the literature on Clob and Pimecrolimus but not tacrolimus (other than the fact that it can sting). When you say you have your light, do you mean you have your own phototherapy device? I have been seeing light therapy devices from people in the Facebook groups. Yes. I do. It is a small one. It cost me 500.00. Insurance did not help because it has to cover so much of your body and envelope a large part of your hand. It is essentially the rules for psoriasis/eczema or something. So I just went ahead and bought it myself. At first, the company tried to charge me 1000 and I was like wooah there lady. She knocked it down to 500. Not sure why. You are given a prescription which the company calls you up to go over the instructions with you. So you start off with the light with a specific wavelength and a starting time. You use this large table that you follow along almost like a multiplication table. You find your energy level and then go across to some column to find your time. It says go up if no pink and do not if pink. You cannot miss doses, I think you do it every other day. They also give you some uv goggles and then it is up to you on how you want to do it. IT has like a comb on it to keep distance from your skin and the bulb. \n\nThere are weird light things you can buy but it is not the same, I promise you. This light is specially made for you with a special bulb. Just google dermapal Daavlin. It is the first pic that comes up with google images. Apparently if you are so unlucky that this condition is enveloping your entire body, they apparently have a phototherapy at home with a huge bed. It costs thousands to have one of those, I imagine they rent it to you or something. This is not that lol. I just read about that and also heard they were providing entire body sized units but for really bad off people where a small light will not cut it. Are you using Clob. cream or ointment? I have found that creams usually give me zero relief and even can make things so much worse for me down there. \n\nI made it a point to ask for Clobetasol  \nOINTMENT not cream and can tell you the ointment has given me SUCH relief! I think whatever is in the cream suspensions irritates me... badly! I guess  the ointment does not have any of the irritating crap in it that the cream has. is it usually cream that is given or ointment If you think the creams irritate you or if they provide no relief, you can ask your doc tp specifically prescribe you ointment and not cream.\n\nJust told mine that the cream suspensions irritate me/make it worse... asked her to write me a script specifically nothing ointment and was not a problem. The ointment was a game changer for me. I could not believe the difference in results from the cream! I commented below somewhere regarding ointment versus cream Clobetasol. I cannot use the cream. Whatever they add to the cream to help suspend the clobetasol made me wish I never replied it in the first place. I got no relief and, in some areas, the cream actually made my symptoms worse. I switched to ointment and the difference was night and day for me. Unexpected to get such a different result from dumping the cream and going with ointment. Just an anecdotal suggestion for my own personal experience. :0) I have always used the ointment never the cream so it is definitely the steroid but thank you!

I am still on my first tub which I got many months ago, so I would say it is pretty good value in the long-run. If you are still having symptoms, you should still be using the steroid cream daily.

I am hoping the OP provides an update on his progress following the surgery, as there does not seem to be many if any male patients who underwent circumcision in an effort to cure their LS standing up and singing the procedure praise. \n\nUpon researching the condition after being diagnosed and looking for answers, it seems like the LS community, both medical and patients, are confined to a small desk in a poorly lit room attempting to understand this annoying disease.

What the odds are, I could not say.  If LS only gets worse over time you seriously might consider a circumcision to get rid of it and to appear even.  I have heard of some people just getting the LS part cut off.  Not sure how that looks afterwards though and if that even matters to you.\nDepending on the how much has to be removed, you could get it cut, then perhaps join us on /r/foreskin_restoration and do some restoring once healed.\nGood luck to you.

Recommended by my dermatologist  I was actually thinking of getting a partial circumcision, as currently only a small portion of the tip of my foreskin (when not retracted) is affected. \nSo, in my mind, removing the top portion of foreskin may be just as beneficial as a full circumcision without as much of the negatives. \nThat theory is largely based on the idea that urine plays a role in the development of LS in males, rather that it being an autoimmune disease.  Hey. Do you think its okay to put on the glans?", "Might I have LS? Hi everyone! So I have been experiencing some symptoms of LS - and yes I am planning on booking an appointment with the doctor regarding this - but I do not want to sound completely crazy suggesting LS to her so I figured I would come here first!\n\nMy symptoms:\n- vulvar itching is nearly constant \n- the skin in between the two holes has torn multiple times for seemingly no reason at all which makes using the toilet and sex extremely painful \n- I have got type one diabetes which puts me at a higher risk anyway :/\n- I have not had any \u201cwhite patches\u201d but I have noticed the occasional raised lumps or raised lines which go away after about a week(?) and the skin has become very shiny\n\nIdk I do not want to seem like a hypochondriac so does it seem like I may have it or am I paranoid? Thanks in advance! Sounds like LS to me. You are not paranoid at all! Those are all early symptoms of LS, it is perfectly reasonable to suspect it. I experienced the same things, then a few months later developed the characteristic white patches. I really recommend suggesting it to your doctor, mine gave me steroid ointment to treat LS before I was properly diagnosed to see if it would help, it really did and stopped the tearing and itching.

Catch it before your clitoral hood fuses. I did not \ud83d\ude14 It sounds like it could be. But whether or not it is LS, *something* is up. Whether or not you suspect LS, severe pain and lumps *have* to be checked out by a professional. Pain with sex is never normal. Reading up on what could be causing it is not being a hypochondriac. It will help you to have an informed and confident discussion with your doctor, to point out the relevant things to them, and to call them on it if they are pretending to know what they are talking about, which happens a little too often. Definitely sounds like LS, do not let doctors tell you that you do not fit the typical LS mold i.e age, and push for a biopsy of your perineum then you know for sure &amp; either way can move fwd. If they tell you they will not biopsy, find someone who will, it took me 7yrs &amp; I was right all along.

I started clobetasol cream tonight, and will be using it twice a day for 30 days for now. I was wondering what the cream is supposed to do exactly. My perineum is extremely tight and scarred. Will the cream loosen up the skin or help with the scar tissue? Is it possible to prevent the constant tearing? How often do I need to get it checked to make sure there is not cancer? Is my annual obgyn visit enough? Thanks to anyone who replies :) Diagnosed 6 years ago. The cream helps me with the scaring as well removes the white spots.  It also keeps the itching away. I am currently applying every night. Occasionally I forget but generally speaking I am pretty good about it. I have found that tearing, leading to painful sex only occurs when I have a flair up but if I am consistent with the cream I am pretty good. My gynecologist is seeing me every 6 months right now because I still have some spots but once I have those under control it will be once a year. She assures  me that if I have it checked out annually there should be no issues with cancer. The main issues I have with this is keeping up on the cream when everything is good. I know I need to but I often forget, my other issue is sex with a new person. I found having to explain all that and be sexual with a person difficult. Best of luck. I was also diagnosed 6 years ago and I usually go once every 6 months to see my specialist. Although it was a year this year. I use the same cream once a day before bed and twice a day if I am having a flair up. It seems to mainly help with the itching but it does seem to loosen the skin up slightly which can certainly help. Good luck and I hope it is manageable for you My doc told me that I can try spreading out how often I use the cream, eventually aiming to use it once a week at night but right now I am applying it every other night. \nI use coconut oil after showers and the doc told me that coconut oil can be used any time and is a great lubricant for sex. I made myself a little jar for the bathroom Would be grateful if you would tell name of the cream (I am going to see gynecologist anyway, but right now I am collecting any information possible) What cream do you use?

But you deserve to be accepted for yourself and the whole body you carry around. \n\nBe honest, be self-accepting, and let the chips fall where they may. It can mean short term grief but long term you will then have room for the people that do not hurt you. \n\nSigned, a forty-something that needs to take their own advice. Especially twenty years ago. But today too. Thanks so much :)) hope you have a great day!! I will work on the self acceptance :)", "Will using ointments make it worse Hi! I was diagnosed last year after visiting my gp. I went in for something else but she recognised the lichen sclerosis and she told me to use Betnovate to see if I would clear up. It did not but it did irritate my skin. I have had no itching or tearing and it has not caused me any issues. Had it for over 10 years. I was referred to hospital and the consultant prescribed Dermovate she advised me to use it but did not expect it to make any difference and I have been booked in for a biopsy. \n\nQuestion is I am concerned if I use these ointments it will make something that is not a problem into a problem?\n You are not alone. I am not sure either. I take clobetosol something. Some drs say use it always some say just for outbreaks  You are generally prescribed a course eg I dermovate once a day for two weeks, then every 2 days for a week then three times a week (that is pretty similar to what I prescribed) but as my dermatologist said to me, I can judge when I need it and I find that to work so far. ", "Scared to have sex (29/M) I have a ten millimetre white patch on the left side of my glans (fortunately I guess that is all I have these days, was much worse two years ago with a bruise on top of that patch). I am frightened that when it comes to sex a girl will see that patch and I will never be able to have sex again, and it is really affecting my confidence and mental health. Do you think I am worrying about it too much or would something like that always be an automatic dealbreaker and I will not be able to be in a relationship ever again?", "Anyone else? 24 years old, never orgasmed, took four doctors for someone to even examine me, then two after diagnosis to be given treatment Just wanted to throw a quick run down of the Hell I have gone through before I focus on the \u201cnever orgasmed\u201d part. I am about to receive my final laser treatment of the \u201cMona Lisa touch\u201d then we do steroid creams on top of the estrogen cream, but I would just really like to know if anyone else has dealt with this in their sex life with the disease? I have had Lichens sclerosus for easily over 11 years, so genuinely I am starting from the beginning as far as sexual feeling of pleasure, and my husband and I are going to try and have sex after the treatment, it is been 7.5 months and I am really nervous. It feels like I am basically a virgin and I feel like no one else understands. I do not even know HOW to orgasm, I have never had feeling down there before!", "Panic spread to other parts of your body? I know that is when I have a very bad flare-up in my vaginal and buttocks area I seem to start having a break out in between my breasts and underneath my breast. Normally I would dismiss it because of heat but it has not been hot enough yet like the summer time?. But what I have noticed is when I have a flare-up down below I get the flare up between my breast and it looks like white patches but it looks like big bumps like pimples except they are itchy and painful. I tried Nystatin oh, I have tried that certain I have tried the lichen sclerosus cream. I cannot quite tell what clears it up. I think the nest head clear step. But if Nystatin clears it up is it just a rash or is it related because it breaks out when I have a flare up down below. Also with the same breakout that I have in between my breasts I have all along my underwear line especially on the right side. It is gotten so bad where I have to have gone out to buy boxer briefs panties because I cannot wear regular underwear now It could be related, my derm said that inverse psoriasis and LS can manifest in similar ways, and can both be treated with a steroid cream. Especially as inverse psoriasis shows itself in the folds of your body- think armpits, ears, etc. Perhaps visit your doctor again, and mention this? So check with doctor and throw psoriasis into the pot of skin conditions .  .i am having super tough time pulling my self OUT OF MY PITY PARTY I get that. I get that hard core!!! That is the hardest part for me actually. This is not fair! It is painful and debilitating sometimes and it means you cannot just be normal like everyone else!! It is so damn frustrating. I am sorry. :( If you google it, does it look like Lichen Planus? Thank you, I did check it out and no. .thank God it is not that.   However, the inverse psoriasis looks more like it When I have been ill or stressed I have often got a red rash around my hairline at the same time as a lichen flare-up, which was why my old GP mistook my LS for dermatitis while it was v mild. My new GP, who is a bit more knowledgeable about this stuff, said that if someone has one dermatological condition, it is quite normal for them to have another as well, and that the same sort of factors would be likely to cause a flare \u2014 so she thinks maybe mild psoriasis or eczema on the hairline in my case.", "Could this be lichen sclerosus in its early stages?

I set up an appointment, and I am going to go to one in the next three weeks. Do you have any idea of what it looks like? Been told it was normal by my gp and a urologist Not a doctor but I do not see anything that looks like LS. Maybe it could be phimosis? I think I might have a slight form of phimosis because my foreskin sort of peels back instead of glides but it kind of looks like a dry skin issue as well and I cannot really wrap my finger around it No sorry no idea. how long has it looked like this. how old are you ? I am 18, looked dry and wrinkly for probably a year to a year and a half but I think it is gotten a little worse over time I cannot really remember. I am hoping to get a diagnosis at the dermatologist and if there is not one I am going to ask to take some tests or to get a biopsy. Definetely does not look normal though, right? when I was about 15 or 16 i had something simular around the base of the glans, on the underside. They said it was normal, and it did go away. but not same. That was 50 odd years ago. Good luck with your visit. Did Your glans look like this though? it looled like white small dots but only on underside not the same Yeah those were probably just pearly penile papules or at least sounds that way in which you described it", "Does this look like lichen?  Not too sure if it is lichen because mine looks more like white patches. This definitely looks irritated and inflamed. Is it itchy or painful for you? I would definitely recommend seeing a gyno although it may be hard to get an appointment right now. I actually went to the doctor about it today!! She said it is contact dermatitis. So i am taking some meds for a couple weeks to see if it goes away. She said it deff does not look like lichen though. Ahh I am glad you were able to see a doctor!! And glad it is not lichen but whatever it is I hope it goes away soon and that you will feel comfortable again. I would definitely agree that it does not look like lichen, which is great! If you get vulvar irritation again, I would recommend either pure aloe from the plant or Manuka honey, both all natural options that work like a charm.", "Tears: Clob or LS?! Hi all!\n\nDoes anyone have advise on telling the difference between tears from LS vs tears because of Clob thinning your skin? \n\nI have always gotten tears since my LS flared, but I am getting tears with very little pressure now when my skin feels pretty much fine. I have been using Clob at least twice a week (Or more than that) for 10 months. I have tried several times to stop using it, but usually flare within three days of not applying it. \n\nJust wondering if anyone has experience with skin thinning and what to watch for. \n\nThanks! I wish I had advice, but I do not.  I will say that I was told by my dermatologist that clob will actually NOT thin the labia skin, like it will for other skin, for reasons unknown to me.  But I have been using it regularly for a couple months and am still having issues with tears.  Tears from just minor things like using a menstrual cup.  But then the clob helps to heal it quickly.  I wish I had answers as well because it is very frustrating! I would reach out to your doctor and definitely do not want to stop using it during a flair seems like you might need your meds adjusted. For the tears you will not know until you get it examined right away. I know that if you use too much of clobetosal that it can thin out your skin. But not using the amount you need can also have the same affect.", "Any other health issues related to ls? Does anybody of you have other problems with the ls besides the spots or itchiness. I have the feeling I have Hormon troubles etc? It is commonly associated with hypothyroidism and low sex hormones, if you feel like something is wrong you should bring it up with your doctor and get tested. What do u mean with tested? Thx! I have endometriosis and asthma. Gallbladder up and died a couple years ago. \n\nThere is a common thread for the asthma, LS, and gallbladder - chronic stress and inflammation. I grew up in a rough house and got into a rough marriage and one of my kids is tough too. Never know when there is going to be a panic emergency. It is been terrible for my body. Oh I am so sorry! I have an gyn appointment in a month anyway because of ls (diagnosed in December) so I will ask her what I could might have also. I would not say anyone NECESSARILY has any other conditions alongside LS -- doc cannot just come up with a list of \"you might have\".  You could ask for bloodwork (looking at your blood to check levels of things - cholesterol, blood sugar, levels of certain vitamins and hormones, iron, etc) if you have not had any kind of physical in the last couple years.  But there is not any particular red-flag thing to go look for that a doc would say \"oh hey, we should test you for this other thing\" if you do not have any particular symptoms of other issues messing with your life.\n\nDoc is going to tell you to eat a healthy diet and avoid stress.  :-D It is autoimmune and inflammatory, so it is likely many folks have other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. You can have your hormones tested for imbalances and be treated for them.  I was told to monitor it over time, because there is a risk of it becoming cancerous. ( only addresses female LS.

Thank you all! Ok. I have such a terrible itchiness the last week. Go to see my doctor on Thursday. Hope she can help. Tried gluten-free diet but did not work. I was just pissed....", "London private doctor? Hello, Im wondering if anyone know of a private clinic in London where i can get my diagnosis confirmed. Im a male so im sure there are some penis specialist places or derma specialists. I dont want it on my NHS record which is why i want to go private. Thanks guys Although I live in USA now I grew up in England.\nI went to private doctor in Harley street when I was younger for a law suit.\nI recommend a dermatologist, this is a skin condition. \nI do not understand why you are concerned about the NHS record, this is an autoimmune disease not a transmissible one you catch or pass on. He might be concerned that it is not LS but actually an std Maybe ! But I am still suprised. A highly recommend dermatologist specializing in this issue is Professor Christopher Bunker. He will want a referral to see you. His details are available on line. He is extremely good. I was diagnosed in London in 2016 after a biopsy on my lower lip, done through NHS but before I did the biopsy I went to the London Dermatology Centre, the doctor there just looked at my lip and said it was LS, told me to check my vulva. They recommended me to go ahead with the biopsy and come back if I needed. I did not return as I got the diagnosis and treatment with NHS but I recommend them. I think just that initial appointment was \u00a3200 or \u00a3300.", "Aloe for LS Does applying Aloe (natural, directly from the plant) really helps treating/\"curing\" LS? I need to find a less expensive treatment since Tachrolimus ointments are so over-priced. Thanks! I do not know about Aloe. Zinc paste for diaper rash helps me but certainly does not cure LS. It makes the flair ups more tolerable.  I use coconut oil and Young Living lavender down there.  I used it for years to control the itch before I found out what I had. You just want to use a natural lavender and not synthetic stuff\u2014natural lavender has anti inflammatory properties!  I also have a moisture barrier (similar to Vaseline in a tube) that I will put on if I will be wearing skinny jeans or leggings to protect my skin. \n\nAs soon as you feel heat, pain, or itch, treat it!\n\nAlso, my diet greatly affects it.  If I am eating a carb high diet, I get flare ups.  I am about to start Keto because it reduces inflammation internally, which in theory should reduce inflammation there and my immune response. Might be worth trying!", "Only itchy before period The whole inner side of my vulva is paler; not in patches, but as a whole, it is paler. My itch is intense the weak before my period on the vulva and an labia as well as the clit, and becomes less itchy during my period and stops entirely thereafter (until my next cycle).\n\nIs this LS? This is exactly what I go through and look like. I have been diagnosed. I itch so bad it keeps me up. Same here Yeah my itch is only for a while. I sleep well through the night. And the itch stops after my period is over. Was that the same for you? Same here, my LS heavily depends on my cycle. Is it itchy only before/during your period? It is the most itchy for about a week before my period and then completely disappears when I am on my period. I have not figured it out completely but I guess it is connected to hormonal changes and the changing consistency of discharge that comes with it (sorry if it is TMI) Saaaaame It still is the same, honestly. I have not really found anything that really works for me, yet. As long as I can fall asleep I will not lay there and scratch. I itch too bad during periods\ud83d\ude11 Have you been diagnosed with LS by a doctor/biopsy? I am curious as I go through the same thing, still waiting on biopsy results though. I do not feel complete relief after my period. I feel constant irritation then it is 100x worse the week before my period... when my period starts - it goes away. Then when my period ends, I am feeling discomfort again but less than the week before my period! How are you feeling now?", "Any ways I could rule out LS on my own? My (F32) clitoris and clitoral hood have been itching on and off for a few weeks now, and it is impossible to overstate how terrified I am to potentially have lichen sclerosis. No matter how innocent a search I conduct on Google, LS always shows up. I have no other symptoms except clitoral itching. Vulva appears normal, no abnormal discharge, no smell, no pain with PIV sex or sexual stimulation of any kind. Even the itch is not that bad, just continues to resurface randomly. I have considered a yeast infection that is just on the outside, and I have considered smegma buildup causing irritation/itching, since I have noticed the little smegma \"pearls\" since itching. But the truth is I just do not know.\n\nMy question is are there any ways for me to rule out potential causes on my own? For example, should I buy the typical yeast infection medication at my local pharmacy? Or could I put hydrocortisone cream around my clitoris? If either of those solved the itch, could I theoretically rule out LS? I would never heard of an external yeast infection but apparently they can be a thing.\n\nI *am* able to see a doctor eventually (though I am still mortified at the potential cost $$ because I do not have traditional insurance, only healthcare sharing which means I will be reimbursed *after* paying for all my medical expenses), but I am in the middle of a huge transitional period. My husband and I are moving across the country (US) next week and taking a month long fun trip to do it, so it is just a bad time to try to get in to see a doctor. Even then, I have no clue what kind of doctor to start with. If there was a way to temporarily treat the itch, and/or potentially rule out LS with a simple OTC treatment, that is going to be my only option until July.\n\nThanks! You are all warriors to me. If you have not tried the yeast infection cream yet then def give that a go first! Generally itching could be so many things, the most common sign of LS would be the white patches/shimmery skin patches around the vulva, so keep an eye out for that. Do you have any other symptoms that match LS? Hope you are okay, an itchy vulva is very annoying! &lt;3 If the itching is mild and nothing else seems out of the ordinary, it does not sound like something you need to be too worried about. You could try the yeast treatment if you want, but I would not recommend the hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone is actually a weaker form of the drugs usually used to treat LS, but it can also alleviate many other conditions, so I do not think it would prove anything either way, and it could probably worsen some conditions.\n\nThere are many things that can cause itching, and a lot of them are minor. What you said here makes sense to me as a reasonable guess:\n\n&gt;I have considered smegma buildup causing irritation/itching, since I have noticed the little smegma \"pearls\" since itching\n\nI would suggest taking some short, warm (not hot) baths where you gently stretch the foreskin and soak off any trapped smegma. Then immediately moisturize with vaseline or another mild, unscented lotion. Avoid soaps and fragrances, and skip underwear, especially at night, and see if it feels better. When you do wear underwear, cotton only, and avoid tights and leggings.\n\nYou are right that LS is a possibility, but if you do not have white patches and you do not have any other symptoms, a doctor will probably not consider LS to be very likely at all, and if you only have mild itching it is probably not even worth the pain of a biopsy to find out. And if you do not have white patches, it will not even be clear where to take a biopsy from. All you could do is keep a a close eye on it to see if anything changes. Also, even if you did have LS, it is not necessarily a terrible thing. It is totally possible to have mild LS, and if you do have LS, it is certainly mild at this point based on what you said. Googling shows you scary pictures of severe, highly progressed LS, and people post here about frustrating treatment-resistant cases, but most LS cases respond well to treatment and can be brought into remission, especially when diagnosed early (which would be the case for you.) \n\nIf the itching gets to where it is really bothering you, I would see a gynecologist promptly and have them do the standard pelvic exam, pH test, wet prep, and whiff test, and any STI tests or other tests that they recommend. Get a pap smear while you are there if you are due for one; it should be covered as standard preventive care. If the itching stays mild but still does not go away after a few more weeks, when you are settled (and de-stressed), you should probably still visit the gyn (and if you have not been in recent years and/or you are due for the pap, you may as well go anyway.) I do not have any other LS symptoms, and you are right that itching could be so many things. It is likely just anxiety being obnoxiously loud in my head. Thank you for replying! So far the itching is infrequent/minor enough that I am going to hold off on yeast infection treatment. But if it continues or gets worse, that will be my first response. I wish I could give you a gift card to your favorite restaurant or something for this haha. Thank you for taking the time to write it out; it was thoughtful and directly answered some important aspects of my post. Most especially it is invaluable to know what doctors need in order to be able to even test for LS. I can definitely say there is no specific area to take a biopsy from, and that is something I did not know they would need. So even if I do have early LS, there is literally nothing to be done yet. Which tells me hopefully the progression is fairly slow. You are so right about the terrifying images on Google, and as a layperson I just did not know how quickly the atrophying and fusion could happen. I will definitely see the gyn as soon as I get settled, as it is time for a visit anyway plus I want to get the process started for testing for possible infertility. Thanks also for the warm bath suggestion. My husband did a little trim down there for me last night so it will be easier to keep clean and monitor. Do you reckon coconut oil would be good to moisturize around the clitoris? No problem! When I figured out I had LS, my way of coping was by doing a ton of research, so I am always happy to put it to use. \n\nA lot of people on this sub seem to really like coconut oil. I have heard that it might not be a good idea for some people, especially in the vagina if you are prone to yeast infections, because its antibacterial properties could reduce the \"good bacteria\" that keep the vagina healthy. But some people report using it as lube for penetrative sex with no issues. So I would guess that just putting it around your clitoris would be pretty safe. You can probably use whatever you like as long as it is moisturizing and does not have fragrances, preservatives etc. that could be irritating. I should emphasize that I am not a doctor, so obviously none of this is professional advice, but that is my two cents from what I have seen and read. Hello! I have purchased these pH tests before: (\n\nThey can tell you if your pH is out of balance Go to planned parenthood! An np from PP discovered my LS after numerous doctors did not and brushed off the severe pain I had. Visually, i would not have noticed anything on my vulva until it was pointed out. I never have had problems with sex. I do have atrophy on my inner labia. \n\nAt pp it is It is free (if you qualify)  and they will sign you up for a plan if you do not have one. Otherwise it is $200 cash or less (they will tell you and you will not have to deal with billing). \n\nRegardless You probably need to see a dermatologist to get diagnosed regardless. At least I did and I am in NYC. Obgyns will not prescribe me anything here and most do not know much about it. \n\nIf you can get any doctor to prescribe you steroids you are good regardless.\n\nI have never had a biopsy.", "Hydrocortisone How long should it take for hydrocortisone to stop the itch? My gyno thinks I have a mild case of LS, I have no white patches or dryness or fusing or splitting skin just an unexplainable itch. Can anyone give me an idea of how long it should take to feel improvement if it is mild? I am meant to use it for 6 weeks and it is been 2 nearly and no sign of it easing yet. I have never heard of hydrocortisone being prescribed for LS. I do not think it is a strong enough steroid. I would seek out a diagnosis so you can seek further treatment based on your symptoms. A dermatologist may be of better help. Usually Clobetasol is used. I was originally prescribed hydrocortisone when they thought I had psoriasis. It helped a little sun terms of itch after a couple weeks but did not improve the quality of my skin. I saw a dermatologist a few Months later who diagnosed clobestesol and it worked almost instantly. So the hydrocortisone May work, but I would encourage you to go back if it does not improve by the end of your 6 week treatment plan. Agreed. Hydrocortisone is one of the weakest steroids out there, and clobetasol is one of the strongest. Using hydrocortisone for LS is probably going to be like hammering a nail with a fly swatter.\n\nThen again, if the only reason to suspect LS is itching, that may not be justification for using an ultrapotent steroid. There are SO many things that cause vulvar itching. I assume the gyn did the appropriate tests to rule out other causes? In any case, a visit to a dermatologist sounds like a good idea. Thanks great thank you for the help! Thanks, yes the hydrocortisone does not seem to be doing anything for me, I might see another gyno for a second opinion if possible but here it takes months maybe years to get an appointment :: You might try the dermatologist as well. Some people think derms are better for LS, but you can also just go wherever the wait time is shorter.", "carbon doxide laser ", "Doctor recommendations? (in Boston but other places too?)

Hi I know this is very far into the future for me, but I am still very curious to see what my options are if and when I do decide I want kids. Just some background... I have vaginismus and lichen sclerosis so my pelvic floor muscles can be hard to control and the surrounding vulvar skin is also tight and sensitive. My vaginismus has significant improved- I can wear tampons comfortably, get a Pap smear with minimal pain, and fit two fingers pleasurably now. The LS is harder to fix, but I have started using estrogen cream. \n\nIs there anyone here who has either condition (or both) and has gotten successfully pregnant through intercourse? One of the OBGYNs I saw told me I would probably end up getting a c-section in fear of tearing and making my LS worse, and I just wanted to hear any thoughts or advice! I have severe LS (phimosis of labia minora and clitoris) and ive had no issues at all getting pregnant.  Birth was a lot easier than i thought.  I was worried about really bad tearing but only had one small superficial tear.. our doctor said that LS has no affects on fertility My LS was never severe but I got pregnant easily. I was worried about not being able to use my steroid cream during pregnancy and suffering through 9 mo of itching but it has not really flared at all during this pregnancy. Guess for me it is one of those conditions that resolves temporarily during pregnancy. I hope it causes some sort of reset in my body and it stays away for good but I am not going to hold my breath.

The issue is that I still cannot have PIV sex as it is painful at the entrance still :( I had to stop using the clobetasol steroid cream and switched to estrogen cream and tbh I have noticed a bit more itching. I still cannot have sex which I think is the biggest obstacle to getting pregnant, but I am not stressing about it right now since I do not have to think about that yet. Congrats and wishing you a safe and healthy pregnancy :-) I should have added I was experiencing a horrible flare up last summer until about November when what i had was finally properly diagnosed and I started steroid ointment. We did not start really trying until I was physically comfortable having sex back to back. I continued to use my steroid ointment about once a week to keep things at bay until I got a positive test. My OB actually told me I could still use it during pregnancy  and I had to use it maybe 2-3 times early in pregnancy because i felt a flare up coming, but otherwise I have been fine. Even though I was given the OK I did not feel very comfortable with the idea of using the steroid so I am glad my body has been behaving. That was so hard at first.. the Clobetasol helped soften that area and it became a lot better... i know surgery is out there but its such a personal difficult thing :( so sorry you suffer with this.. i was shocked my labia didnt look like text books.. and by then the damage was done.. Aww thank you. Yeah I relate very well to that last part. I remember growing up I always thought my vagina looked so different from those we saw in high school sex ed... but everyone would say that every vagina looks different so I assumed some people just did not have those labia minora \u201cflaps\u201d at all LOL it was not until last year that I realized mine was not normal. Luckily, it does not really affect other forms of sex for me too much. Stay strong!! You too sis!!! I hope you find a solution to piv sex.

I have been doing some research and I stumbled upon a doctor that might help officially treat the issue. The videos that I have watched were really convincing and really encouraging so I wanted to share with you guys what you think. \n\n\n( )\n\n(\n\n(", "Please share your experiences. I am curious what kinds of improvement people have seen from various LS treatments.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHave any of you been able to regain lost pigment or heal skin that was damaged in any other way from LS?\u00a0 Has anyone fully resolved all their LS symptoms with any treatments?  Please share your experiences, including things like what treatment was used, what level of improvement was achieved how long it took for positive effects to occur for various symptoms, etc..\u00a0\n\n\nThanks in\u00a0advance for your feedback! Oh boy. I have not found a cure. The heat and humidity are a killer and set off a LS flair up. I use a steroid ointment as needed. \nHowever, I just found a treatment called the Mona Lisa, a laser treatment used mainly for vaginal atrophy, but people find helps LS. I had my first treatment about 4 weeks ago and going for a second in 2 weeks. I think it is helping! My skin looks better and the itching is improved. Time will tell if this really makes improvements. Male. Tried a few things, but the only thing that really worked for me was the steroid cream.\n\nCanesten 2% (1 month) - did nothing\nVitamin E cream (2 weeks, mostly petroleum jelly) - did nothing\nHydrocortisone cream (1 week) - this was the only thing that actually made things worse for me\nCoconut oil (1 week) - very soothing, but did nothing\nBaking soda bath (twice) - these actually seemed kind of helpful, hard to quantify though\nClob - major improvement\n\nRegarding the Clob, 5 weeks in the thick plaque on the penis tip is gone, but some very slight discoloration remains. Sensitivity returned and it feels like the surrounding skin. The thick white band on the foreskin is only ever so slightly visible now. Tightness in the foreskin is pretty much gone. Looks about maybe 95% healed at this point.\n\nI applied the clob twice daily. Coating the pale areas but also the rest of the nearby foreskin, spending about 10 seconds applying. Applied once in the morning and once at night before bed. Additionally, I would reapply the clob immediately after working out and showering (every other day). I washed the area with water but never soap. I have used maybe a third of the tube up to this point. Wow, that is pretty good improvement you got with the clob. Thanks for sharing.  5 weeks sounds fairly fast also.  About how long did you have those symptoms you described?\n\nAnd I take it you have had no thinning of the skin or other side effects from clob use thus far? I have been doing stem cell/PRP injections and seeing really promising results. Feel free to PM me if anyone\u2019s interested I first noticed the pale skin around Jan 2021. It got progressively worse until July. It spread over time  covering most of the tip and maybe 50% of the way around the foreskin. In pretty rough shape for at least a few months.\n\nI have not noticed any side effects from the clob or thinning of healthy skin. I will probably start scaling down as soon as the coloring is normal again, hopefully in a few weeks.\n\nFYI I am fairly positive my LS is related to slight urine leakage after using the bathroom. I have had a dribbling issue for a number of years now. Any improvement with the dribbly leakage?? \nThe dribbling thing seems to be a common issue with this disease.  I have that symptom also, but it does not explain the itcyness all over my backside and other symptoms people get with LS that affects the anogenital or extragenital regions.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Promising results like resolving your symptoms and returning things to normal?\n\nThat stuff is pricey! No improvement to the dribbling. In my case the issue is quite a ways upstream and might be something like a uretheral stricture or prostate related. It weakens the urine flow and traps some urine that eventually leaks out after standing and moving around. I suspect men dont also get it around the butt just because the urine cannot easily make it is way there. Very pricy, but yes! Currently I have no signs of ever having had LS visually and physically I feel a million times better than before. I had my last treatment about a month ago so things are still a little swollen and irritated from that, but no more white spots and my skin feels so much healthier and looks so much more full. It takes about 1-3 months for the treatments to work, so it is not a quick fix but to me, it is been the best treatment I have found for this god awful disease Did you ever have a problem with extra liquid leaking out after using the restroom?  Is that fixed? I have not personally had that problem, but if you call the office of dr Nathan Newman in Beverly Hills, they can give you more info on what the procedure can help with. Have you seen a urologist for the issue? I was not aware of it being an LS symptom Went 3 years undiagnosed. Had painful sex, fissures, itch that was so bad that I would scratch until I bled, did not sleep at night because it kept me up, had slight ashy skin, it eventually spread to my anus, it always burned. After three years of my gyno calling me crazy I finally saw a dermatologist and was diagnosed. He prescribed me clob and told el me to use or twice a day for two weeks, then once a day for two weeks, then every other day for two weeks and after that i used it maybe once a month. It is been maybe 2 or 3 years now and I only get flare ups when I am stressed out. I look and feel normal down there. It is like I never had it. I think the dribbling thing sounds like it is more of a common issue for men with LS.  At least that is the impression I get from other patients on here.  Ive talked to some good doctors about my LS, but I was curious what the experiences of other patients were like.. Thanks for sharing your story!  Its great to hear that clob can actually achieve full remission in some patients.  ", "Did LS go away for you men after circumcision? If you are a male and had LS on the foreskin and some on the glands, did it go away after circumcision? Want to know what I will be expecting from someone that is been in the same boat. Hey I have not had a circumcision but I was told by my doctor that it does not get rid of the disease but it can alleviate problems for those who is foreskin is so affected that it is painful or if it effects their sex life.\n\nMy LS flares up as a ring around my foreskin  and some patchy light areas on the glans but demovate ointment clears it up almost completely after 2 weeks, it is pretty astonishing really how rapidly it transforms the appearance of my penis but at it is worst I just have some moderate tightening of the foreskin and shiny white patches but dermovate works wonderfully for me. Ah so the ointment is only a temp treatment for it? Does it come back frequently? I read one guy had it like mine to where it was on his foreskin and gland but after circumcision is cleared up. He is been good for 6 years. Debating if I should try to make an appt and get a prescription. So when it clears it up u do not have symptoms anymore? Why do not you use a maintenance regimen of steroid to make sure it does not flare quickly. \n\nMind me ask how long have you had it and how often it flares up? Yeah when it clears up I do not have any symptoms any more aside from a slight skin discolouration, but it is barely noticeable compared to when its fully flared up and it is really distinct white scar looking tissue. I am 30 and I was diagnosed at 20. How long it lasts before symptoms appear again seems to depend on how well I keep it clean, for example making sure no urine is left down there as that seems to trigger it, but it can last anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks before symptoms start to reappear, I find it really difficult to stick to any regime, it feels random at times like I cannot predict when it will flare up. But I try to nip it in the bud when I feel even the slightest bit of tightening around my foreskin. The guy I read that had it said his never came back since he was circumcised. I have had mine for about 7 months. It was more on the foreskin but have a but left on the gland. Hoping it goes away. Will probs call doc tmrw to see if i can get a steroid for it now though Well I was told to apply it thinly but I find that when I apply it to my foreskin, it goes on the glans automatically when my foreskin rolls forward so I just leave it at that as I worry applying it separately might be too much. Thank you - so you had some whitening on the glans and the ointment has restored some colour to it? Yes, exactly, I do also put Bio Oil on once a day too which claims to help scars and uneven skin tone, it could be that which is having the effect, I am not sure as I use both! Thanks bud really appreciate your replies", "Painful clitoris--is it from the clobetasol I apply to it or from the LS itself? Hi, I have been dealing with LS symptoms for about 3-4 months at this point. The only symptom I started out having is itchiness in the fold between my inner and outer labia. I started to apply clobe for a few weeks and the itchiness is subsiding slowly. However, my clitoris started to feel weird (not the whole thing--only the side) a few weeks into using the clobe in the aforementioned labia fold. I asked my DR and she said to use clobe on my clit if needed so I began to do so. Since then, the pain on my clit has worsened and is in my whole clit rather than the side. Do you think the pain is from the clobe or from the LS? It would be depend on how much your putting on and how often. Twice a day for the past several weeks Vulvodynia can go hand in hand with LS, I have both. Essentially I will randomly feel pain in my clit or labia, almost like nerve pain or a muscle ache. I have found that it is not consistent though, like it does not go on for days and days, usually a couple hours here and there. It is plain pain or is it rashy as well?", "Q about trimovate Wanted to ask a question about trimovate: I have been waiting for my GP to speak to a specialist about prescribing an estrogen cream, as although the mometasone has cleared up the patches of lichen I am still raw in places and could do with something to heal the skin. The specialist refused as I am deemed to be too young (I am in my 30s). She suggested trimovate instead, although since she knows I have recently been swabbed and had no yeast or bacteria issues I am not entirely sure this would help. Has anyone else used  it, and if so did you find it helped to heal things up? (I have also asked for a private referral from my GP as I am not entirely convinced that this specialist's suggestion of trimovate and a leaflet about vulva care was an adequate fix). Thanks!", "Bone Loss? I am waiting on confirmation for LS diagnosis. I have been reading forums voraciously and I am feeling really optimistic! Reading your accounts of how you are doing made me feel so much less terrified! \n\nI guess the thing that is still a big hanging question mark that even my doctor could not answer is how the clobetasol will affect my bone density. Has anyone here had any issues? Wait, does clobetasol affect bone density? I am not sure. It is a topical steroid cream, and I know that if used long term steroids can cause bone density loss. I do not think the topical ointment makes it into the bones - lots of layers of other stuff to get through! -but as women age that is a side effect of menopause (you did not say M or F so making an assumption here). Someone asked this about a month ago, and I read a bit about it. I posted my original answer below. The main takeaway is that people who use steroids over large surfaces of their bodies for many years do have higher rates of bone loss/osteoporosis. But treating genital LS is unlikely to ever reach high enough total doses to cause that. \n\n\n\n\"So I read this thinking \"no way topical steroids are bad for your bones\" but I went to do some reading. And yeah, I was wrong. However, we are talking about REALLY large doses over a long time, way beyond what you have been using. \n\nA recent study ( found that lifetime dosage of &gt;500g of mometasone was associated with increased risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture. This kind of dosage is seen in people with eczema or psoriasis over large areas of their bodies, who have been using the medication for years. \n\nYou have absolutely nothing to worry about using it only on your genitals for (in the grand scheme of things) an extremely short time. If it is helping your symptoms, keep using it. If you stay on steroids in the long term, your doctor will talk to you about how to manage your condition using the lowest effective dose. There may be other side effects of long-term steroid use that need to be considered, but it is unlikely that bone weakness will be one of them.\"", "Can anyone recommend an unscented emollient? I am going crazy trying to find a gentle simple one!!! As title says, I am going crazy trying to find one that is simple, unscented, and gentle. Its like pulling hair out, and no one ever says what they are using! Any recommendations would be great. I am in the US btw.\n\nEdit: Btw I am looking for a wash for my foreskin, I already use Vaseline on the affected spot now.  Vaseline. Sweet spot labs gets five stars from me. They have an unscented version. Thanks I should edit my post and clarify I was looking for a wash, totally my bad. I am already using Vaseline however on the affected patch in the morning and night just to create a barrier from urine :) Thank you!!! :) Bad bot. Oh, in that case I think cerave has a body wash that might fit the bill. Its the \"soothing\" one. I have not tried it myself yet though. I do not know what doctor's recommendations are for male LS but in female they do not recommend soaps or washes for female patients. Just water rinsing Cetaphil or cerave? Yeah even for males we are just reccomended water but I do not understand how we wash off stuff like old vaselin or cream with water... My doctor told me (F) to use Dove Simply Sensitive bar soap. It is worked well for me, non-irritating, cheap, and widely available. \n\n(PS looks like you have got it figured out, but just to be sure: the word \"emollient\" refers to ointments/creams/lotions, so you will not find what you are looking for with that term.) &gt; Dove Simply Sensitive bar soap\n\nThis is what I currently use and have for a few years now, but I am still uncomfortable using it because of the stigma of not using soap. And you are correct searching for emollient itself is a lost game I have learned, in that regards I wish people would maybe refer to a more lotion based term than just simply saying emollient when they are talking about these washes(obviously youre not going to \"wash\" with a thick greasy ointment). The Honey pot company!!! their sensitive wash is great and no added fragrances :)\n\nI follow up with their coconut vulvar cream after, if i am feeling dry. Also no added fragrances- the lavender in there is to soothe! QV wash works a treat for me - not sure about any additives / fragrances but it leaves me feeling clean and soft It is my understanding that part of the emollients are supposed to absorb and warm water will be sufficient to wash that off. Good luck, LS is hell!", "does it ever get better?? i am 18 (F) got diagnosed in October and man it is really been hell. I am now a month and 3 weeks into treatment (clob) and still have pain, is that normal? After walking sometimes the pain makes me stop in my spot. it sucks. i wish it would just get better already. My gyno said it is normal and to just be patient but it is so hard. It is stressing me out and i am scared that is making the symptoms even worse. I was wondering how long it took anyone to get into remission and if this is normal? Really need some support this disease is so hard to deal with especially at my age.", "Going to dermatologist Hi guys, so I think my gyno is not really knowledgeable about LS. So I figured maybe a dermatologist would know more about it, so tomorrow I am going to go to one.\n\nI am a little nervous to explain what is going on because dermatologists are not looking at vaginas all day long like the gyno lol\n\nCan anyone tell me about their experiences at a dermatologist when you first explained your LS symptoms? \n\nI know I just have to tell my dermatologist and be brave, I am having a lot of anxiety about explaining it lol They look a large amount of genitals because they do full body skin exams every day, so do not worry about that at all! \n\nWhen I made the appointment I made sure to ask if they treated LS. The dermatologist was amazingly helpful and extremely knowledgeable. Oh that is a good point! This is my first time going to the dermatologist in my life, so I am really not familiar with what they do. Thank you! I see a dermatologist too. In fact, it was my gyno that referred the one I go to, as she is very knowledgeable about LS. She took one look and knew it was LS so I did not have to do much explaining. Hopefully that will be the case for you too! Are u in remission? How far long between flairs? Kind of. I was using clobetasol 2x daily for about a year, but in the last half year I started to have thinning skin on my inner thighs. It took me a while to realize it was probably due to the clob, so I stopped. I was worried I would have flare ups, but it is been about 3 months since I stopped applying it daily, and I have only had a couple of minor flare-ups, where I would apply a tiny bit of clob and it went away. I just got diagnosed by my dermatologist earlier today. I saw multiple doctors since september and a gyno in february and none took me seriously and insisted it was yeast despite cultures coming back negative.\n\nI knew there was something going so I booked an apt with my dermatologist just to get another opinion.\n\nMy dermatologist was not fazed at all and diagnosed right away. Despite her being a pretty young doctor, she clearly knew way more about LS than the \u201cexperienced\u201d gyno I saw.\n\nI hope your experience is as positive! in my experience my dermatologist had no freaking idea what she was doing. she seemed super uncomfortable in that area, would not really touch any part and i wound up having to go in 5 (!!) times, 2 biopsies and she still did not have an answer for me. i mentioned that i suspected LS and her response was that she was doubtful because it is so rare (like ok but plenty of people still get/have it??). when i went to a gyno after, she took one look and mentioned LS before i even could ask about it. i had a bad experience with my derm for it but i have read plenty of comments that said they go to their derm for diagnosis and treatment so i really think it will just come down to the individual doctor unfortunately.", "Very new to this Hi all, I (18F) was diagnosed a few weeks ago and it is definitely been a major mental adjustment. My LS is very minor, but I also have clitorodynia (does anyone else here have clitorodynia as well?), vestibulodynia, and vaginismus, so let us just say that my lady parts are not a happy place. \n\nI started topical steroids twice daily about two weeks ago and things are definitely less itchy!\n\nMy doctor said that my clitoral hood is nearly unretractable, which I never realized. I have some superficial clitoral pain and just recently the skin sort of under/of my clitoral hood seemed to tear. Could that be from the topical steroids? Or is delicate vulvar skin a symptom of LS? I am no stranger to tears (tore a similar spot on my clitoral skin once before, and tore my peritoneum twice (waterfall jumping)), but I wonder if it could in any way be connected to LS. \n\nI already do not eat gluten or eggs or a a ton of corn or dairy or anything, and last year around this time I started wearing men's underwear (best decision EVER, so comfy and roomy). I do not wear pants with a tight crotch, and do not really shave. But is there anything else I can do? (Non diet related... I have a lot of food restrictions already, yay IBS! so that is not a thing I can change right now). \n\nAnyway, I am really glad to have found this community, and I would love to hear you all's tips!! I do not know that I can offer much advice right now because I am new to this too but I just wanted to say that I hear you. I too have additional issues with my vagina on top of this and IBS-D as well.\n\nI hope you can find some relief and get back to living a more normal life \u2764\ufe0f I bought a bamboo squatty potty and an inexpetbidet attachment, which has helped a lot with delicate cleaning. Tearing is a side effect of LS, so is hardening of the clitoral hood - the steroids should help this. Not much else known by me outside of clob creams. Will follow this thread with interest. Good luck! Thank you so much, it is so nice to know that I am not alone. It sucks to have multiple conditions (especially in one specific area..)! I hope things get better for you as well :) \u2764\ufe0f Oh, how interesting! Well, that would do it... and sorry, what are clob creams? \n\nThank you!! Things that have made the biggest difference for me: no lounging in hot baths (just showers with no very hot water down there), bought a fancy bidet for my primary bathroom, do not wear underwear to sleep, no soap down there (use Cetaphil instead), increase my clobetesol about 2 weeks before I get my period (my LS gets worse about 4 days before my period starts)\u2026 Hi. First of all, I am so sorry to hear you were recently diagnosed, and at such a young age. \n\nI was diagnosed 3 and a half years ago, but symptomatic for over 10 years. My main symptoms were pain with sex, tearing around the perineum and clitoral hood, but by the time I was finally diagnosed, I had a lot of architectural changes (clitoris fused to glans - mine also cannot retract btw) and I basically have no more Labia minora. I also was diagnosed with Vestibulodynia and vaginismus. It is honestly a lot to handle so feeling like it is a lot mentally is totally normal. It is a lot. I could go on for days about this, but I lll do my to be brief\n\n You can visit my website  to start for information. I have a blog, a YouTube channel plus some other exciting content coming out soon. I focus on sharing evidence based information (my  background is in science and research\n) and I also focus a lot on how mental health and sexual health intersect with LS. \n\nThe tearing is a common thing with LS and it actually occurs becuz the inflammation caused by LS changes the structure of our skin such that it thickens and hardens. Because of this, it loose flexibility and elasticity and thus is more prone to tearing. If you want to learn more about this, you can check out my YouTube channel (The Lost Labia Chronicles) or watch them on my website by going to lostlabia.com/watchnow . The tearing will slow down as the skin heals with consistent steroid use.\n\nAs for vaginismus and Vestibulodynia, I worked thru both in physical therapy and with dilators. I share a lot of this on my blog. \n\nMy biggest advice is to educate yourself on the disease, have a treatment plan you understand and feel comfortable with, and build a strong support system. There are Facebook groups in addition to reddit, our consider joining the virtual ls meetup at lssupport.net/connect. We meet every other Saturday from 2 to 4 or 7 to 9pm EST. If you can make it, it is a great way to meet others with LS and ask questions and advice.\n\nGeneral tips: steroids are great, but do not forget to moisturize (e.g  coconut oil, castor oil, olive oil, yes WB, cleo by damiva, Vmagic, etc. You can moisturize as much as you want, but avoid applying until after 30 minutes of using your steroids. Moisturizer helps protect the skin, soften it (imp since LS thickens and hardens it) and in combo with steroids can help prevent further fusing. Find comfortable underwear. If it stings when you pee, buy a peri bottle and use that instead of paper towel. \n\nFinally, know there is hope. My case was bad by the time I was diagnosed, and although it took some time, I am in full remission now and have been for over a year and a half. That means no more signs of active disease, and no symptoms at all for me whatsoever. No more anatomy changes and my skin returned to pink. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I can have pain-free sex!!! Clob is short for Clobestasol which is an ultra potent topical corticosteroid. It works by reducing the levels of inflammation in the basement layer of the vulvar skin. To date, it is the gold standard of treatment as its the only thing that has shown a significant reduction of inflammation on histopathological analysis. I have been wanting to look into bidet attachments. Are you willing to share what brand you got. Also with ya on #teamsquattypotty", "Itchy bum at night/ perianal involvement with LS Anyone else experience nocturnal pruritus ani? (or in simple terms: an itchy bum at night)\n\nApparently involvement of the perianal region is fairly common in patients with genital LS.  I wasnt aware that LS could also involve the perianum and cause things like nocturnal pruritus ani until I was pretty deep into reading about LS after my diagnosis.\n\nI actually started exeriencing the nocturnal pruritus ani long before I ever develoed the other symptoms of LS in my genital region and had always suspected it was due to an intestinal parasite - even though stool tests continually came back negative.  I had a protazoan parasite in my stomach about 13 years ago that gave my the same feeling, so that seemed like a good explaination when the symptoms returned.  My doctors never suggested anything else that could be causing the itch back there when I talked to them about it. \n\nAnyway I just thought I would share this info in case it is helpful for anybody else.  I would also be curious to know how many other people exerience any kinds of symtoms back there, and what they have done to treat it (if anything). I know talking about the private parts makes people shy, and people are usually more shy when it comes to talking about the back side.. Part of me wonders if perianal involvement is more common in LS patients than the statistics show, either because people are less likely to talk to their doctors about problems back there, or are just unaware that this disease can also affect that area..  \n\nAnybody brave enough to share their own experiences?  You can chime in even if its just to say you just have symtoms in the front (or elsewhere)and not the back. \n\nCheers! I have itch issues back there and pretty much only back there as well. My doctor confirmed that it is LS.\n\nI really think that a small amount of Vaseline helps with night time flare ups. I still have a tube of the steroid cream that she prescribed, but I only use that if it gets unbearable at night. \n\nI hope you can find relief. It is nice seeing your post and knowing I am not alone with this annoying issue! You are *not* alone. \u2764\ufe0f\nTalk to your doctor about alcometasone ointment. It helped me a lot!!! Also Boudreaux\u2019s Butt Paste \u2014 just in case you are chapped! :) Thanks for your input.\n\nI have said this other places in this forum already, but I personally feel better using organic unrefined coconut oil as a moisturizer over vaseline, since the latter is a petroleum product.  Putting petroleum jelly on your body just seems wierd to me when I think about it, and there is some evidence that it may not be a great idea..  I am not a total expert on how safe it may really be, but I just feel safer with coconut oil.  Coconut oil been great in my experience with LS. Good point. It felt like the lesser of two evils at the time compared to the steroid cream.\n\nUsing coconut oil instead would put my mind at ease for sure. Thanks for the tip! Will definitely make the switch. That is where mine is, do you ever get rectal bleeding/painful BM? Ya, I sometimes get tiny little cuts like paper cuts on my a-hole that make BMs painful and leave just a drop or two of blood on the tp when I wipe. Thanks for the reply and the tips.  I have been experimenting with non-prescription treatments so far, because my body has had too many bad reactions with prescriptions in the past, but if I do end up going the Rx route I will talk to my doctor about the alcometasone ointment.  That Is a steroid I had not heard of yet, so that is good info! \n\nAs far as the other butt paste you recommended, its got petroleum products which I am trying to avoid. Ive been using coconut oil as a moisturizer and it works nicely. Thanks for sharing your input! I also have ibs and after years of trying to find out what was going on with my itchy anus I had a colonoscopy technician remark that the irritation is probably caused by acid coming through the digestive tract and leaking out my bum. I need to try fodmap diet to identify my triggers and get the ibs under control.\n\nI have also noticed that it is itchier when really small pieces of faeces are sort of stuck in there when I am going through a bad constipation period.\n\nI know these things do not help with the micro tears but I can see how they would be exacerbating things. Anyone else have ibs? Well when I had that parasite 13 years ago my doc tried to tell me I had IBS after I told him my symptoms and everything.  I thought to myself- haha IBS, ya YOU can BS me all day but I think IBS is just a description of symtoms, and it doesnt really explain what is going on.. sure you could have said I had IBS but I was not satisfied with just that as a final diagnosis.\n\nYou could go to your doctor and say your anus itches at night and they could just say you have nocturnal pruritus ani.  Wow! They just translated your symptoms into medical lingo for you. That doesnt explain what may be causing those symptoms though.\n\nAnyway, I basically had to explain to that doc (again) why I wanted to get a stool test for parasites, and when he refused it I had to hold my ground and just not take no for an answer.  That test came back positive for protazoan parasites.\n\nI guess I still sometimes will go back and forth between diarrhea and constipation sorta like I did when I had a parasite(but much less severe), and the nocturnal pruritus is still there but the terrible crampy stomach pain I had with the parasite is luckily all gone, so I guess I would probably not describe my symptms as IBS. Ah yes one more joy of LS. It presents in a figure eight () pattern around the vulva so yes it will affect your perienum and beyond. My first flare involved so much inflammation and itching I felt as though, sorry, my ass had grown together. The skin in my proverbial butt crack is damaged with lichens. It does not bother me often. I occasionally get the itchy anus. \nI soak in a tub and use coconut oil for moisture to help it settle down and OTC Cortisone ointment for the itch. Many women use other OTC diaper rash for that area and their vulva. I do not believe Vaseline or any other moisturizer will stop the itch. \nDo not use any stronger steroid on it. I tried my prescription Clobetasol on it and burned the tissue. After 2 days of suffering I had to call my friendly nurse for help and was told Clobetasol is too strong. Good luck\ud83e\udd1e Same!! My doctor was concerned but I was like I think it is just skin tears too. Oh, well we cannot all be perfect. Yes the first manifestation of my LS was anal fissures. It spread to my vulva after a month or two which is how I started to piece together it was LS. Interestingly enough, I actually developed a sort of figure 8 pattern of depigmentation on my penis after I had dealt with the symptoms LS in the backside for years without knowing the cause. \n\nMy figure 8 pattern was composed of one circular band which went around my foreskin and another band that went around the head of my penis.  The two circular bands connected on the underside of my penis to form a figure 8.  Its not as clear of a figure 8 as one would draw on a flate plane, but the shape is there - just spread out on plane which is shaped like a penis instead of like a flat sheet of paper.  Little bit difficult to describe or visualize, but ya.. So sorry to hear this. Its been only 7 months since my initial diagnosis when I was in a huge flare up and had never heard of LS. After researching it is obvious that men and children suffer the worst from this cruel disease. I hope you have figured out how to manage it and treat yourself with love and care\u270c\ufe0f Dope username!  I think it can be equally bad for either gender if it pregresses far enough.  Both can experience skin fusing, atrophy etc..  Having your clit disappear and vagina close up sounds terrifying.  I am glad I got diagnosed as soon as I started to see skin shrinking and phimosis developing so I could stop that stuff in its tracks. Pigment loss seems like nothing at all compared to that stuff. Omg that butt paste is life! Me too! I get tears whe i go nr. 2 sometimes, its so horrible.", "REFERRAL!!!!! I finally got the referral from my gyno he sent it over today! Just have to wait for the referral to get processed!!!! And then an appointment!!! I am really happy and excited it is been 4 years without knowing what is going on with my vagina, constant oh it is a yeast infection every time. I am mostly excited for the constant itching, burning, tearing, and dryness to ease up! Biopsy here I come Yeah girl! So happy for you you! Make you bring a pad just In case, have some Advil and polysporin on hand! Best of luck! Thank you so much! i will! Ik it is a sucky situation but I am so happy! Congratulations. Be tough with your new doc. You have to drive this thing! I am gunna be pushy they are not gunna want me back lmao Your body, your responsibility. Get them! Congrats, I have been referred today as well. They did say Corona is going to slow things down. :-(", "Have any of the ladies here gotten Brazilian waxes? This is maybe a silly thing to be asking about, and in the scheme of things it is not that important. But I had been planning on surprising my boyfriend with a full wax, but then I started having symptoms and recently got diagnosed with LS, so my plan was put on hold. I assume a wax would only be advisable if you are completely in remission, which I am not currently. Just curious if any of the ladies here have had any experiences (positive or negative). Thanks in advance! I never have and I am not a doctor, but with LS, your skin can be thin and fragile, so I would not think a wax would be a good idea.  You should ask your doctor about it before you make a final decision. I have. It does not seem to aggravate things. I have never gone during a bad episode but that was more timing than avoidance. I recommend getting sugared as opposed to waxing. Yeah, the thinning is what I was worried about. I was just thinking that it might be doable in remission. I will definitely ask my doctor when I go back to see her. I am certainly not planning on a wax right now since I am not in remission and I am in the twice daily clobetasol phase of treatment. Good to know! I will definitely wait until I am more healed than I currently am. \nCan I ask why sugaring is better? Have you done it? I have seen ads for it, but I do not really see much difference. YES and I question if this is what has caused mine to start the fusing. Happened around the same time as waxing and tummy tuck surgery.... I have in the past, but no longer due. There are other hair removal products that are safer and less traumatic for the skin. However, if you do go waxing, it is best to wait until you are not in an active flare, ideally remission, and make sure you see professional waxer that applies an oil on the skin before waxing (protects the skin) and they should apy a soothing afterbalm afterward. Generally speaking, trimming, sugaring, and laser hair removal are all safer options - as always not when you are in an active flare. I got laser hair removal and now I do not really have to bother with it much. This advice is from OB-GYN Dr. Cyn Wesley. Wow, that definitely does not sound pleasant! Can I ask if you repeatedly waxed or was it a one time thing? Thanks for the advice! I do normally just trim, but I was looking for something more. I have had laser hair removal on my underarms, and it did not work for me. I am not planning on doing this on a regular basis, more of a special occasion thing. But I will definitely look into sugaring more, you are the second person to mention it! I do not fully understand how it works, but if it is just as thorough while being gentler, it sounds perfect :) For sure! Sugaring is less abrasive to the skin so it is a nice alternative to waxing. I actually got a wax 1 week before my wedding and I did have LS then but no diagnosis. I was OK then, but I was not in an active flare. I waxed for about 8 months. I will not be doing it anymore now that I know I have LS. It is not worth things getting worse. Im on triple creams (steroid, testosterone and estrogen) and I am not getting worse but I am not unfusing either. My pelvic specialist is going to try to manually separate the clitorial hood from the gland one day and might do it in his office or under anesthesia. After the biopsy he did on me, I do not even want to be touched by him again but I want to see my clit gland.\n\nBath regularly, do not sit around in sweaty tight clothes, use a bidet after pooping if your experiencing any issues near the anus. Use your clit! I had babies two summers in a row and I swear that and minimal sex is why my clit fused too. Use it or lose it. Try not to scratch. Use A&amp;D ointment every morning. I am definitely not a professional in this area.", "Biopsy said eczema 4 months ago but still have symptoms. Going back next week for f/u. My OBGYN mentioned lichensclerosus when I went in for some itching and discomfort. She noticed white patches and my \"vulva size\" was small. She thought maybe I am too young for LS but It seemed like she was convinced the biopsy would come back as LS. it ended up coming back as eczema and was prescribed a cream to help. The cream helps temporarily but I still have the same symptoms.\n\nAnyone have experienced of being diagnosed with something incorrectly before being diagnosed with LS? I am curious if there is a way to distinguish between LS and eczema. Did your doctor mention anything about eczema initially? Is not the treatment the same for both (i.e. steroid cream)? Well my regular dermatologist gave me a preliminary diagnosis of vitiligo, but she basically said she was in somewhat unfamiliar territory so she referred me to this dermatologist that specializes in pigment disorders because he had more experience with these things..  That guy diagnosed me with BXO/LS. \n\nI was diagnosed at age 29 and I had certain symptoms for at least three or more years before I got diagnosed.  There are lots of other young people in this group.  If you spend enough time here you will see that there is no such thing as being \"too young for LS\" despite how many male and female doctors tell that to women.  (I say \"women\" here because I have seen countless women say that their doctor told them this \"too young\" thing, but so far zero men..)\n\nGood lucking getting the help you need. Doing your own research can help a lot.  As I read more about LS I realized I had more of the symptoms than I originally was focused on and had discussed with the dermatologists..  Nocturnal pruritus ani is apparently associated with LS also since it can affect the anal region.  Anal involvement can also cause changes to bowel movements, anal fissures and all kinds of other things that are rarely mentioned when it comes to LS.  -all of these symtoms involving the backside were things I experienced and had suspected were due to some sneakey intestinal parasite that tests hasnt yet detected.. that is until I learned that they were more likely to be a result of my LS.\n\nSORRY for the long tangental rambling down the rabbit hole.  Best of luck to you!  Feel free to ask more questions! Same here. Biopsy said eczema but dermatologist is still convinced it is LS. She said treatment is the same for both so we shall see :/ I actually just posted something similar because I did not scroll back far enough to see your post! I was initially diagnosed with psoriasis but was later (a few days ago) diagnosed with LS. In my case. I believe it was because I was using clobetasol at the time of my first biopsy, which can change the pathology. I am still in a state of confusion to be honest\u2026. I ended up going back and my OB said that it looks like LS (it was middle of flare up) and gave me a stronger steroid. She seems confident.  So it is being treated as LS now! And I have had more relief. Thank goodness!", "21 y/o female Please help, I think I have LS Hi guys. \nI am really struggling with this I would love some\n\nI have been in a relationship for 3 years and sex was absolutely fine up until this June. We had to live apart for the lockdown this year from March-June, and when we reunited during foreplay I teared in my vaginal opening. I have never experienced anything like this, we were always quite active in the three years basically living together at university. But ever since I teared in June when reunited Ive teared every time we have had sex. We have only had sex once every month and every time has been really painful, I think now even before I tear it is hard to get him in bc I am so worried and I tighten up. I have no problem with being turned on, I am always wet and we have tried lube every single time, a lot of it. We have left my tear to heal. I have even been prescribed betnovate cream to put on during healing periods by my doctor but it is done nothing. \n\nI have had a phone consultation with a gyno but the system here is so poor in the UK, it is so slow and they never get back to you. It is having a massive impact on my mood and I cannot help but think about it a lot. \n\nPlease let me know if anyone else went thru this, I need advice on what to do/what this is. I think it is LS but I am not sure. \n\nThanks Do you have any itching or pain? Any areas that are like a white plaque? Does the itching come and go within a few days? With LS you get intense itching, burning, white patches of dry skin, sex is painful but not bc of the penis tearing it, you get fissures, flare ups, etc. it is more than just tearing during sex. I do not think this sounds like LS. The symptoms of LS are pretty clear. The visible Symptoms can vary as I know I was diagnosed early so visibly there is not much to note. I feel burning and itching from time to time (I am on clobetasol). When I got myself on clobetasol, I started using coconut oil in between doses, drinking celery juice and apple cider vinegar in the mornings, and other general healthy things to make myself feel better. It really is about the healthy decisions you make for yourself. Coconut oil can relieve pain, itching, and burning you experience daily. And before anyone else says anything, USE DILATORS... the pink magnetic ones are amazing and keep you open for sex. If you have LS, it is not a death sentence I promise. Just a little annoying. It really is about makin yourself as healthy as possible. It is not a death sentence. Life does go on and you will have amazing sex soon. I promise.z Thank you for the replies everyone. \n\nI have noticed itching now in the vaginal opening on the last two times I met up with my partner and we had some foreplay. There was no sex but when I came home I noticed really uncomfortable itching which started to hurt. I also tear at the top of my vagina in the hood sometimes. This can be either from my partner being too rough With his hands by accident or from when I am on my period and I wear pads. When I tear from sex I noticed that the tears on my Perinium/vaginal opening turn white After they heal. Thank you this was rlly helpful. I am looking into dilators  and found these  \n\nThey have been recommended a lot online for those who have painful sex due to tearing/Ls/muscle tightness Hii, I had the same exact symptons as you do and I was diagnosed with LS through a biopsy 2 months ago. I would recomend for you to stop trying to have sex because I did not and my condition got worse (I even developed vaginismus). I know most people are telling you that does not sound like LS because there is no itchiness but for me that only started after some time. \n\nI think you should go to a doctor and check that out because I had a mild case that got worse because most people (even doctors) did not think I had LS since visually I was \"normal\". \n\nGood luck! \n\nPS: sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language Thank you so much. I am waiting for the gyno to get back to me as they said they would call back with an appt in person and potentially a biopsy. Did the biopsy hurt? I am kind of afraid I have heard bad things. Have you felt a difference recently or is it still quite bad?\n\nI am thinking of contacting a private gyno because the NHS takes so long. It is a lot of money but I do not want to wait and it gets worse as I have seen you can be at risk of Vulvar cancer. \n\nAlso I think I have vaginismus now bc whenever I have tried to have sex recently it is hurt but it was a different pain to the tear, as if my muscles were tightening even though I was turned on. I bought vagisil wipes today to help with itchiness hopefully they help. New here, I have not yet received a diagnosis, but like OP I am pretty sure I have LS. Are there any consequences/side effects of using steroid cream long term? I had zero plaques until I actually started treatment for LS. I either hadnt noticed them  or the area was to inflamed for them to actually build up. \n\nUntil you see your gyno, which is a great idea, I would start using the basics of LS care to try and find some comfort. Trash scents, perfumes, soaps, super hot water etc and start a moisturizing regime. I have had an issue with with hood tearing as well but found the biggest benefit was just changing the underwear I was wearing. Switched to looser underwear that did not put any pressure on that area and it is generally doing fine now. I hope some of that helps in the short term! \n\nI do not know if you are doing it already, but it may be helpful to journal your symptoms for your gyno. Use a mirror twice a day to take a little look around and document a couple weeks of observations. It can help you understand the patterns as well. That was really helpful thank you. Do you recommend any brands for underwear/ soaps? \nHow did you find your LS treatment, has it taken a while to get back to some normality and did you need a biopsy? I use sweet spot labs unscented wash exclusively. It is not a soap, it is an emollient. I have Psoriasis in other places on my body, which is also sensitive to soap so I use the sweet spot everywhere. \n\nI have not had a biopsy, but diagnosed through an exam by a dermatologist. I went about two years before getting a proper diagnosis, partly because my Psoriasis made drs think that is what I had downstairs, party cause I was embarrassed to talk about it with the dr and part cause my GP was not familiar with the disease. \n\nI have been treating since Feb this year and definitely found some immediate relief. With that being said it is not under control yet and I still have some bad flakes which are upsetting. But I have also been really uncomfortable for years, so the improvement I have right now are welcome!! In general, my LS is just a part of my life, but is not some huge black cloud that bothers me daily. Just new routines and changes to habits. \n\nI do not have a specific brand of underwear that I buy. Typically looser full back and gentle fabrics like cotton or modal. I fully avoid thongs and buy a size bigger than I used to just to make sure they will not put pressure on my skin. Same with pants. At least for pants I know I am going to be wearing all day. Loose wear it matters. I still have my skinny jeans and tights and nylons, but I reserve wearing them for when my skin is clear and for short amounts of time like out for dinner. Great thank you. Did you find that it is easier to have sex now? That is one of my worries that it will be a long time til I can even try again I am 64 yrs old,, post menopausal. I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago with a positive biopsy. I used a cup or urinal to avoid burning the biopsy site.\n\nMy symptoms were smooth white spots on the perineum area. Smaller spots seemed to join together.  I had slight itching that I attributed to panties made in China. \n\nI still pee in a cup and it helps a lot! I am treating with Clobetasol and Estradiol (1 week)  My color is returning and I plan to start weaning down from the Clobetasol and start on coconut and lavender oil.\n\nI will post my progress. I forgot to add, I wear dresses and a half slip and NO PANTIES. I think it is helping the spots heal. My biopsy hurt like hell, but if you check out my history you will see why, I have a very high tolerance to anesthetics so I have unfortunately felt the procedure. What I have seen as common in LS groups is that the anesthesia hurts a lot (it really did) but most people do not feel nothing at all after it. \n\nAnd I am doing better now, I am on clob for a couple weeks now and it seems to be the solution for me. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb If you go to a private doctor, be sure to ask her f that doctor has any specific experience with treating LS. I would hate for you to pay a lot and then get someone who cannot help Yes definitely thank you. Ahh ok thanks what is clob? I have been seeing it everywhere but Ns what it is lol It is clobetasol, an ointment that helps with LS. My bad, I am so used to calling it clob I forget not everyone knows what I am talking about\ud83d\ude02 It can be asymptomatic in some people (no itching etc.) I think it could still lead to structural changes or loss of elasticity that could manifest as fissures and tearing. It does not sound like a ton of evidence for LS, but I think LS could explain OP's symptoms and could very easily have gone undetected otherwise. You might want to use period underwear in lieu of pads. They are much less chafing in my experience. Or even if you could find softer pads (the ones I used to use were like sandpaper) I wonder this a lot myself so I am constantly looking for natural ways to handle it. It is a steroid so it is supposed to thin the skin but doctors are split on how it affects the vulva mucous membrane. I think the safest bet is handling your flares with the clobetasol ointment and then finding healthy maintenance strategies in between possible flares or to keep flares at bay (while still using the ointment at least every 3 weeks to make sure the texture and structure of the vulva stay the same or possible repair). If your doctor offers it, I got AMAZING results from the Mona Lisa touch laser treatments. I do not feel the need to use my ointment for weeks and only feel symptoms every now and then... but my life almost feels totally normal again. I would also recommend coconut oil as a daily moisturizer but be careful with how it leaked through and even stains clothes sometimes. I also recommend magnetic dilators like from vulvatech (I think it is the name) and use them REGULARLY... not just right before sex. It really helps keep your vagina from narrowing and helps make sex not just possible but feel amazing. Also consider diet changes and watch how it affects your symptoms. I would also recommend a hormonal free birth control... I am on the copper IUD now but getting off hormonal birth control eliminated almost 80% of my constant pain. \n\nI know that was a lot of digest and lichen is a lot to manage, but once you get over that hurdle and know what makes you feel the best, it is all worth it and life becomes amazing again! Doing all of that and trying new things to make myself more comfortable probably took me about 6 months to getting to a solidly good place where I would have flares weeks apart compared to having horrible symptoms every day. I hope this helps!!!\n\nAnd remember... life does go on. This is not a death sentence. And you WILL get better. If you need anything you have an amazing support group in this app. We have experienced and heard it all. Thank you, that was very helpful. The past few days I have been using Bag Balm on my skin 1-2 times a day to help with the dryness, and it is made a huge difference so far! I have an appointment with a dermatologist in 3 weeks so I am glad I have found something to manage until then. \n\nUnfortunately I need to be on hormonal birth control. I had period cramps that were so painful that my body went into shock and I had a seizure and had to go to the hospital. I have been considering a tubal ligation and endometrial ablation so that I can quit all the hormones. The only problem is finding a doctor that will do it haha", "Rapid onset of Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans (BXO) in 28 year old male over 1 month affecting foreskin and glans penis  Is that you OP? This has be the best documented photos of the onset of Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans (BXO) I have been able to find. Is this you? Is that last photo currently? I would like to see if they have a version of this with BXO improving with Steroid cream. This is exactly why we need to have a guys board as a majority of the photos are of women. Yep, that is me from 10 years ago when I was 28. Yes this is me, this was 10 years ago now and I got circumcised 4 weeks later to remove the diseased tissue in the foreskin.\n\nI also agree with needing a different subreddit specifically for guys and BXO, because as soon as I posted this picture, it was downvoted. Agree with needing a male board. Would join. How has your LS evolved since? Was circumcision useful? Have you been able to revert skin whiteness or scarring? Since the circ, the whiteness on the glans and remaining frenulum has pretty much disappeared, there only remains a very faint discolouration on the glans that is hardly noticeable.\n\nI am no longer in pain from trying to retract the foreskin now, and the risk of it spreading into my urethra has greatly reduced. It also fixed my short frenulum that use to tear during penetrative sex as well.\n\nSo all in all, the circ was the best thing to happen and would not hesitate to do it again. I have had it for about 2 years, also started at 28 coincidentally. It is a lot slower than yours though and I am very reluctant to go for a circumcision. Does anyone know what actually causes it? Especially at this age. Is it just one of those annoying things where your body decides to attack you for no reason? From the British Association of Dermatologists regarding male penile lichen sclerosus:\n\nWhat causes lichen sclerosus is not fully understood. It almost never occurs in men who have been circumcised early in life. \r\n\nLichen sclerosus is not caused by an infection and, although the genital area \ris affected, cannot be passed to a sexual partner. \r\n\nLichen sclerosus may affect some men with auto-immune diseases such as thyroid disease or diabetes, although this link is more common in women. It may also be linked to atopic conditions such as eczema, asthma and hayfever.\r\n\nFriction or damage to the skin can bring out lichen sclerosus and make it worse. This is called a \u2018Koebner response\u2019 and is sometimes seen after surgery. Some men dribble a small amount of urine after passing water, and it is thought that the trapping of urine under the foreskin may cause male genital \r\nlichen sclerosus.\r\n\nThere is a link in some men between lichen sclerosus and penis cancer, but it is rare. Although circumcision may reduce the risk, it does not absolutely prevent penis cancer. r/BalanitisXerotica Thanks for the heads up - how do I join? I have had great success with silverBoitics healing cream.  Found thru Amazon To mind, this makes the case for routine infant circumcision Oop it was set to private it is now open Hey I am 25, I have BXO and will have to schedule a circumcision soon. How was your experience after the circumcision and what was your experience with treating BXO that was on your glan. Looking at your mine is about the same severity. I am constantly stress about getting circumcised and I keep putting it off. Hey, my remaining BXO on the glans and frenulum just cleared up on its own after a few weeks. After the circ and the area drying out, it just slowly faded back to a relatively normal skin colour with only some very slight discolouration that is extremely hard to notice now.\n\nHope you have been able to see a doctor and try using some steroid creams to slow it down whilst you decided whether getting circumcised is for you.\n\nAfter my experience, I am 100% happy that I made the choice  to get circumcised to clear the BXO and stop being in pain from the constant skin cracking. ", "Regarding loss/regaining sensitivity with BXO &amp; circumscision Hi guys, \n\nI have had BXO for nearly 3 years now, I noticed a loss of sensitivity around a year in which I believe has been getting worse recently, my orgasm is weak compared to what it once was.\n\nTo anyone who has cured them self of BXO with a circumscision or other methods, did your sensititivty recover once the BXO shifted? \n\nI nearly bit and went for the circumscision recently but decided against it, for now I am going to keep my foreskin pulled back literally all day every day, I have been doing this so far for a week and it does look better already, also I am completely avoiding any moisture such as creams lubes etc and keeping it dry 24/7.\n\nHas anyone cured their BXO by doing this and avoiding the circumscision? \n\nAnd also to anyone who has been cured by a circumscision, how long did it take for your BXO to clear after the procedure?\n\nAfter years of testing triggers such as foods etc I really do believe this is simply down to moisture being trapped under the foreskin now, not all these food triggers/ auto immune stuff you read online \n\nAny help or information would be deeply appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers Hi, autocircumcision, keeping the foreskin back, is useful in terms of minimising exposure to trapped urine, although I note that you doubt that being the cause of LS. Just make sure that you release the foreskin from time to time and move it around. \n\nI have serious doubts about your decision to not use moisturisers or creams - does this include steroid creams?  Have you discussed this with your dermatologist? Just be mindful of the X in BXO - xerotica relates to dryness of the skin. \n\nI am currently in full remission from LS. I used dermovate and follow a regime of washing and drying after urinating. I replaced soap - which is drying - with an emollient wash and also use a neutral moisturiser, epaderm, inside and out. \n\nI wish you all the best. Circumcision may be sometimes be necessary but it is something I am working hard to avoid. Hello mate, thank you for taking the time to reply\n\nSorry about the miss communication, I do believe the urine being trapped is the main cause of LS but I believe moisture being trapped under the foreskin allows the warm moist conditions needed for the LS to thrive. In my experience when ever I use for example coconut oil it will appear more inflamed on my glans, I am not sure if this is due to a reaction to certain things with in the coconut oil I use but in the past 2 weeks just by keeping the foreskin pulled back through out the day and by not applying any oils/creams (other than Daktakort on occasion actualy) it does look a lot better, but I do understand you are right in that certain creams/moisturizers will be beneficial.\n\nGood to hear you are in remission! I am curious how long did it take you to put it in to remission and what was your daily routine with the Daktakort? I have been applying it sparingly when it flares up, would you apply it every day? And also did you keep your foreskin pulled back too?\n\nThanks for the information mate, good to hear you are on the mend!  Hey mate, would love to hear anymore information you have! Hey man, I got cut almost a year ago and LS seems to be gone, I quit soap and just gently wash with water, then moisturize with Cicaplast Baume B5 after the shower. I find the tip gets irritated if I do not moisturize, by the friction with underwear fabric.

This is in my groin area Super hard to say about LS, my doc diagnosed me using a microscope, but I had eczema and LS at the same time causing tons of skin irritation and itching, and scarring. So maybe look into eczema also, which you could try a 1% cortisone to see if that helps at all. Either way think about your detergents, body wash or soap, etc.  Hopefully you can see a doc soon!

I just got my diagnosis today and am just relieved to know what is wrong with me. I am a 33 year old female, single and just trying to navigate what to do next. I have been given Dermovate steroid cream to use, however I would like to know what natural remedies people have had success with. I have been keto/carnivore/ketovore for almost 4 years and loving it, it is really helped my eczema, shame it could not help with this. Has anyone tried emu oil, evening primrose oil, vitamin d3 cream, cbd oil/cream, supplements, purslane etc.? I was diagnosed wtih LS last fall and, being a bit of an ethnopharmacology nerd, I decided to take advantage of the unique opportunity to experiment on myself with some natural remedies before using the topical steroids that my doctor wanted me to use.\u00a0 I made a simple salve using a powerful medicinal plant called P. harmala which was able to completely reverse the entire mess of aweful LS symptoms I had.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nQuick warning:\u00a0 P.harmala can act as an MAOI, so dont just start messing around with it if you dont know what you are doing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy pigment came back to my skin, phimosis reversed, plaque-like growths on skin healed,\u00a0 itching went away, urine stream became straight again and painful urination stopped, sex stopped hurting, genital skin stopped being prone to tears, etc etc..\u00a0 Everything is all back to normal there now, and it was pretty messed up before.\u00a0 \u00a0I used my topical treatment for 8-10 months and then I decided to switch to a few days of oral treatment with the same plant.\u00a0 I made tea with about 4-6g of harmala seeds every morning for a few days in a row, and that seems to have finished off the last systemic bit of the disease which my topical treatment had not quite finished off yet.\u00a0 I have been completely symptom free and using no treatments at all for a couple of months now :)\u00a0 and I never had to touch the steroids.  \n\n\nLet me know if you would like to know more, I would love to share.\u00a0 The treatment is super cheap and pretty simple - as long as you are not on a bunch of prescription drugs and stuff that could interact with MAOIs.\u00a0 You sound like you are already on the natural path with the carnivore dieting and stuff though! That Is what is up.\u00a0 I would like to know more! I have tried a dozen things and for me it is been mostly about symptom relief. I do not think anything is proven to actually stop the disease process other than steroids (some evidence that other immunosuppressants might help as well).\n\nConcerning symptom relief though:\nI make a \"body butter\" that is mostly olive oil, a bit of cocoa butter, hempseed oil, seabuckthorn oil, vitamin e, and zinc oxide (all food grade since I use it internally as well). Zinc oxide is also in most diaper rash creams and has solid anti-inflammatory effects. Olive oil (specifically \"early harvest\" and high polyphenol varieties) also has been proven to have good anti-inflammatory properties and I personally think beats every other oil in moisturizing properties (I know people love coconut oil but it just is not as good impo).\n\nAquaphor makes a great ointment for sealing up the broken skin and reducing the stinging from urine and acidic discharge. It is not exactly \"natural\" but it is a home remedy.\n\nI have also tried ozonated oils which definitely helped me *feel* less swollen... but I personally could not tell you if that is because of the oils themselves or because I bought suppositories and kept them in the freezer (and use them frozen... I know that sounds intense but they melt VERY quickly and start to do so once they are taken out of the freezer). They basically produce hydrogen peroxide (which the vagina does as well via lactobacilli) and have really strong anti-microbial effects that might be really useful at preventing yeast or bacterial infections from steroid use. They are also anti-inflammatory but it is suggested that the middle-line ozonation is best (usually this means ozonated olive oil, coconut is very low and hemp is very high)... but they are expensive and best to get directly from a reputable company as the extra oxygen in them can degrade in heat (so if they are not handled well, they might be useless). Either way, oxygen is great for wound healing and I did feel a difference in pain levels after I started using them... and the side-effect profile of something like ozonated olive oil is basically non-existent.\n\nWith that, I would 100% suggest keeping any ointments or creams in the fridge! Seriously! The cold is very soothing! You can also try ice packs on the area (I am absolutely guilty of watching TV with an ice pack between my legs) and it is really nice when everything's really inflamed, helps a lot after applying any topical medications that burn too. Like what? Where can I purchase this? Where do you purchase the seeds? It seems to be regulated in some areas. Its pretty easy to find.  You can get it online or from your local  middle eastern/ethnic grocery store. Never thought about the ice pack!!! Clever. Thank you for the information. keeping creams/ointments in the fridge is a good tip! thanks! R u in Australia? That Is the only place i know of that regulates them  Would like to hear more about this. Like what?", "Questions I have recently been diagnosed with LS vulval and oral (during a flare up both places at the same time) I have a few questions, just curious to see if anyone else has the same symptoms:\n\n1. My flare ups seem to be very regularly 4-5 weeks apart and line up either just before of with the arrival or my period. Do any other women experience this? \n2. Before the patches open up and become rough/painful, I experience quite significant inflammation and swelling in my lips, vulva and inside my nasal passages. After a few days of swelling, the LS patches inside my mouth and on my vulva raise up and become red and sore. My vulva becomes so swollen it almost blocks the entry to my vagina! Does anyone else have swelling at the start of a flare up? My flare ups are always in the second part of my cycle and they become worse as my period is closer, but once I get my period it gets better. This being said - my vulva is always itchy and more sensitive before my period, but I do not have flare ups each and every month. Thanks for your reply. My doctor seems to think the flare ups could be triggered by hormones. I also get flare-ups around my period. I was using pads and tampons but even the natural ones really irritated me. The cotton was drying up all of my moisture. Now I use a menstrual cup which helps a ton, although other folks who menstruate have said cloth pads have been a big help when their vagina is too swollen. Thinking that might be my next step. Still get flare-ups but whatever helps, right? Yes definitely, you could also try the period undies like Modi Bodi?", "/r/lichensclerosus hit 1k subscribers yesterday ", "Is this HPV, some harmless skin thing happening, or is this some kind of skin cancer? When I run my finger across this spot, it feels like a hardened bump or like it is raised.  Tried to reach you about this one. I think it is just chafe. I had this happen like two months ago and it is slowly shrinking. Did yours ever go away?", "LS Itching - Yeast or LS? Hi everyone,\nI have been creeping this sight for a while and am in dire need of advice as this has been months long:\n-In October (5 months ago), I developed a slight itch and some minor redness/swelling on my vulva. And by slight, I mean maybe once or three times a day with only the smallest sensation of itch or tingle. Visited my gyno who thought it was dermatitis as my BV and yeast test came back negative. Treated it, but the small itch stayed.\n-Went for follow-up, she noticed a small freckle on my clitoris. Removed/biopsied in November. Biopsy came back benign, but had yeast. Began Difulcan, but small itch stayed.\n-December, symptoms went away and I believe my \"yeast\" infection was cleared.\n-January, itch came back more severely one morning, but then returned to the normal, barely there, not every day itch. Had some small discharge amounts of white, but not cottage cheese like. Gyno diagnosed yeast again.\n-February, still treating for yeast. Tiny itches, sometimes redness.\n-March, asked about a biopsy for LS, but she seems confident my skin down there looks fine.\nI have tried Fluconozole, Terconazole, Monistat, Clotrimazole cream, and Clob (when we thought it was dermatitis). Nothing works. I have not noticed white patches, nor tearing. And the yeast has not tested positive in my vagina, just on the labia. My perineum looks slightly shiny, but I have not noticed changing and my gyno insists I do not need a biopsy yet.\nLong story short, can you describe your LS itching? Was it slight and inconstant, or constant and major? Should I push for a biopsy? I cannot stand to spend another weekend alone and crying, please help! Push for a biopsy. Either way treatment is Clobetasol which you might need to apply daily for a week or two to stop the itch. \nI find my skin flares and the need to scratch can be intense but it goes up and down. Everyone is a little different. But I had not too bad but fairly consistent itching all the time for over a year. I had some similar issues, looking for yeast and not finding it, until a gyn finally figured it out. But it was slight enough that I could get distracted and ignore it for a while. But if my mind was not otherwise occupied...I would just sit and scratch and make it worse. \n\nSo yeah, I am not really sure what the harm in doing the biopsy would be? I would think after trying all those yeast treatments your dr would maybe concede to the need for trying something else?", "HELP!! Thinning skin tearing Can clobetasol 0,5% be applied on the perianal skin??? The skin there is VERY thin and I think it also developed some kind of ulcer or tearing on the inside/outside , does not hurt but it needs to go back to normal asap. I cannot live like this. GP only said to apply on the genital area and prescribed me a cream for dry skin for the anus but of course it is not helping. Please any advice of people who managed to\"cure\" it and had it go back to normal with clobetasol if not which one??? I personally apply Clobetasol all over the genital area and anus. I am having a flare up right now and my perineum is torn and sore just now too so yes absolutely you can apply it there!! Quite odd the dr said not to put it on ur bum because my gyno told me I absolutely had to cover everything with Clobetasol from the front to the top of my bum crack haha Thank you so much!! I think my doctor knows little about this, I will apply it and wait 2 weeks for an improvement if not I will have to pay for a dermatologist. Hope it goes well for both of us I was told to use clobetasol on the perineum, I just also massage it with hydromol or v magic at other times to try and keep things a bit more supple. I have the same issue and my obgyn says to use clobetasol there, and to use a moisturizer in the area (aquafor, etc) every day. It has not made it go back to normal but it has made the discomfort go away. It is been a few years now so I just accept it as it is", "Glans skin look like your finger when its been under water for too long Does anyone else have this? Its like my glans scrunch up together.\n\nTheyre meant to be smooth right? Well from what i can remember  Yes. It is happened. \nI do not now if it is related to ls or something that might occur because of other circumstances.\nMore importantly I did not want to leave you hanging with no comments Does it always look like that? Or is it only when it flares? Or only when cold? Yes. Mainly if I do not use epaderm ointment (an emollient) after a day or two.", "Do you all use clobetasol even after a tear/laceration? I tore really bad today, and I have been wondering, do you guys use clobetasol even when you have got an open tear? Or do you wait for it to heal? I have waited in the past but I am honestly not sure, my gyno said that it can slow the healing process. In addition, do you guys have any tips to help tears heal faster? I was in a fuckin puddle of blood earlier. Hurts. I would keep taking it to prevent another outbreak. And I find Zinc Ointment really helpful for the healing process", "Any other female to male trans men, or understanding cis women I can talk to, so fucking alone I cannot take this much longer. Looking back,  Ive had LS all my life. I started my transition about 6 years ago and went about a year before my first bad flare up. I would already grown a beard and had top surgery and I thought I was free. Now I can only take half the dosage of testosterone that other trans men take. I have lived years with this diagnosis, I often think I am the only trans man with lichen sclerosis. I feel like I am cursed I just want to talk about my pain but to talk about my pain I always have to disclose that I am trans. I have never had a full conversation about it with anyone, even my closest friends, even trans friends. At the end of my rope. Hi! I am a cis woman with LS and happy to lend an ear. I am sorry you are struggling. Pm me or through this thread, whichever you are more comfortable with. Be well! I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling. I am cis female and for what it is worth I am willing to chat with you. \n\nWe can talk about it privately if you prefer, but I am unfamiliar with the process. Is LS why you can only take half a dose? im also a trans man with LS, and it makes my dysphoria fucking rampant. im sorry youre going through this. Hi, I am so sorry you are dealing with this too, I am surprised there is someone else. And I understand, It is such a weird kind of dysphoria like you cannot just \u201cnot think about it\u201d or ignore the area. Hi, I appreciate the reply, I feel a bit Less overwhelmed then earlier but Thankyou. And yeah, from what i understand the testosterone causes low estrogen levels which makes you have early menopause,  and LS symptoms are sometimes more intense when you have low estrogen (pre puberty/post menopause) so to keep my flare ups under control, I have to let there be a good amount of estrogen in my system. exactly! it just sucks when you want to not have a vagina and then you get a condition that makes it impossible to ignore. i hope you can get treatment for this and feel better! Yes! At first I would thought about bottom surgery to just \u201ctake that whole area out \u201d but my doctor was concerned that the fusion could effect the healing process of the lengthened urinary tract,  Thankyou! I do too, I hope yours is or can eventually be better, if you ever feel like messaging more, feel free to PM, It is just crazy to meet another guy in this exact situation. &gt;\u201ctake that whole area out \u201d\n\n\n\nThat is been my reaction, too.  Unfortunately, there is indication that that does not help because it tends to come back post surgery.  It really just sucks. If you are feeling like the LS makes you less of a man because only women get it widespread, you should know that even men can get it widespread, it is just more rare.  \n\n\n\nI am curious, though, if you do not mind, why can you only take half the testosterone?  Topical testosterone used to be the first choice treatment for LS and remains an accepted alternative for those who cannot use the topical corticosteroids.  If the reason you cannot take the full testosterone has to do with the application of corticosteroid treatment for the LS, perhaps you can switch to the topical testosterone instead. Thankyou, I realize that it is not only a female issue, the main problem is the fact that it draws attention to that area at all. If I were a cisgender man with LS I would be fine, and Unfortunately the testosterone dosage is only an issue because testosterone induces early menopause, (very little estrogen in the blood stream) and most people with LS see their worst symptoms during menopause. Hope I could answer your questions Ah, sorry, I am not familiar enough with the testosterone to realize it induces early menopause.  Thank you for the information and sorry you have to go through this. Ah, that is true, that is something I have heard is a concern. Well I am sorry you have to go through this, it is really a frustrating thing to have. I hope things get better for you, and I hope this community can be supportive for you. So sorry your dealing with this. LS fucking sucks. I have been dealing with it for about 10 years now.(Cis Woman). May I ask what treatment they have you on? I was not responsive to most of the typical treatments but was able to find some relief with dapsone oral Trans girl here who might have LS, this shit is dysphoric misery incarnate.", "Anyone had a bad reaction to protopic? (Tacrolimus) I think I may have had one M(22) So I used steroid cream last year (Betamethasone 0.05) for some LS like symptoms but ultimately left it alone as it seemed to be healing mostly on its own. Then this year I decided to try Tacrolimus for roughly 5 days to see if there was any good effect. A week after I noticed some redness but it went away fast. Now three weeks after using the ointment I had sexual intercourse and the skin became so red and irritated that it even bled slightly around the rim of the penis where I had applied the protopic. I was so hopeful this cream would help me like it helped others but it seemed to make things worse! Has anyone els had a bad reaction? Or could this be something different as I used the ointment 3 weeks ago?", "Zero relief It started after my first childbirth. My doctor said he could not see anything despite pointing to the one specific spot that constantly itched. I tried a few times for him to take me seriously and eventually gave up and accepted I am just always going to itch.\n\nFor my third pregnancy I had a new OB and mentioned it to him. He confidently said he could help me. What???!!!! Really????? He BELIEVED ME??????????\n\nHe prescribed clobetasol. It did not work. Tried betaderm also did not work. Diaper cream, Vaseline, lidocaine...tried it. He explained I was probably in a scratch itch cycle and I needed to break it. Suggested benadryl at night to sleep through without scratching. Lidocaine to numb to prevent being tempted during the day.\n\nAlso tried antibiotics for whatever reason.\n\nThe thing is...nothing gives me any relief for even a minute. It is not like I can put on a cream and I am fine until I reapply, I am perpetually itchy.\n\nHe referred me to a vulva specialist and she was completely useless.\n\nNow I have been referred to a dermatologist so I have to wait for that but for now I am just CONSTANTLY ITCHY with zero moments of rest.\n\n Losing my mind I am in the same boat. Constantly itching or in pain due to broken torn skin. No relief and I loath when people give me advice or say they can help because nothing does. And I, like you, have tried EVERYTHING!! I have not gotten an uninterrupted night of sleep for at least 7 years. I get no rest, no relief. And I am coming to realize that if my body is ever going to stop tormenting me, I will have to escape it. Suicide looks soooooo nice right now. An opportunity to rest?? Yes please!!! Good luck to you! Another person that GETS it! On the one hand it is nice to have someone to commiserate with but on the other I would not wish this on my worst enemy and I am sorry you are also going through this.\n\nI also cannot stand when other people suggest anything that is one of the most common treatments. I get that that works for most people. I have tried and it does not work for me! At 52 yrs old, a veteran to life with LS, I can say, it gets better. For years, I was up all night and every morning I awoke with blood under my nails. It was unbearable. Finally, after many doctors, I was officially diagnosed. Dermovate helped but did not take it away in the early days. It took time for my body to adjust to my cream application. I was not always disciplined. Keep it somewhere where you can apply regularly. Warm baths to soothe the raw skin. It will get better. Do not give up on the clob! Try to use it regularly. You will get relief! How often do you use the clob a week? Doctor varied it. At first it was twice a day for two weeks followed by two weeks of every other day to then use only as needed. \n\nTried it multiple times with different instructions\n\nNow I just do not use it Hmm, that is strange. I think the average advice is 3 applications a week per life for severe cases. But I do think I have read around 10% of people do not improve of Clob. I hope you can find a solution, but unfortunately it is probably expensive. Laser therapy, plasma injections, Mona Lisa touch or similar... And idk if you can or want to take that big of a financial risk. ): I am really sorry you are miserable. Sometimes my flares are so severe around my period time (like I want to just claw my skin right off) I practically live in the bath tub with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide dashed in. The moment I am out, I am in pain again. I am sending you so much luck. Have you ever tried Estrace? No actually, never heard of it It is a hormone cream. My LS seems to be related to hormone imbalance, so I use Estrace regularly combined with clobetasol (for flare ups only). This works for me, but everyone is different. Also, I find that I cannot have much sugar in my diet at all or I will get a flare up.  Fleece pants also cause flare ups! Coconut oil really helps, too. I hope you can find something that works for you. LS is not fun! I will mention it to my doctor, thanks It is usually given to older women (menopausal) for vaginal atrophy, so I am not sure if it is commonly used to treat LS. I was first prescribed Estrace after giving birth. I am not sure if you are nursing or not, but that can really mess up your hormones. I have had 2 biopsies at different times in my life, both which confirmed LS (first in my 20s and then later in my 30s). I was never prescribed the Estrace until my 30s and I really think that would have saved a decade of suffering. I have heard of MonaLisa treatment, stem cell treatment, plasma treatment, and UV light treatment helping some people who do not find relief through conventional methods. Have not tried any of those but one day, if I can afford any of these, I might try. With any luck (or mercy from the gods) I will be dead before I reach 40. I am genuinely happier to die than live my whole life in this agony. Please keep updating. And tell us if you find ANYTHING that helps you. Have you tried Protopic yet?", "Allergic to something in Clob cream I was just diagnosed today, after years of issues, and was prescribed clob. But, it has petroleum in it.

It does not seem like there is a form without petroleum Can you ask your doctor about working with a compounding pharmacy?

My doctor prescribed 0.05% steroid cream, applied twice a week. That usually keeps it under control. Might be something to try.  My sympathies! I was diagnosed at the beginning of the year  and it was a relief finding out I was not imagining my symptoms (plus finding out it was not just chaffing, which was my initial diagnosis until I went to my GYN). I had relief from the itching with steroid ointment, but had other health problems come up and stopped using it after about 4 months.

I was diagnosed a little less than two weeks ago by an obgyn, but I have had symptoms as long as I can remember, so I am pretty sure it started when I was around 11-13 (I am in my early 20s now). The extent of my symptoms over the years have been the white figure eight, bad itchiness, and a \u201cthin\u201d top layer of skin that was easily rubbed away by any friction and caused more irritation. I have only ever had slight occasional tearing or splitting. I feel like I basically have lived with years of a constant, mild flare up because I always explained away my symptoms and suffered through.\n\nI was extremely thankful to be finally diagnosed and I was given clob cream for 2 weeks twice a day and 1 week once a day. I have definitely started to see major improvements in itchiness and discomfort and that the skin seems less irritated and dry.  I am only a week and a half into the clob cream so far. \n\nThis might sound silly but when will I know when it has fully done its job. Since I have never treated my symptoms I am unsure of what I should expect as \u201cnormal\u201d during a non-flare up. \n\nFor the thin skin and whiteness, am I waiting for those things to fully disappear with clob? Or are those just parts of LS that do not really come and go? Can I rely on itchiness and discomfort alone to signal a flare up after I finish my three weeks of clob if the whiteness does not go away?\n\nThank you for the help! It is a relief to be diagnosed, but scary at the same time to know that this is never going to fully go away. All of your symptoms may go away with the clob. Eventually after things get better, you may feel an inkling if itchiness and that is your signal to use a little clob again. Also, look into sitting in shallow warm water with a tablespoon or two of borax powder dissolved in it. It is a good tool to have if your itchiness seems to return. It is a simple way to address the problems in supplement to clob. Thank you! That is extremely helpful, I will look into it. And hopefully the rest of my symptoms will disappear soon. With LS, is not Clobetasol supposed to be used indefinitely? I am confused by the description of using it for 3 weeks, and then just stopping unless there is a symptom...

I have had LS for about 12 months. I am uncircumcised and I have a shiny patch on the head of my penis for around 12 months. The shiny patch is probably around an inch square in total size. There is a bit of a red rash sometimes. I have also had 2x biopsies and thankfully no cancer. (That would be very scary). I am a patient of the dermatology clinic in our main hospital. They have been pretty kind and helpful and it is a free service thankfully too. Due to covid restrictions I had a Telehealth appointment and the young doc I spoke finally told me \u201cLS is not that uncommon in men\u201d \u2026 at that point it opened up my world a bit \u2026 until then I thought it was really weird and uncommon.

Since being diagnosed I have had flare ups, yeast infections, and now BV. All of my problems with my vagina started with that first flare up I had. I am sick of the flare ups, the itch, the pain, the embarrassment. I am sick of having so many yeast infections that at this point I can feel it coming and do not even want to go get swabbed for it because 9 times in a row I have been correct in thinking it was yeast. A week ago I started having the symptoms of a yeast infection but also noticed a really different/gross smell down there so wanted to go check if it was bv(which I had never had) or yeast. Turns out it was both at the same time and I literally have not done anything to upset my vagina. I seem to have started this new thing of 30-60 day long periods a few months ago and the constant wearing a pad or using a cup eventually causes irritation and a flare up. Sometimes I feel like my vagina is broken. And I just want it to work.\n\nWhenever I tell my mom what is going on she likes to tell me it is because I ruined her \u201cperfect creation\u201d (me) by having sex and it is the worlds way of telling me to be a kid and stop trying to be adult. And I know that none of that is real and that I did not ruin myself but sometimes it just gets to me to hear her speak about my real experience and pain like that.\n\nJust wanted to vent a little. Wow you poor thing. You should not have to suffer like this. Are you seeing a gynaecologist? You probably should be. Those periods are not normal and will not be helping the LS. Sometimes the steroids can make you more prone to yeast infections. I use an ice pack to help the itch and pain. Definitely get yourself some medical help. Good luck I am sorry you are having such a hard time right now. Like the other comment suggested I hope you are able to get some good help with a gynaecologist. Periods that long are not normal and having to wear a pad all the time can really irritate your skin! Have you tried good period underwear? I find they can be less irritating on my skin. \nMight be worth putting your mom on an information diet. If someone was saying those things to be I would not be telling them a single personal thing about myself. You deserve better support than what you are getting. I am so sorry! My first flare up came because of an infection. I hope you are expressing all of these things to your gynecologist. They should be helping you find a solution. \n\nMy advice for avoiding infections. Take a probiotic daily. It helps to balance out your flora down there. I also use something called boric acid. Boric acid is what they use when people get super infections that are not responding to other treatments. Basically what it does is it changes your ph back to the healthy ph it should be. This is why it can treat both yeast and bacterial infections. When you have a yeast or bacterial infection you vaginal ph is messed up, this can lead to more infections..and if you have one treating it can lead to the other..exactly what you are experiencing. When I am starting to feel itchy or off balance I pop in a boric acid at night. I also put them in after sex and I feel it helps. I recommend asking your doctor about trying that. They have a specific treatment plan for infections that is about 2 weeks. If you can get your ph in balance you can get the infections to go away. It is a very delicate balance. I will add that because your skin has a different ph then your vagina it can feel uncomfortable when it leaks out the next day. I have not seen it worsen my ls, but it definitely irritates my skin a bit. As long as I change my panty liner often and keep it off the outside I am usually fine.\n\nThey make boric acid pills specifically for this. They sell them on amazon, Walmart etc. I just make my own. \n\nIt is definitely not because you \u201cruined\u201d yourself. You just need to have a talk with your doctor and get something that will work for you. You do not need to suffer like this, but please please advocate for yourself. Do not leave the office without a treatment plan and a follow up plan. Explain everything that is going on. Write it down before hand if you need to.\n\nI am so sorry you are experiencing this. I saw one for the first time a month ago. Honestly I left feeling like I did not get anything out of it other than confirmation of what I already knew, that I had a yeast infection. I was not experiencing a flare up so everything looked okay and he just kept telling me it is so weird that I was diagnosed with LS since it normally only affects older women. I told my pediatrician about the period and she said it might be due to my nexplanon and that she experienced the same thing and if it continued to happen we could look at taking birth control pills to regulate it. \n\nI use ice packs too and have started using Benadryl pretty regularly I have not but I will look into it. The cup is good in terms of not having the irritation that I would from a cloth pad but sometimes getting it in is hard if I have a flare up. Also I do not like using them when I am experiencing an infection. And I agree about the mom part- she does not even realize it is hurtful. I just wanted to clarify that the boric acid should be placed inside the vagina, NOT taken by mouth. I know most of you probably know this, but for someone who has not tried boric acid before that bit of information is important. Yes! Great clarification! It is a suppository, do not take by mouth.", "People who did biopsy - how many days before biopsy were you instructed to stop with corticosteroids? Health care system is crazy where I live, so I can not get any information before I actually get into an appointment with doctor - which I have to wait for a month or more. I would appreciate knowing how many days before biopsy you stopped with corticosteroids, so that I can be ready for biopsy on my first appointment with a specialst. Thanks! \n\np.s. I am using mild corticosteroids and for a very short periods because doctor told me to wait for biopsy before getting strong ones, so I can stop anytime I have not yet underwent a biopsy, but the dermatologist that prescribed me the corticosteroids cream (Locoidon in my case) told me to apply it once a day for 14 days, then a 14 days break and repeat. She also told me to manage this cycle so that i stop using the cream 14 days before the biopsy. I am on clobatesol and was not instructed to stop at all. Hmm... I guess it depends from the case. I am hoping everything went well :)", "Link between lichen scerosus and lyme disease I was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus(LS) last fall, and since then I have been reading a lot of journal articles on the subject.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI found many journal articles that provided evidence suggesting a strong link between LS and the Borrelia bacteria which cause lyme disease, but one article in particular caught my attention because it describes a relatively new immunohistochemically assisted microscopy technique pioneered by the authors which they call focus-floating microscopy(FFM).\u00a0 This new technique appears to be much more effective at detecting Borrelia bacteria compared to the standard borrelia specific PCR tests.\n\nThe article is titled\u00a0Possible Role of Borreliaburgdorfi Sensu Lato in Lichen Sclerosus Patients, published on the 1st of May 2008 by the Journal of the American Medical Association(JAMA).\n\nHere is a brief summary of their findings:\n\nIn this study, the authors reported that with\u00a0their\u00a0new FFM technique they detected Borrelia spirochetes in 38 of the 60(63%) archived human tissue samples from LS patients which they were analyzing!\n\nUnfortunately, they were only able to perform B.burgdorferi specific PCR analysis on 11 of their 60 archived LS samples due to technical problems with the storage of archival materials and 1\u00a0of these 11 cases did not have enough material for FFM after PCR).\u00a0\u00a0However, they found that\u00a0none of their 11 LS specimens which they tested for borreliosis via PCR \ncame back positive while 6 of 10 of those same LS cases was positive via FFM analysis.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAn earlier study by the same authors found that when compared to standard PCR tests for detecting B. burgdorferi sensu lato in classic cutaneous Borreliosis cases, their FFM technique was not only far more sensitive (45% positive identification for PCR vs. 95% with FFM) but it was also almost equally specific (100% w/PCR vs. 99% w/ FFM).\n\n\n\nI am curious how many LS patients in this group have either been diagnosed with lyme disease, or strongly suspect they have it.\u00a0 Wow... this is really interesting. I had Lymes when I was about 5 years old, had acute illness with high fever and was treated with high-dose antibiotic. Lifelong problems with genitalia led to my LS diagnosis at 27. \n\nBy chance did you find any papers discussing whether this can impact treatment of the condition? I have been on tons of antibiotics through my life and it does not seem to have changed the course of the disease.   Im sorry you have struggled with lifelong genetalia issues.  That Is got to be real tough.  Have you seen my post about my LS treatment success?\n\nAlso, in regards to your question.. Are you asking about the impact on treatment of lyme? Or LS?\nThe authors of this paper discuss some of the the challenges of detecting lyme disease and as I understand it, there  is some overlap between the reasons why lyme is difficult to detect with traditional testing, and why lyme is difficult to treat/ eradicate from the body.", "Can clob make it worse? I feel like when this all started I only had a couple white spots and mostly on one side. Now it seems like almost my entire vulva on both sides and my whole perineum are white. Maybe I am just now noticing but idk. Could the clob or estrogen creams be making it worse? The itching has completely gone away which is nice but what about all the white that us there now. How long has you been on it Almost 2 weeks It going to take longer then two weeks for it take effect especially if it is a bad flair Ok and thank you I was just worried that it seemed worse/to spread. This is my 1st experience with it I was officially diagnosed a few days ago when the biopsy came back. I have just been freaked out. \nThank you so much for taking the time to reply. Of course anytime you have questions Thank you it means so much to me I am sorry you are going through this, I know how scary it is. But I agree with the other poster, 2 weeks is just too soon to know for sure whether clob is going to help you or not. And if the itching is going away that is a great sign! Ok thank you so much  ill chill out for awhile :). I really appreciate your time :) I am glad I am in the same boat, it never spread until I used clob. Been on it for months now with little improvement That Is interesting to hear. Has your dr said anything? No, they are crap. I was supposed to be referred to a gyno a year ago but there is no space so I am still seeing a general practitioner. They have to Google what it is every time I see them Oh no!! Can you not make a gyno appointment yourself? Are you in the US? Or maybe a dermatologist ? Are you talking about clobetasol? \nI can speak for lichen planus on scalp and this made things worse...\nI read from a person that used Thymosin Alpha 1 and healed it. Even after quitting the medication. Thank-you! And yes I was. Topical steroids can cause skin bleaching. It is difficult for myself atleast to determine if the white patches are from the steroids or from the LS. But I will take skin lightening over the painful, broken and inflamed itchy skin any day. I did not know that, thank you so much", "Using the steroid cream on your period? Hi All,\n\nIm newly diagnosed and was waiting for my biopsy site to heal before starting the steroid cream I was prescribed. I\nOf course, because my body hates me, the day it finally healed is also the first day of my period. Are there any issues with using the steroid while on my period?", "Going for a biopsy today, kind of scared I am having these white patches for almost 2 years. Last year at the usual gynaecologist appointment she said that is due to the drynes and gave some cream. This year i went to different gyno and he referred me to a dermatologist. She said it looks like lichen, but we have to take a biopsy to be sure. What scares me the most is if this could be cancer? I am having this for 2 years, but only at the begging i had massive itching and little cuts. Do lichen works like this? The worst part of the biopsy is the numbing injection, but it is not really much worse than a flu shot or something like that. You should not feel the biopsy itself at all. Some doctors will do stitches, some will cauterize the spot. I had two stitches with each of my biopsies, and you will feel some tugging, but not pain. Once the numbing wears off you will be in some pain and have some swelling. You can take ibuprofen to help and use some ice. Do not take ibuprofen before the biopsy, because it can increase the amount of bleeding and make it difficult for your doctor to see to do the stitches. Be very careful when wiping after using the bathroom or use a spray bottle to clean yourself off. Do not have sex until you feel well healed - with my first biopsy, I had sex after a few days once the stitches fell out, but for the second one it took about a week and a half to feel fully healed. To be honest, the emotional strain of the biopsy was worse for me than the physical, but you will be okay. LS is not fun, but it is manageable. Itching, cuts, and white patches does sound like LS (even if the itching/cuts comes and goes.) I would not worry about the cancer possibility. Vulvar cancer is pretty rare, and although it can be mistaken for severe LS, I do not think the overlap in appearance is really that big. You would probably have noticed a lot more appearance changes than just the white patches. And even if you did have it, it is treatable, especially if diagnosed early.", "What were your initial symptoms that made you visit the dermatologist? I have decided that maybe it is time to visit the dermatologist. However I was wondering if anyone else has or had the same symptoms as I? \n- dry scaly almost flaky skin on perineum\n-dead skin when I wipe \n-white discolored spots of skin on perineum \n-fissures or small tears on perineum Extreme itching White Plague and red skin. same I had no symptoms. I went for my first gynocology appointment and they noticed really bad fusing and deformation Me three. The itching was unbearable. Foreskin adhesions \nPhimosis caused by antibiotic use and yeast infection Sometimes my itches but not really that often. But I realize everyone is different. I did not see a derm I was seen by gynaecological consultant. Itching split skin  (talking splits of a cm plus ) I would had some brief work up via my GP to rule out STDs and I have much more itching than any type of change in skin, no fusing or deformation....I only get the dry flaky shiny looking skin after i have given into itching like a maniac I had all these you mention, plus extreme pain during sex and using the bathroom. No itching at all, guess I skipped that step. Ironically now when I have a flare up it is mostly itching lol.", "Question Hello! I just joined this group, as my GP believes that I may have LS. I am scheduled to see a gynecologist in April.  My question is if any of you had itching on any other parts of your body? My breasts itch like crazy all the time, as well as my genitals. Has anyone experienced this? Thanks! You should look up the support group on Facebook, way more active and supportive It can affect the breasts. Yes it can around your nipples and around your mouth! yeah, it can affect multiple parts of the body! i actually had issues with my ears (similar issues with healing/scarring, frequent infections)... though do not know if that was related or not You should also schedule with a dermatologist.  The gynecologist can diagnose LS and a dermatologist can determine if you have the same condition in multiple places or different conditions altogether, plus LS puts you at increased risk for cancer that regular dermatological exams should be able to catch early.  Another advantage of having both is, if you get a flare and cannot reach one, you have another option. Thanks! I will ask for a referral! Thank you! Thanks! I did not know about the mouth at all. Me either until my doc noticed it on my face not too long ago. I just thought it was dry skin lol Can my partner get it if he performs oral sex on me? Nope! It is a skin condition, not an infection, which means it is in no way contagious.", "Have you ever lost a relationship due to LS? I am a male in my 30's and my GF is in her 20's. We got together somewhere between 2-3 year ago. In the beginning sex was VERY prominent in our relationship. Then within a few months things started to change. First she had pain... then tearing... then trying compensating tactics like different kinds of sex... then sex became less and less frequent. Now she is all but asexual. \n\nShe got her diagnosis over a year ago I think. She is used creams and changed her underwear and laundry detergent. \n\nI feel like I have just been waiting and waiting for things to get better, but they are not going in that direction. I know LS does not have a cure, but I was hoping it would go into remission or something. \n\nHow can you be with someone who has very little interest in sex? I am a highly sexual person. I know it is going to sound like, \"heu heu, dumb horny man cannot cope\". But I am being serious. It is a personal decision and choice. I, 51F, was diagnosed 2 days ago and married for just under 3 years. My husband and I are in a committed relationship and intend on staying that way.\n\nHe has a high sex drive and I am, at least at the moment, out of the game. I want nothing to do with sex. It is painful and frustrating and a lifelong thing I have to figure out how to handle. He will need to be patient. And he is. I have included him in as much of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and discussion as he will tolerate. (How many times can a man hear the words vagina and vulva in the same day?) \n\n\"In sickness and health\" means exactly that. \n\nI would think you have to decide where your commitment level is and decide for yourself. If the two of you cannot come to an agreement on how to move forward together then is it a healthy relationship for either of you?\n\nEveryone has needs. Hers are different than yours at the moment. If you are looking for a way out that does not make you seem like the asshole, I do not have the answer for that. If you, as adults, talk it through, and realize you are not on the same path then set eachother free. \n\nAlways with grace and kindness. As a female with LS, I do have to say, when things are not \u201cright\u201d down there, when I am having a flare up, the last thing on my mind is sex. Mind you, I am incredibly attracted to my husband. I would love to have sex every day. But when your skin downstairs hurts, tears and bleeds, that is the last thing you think about.\nI understand both sides of it in the relationship. But you have to understand it is not her choice to have this skin condition. Please just support her and be understanding. There are also plenty of other fun things to do besides PIV \ud83d\ude42 I (28F) was diagnosed a few months ago, and I do think it played a big role in the recent end of my 2-yr relationship. Similar situation, sex was a massive part of our connection and I suddenly had to pump the brakes due to pain and discomfort. \n\nBut from my POV\u2026LS contributed to my breakup because I suddenly saw how my partner would act in times of crisis, and it was hugely disappointing. He was unsympathetic. He never asked me how I was, or tried to help/support. I sent him articles on it and talked about it and I bet if you asked him the name of the disease, he still would not be able to tell you. He told me he wished we could have sex; it made me feel so bad for something that was out of my control. \n\nOn the flip side, you have my sister, who did her own research on LS, sent me ideas for home remedies, and still texts me to check in. Eye opening. Right, and I am perfectly happy (most of the time) doing other types of sex other than PIV. But did you read the part where I said she is all but asexual now? That part I cannot give any advice on. But I do know when I personally am going through flare ups, I try to keep interactions with my husband very, idk non-sexual? Like I feel like my demeanor changes when I am having a bad flare up because I do not want him or myself thinking that anything will lead to sex if that makes any sense at all. \nNot sure if that helps you at all but I have noticed a change in myself after having to deal with this issue Thanks, but I do not think it is a flare up thing. She says she is just not interested in sex anymore. Unfortunately I am not a sociopath so even if she was willing to keep me placated I would not be able to accept it in the long-term because I do not like having sex with people who are not into it. I work in healthcare. I know a large portion of the population is pretty clueless when it comes to health issues. Given your age I assume he had very little experience with health issues at this point in his life. That might have played a role. \n\nStill... if he literally never even asked about it and just complained \"me want sex\" then yeah that is pretty bad. Understandable. I was just trying to give advice as far as the LS goes from a female perspective. Unfortunately cannot speak on behalf of the asexual portion. I hope you guys can figure something out that is best for the both of you I do not see why you have to bring male and female into it. If my dick hurt I would not want it touched either. Sex is not everything. If you had some medical reason why you could not have sex, would you like it if she bolted and left you in the dust? LS is very painful and longterm can cause genital deformities. I am not trying to be mean but this poor girl is in for some painful episodes and she needs support from her partner. Maybe you need to move along, you do not sound mature enough to handle her condition. It is not everything, but it is a huge and necessary part of almost every romantic relationship. \n\nI am not \"bolting\". I have been very supportive and patient and understanding for a long time now. It was only not an issue for the first 6 months or so we were seeing each other. \n\nI am not \"mature enough\" to be in a sexless relationship? Give me a break. What are your options financially? \nEver heard of stem cell or tulip or Mona Lisa touch treatments? That said, in most cases sex is possible and many women have normal ish sex lives. Obviously  there will be flare ups and times where it is a no go and my bf and I just do other non PIV or at least mix it up to a lower ratio of it. But with lube and foreplay we still have a pretty active sex life. It just takes treatment management. I am currently undergoing stem cell therapy that has helped and I am considering laser treatments as well to hopefully improve things more, I also had to change my diet (no gluten, no dairy, no eggs), and soak in borax all the time. It all helps and my healing is an ongoing journey. LS is NOT a death sentence unless it is exceptionally severe but if she is in her 20s, she was caught early and with treatment it should improve enough to allow for intimacy. Note that it is a slow process. I would think that her lack of libido and/or interest in/ability to improve her condition are mainly why your partner has no interest in sex. Perhaps some therapy and approaching it from a mental health standpoint, and looking into alternative  medical treatments to make her more comfortable would help improve things. I am in my 20s &amp; have LS but completely refuse to allow it to rob us intimacy, but it is a heartbreaking battle at times so be gentle with her as she heals. Wishing you all the best\u2026\ud83d\udc97 But if the lack of sex is bothering you, then it is an issue for you or you would not be asking for advice. Sometimes hearing the truth can be a hard pill to swallow. You want sex, she does not. Do you really think it is going to work this way? It will bother you even more as time goes on. Being able to cope with a partner who has a chronic illness is not easy, and anyone who says it is is lying. You need to be an adult about this and figure out what is best for both of you and she also needs to realize all of this too. It may suck, it may hurt feelings and cause mental anguish but if she cannot please you in bed, then it is just going to cause resentment and anger. I wonder if it is worth her trying a different kind of treatment if things have not improved in a year? Obviously I do not know how many avenues she is tried, but from my own experience and the experiences of others here it seems like one of the annoying things about getting LS under control is that there are so many different options. I personally could not take clobetasol for more than a month so switched to mometasone, which helped some. A poster here recently said she would been using clobetasol for quite a while and it had not helped, but adding an estrogen cream allowed her to have sex again in a couple of weeks. (Hoping to ask my own gyn about this at my next visit after reading her post.) It sounds like LS is the least of your concern here. Maybe try a relationship advice sub I think there are a few things you need to remember here with this one. There are roles in this scenario lets say, the person who is experiencing a painful, joyless chronic autoimmune skin condition, and someone who will hopefully want to support the person they love through a difficult patch as they come to terms with the best way to handle this condition.\n\n Now, you said you work in the medical sector? So I am sure you understand yourself that getting to grips with a life long incurable condition takes a while. I can only imagine that she is not interested in sexual activities because of flare ups (which you said this is unrelated to) or fear of pain, or just generally not feeling sexy or desirable because this condition can feel quite undignified to say the least. \n\nAll of this is not to suggest that you do not have feelings too, because what happens to the ones we love, also affects us deeply too. I am not going to start saying break up or whatever, because that would suggest you only want her for sex and I do not think that is the case, I think you maybe just want that intimate pain-free bond back, which currently does not appear to be an option. \n\nWhat I would suggest is maybe discussing this seriously with your partner, asking what is really on her mind and why she seems uninterested in sexual things, non-accusatively, just very neutral and figuring out the steps from there. \n\nShe may just be deathly scared of the pain, scared that any other sexual act may have an expectation to turn into sex that she will feel like she is letting you down by refusing, or that it is psychological and she simply is so down about this condition that she wants nothing to do with that type of intimacy. \n\nIf she feels like she is ready to come around on the sex idea, because she probably misses that closeness too, then make sure not to use commercial lubes etc, try coconut oil, an alternative to condoms if you are using them and lots of foreplay and affection to make her relax. The fear of pain can cause involuntary tightening of the vaginal muscles and that makes sex soooo much more uncomfortable and painful. \n\nI wish you luck, man. Keep being supportive and things will work themselves out! Finding out your partner is asexual due to LS is the \"least\" of our concern here? Sure, that is fair. I would also say that once we could not have sex to distract us, some of the other cracks in our relationship started to show more prominently. So it was not the only factor. If you feel solid about your connection in other regards, it is definitely worth fighting for.  I do not think a side effect of LS is asexuality Losing my husband because of this disease is something that has been on my mind for the last three or so years. We have not had sex in the last year and up until about 3 weeks ago we did not know what it was. I repeatedly made an attempt to have sex regardless, which often resulted in intense pain and bleeding. Slowly I stopped trying because after 4 years of painful sex and it just getting worse, I could not stand being in pain for it anymore.\n\nLook, LS can be incredibly painful. On an average day for me that I do not have essentially paper cuts on my junk it is still usually sore and does not feel quite right. I know when it is bad enough that it is going to hurt just to touch, sometimes it hurts just to walk around, and hurts to pee. It is extremely distressing and plenty of people develop depression from it if they did not have it before.\nBelieve it or not, she may *want* to have sex but if she is like me at my worst, getting aroused can mean the increased blood flow makes it MORE sore and masturbation may even be nearly impossible.\n\nI am hoping this makes you understand a little more what she is going through.\n\nIf steroids have not worked, she might try adding on topical estrogen as others suggested. It is possible her sex drive would improve if the disease were under control, and perhaps you should communicate with her your concerns and if there are alternatives you two can try.\n\nMoving forward, you have to decide if your relationship with her matters enough to stick it out. There are other options for sexual intimacy - there are lots of other options for INTIMACY. Be aware that if you break up with her over this, it is going to be a hell of a thing for her that something she does not want and did not ask for ruined a relationship that she does want. She is probably already considered this as a thing that might happen. If you do break up with her, have some compassion and let someone close to her know so they can spend some time with her afterwards and make sure she is ok.\n\nI understand that this is frustrating, but I have never really understood why this is such a \"make it or break it\" thing for people (sex is not essential to a healthy romantic relationship). I do think it is something you need to put a lot of thought into (I suppose maybe you already have, but still, tread lightly).\n\nRegardless, I hope the best for the both of you. I am telling you what she has told me. A YEAR?! A year without any kind of sex or just PIV sex? How often were you having sex before that? Fairly frequently. For me, LS started in the first trimester of my pregnancy... so... \ud83d\ude2b", "Sex &amp; Relationship So this feel embarrassing to ask/talk about but it is just the internet so here goes. I am a female in my 30\u2019s and have been diagnosed with lichen for years now. Shortly after my diagnosis, I was in a very brief relationship and the first time we had sex, I bled. He thought it was my period but I was too embarrassed to tell him it was really my skin tearing from lichen sclerosis. I was mortified. Any sex after that incident, my skin did not tear anymore with the help of clobetasol but we also only did missionary style. I was too afraid to try any other positions in the fear that I would tear again\u2026and then the relationship ended anyways so that is that and i have not been with anyone since..\u2026but now I am in a very brand new relationship and when the talk of sex that will inevitably come up\u2026how did you broach the subject of lichen sclerosis with a new partner (without scaring them off)?\n\nAlso what products can I use that will help me? I have asked my derm in the past and she recommended a dilator. I have not tried it yet but I guess I am looking for any and all product recommendations that could help me. What type of lube? What other products? Should I just always make sure extra lube is used? For some context, I feel like a born again virgin since it is been so long since I have had sex so how should I ease or prepare my body into it?  Thank you for listening! Oh sorry to hear you are having such trouble. I\u2018m old enough to be your mother, e but here is my story. I was dx one year ago while in a pretty hot relationship of 2 years. I got a tear &amp; my first full-blown itchy flare. Got dx by biopsy. Freaked completely out and thought that was it for me sexually. I gave my guy this to read &amp; he found it hopeful, esp the comments. I am with the same guy and have not had to explain to a new one. Expect I would take it slow &amp; break the news after he is hopeless besotted /s  \n\n(  \nI recovered with clob &amp; other maintenance. Now it is mainly a discomfort but everyday is different (burn, itch, hurt).  I have better sex than I hoped for. I use lots of coconut oil for lube. Like start off with a bit then increase as you need, being mindful if it gets dry or painful. It is edible.  I like to take a quick soak afterwards. Of course I avoid sex on bad vulva days. \n\nAbout easing back into sex, I did take lots of baths and lubricated myself w coconut oil. It helped me accept LS and regain a bit of confidence about my sexuality. Keeping the natural lubrication of sex is critical for your parts however it happens. Never used dilators-thought a vibrator would work the same-and used my fingers. \n\nProducts for LS are abundant and I have tried all of them. Slippery Stuff is an approved lube but I prefer coconut oil. There is good info in this sub about products and all. Everyone is different but we all seem to find what works best for our body. Hang in there and take care. I think what is important to do here is be honest and calm and have reliable sources to share if your partner takes an interest in this once you tell them. \n\nThe most crucial thing is that if the person reacts badly and makes you feel bad in any way, you have dodged a bullet. Someone who is not willing to respectfully recognise you have a condition that requires a bit of extra care and attention and will not take the time to understand it, most certainly does not deserve you. \n\nMy ex acknowledged my condition but did not alter his behaviour to accommodate more comfortable positions or taking it slow and easing into things which was awful. My current boyfriend is fantastic and I simply told him \u201cI have a skin condition down there that is not transmittable but I need to be extra careful as it can cause me a lot of pain and discomfort\u201d and he immediately responded with something along the lines of \u201cI do not care, we will not do anything you are not comfortable with, you must tell me if you are in pain and we can change it up so you are more comfortable.\u201d\n\nEach person will be different of course but I am just trying to stress the point that they need to acknowledge AND respect your condition or they are not worth it! \n\nI personally agree that coconut oil is fantastic!! I use a dildo/vibrator as a preventative measure as recommended by my gyno to help keep structure down there. Hey there, I am currently engaged to someone with LS. I love her, and that is really all that matters.\n\nFor our overall sex life, and I do not know if I feel comfortable talking about this on the internet, but lube pretty much helps the most for us (plain, water-based). We communicate during, and if something is uncomfortable we stop. I am only sharing this because she is the same age as you, and I remember her,  breaking down in tears, talking about the constant pain she was in. Life has gotten better for her, I think she is feeling alot better these days. I just want you to know it can be better and it will be better for you too. Im around your age too. I was already in my current relationship when I was diagnosed, so my experience sharing my diagnosis was a bit of a different situation than yours will be. That said, I have had LS since childhood so I did always have to have a conversation with new partners about the fact that I experience pain during sex. I would just give a quick heads up that I sometimes experience pain, and it is almost always worst at the beginning. I would ask them to go slow and bear with me. It has never been a problem at all\n\nFor general tips to help with comfort during sex I would recommend lube and starting with a finger Coconut oit can only be used if you dont use a condom. It is not condom compatible, it tears its material, if you dont use pill or other thing is better to avoid use it as a lube.", "Is it inevitable to have a progression with LS? I am having hard time finding answer - are there different severities of LS or just different stages of the same condition? Some articles are talking about stages, but other sources are talking about \u201cmild\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d form of LS. \nSix years ago(29 F) I had a suspicion I have LS due to constant itch and the expert for vulvar conditions in my area (small country in Europe) told me it is nothing. Fast forward six years - I have developed more serious flare ups and white patches, as well as some mild architectural changes. It has been confirmed, and I am glad I know what it is even if it is LS. Now I would like to know what can I actually expect - is the therapy there for slowing progression down or just containing the symptoms? When I was first diagnosed, my doctor told me that topical steroids like clobetasol have been shown to be successful at halting the progression of symptoms and/or scarring. That has been my understanding! It seems like you can prevent further damage or worsening symptoms but the difficulty comes in trying to reverse or correct the scarring and damage that comes after having symptoms for longer periods of time with no treatment. I hope this is helpful! Thank you! It is! I can only attest to my personal experience.  About ten years ago, I had a persistent itchiness just in the little dimple at the top of my bottom.  My doctor kept diagnosing it as a fungus and prescribing anti-fungal which did nothing for me.  Over time, my bottom started feeling raw.  I was prescribed diaper rash cream which helped not one bit and ended up using Monastat anti-chafing powder gel to get some relief, which did seem to help for a while.  \n\n\n\nLast year, my gynecologist diagnosed LS, but I thought I was asymptomatic because I had not yet put two and two together to realize the problem I had had for ten years was what she had just diagnosed.  Then I had a flare that included my bottom and my genitals and it was *bad*.  \n\n\n\nSince then, I have had two bad flares treated with topical corticosteroid and I use aloe gel daily between flares.  I now have itchiness up my lower back and my husband says it looks like white patches, so I am guessing it is spreading up my back, but I am not willing to go to a doctor right now to confirm.  I have an immune deficiency, so I will wait until the current pandemic dies down before I find out for sure if it is the LS on my back.  \n\n\n\nI do not know if using the aloe between flares actually slows anything or if it just helps it feel a bit better.  These days, I am either itchy or downright in pain more often than not, which is a progression from even just a year ago.  I wonder if it would be this bad had it been treated properly back when I first started complaining about it. My doctor said the same - as long as I keep up the treatment, there will probably be no progression. Honestly I do not know! But I noticed my LS symptoms before I knew what it was 3.5 years ago. And that was the tearing and some itchiness around the vag area. About a year ago I have noticed it around my anus... so it seems to have spread for me personally in somewhat of a short period of time. I am 28, so still more time to find out. When I was diagnosed, my dermatologist said he is seen it \"cured\"  but everything I have read says it is not curable. But I will say, when it first noticed symptoms I had (like 4-5 years ago)- cracked skin on the mons pubis, intense itching, fissures, burning, painful sex, bleeding. Once I started treatment all of that went away. I use Clobetasol ointment once every couple of weeks now when I get flare ups and I have had quite a lot recently but turns out it is because I am using a heated blanket at night and it is causing a lot of sweat/moisture down there. I only get itching and fissures now. I have not had white patches/cracked skin in a long time. I would say I am in a better place now than I was 5 years ago. That is just my experience. I know others are not as fortunate. But It is important to continue using your meds to prevent it from progressing though, some people stop once they see improvements GIGGITY Stupid secks bot! I hope you will be able to find best solution for you and that it will get better!\n\nI have had itch before, but it just went worse and it was constant and intensive pain, like - if you ever had a burn on your skin, that type of pain. Sitting on work is really hard, walking is terrible and gym - well it is a internal battle to go through that. My worst flare up subsided and it is just part of this now, but it has left me wanting answers and help. \n\nIt took me at least six years to get diagnosis, so I am having same doubts as you are - could this have been prevented and will I get progression to even worse state because of this neglecting? I try not to dwell on it, and to focus more on how to fight now to get the proper treatment and to be taken seriously. I have very pessimistic doctors who basically told me there is not much they can do, there is no cure and not to get my hopes high, even though from what I am reading and seeing online - I have it rather mild. \n\nThis sub has really helped me realize that there are options and people do get better and they manage to lead mostly flare ups-free life once they get good treatment for them. If I may ask - did you get treatment for LS in that period? I was prescribed Triderm (which has 0.5 mg/g betamethasone) because clobetasol is either unavailable here or not prescribed, not sure what is the case. I was using it for 2 weeks and I am not sure how much it helped to be honest. Now I am on Elidel 1% (pimecrolimus) for 20 days and again - not sure how much it helps. I got diagnosed with early stage LS in January after 2 years of mind numbing itch.  I used clobetasol every night for a month, then every other night for a month, now just twice a week and I am almost fully in remission.  I hope the steroids do the same for you! Did you have any other symptoms other than an itch? Other than being itchy and even that is variable everything looks normal for me but the GP cannot say that its 100% not that because a specialist has not examined me. Well other than a tiny bit of redness once or twice which quickly went away and the tiniest tiniest abrasion from sex in the skin fold next to my clit. Been prescribed fucibet cream though and currently treating it as dermatitis.", "Guy with LS/stem cell therapy? Hi. I am a 40 yr old male with LS. It started developing in my early 20\u2019s. Shout out to a doctor that misdiagnosed it as \u2018nothing\u2019 back then. It has since progressed and become a bit more problematic.  \nClobetasol and tacrolimus seem to help keep it at bay but it never fully goes away. \nHas anyone here utilized stem cell therapy? I do not know if I will ever be able to afford it, but it seems like an effective treatment. are you circumcised? who has said this is an effective treatment?  I am circumcised. There are a number of clinics popping up having great success treating LS with stem cell therapy. One such place is in L.A., google stem cell lift for LS. It seems to be far more effective than steroids. I am sure it is much more expensive, though. OK. were you circumcised at birth or did you get it done after having LS At birth. Would it be constant treatment or one time only? From what I gather, after the 1st treatment symptoms generally improve at least 60%. It can take up to 3 treatments. More than once (its called platelet rich plasma or whatever, it is more of a plastic surgery), and it does not cure it but significantly reduces symptoms and gives your private part a better 'look'", "Studies for cures I had a look at studies regarding cures for LS. And found one dates in 2006 about a successful cure using laser both on men and women.\n\nThey then revisited rhe patients 10 years later amd only a few needed further treatment.  If a cure may be there, then why is nothing being done?\n\nLink here\n \n\n What types of lasers ?? Because . . . money. \n\n1) small affected population\n2) not a huge profit due to 1)\n\nSorry, I am kind of cynical Also, subjects were only men, no women, despite the fact that the majority of LS sufferers are women. Ive chosen a study for men because this was the only one.  If you look at all current studies via google and previous studies, they were done on women aswell. This isnt a gender biased issue, just takes a google search to find research papers Carbon dioxide mate What are they called . I got to disagree. I went looking for a doctor who mentioned a specialty or even competency in LS. Every single one I found was a urologist who mentioned foreskins. Not a whisper of labia or vaginas, thankyouverymuch. I looked for studies, and did not find anything, so if you can sent me links, I would be grateful.  Mona lisa laser i believe", "Can you describe the pain? I am a 28 y/o male, trying to get a diagnosis of a suspicious white patch next to planus looking lesions on my shaft. It kind of just feels like someone kicked me in the dick when I stop using pimecrolimus.\n\nI have been to 5 doctors with 25 appointments, 25 creams, and no answers except eczema. Do you all only experience pain from the ripping of skin or do you feel the dull achey feeling that I have? I can definitely say i know the dull achy dick soreness. I dont understand how a skin disease can make your whole dick hurt. Does yours go away with any of the treatments?  Its probably because the skin things are just external manifestations of a deeper underlying internal problem.  Lots of evidence points to a correlation between LS and Lyme disease.  And Lyme disease can cause all kinds of chronic pain, and autoimmune issues and endless other problems..  I used a treatment that is not really FDA approved or anything yet so I cannot say much about it right now, but it did resolve those symptoms.  My only unresolved symptom is those darned couple drops of clear slimey discharge that I get after every time I use the restroom. I Always have to wait around an extra minute or two to wipe that after I am done emptying my bladder or bowels. Oh ya, and I probably still have Lyme disease, but I dont even have a solid diagnosis for that yet, and there isnt a real solid cure for chronic Lyme right now anyway.  Lyme is a tricky beach Hmm. Well my description of pain would not be helpful since I do not have a penis. But I am sorry you are experiencing pain!\n\nHowever, I do use pimecrolimus. Since both LS and Excema are autoimmune diseases, it makes sense that the same medicine would help the problem, whichever thing it was. \n\nI am curious to know if you have patches anywhere else on your body? My very limited experience with excema is that it can show up in different locations, anywhere. If it is just localized then it could be LS. You mentioned going to doctors, are any of them trained in LS that you know of? I sometimes get a dull pain, like a broad, very sore bruise all around the vulva but there is no bruise. I am not positive it is from the LS, but I suspect it is an indication of the underlying inflammation.", "Shaving vs waxing or anything else Hello everyone I was occasionaly shaving before LS but now it causes so much irritation and waxking is a nightmare as well. So, I decided to let the hair grow. However, last week my doctor saw and immeadiately told me to find a way to get rid of pubic hair since it might be the reason for itchy feeling. I am curious about your experiences and suggestions! Seems just as likely to me that removing the hair would cause itching and irritation as it inevitably grows back.  That Is what happens to me when I shave my face so I just keep my beard trimmed short to avoid the irritation to my skin.  \n\nI mean, its couldnt hurt too much to just try what your doctor suggested also, cuz their explaination kind of maybe might make some sense also. What the hell? That doc is crazy. Pubic hair does not cause itching. It protects you! And removing it causes itching!! \n\nThat is completely insane! Not just wrong but wrong in an offensive and harmful way. \n\nGet another opinion, please!! I use electric clippers to manage the Bush. I never shave, wax or use chemicals. If I am flaring I use blunt tipped scissors. Just be careful because any irritation can cause problems down there. Always gently remove the hair and not completely. \ud83d\udc4d I second this! Lifesaver for me. I find that having no hair/ very short hair causes less irritation than when I have longer hair, because I think it can \u201cbreathe\u201d more, but that is just me though, however I do agree that doctor sounds a bit extreme She suggested laser hair removal for me but I am not sure about it She actually suggested laser hair removal for me since it wouldnot cause any irritation but I am not sure about it as well I tend to get me pain and discomfort when I have not shaven so I tend to shave frequently and I have not been sore in a while now! Yeah she actually suggested to do laser hair removal in order to avoid irritation Thank you so much for sharing your experience! I am so confused at the moment whethwr should I go to laser hair removal or not I think you should do what works for you! If you like having hair, leave it. It could be that hair regrowth after shaving is causing irritation, but hair in general likely is not.\n\nI use an electric trimmer, which is not as smooth as a wax or shaving, but there is no prickly regrowth. I have heard that sugaring is gentler than waxing, so I am going to try that. It is not something I would do on a regular basis though.", "DO I HAVE LICHEN or am I overthinking !!!! Worried and scared  It looks normal to me, is it irritated? What do you mean irritated? Also the darker spots on top that is hard to see but you can see it. Is that just the skin like that? It was previously a clear flat lesion and turned just to a light dark spot as u can see there. Am I overthinking and it is nothing serious? Honestly it is hard to tell. Most pictures of LS look a larger white patch to start. Mine turned color and became flat and sometimes looks like a depression but it is over 1/4 inch dia and on the glans. \nOn the underside it was thick white scar tissue. This cleared and I have new pink skin. Took about a year. \nThe frenulum is completely gone.\n\nMaybe wait and see if it just clears with a steroid cream. 4.00 inches is 0.57 bananas long\n\nI am a bot and this action was performed automatically\n\n conversion table\n\n|Inferior unit|Banana Value|\n|:--|:--|\n|inch|0.1430|\n|foot|1.7120|\n|yard|5.1370|\n|mile|9041.2580|\n|centimetre|0.0560|\n|metre|5.6180|\n|kilometre|5617.9780|\n|ounce|0.2403|\n|pound-mass|3.8440|\n|ton|7688.0017|\n|gram|0.0085|\n|kilogram|8.4746|\n|tonne|8474.5763| Looks normal to me, or definitely not LS.

Put some moisturizer on it and see what happens, nothing with fragrance Why is this still not marked NSFW?!? Where the fuck are the mods?!? Lol Why do I need a cream for? And should I wait about a year or what. It is been 7 months Why moisturizer I think you should request a steroid ointment like betamethasone and see if it clears up.\nJust my opinion. I obviously am not a doctor. Does it hurt? Also does it seem normal like maybe it is just discoloration that is normal? I cannot say. What hurts me is adhesions that are torn open.  The white marks do not hurt. Just itch when getting better as skin sheds.\n\nI think you should try to find a dermatologist that has LS patients and try a steroid cream for short period of time. Just my personal opinion.\nMy dermatologist checks me for cancer once a year so I do not think you need to worry to much. Just my opinion! How does he check you for cancer? Also is my skin normal? Does it look similiar to yours? Just inspects for suspicious marks or lumps. It is a she and I had her for years before my accidental diagnosis.\n Long story but it is in one of my replies. Your skin does not look that bad to me. \nA dermatologist is best bet for these types of problems and females have more women LS patients. I just got lucky. She has me handle myself and she directs me to turn and hold so she can see. So they would know if you have cancer or not? Yes yearly inspection", "Confused Hey,\n\nI am a 25yo female and have been struggling with symptoms similar to LS for a few months. After speaking to a dr she said it probably is not LS as there is no white patches. But from what I have read the white patches come once it is got worse, so surely it could be LS but the white patches have not appeared yet?! I have constant tiny cuts appearing and it is soooo irritating, and looks pretty inflamed and sore at the moment. Been prescribed cream again for now but I cannot help but think I will be back at the doctors In a few weeks with the same symptoms all over again. \n\nJust wondering on others peoples diagnosis and whether the white patches are the only way to tell? \n\nThanks! It could also be lichen plantus. Only real way to know for sure which/what condition is to have a biopsy. Find a reputable Dermatologist who will do a skin biopsy. Agreed ^^^. I am in a similar boat. I do not have cuts but inflammation and itchy. I got a biopsy done but mine came back as non specific inflammation, which they figure could be early LS but no way to tell for sure. I have been to a lot of doctors. Still no real answers yet. All I know is when my allergist put me on prednisone it was the best I would felt in months. Keep pushing for answers. I know when I got yeast infections a couple times I got tiny cuts. Unfortunately I think a lot of peoples symptoms differ so it is not a one size fits all thing. Hope you feel better! My LS started the same way - had the same symptoms as you with no patches, thankfully my doctor treated it as if it were LS and gave me the treatments for it.\n\nI think the patch did not appear until maybe 6-8 months in? I have one little white patch so far, hoping to keep it that way. My symptoms were under control by then but I still was in pain, the pain went away once it appeared really which was nice and lead to me getting diagnosed. Ah really?! \n\nThat is what I am thinking cos all the other symptoms seem to add up except the white patches, but I thought maybe they would appear after time like you have said yours did. \n\nI think it is going to just be back and forth to the doctors a lot to finally get a diagnosis. When I first started reading about LS I was so gutted that I might have it but now I feel like I have come to terms with it and just want the correct treatment to keep it all at bay. \n\nThanks for your reply! Everyone is super helpful on here, it is been so helpful reading what everyone says and knowing you are not the only one! Mine started with white patches and pain during sex and occasional tears. I did not even really notice anything was wrong. My doctor actually pushed for further investigation based on appearance. (Two different doctors actually!) No other symptoms for at least a year, including itchiness. Even now, my itchiness is super, super mild, even during my worst outbreak.\n\nMy biopsy also did not show LS or anything else. My doctor thinks we tested too soon or in the wrong place. And getting the biopsy kind of sucks, so I would maybe put that off if you have a doctor willing to look into helping you some other way first. \n\nThis might not be helpful, but I guess my point is that it seems like it can show up in different ways for different people. \n\nI hope you figure out the cause and a solution! Yeah it is so strange is not it how different it can be. For me itchiness is the worst part, and it comes in waves so sometimes I am like oh it is better and then it is back. I think it seems to be worst if I am stressed/tired/run down etc. \n\nYeah I did wonder what a biopsy would be like tbh and think I have been too scared to ask anyone. \n\nThanks so much! I am glad I have this to talk on as it really helps to make you realise you are not the only one! For me, what sucked about the biopsy was two things: 1) the numbing shot to the vulva, which def hurt pretty bad (after that I could not feel the actually biopsy itself, thankfully), and 2) having an open wound on my vulva so that every time I peed it stung like hell. \n\nIt is doable, and you will be fine if/when you get it done. But it definitely was not the best week of my life.  Yeah! I thought the same thing especially hearing from others about it too\n\nYes though, really push for that medication because the sooner you medicate the sooner it gets better.\n\nI know :( honestly it is really daunting, ive been diagnosed with chronic conditions before but never something so uncommon or something with so little research. My mental health has seriously taken a toll and I have a lot of health anxiety about it now (booked a festival for the summer and cried right after because I was worried how I would wash and apply ointment etc) \n\nFeel free to dm me if you are struggling, I think time helps and getting used to treating it helps too (it is not too bad to be honest, my current regime is steriod ointment I rub in every other day then this emollient cream thing i rub in whenever I do not do that and use it as soap in the shower for down there too). I think it is natural too to grieve for times before symptoms started etc, it is rare I can have spontaneous s*x now bc of constantly having some kind of medicine applied that I will go quickly shower off etc, and wearing leggings often bc I enjoyed those before :/ overall though I am glad it does not take more away. \n\n\nAnd of course! Apologies this ones a few days late, i think speaking to others experiencing it too has really helped me feel less alone yknow? Girl get yourself to a dermatologist who is an actual expert on LS. You can call offices and ask for a physician who treats LS regularly and uses an aggressive approach. You are young and there is no time to waste. Good luck!", "How long does clobetasol usually take before you start getting relief? I have been on clobetasol for a little over a week now and still am not getting much relief. I was actually feeling a little better last weekend but then on Monday I felt like it got worse and has been the same ever since. How long does it take for you to start getting relief after you have started applying clobetasol? Much more quickly. My doctor said I would feel better straight away and there should be no itchiness after a week. Maybe give it a few more days and call your doctor if it is still bad by then. Yes I had relief much sooner with clobesotol. I would make another appointment with your doctor. In the mean time try adding coconut oil on after the clobesatol. It is very moisturizing and always helps when I have a bad flare up. Hope you can get some relief! Thanks I will try the coconut oil! How often do you apply clobetasol when you are in a flare? My doctor just has me using it once a night Just once a day usually after I shower. Usually I will only use clobesatol once and then just coconut oil alone for a few days. That works for me but I have had it for 6 years lol I have used 3 steroids now: clob, betaderm and one in the middle of those two strength-wise that I cannot remember the name.\n\nBetaderm and the other one worked quickly, but I found that they were a little too strong and did not work as well for recurrence.  Clobetasol works quickly for me but also works better long-term.  Worlds of difference.  I use it before bed so it can sit and do its thing without me moving around too much.\n\nAlso I second coconut oil!  I use it after I shower and it keeps things calm without always relying on a steroid.", "Specialists in United States (california) I have white patches on my penis head that I have had forever and thought were birthmarks, and after having a yeast infection it caused the lichen that i have had to flair up.

It is spreading very rapidly especially on the outside and i am in immense pain I need help quickly please.

I just have white patches and the start of scarring on my glans/frenulum and very minor tightening of the foreskin, would this allow me to get circumcised to potentially stop LS? I am undiagnosed but thinking ahead - doctor currently has me on hydrocortisone to help with the tightening of my foreskin but it is not really helping as it has not improved with a month of use Change your doctor. Hydrocortisone will not get you anywhere. It is not strong enough for effective treatment although could be used as part of a maintenance routine. See a dermatologist. I can recommend a very good one in London. In answer to your question, yes you can. The NHS treatment sheet recognises it as a solution if steroid creams - typically clobetasol/dermovate - fail. Hi you should go back to your doctor and explain that the hydrocortisone has not really helped at all, they may give you something stronger and refer you on to a urologist or dermatologist. Have you been doing stretching exercises with the cream? Having a circumcision should really help to stop the LS but you should have it diagnosed first. The NHS would do it if diagnosed but I am sure there would be a wait to have it done. Hi I have not been doing any stretches cause the phimosis is not really setting in yet, It is just kind of noticeable (I can see the ring has tightened slightly but it is not got any white or scarring - it is mostly on my glans/frenulum) \nI did asked to be referred to a dermotologist but they referred me to a urologist who just gave me an ultrasound on my testicles to check for any issues and have another appointment to check up on my urine flow (Idk why they are doing this, maybe because i had a UTI at the same time I mentioned my concern of LS)\n I will call Monday and get a stronger steroid/mention clob and get a proper referral to a dermo If you have active penile LS or it is suspected, stretching exercises run the risk of creating actual or micro tears resulting in scarring and likelihood of the phimosis worsening. Ah so I should avoid it for now? Some gentle stretching should not do any harm really especially when using the steroid cream if not the foreskin will get tighter in time especially if you have a ring around it as this is the problem with having LS. Is the meatus affected with LS? How old are you? When you had a UTI it would be normal for some tests to be done. Hi I am 21, I would not say the meatus is affected but the white patches go very close to it which is worrying but no scarring on it at all, i have noticed some occasional spraying when urinating but I think that is due to the meatus lightly sticking together Your UTI has cleared up completely? it would be a little unusual for you age to have one are you sexually active. I have had them in the past as well and all sorts of tests and no real answer to why anyway.\nThat is good the meatus is clear I would try the stronger steroid and see how it goes. In my case It affected the frenulum and spread out to the foreskin and some patches on the glans. Yeah it has cleared completely - been tested for STIs as well and it came up clear - I am sexually active but only with my long term gf - no chance of an sti Did your frenulum have any scarring? Mine feels hard which is unusual but I think it is just scarred slightly from LS Until LS has been ruled out or been treated into remission. Whilst waiting to see a dermatologist, stop using soap on your genitals and replace it with an emollient wash like e45, and use a barrier cream on the glans and foreskin, such as Epaderm, to remove contact with urine and always shake and wipe. Yeah it was the worst affected area it spread out around the foreskin then. the frenulum eventually broke with me but at least the foreskin was not as tight after that. I eventually had the circumcision done which was a big decision but it was the best decision I made. You do not have any photos up anywhere, there are other sites that are good for information as well. Are you from the UK yourself? Can I ask how long your circumcision took to happen from referral? Also was it due to phimosis or what is it a given option to you? In the end I went private I just could not deal with the waiting in my case the steroid cream helped but it was still spreading. the steroid soften the foreskin so I did not have phimosis at that time it was the discoloration and scarring that was there still. The options I had were to continue with the steroid long term and hope that it would improve or go for the circumcision of course it still might not have helped but so far it has. I do have one area that I think there is some still but it is not spreading. I am for Ireland Ah I see! Thank you for the info :) No problem. it sounds like you have possibly some extensive LS keep in contact with your doctor's and definitely try the stronger steroid I will do!\nIf I may ask one final question, how much money was your private  circumcision? My was a few years ago I think now it is anywhere \u20ac1000 to \u20ac1300 depending on the job. Are you thinking about circumcision? I would give the cream a try anyway first. How extensive is it you can pm if you want to. Ideally I would be open for a circumcision because I do not really want to do steroid cream for the rest of my life, if I am honest I would not say it is extensive, minor phimosis, frenulum feels hard but looks normal, white patches above the frenulum on the glans close about 2mm from the meatus - the skin has started to thicken within the last week but only in a few tiny spots and is barely noticeable unless you feel over it \nI would still say early stages but progressing onto moderate - no pain or itchiness at all and sex/masturbation feels normal Yeah I felt the same about it. I am glad I did have the circumcision now. It is something that you need to be happy with doing. See how you get on with the cream and what your doctor and urologist think.

It is consistently pale down the inner part of the majora and not patchy at all. \n\nThey wanted to take a punch biopsy near my clitoris but the pain of the lidocaine needle was so extreme I could not do it.

So I read this thinking \"no way topical steroids are bad for your bones\" but I went to do some reading. And yeah, I was wrong. However, we are talking about REALLY large doses over a long time, way beyond what you have been using. \n\nA recent study ( found that lifetime dosage of &gt;500g of mometasone was associated with increased risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture. This kind of dosage is seen in people with eczema or psoriasis over large areas of their bodies, who have been using the medication for years. \n\nYou have absolutely nothing to worry about using it only on your genitals for (in the grand scheme of things) an extremely short time. If it is helping your symptoms, keep using it. If you stay on steroids in the long term, your doctor will talk to you about how to manage your condition using the lowest effective dose. There may be other side effects of long-term steroid use that need to be considered, but it is unlikely that bone weakness will be one of them. i mean it looks like it im 60 days in and i still have some white patches around maybe even expanding  but some are gone if it will continue to expand i will get circumsized just incase but there is some near my string so i guess there is no way around it i think i have more of it but its just in sleep mode i just hope it wont get that much worse overtime. Im mad i didnt get it diagnosed faster when there was just 1 little dot but doctors miss diagnose ls alot. I legite think it was caused by friction or the lube  i always had tight foreskin at that area where lichen started so i guess it was due to friction stress. But on the other side im on testostorone replacement therapy for 3 years now. yea i figured it 1% isnt that much unless you are eating oral ones that are 40% + bones shouldnt be an issue. Im coming to my 90days max soon i will call my doctor what to do next.  It says on the medicine dont use for more than 12 weeks. But the thing is 1% hydrocortisone is weak and people get prescribed much powerful ones for it to work\n\nHave you looked into Tacrolimus or Pimecrolimus? Those are immunomodulators and they have no bone or skin thinning problems plus theyre safe to use for years. (Even on babies)\n\nI recommend having a talk with a reputable derm &gt; Tacrolimus or Pimecrolimus\n\nthey prescribed me Advantan 1%", "Not sure I have been diagnosed for years now. The only reason I found out was that when I went to see the gyno he took a look. Jumped back from the table and told my husband who was ready to start swinging. Turned to us and said when were you castrated. I am a women. I told him he had horrible bedside manners and to give us a referral.\nWhen I saw them I was in no good spot. She looked everything over then told me that she will need to run tests but I do have Lichen because my vulva is pretty much gone.\n\nSo for maintaining do you like to keep it shaved? A little bit hair or au natural?\n\nMe I go natural I have tried all and did not see much of a difference Wow that is awful..I would be reporting them. \nShaving does not really matter, just whatever your comfortable with.  Be sure to follow your treatment! Sorry you had such a bad experience with your doctor. That was very unprofessional of him.\n\nAs for hair care the only thing that causes issues for me is hair regrowing. When the hair grows it causes itchiness. Then, the LS makes the rest of the skin in the area even more itchy so it gets into a bad cycle until I use steroid cream to calm things down. I got laser hair removal done which probably removed around 80% of the hair and I highly recommend it if you are okay with a more hairless look. Do you have symptoms? Itch or pain? I have both but I am on clob for the itch.", "does this look like possible ls? ", "Any relation to genital herpes (HSV-2)? Hey everyone, my lichen sclerosus symptoms started about 1-2 months after contracting HSV-2. At first I thought it was some kind of autoimmune disorder ignited / initiated by my immune system's failure to deal with HSV-2. Does anyone know about a relation between herpes and lichen sclerosus? \n\nAlso I was wondering if there are other people with hsv-2 and lichen sclerosus as I cannot use steroids when I have a herpes outbreak and was wondering what I should do instead if I do get one. \n\nThe doctor was pretty useless as they know as much about hsv-2 as they do about lichen sclerosus - not much it seems...!", "Treatments for lichens?? Alternative treatments? So im going to start off by saying i have lichens simplex chronicus, not sclerosis. But as far as i have been told treatment is about the same, just my lichens is the best of lichens family. I was hoping you all could help me.\n\nAs ive stated i have lichens simplex chronicus and it on my vestibule/vaginal opening. \n\nI have clobetasol to use for 2 weeks at a time when i have flares. Well the first round went great, nocturnal itching stopped all was well. About a month after finishing the burning with penetration came back. I also have vaginismus so i have to do dilator therapy prescribed by the PT and gyn. \n\nSo now what have you tried for treatments that helped medical and alternative?\n\nI use emi oil 2x per day and try to take and Epsom salt bath at least a few times per week both recommended by the PT.\n\nIm so frustrated i will do anything at this point. Sounds like you are doing all the right things! Something I heard of through other online LS groups is using Borax (chemical name:  sodium tetraborate) and dissolving it in water and then soaking in it. It sounds kind of weird and I was pretty skeptical at first but it has cut down on itching substantially for me (like for a couple hours to about a day post exposure) and seems to maybe help inflammation too. Up to you whether you decide to try it but I thought I would mention it :) Thanks!", "Biopsy today. What i need to know before? Any advice are welcomed. Can i shave before? Do I need to use only water? It till hurt? I do not think you need to shave, unless they told you to. They should give you local anesthesia, so that you will not feel any pain with the biopsy. The most uncomfortable part is the injection of the anesthetic. They also should advise you on how to take care of the biopsy site afterward. You probably have to avoid swimming/bathing in order to keep the site dry, but I think you are allowed to shower after a day or so, and you will probably need to change the bandage regularly and apply something like vaseline. Again, they should tell you all this; if they forget or you have any further questions, just ask. \n\nI got my butt biopsied in March and it did not hurt even after the anesthetic wore off. I did have itching so I used an ice pack for that. I know some people on here said that their vulvar biopsy was sore afterward, and I think recommended ice packs. You can probably take something like ibuprofen or acetominophen too if you need to. Just ask the doctor/nurse before you leave what you should take if it gets too sore. The lidocaine needle dosent hurt at all! I am a baby about needles and almost panicked at the thought of one going down there. Where they take the sample will be tight so try not to pull the skin to much after a week or so you can start to massage the are (I use emu oil and emuaid) to help the tissue heal and regain elasticity. Thank you! I have done the biopsy and it was not as bad as thought. What i do not know is the after care.. I am scared to use the toilet and i do not know if i can wash myself or no..the doctor has not been quite specific. Any advice?? My doctor said do Epsome salt baths for cleansing. Like every day for a week I think. Just 10 minutes or so. I did the soaks and applaud my usual creams and ointments. I use water wipes to cleaning in the mornings to get rid of the layer of produc and apply fresh. They are very gentile and I was shocked I can use them so frequently and they do not cause me any problems. I have very active and I use them after sweating and on hikes and they are very soothing and help with itchiness. Sorry meant to write this as a response. Also, if the water wipes work for you, if you are concerned about using rhe restroom maybe day it lightly with a water wipe, or you could try arm and Hamer wound wash (it has a spray head) and put it on a cotton pad or bud and pat the area for extra disinfectant. But I would make sure to only use it on that area so it dose not cause dryness anywhere else. Oh! I almost forgot. Use Vaseline on the spot (I still use it all over everytime I go to the restroom I reapply) but my doctor said to put a good dab of Vaseline on it to help it heal and protect it Just keep it clean like you normally would!", "Do I have lichen sclerosus ?! Does it look like it or no? Plz help  Honestly only a trained doctor can tell. \nBut do you have any pain/burning or severe itch? No symptoms at all, is it suppose to show symptoms?    You need to have a doctor biopsy the area to have a diagnosis and yes there are generally significant other factors as well like uncontrollable itch or pain.  Does not seem to have that \"lichen\" shape to it in my mind but again a doctor should examine and do a biopsy so you can begin treatment. You need to have a doctor biopsy the area to have a diagnosis and yes there are generally significant other factors as well like uncontrollable itch or pain.  Does not seem to have that \"lichen\" shape to it in my mind but again a doctor should examine and do a biopsy so you can begin treatment. You can have LS without those symptoms; I do! I very rarely have itching. Would they be able to tel what it is without biopsy, I am scared of biopsy Sometimes there are no symptoms, especially when it is not on the genitals. What part of your body is this? Sometimes they can tell without a biopsy. It depends on how clear/obvious the presentation is, and how much experience they have. \n\nIf they are not sure, you could ask them to refer you to someone with more experience, who might be able to tell from looking, instead of getting a biopsy. However, some doctors think that every case should be biopsied. Shaft If it goes away should I not worry? How long until I get cancer Lichen rarely evolves to cancer.. There is no way of telling you how long it will be before you get cancer, because most likely, you will not get cancer from lichen if it is treated. Go to the doctor and get the biopsi. It is a microscopic piece of skin, you will be numbed and will not feel anything. Lichen rarely evolves to cancer..

She thinks my next step might be surgery for a vestibulectomy, but told me to do as much research as i can before that since it is a 50/50 chance it will work. \n\nPT and home treatments have kept me from any fusing at this point but im not getting any better.  I dont have itching or any symptoms at all except with penetration...\n\n\nSo my questions are:\n\nWhat treatments worked or did not work?\n\nDid you have surgery or any procedures that have or have not helped? \n\nDo you have any other suggestions or advice?\n\nI see my uro-gyncologist next week so if you have any input of what to ask for treatment wise or advice please let me know.  \n\n\n\nThings i do:\n\nEpsom salt baths approx 3x per week\n\nDilate with intimate rose large set 5x per week (i currently am stuck at second size with no pain, the 3rd one causes pain at my vestibule...) \n\nWear cotton underwear, no thongs\n\nWear no underwear while home or to bed unless i have my period\n\nUse cletabetasol for extreme flare ups (not currently using)\n\nEmu oil 2-3x per day with Cerave healing ointment \n\nDiltiazem 2% cream 2x per day\n\nLidocaine with baclofen cream to use as needed\n\nDove sensitive skin soap\n\nFree and clear tide for laundry\n\nOnly use pads for my period NAD but I was under the impression that the clobestal must be used permanently. I found it took weeks of twice daily use for it to work. Google Dr Gayle Fischer she is an Australian professor who specializes in Lichen Sclerosus for more info. Personally surgery is a last resort for me. I had success with estrogen cream and dilators but it takes time. Just my two cents woth I was told by my doctor that i am not supposed to use it long term but i will bring it up again.I dont want surgery at all... ill look up dr gayle fischer for more info! Yes Dr often say that but the specialists actually say otherwise. Most PCP know very little about the condition. There are also several good Facebook groups. I would post links but am Reddit learner lol &gt;NAD but I was under the impression that the clobestal must be used permanently\n\nThat is generally true for lichen sclerosus, but I do not know about Lichen Simplex Chronicus. OP do you have LS as well as LSC? I have problems with Tide, even free and clear. I do OK with All Free and Clear, though. Makes no sense to me. There are even gentler detergents out there that do work. \n\nI also cannot handle Dove sensitive skin. It is not gentle at all. The fragrance alone is overpowering. I have some orange soap from Tom\u2019s I use on my body, and it seems to do okay. But I never soap vulva. I have a shower head that comes free on a hose, I use it to spray everything clean there. \n\nI have never been as bad off as you but that seems like a lot of things. Emu oil. Cerave. Diltiazem. Lidocaine/baclofen.  That is a lot of things. That seems like it would cause other problems possibly. Have you talked about removing some of those treatments to see how your body reacts? (I am *NOT* a doctor)\n\nI find that pads have been horribly irritating. I actually switched back to tampons because having the giant pad on my skin all day for a week was making me raw. I am considering trying out those cups... but I am so few years from menopause now, maybe I will stick it out.... I should clarify but i do not use the meds/products at once. I do use diltiazem 2x per day and emu oil. The cerave is just to prevent any urine from touching my skin when it is irritated. Emu+Cerave are new and im unsure if they have made it better or worse. Lidocaine is as needed, which i maybe use once a month. I would love to be off of all of it personally. \n\nI will try switching from tide, i guess i never thought to change the brand! Dove sensitive is interesting because that was the first thing i changed with my dermatologist recommendation for my eczema so ill change that too if i can find something. I dont wash vulva with it but around my skin folds because i do sweat and workout.  \n\nI wish i could wear tampons/cups but vaginismus preventa both so im stuck with pads for now. I am trying different brands that are 100% cotton/chlorine free. Im unfortunately not close to menopause so i have many periods to try these out... \n\nThank you for your insight! Any idea of what kind of specialist i should look for? I am currently seeing a uro-gyncologist for this..", "How to fix odour I have been diagnosed with LF for a little over a year now when I told my pelvic physiotherapist that my pessary would start to smell after only a couple of days. That passed but now the odour is back, and has been for over a week now. I have a very good hygiene and the smell only bothers me, my partner not really smelling anything. But for me? It is there. Does anyone have any tips on how to get rid of the smell? I have gone back to using the estrogen cream in the hope that it helps. I do not have any itching, discomfort or pain.", "Think I am having a flare? Hi all! \n\nFor the past five days I have had the most intense itching. I have been layering on clob and waiting for something else to happen, but i cannot see any bumps, lumps or things such as that. I say that because my first thought always goes the STD route. the itching has turned to burning, and I can see tiny cuts i think from where I have scratched. I have posted an image of such on my profile, it seems raw and irritated, but perhaps fresh eyes can see if I am missing something? I cannot see your image, but have you ruled out a yeast infection? Sometimes I cannot tell at first which it is .... Definitely something I am debating- have a doctors appointment coming up! \n\nMy image is actually on my profile if you click it, the two posts at the top! Hey I looked at your profile, the pics look like LS to me. Also... you also posted three days ago that you had not used your clob for 2 weeks, right? \n\nIf that is the case then... yeah, you stopped using the meds, so you stopped feeling better. It is going to take more than three days to get back to normal. \n\nIf you do not want to use steroids long-term, you should have that conversation with your doctor. You should taper off them gradually and find the other medicines or moisturizers that can help. Thank you so much! I really appreciate the response and the help! It is soo terribly annoying and I was freaking out.", "Starting in clinical trial, super nervous Not sure what I want to achieve, but need to get it off my chest.\nI am participating in a clinical study with laser treatment on the 15th of this month\nThis comes with a biopsy and I will only learn if I am in the placebo group or not after 3-4 months...\nNot sure how I can get my nerves under control\n\nWas someone in a similar situation?\nHow did you do?\nHow was it, if you were in the placebo group? I just want to start by saying thank you for volunteering to participate in the study you enrolled in.  Gathering scientific data is super important, and getting data on human patients is necessary also.  I am sure every patient is grateful for people like you volunteering to help our doctos learn more about this awful disease.     \n\nVolunteering to possibly be given a placebo for months at a time and recieve no real treatment is a bit of a gamble..  I know that when I took a month long break from treatment a lot of my symptoms returned fairy quicky, but then they also went away again fairly fast when I started treating myself again.    So, stopping treatment did cause me to lose some progress as far as reversing the progression of the disease, but luckily I was able to catch up on all that lost progress when I resumed my treatmemt.  \n\nI wish you the best, and just remember.. even if you end up in the placebo group- that data is just as important as the data from the group that receives the real treatment.  Thanks again for being a brave volunteer! Thank you so much for doing this. Just imagine, if the trial you do leads to some form of a cure! I hope it goes well for you. Nerves are natural, so you know if you are allowed to do anything alongside the placebo/medication, I.e. moisturise the area to keep it from itching? Good luck!!! I hope you get the real deal and that it helps you so much. I have not been in any trials for my LS, but I did one for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis when I was a kid. I actually did receive the placebo, so that sucked, but after the study ended it was found to be a success so the doctor running it/my doctor fought like hell to get my insurance to cover it before it was market ready. It was fully covered when it would have probably bankrupt us before ($5k a week). I ended up in remission and it saved my life!!! I do not even remember how bad it was when I had the placebo- I just remember how I got my life back in the end, and I hope you have the same experience! Good luck again and thank you so much for being a part of LS research \ud83d\udc97 Thank you \u2764\ufe0f\nSo glad, you received the medication in the end Thank you for your kind words! \n\nI know, they need all the data they can get \nThat is also the reason, why I let them do the biopsy (I could have opted out, but they explained that they hope to find out more from before /after tissue samples) I just wanted to say thank you and good luck! Thank you and good luck ! Do you know what type of laser treatment this is that they are trialing ? Have my fingers crossed for you ! Hello! Thank you for participating in a trial and helping us all. Do you know what type of laser is being used or can you post a link to your trial from the government clinical trial registry site? I am in the clinical trial for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. \nI understand you are anxious.

I am asking for someone important to me Pain level is different but anesthesia is always a risk. This does not require that level of risk &amp; a doctor is not likely to take it. It is a clinic procedure, no anesthesiologist is present. It is not painful but something like a lidocaine numbing solution is adequate for discomfort and the doc can help with that. \n\nEdit: If it helps any: Me shaving first was my only real pain tbh. The procedure was fine &amp; I iced it after- just uncomfortable but no real issues. Ya, a topical anaesthetic like lidocaine would probably be the most effective and appropriate thing for that. Would you mind elaborating on the Mona Lisa treatment? I have not heard of it, and I would be interested to hear your experience and whether it is helped.", "How to beat BXO First I want to say that this disease can take a long time to cure, so patience is key. I had it for around 2 years (early 20's male). This also applies to LS for females.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got BXO when I was the most depressed in my life. I was on the verge of killing myself. It started in the foreskin and then moved to the meatus. Here is how I managed to cure myself of this horrible disease. Keep in mind also, that it can come back. You can look at BXO as either a blessing or a curse. I got BXO when I hit rock bottom. Eventually I said enough is enough and wanted to cure it. It forced me to improve my life overall drastically. My mother also got Stage 3 Ovarian cancer when she was very depressed. I think so many of these diseases happen in these very low mental and emotional states. Mental and emotional well being is key.\n\nBefore I go into what I did I want to say this first.\n\nThere is no modern medicine cure for BXO. Steroids only treat the problem and circumcision can only be useful when it has not spread past the foreskin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is what I did:\n\n **First is emotional and mental well being.** Something like this is not always easy to improve, but here is what I did to improve it seemingly overnight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STOP MASTURBATING.** \n\nIf you do not, good for you and keep it that way. Porn/Masturbating is incredibly dangerous for your mind and overall well being. I have been addicted to it for over 10 years and masturbated almost 1-3 times every day. I dropped the porn and masturbation and mentally I was way different. Way more confidence, less depression/anxiety. Desire to exercise more, desire to get out in the world more. And of course, less inflammation on your skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intermittent fasting** \n\n Fasting is seen as taboo in the western world. Many people do not practice it. Will not people do realize is, it is a natural process for the human body that must be practiced. A Japanese scientist won the noble peace prize in 2016 for his work on discovering autophagy. Autophagy occurs in high intensity exercise and fasting. This is the process of your body cleaning your body of toxins and reducing inflammation. There are numerous proven benefits of autophagy including neurogenesis, I will leave it to you to research it yourself.\n\nDry fasting is also important, since it increases autophagy more than intermittent fasting. Be careful with these 72 hour dry fasts though, make sure you have enough fat on you, and stay at home. Look up the \"Snake Diet\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Diet**:\n\n My diet is the keto diet. Absolutely no sugar at all, and less than 20g carbs a day. It is a high fat, medium protein low carb diet. Never felt better in my life. You would think without having carbs you would have no energy. Once you are keto adapted (burning fat instead of sugar for energy, and then eventually ketones) you will have way more energy, and feel less hungry. This is why it works so well with intermittent fasting. Many doctors swear by this diet/lifestyle to  HEAVILY reduce inflammation which is the root cause of many diseases. I exercise with cardio/weights everyday and I am gaining muscle faster than ever have before. This is caused by HGH (human growth hormone) When you fast, your HGH increases by almost 2000%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also eat only one meal a day (OMAD). But you do not have to do that. Start slow with 16 hours fasting and a 8 hour window of eating, eventually moving to 18/6 and than OMAD if you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Topical Treatments:**\n\nI applied coconut oil to help stretch because BXO gave me phimosis. I then applied DSMO and Tea Tree Oil. Now, these are incredibly potent depending on the purity. The role of DSMO is to penetrate the skin so the TTO can go deep and work it is magic. I mixed the DSMO with coconout oil/TTO. I applied DSMO directly for a few days and the pain/swelling was unbearable for the most part. DILUTE IT. I will say this though, when I applied the DSMO directly, my skin started shredding in a week heavily. New, pink skin was coming out. BE CAREFUL. This cannot be stressed enough. This is seriously powerful shit. TAKE IT SLOW.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Supplements:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst you have to make sure your getting all of your macro/micro nutrients. Make sure all the basic things like Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium are all being met. These, including vitamins, are crucial. You can get all of this from your Keto diet if you eat enough greens/eating high quality grass fed meat and high quality wild caught fish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only real supplements I take would be turkey tail mushrooms for immune support and fish oil. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a horrible disease that has plagued my life with depression, anxiety and basically destroyed my social life. Again, it is how you look at it. You can either treat it with steroids for the rest of your life or improve your life overall drastically and beat it. Like I said before, you can look at it as either a blessing in disguise or a curse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinal note; HAVE PATIENCE. This will not be cured in weeks or months if you had it for a while. It can take years. But if you practice all of these methods your chances will be way higher than someone who is just using one method. COMBINE them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoodluck and remember, this is not some sort of fatal/incurable disease because modern medicine does not have a cure for it. The healing resides in yourself. Take control of your life and discover the new possibilities that await you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; Fantastic post.  I had seen some of this before (Tea Tree Oil), but not all of it.  \n\nFrankly, I have found that once you can get past phimosis, wearing it retracted helps a lot.  I have also started on topical steroids that seem to work extremely well.  Once past the initial regular application to knock it back, I found I need to apply 1-2 times a week to keep things in check. This is a good resource for conservative treatment: ( I do not mean to be that guy, but would not this approach just be considered an alternate form of treatment, rather than a cure? I mean, if you stop your Keto diet and other supplements will not your symptoms just return? The same way someone who uses topical steroids would?  Thanks a lot for this post, you definitely confirmed many of the things I had suspected was the case (keeping dry, cutting out carbs, not eating until you feel stuffed). I never had the discipline to go all the way, but I think this will give me the motivation to make some serious changes.\n\nFinding and sticking with the correct diet is absolutely the most difficult part for me, especially when eating and snacking becomes a coping mechanism. On top of my LS, I have to be careful not to wind up underweight again, which is what happened the last time I cut out carbs.\n\nI find the urge to snack extremely difficult to overcome. I think I will take it slow to start with, and instead try coming up with some low carb staple foods which I can eat whenever I get a craving. I was thinking fish pie with a cauliflower &amp; butternut squash mash, as well as substituting regular rice with cauliflower rice. Hopefully my food cravings will diminish on their own if I aim for lower carb meals from now on. Snacking throughout the day is one of the worst things you can do for your body. Fasting is a natural process that the body most go through to undergo autophagy and numerous other benefits. If you combine Keto+Intermittent fasting your hunger will completely subside, since your body will be adapted to burning dietary fat and your own fat.\n\nIt is hard at first to fast, but once you get used to it, you will never go back to your old eating habits. This diet/lifestyle requires high quality food. But since you will be eating less in general, you will save money. Start out with 18/6. It is 18 hours of fasting followed by a 6 hour eating window. Take it slow you can even do 16/8, but 18/6 is where autophagy really starts to kick in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; I find I get some relief from fasting occasionally, I sometimes take MCT oil and fish oil in the morning to help me get through until about 4-5pm before having my first proper meal, however since I need to keep an eye on my weight, I will have to experiment and find a way to incorperate enough calories into my diet in order to still be able to gain a little muscle.\n\nI have a very small stomach, so cramming in a huge number of calories in a 6 hour window sounds a bit difficult. An 8 hour eating window certainly sounds a bit more manageable, with 2 or 3 moderately sized high-fat / medium-protein meals.\n\nThanks for the advice, it will be interesting to see how much my LS improves after implementing some of these changes. I think I just found my cure. I just wanted to comment on this post. I hope this helps others. I have had this condition for about two years. Diagnosis was confirmed by two urologists in two different states. I would be so miserable as it would come and go. I even got Clobetasol cream that I was too scared to use. I finally discovered what my problem was. BXO seems to be caused by an irritant. Mine was caused by soap/ body wash that was absorbed into my pubic hair after each shower which would be entangled on the tip of my penis. I discovered they through trial and error. Now I make sure that I use a handheld shower head and rinse the area very thoroughly. I have not had issues for over a month since I have been doing this. I truly believe that in my case it was the soap absorbed in the hair irritating the penis for years and the damage became cumulative causing issues. In other cases it could be the laundry detergent in the underwear etc.  I think I just found my cure. I just wanted to comment on this post. I hope this helps others.

The top half close to the tip is discoloured. The white lesion is in in the middle and bottom half is normal pink.\n\nSkin is has become a lot dryer too Sounds very similar to what I had. I have heard of creme complete too with good success but never tried it. Honestly the biggest thing that helped was diet and intermittent fasting. Also ointments helped like the DSMO. When I put on the DSMO with TTO, my skin would start peeling the next day with new healthy pink skin. If you decide to try it, read the forums about it. \n\nAlso, be careful with DSMO. It is use is to penetrate the skin and carry something like TTO deep in the skin. So make sure when you use it, you are in a clean environment. People using DSMO+TTO along with other oils on this ( had great success.\n\nAlso I am curious, are you diabetic, pre diabetic or have hypoglycemia?\n\n&amp;#x200B; Thanks for the post. Were you using low quality soap that had chemical irritants in it? How was your skin beforehand, hard and white with low elasticity?  I had no other issues like diabetes that would have lead to this mate.\n\nWhen the white lesions occured i was under a severely stressful period and on going mental trauma. The white lesions appeared and then started growing. \n\nUsed the steroid cream and it went away and came back straight away once that stopped. And the discolouration started occuring.\n\nI have really changed my diet. I used to eat meat but now im a vegetarian and trying to be as much vegan as possible. \n\nIn terms of sugars ive cut down so much but im finding it hard to completelt cut it out with added sugars in my cereals for example\n\nWhen you say decide to buy it, and reading forums, do you mean the DSMO or cream complete?\n\nWould you apply DSMO with TTO twice a day?\n\nSorry for the long message, really want to curee this shit\n\nThanks Hey, Tiredoflife123456, just a quick heads-up:  \n**occured** is actually spelled **occurred**. You can remember it by **two cs, two rs**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:  \nYour spelling hints are really shitty because they are all essentially \"remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word\".\n\nAnd your fucking delete function does not work. You are useless.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\n( Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up:\nI learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it is mnemonics are useless,\nand 'one lot' is it is most useful one, it is just here to help. This is like screaming at\nsomeone for trying to rescue kittens, because they annoyed you while doing that. (But really CMB get some quiality mnemonics)\n\nI do agree with your idea of holding reddit for hostage by spambots though, while it might be a bit ineffective.\n\nHave a nice day! You can apply it twice a day. The forum I linked specifically talked about DSMO+TTO. Just be warned, if you put too much DSMO your shit will swell up fast and it will be really fucking painful. I diluted it with coconut oil, but  I had better results with putting it directly on the skin. Best way to do it is to listen to your body.\n\nAvoid sugars at all cost. (even fruit, but having some berries like blueberries are not that bad) Sugar causes inflammation in the body. (BXO stems from chronic inflammation, along with many other diseases) This is why intermittent fasting is also very important, it reduces inflammation in the body and facilitates autophagy in the cells. Stay away from garbage food like cereal. Avoiding meat you are missing critical nutrients your body needs, but I will not get into that. If you have European genetics you should limit your carb intake and keep sugar to an absolute minimum. Basically you have to prepare all of your meals, no processed foods at all. The average American diet is so incredibly backwards and dangerous to the body it is comical at this point. Sorry to be a pain but dl you mind if i contact you elsewhere with qs? If u have an email or fb messenger?\n\nMy diet consists of around 6 - 7 fruit and vegetables a day. Didnt think natural sugars would be a problem?\n\nLet me know if i can chat elsewhere pleass\n\nReally appreciate your help You can DM me on here, I do not use social media much. What vegetables and fruit are you eating? Natural sugars are still sugars that can cause inflammation. Berries for example, are very good for you, but in moderation of course. That is not to say you have to be a paranoid freak about what you eat, but nutrition and diet is incredibly important with dealing with diseases and inflammation. Once you limit your carb intake and sugar intake and replace them with healthy fats and protein, your cravings for carbs and sugar will go away.\n\n BXO can be on the glans yes. It is good that it is not on your foreskin. One of the key things with BXO is keeping the area dry. If you can, retract your foreskin as much as possible and let that shit dry out. I usually have strawberries, orange, banana, dates, blueberries daily\n\nIve just purchased cream complete, would it be safe to put this on glans?\n\nAlso your method of dsmo and tto, would that be safe on the glans too? Or did you have LS on the foreskin not glans? Did you know that if you put a banana in the refrigerator, the peel will turn dark brown or black, but it will not affect the fruit inside.  \n ***  \n ^^I am&amp;#32;a&amp;#32;Bot&amp;#32;*bleep*&amp;#32;*bloop*&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;( I was not using low quality soap.

IT suddenly STOPPED working, i was super inflammed and hurt like hell , plus im always having to struggle to get urine out , i know we all have different Symptoms at once which is why its HARD for a DR to Understand Us ive gone through it all this post is influenced by Demanding treatment Demanding a 2nd opinion and its been hell when a DR tells you he cant help BUT THIS MY SAVE YOU SOME TIME. \n\nMYBERTRIQ) PEE HOLDER (sounds scary to some of us because we try to empty , this might vary but im my opinion try it because fuck anything is better then what we are going through right guys? It makes it me use more force to pee. but i like it because i know pee is not being Stuck inside my penis (you know how it feels) that causes inflamation i know it so if this pill helps me keep that passage way clear then its worth it . but i still feel uncomfortable and it took 2 days to get used to inside but this COMBO\n\n(PRESIDONE) A STRONG ORAL STERIOD WORKED MAGIC. (mind you not prescribed by my urinologist, that quak was just dumping cream on the problem ) i didnt go to another urinologist , i did and had No luck. my Urgent care provider who didnt understand my problem but knew these meds might help and took a chance, I HAD TO BE SEEN 100 TIMES BEFORE THEN ONLY IN A STATE OF AGONY DID I RECEIVE THESE MEDS !

Dont be scared DO NOT UNDERPLAY YOUR SYMPTOMS NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY. So you are doing five days of prednisone before tapering down? And what is this other product you use?  I am curious to hear more about what you and your doctors are doing and your results both currently and in the future. \n\nI was on prednisone for months for a full body rash I had a few years before my LS symptoms developed on my penis (The rash seemed like poison oak at first, but poison oak doesnt tend to last 6+months over the entire body.) I had developed LS on my backside already but I didnt know about LS at the time and had suspected parasites as the cause of my \"nocturnal pruritus ani\" and other symptoms back there.  \n\nAnyway, prednisone can definitely work wonders to cover up all kinds of symptoms (with certain side like gaining water weight in the face) but it does not usually do much to address the underlying cause of whatever it is treating.  And the rebound effects when you stop using it can be worse than the effects you were trying to treat.  That was the case for me at least.  Prednisone is not the kind of drug you want to take long term.. my doctors kept me on it for like 6 months and that was probably way longer than I should have been taking it regularly like I was.\n\nBE EXTRA CAUTIOUS AND SLOW when tapering down the dosage with that stuff. Dont stop using it abruptly. I just got to throw in that word of caution.\n\n\nI hate to say it, but the peace you are finding from the prednisone may just be temporary relief.  I hope for the best for you though! Thymosin Alpha cured mine. I took injections 2x day for 10 days and it was gone. Thymosin is a peptide used for Auto Immune Functuon. LS is an Autoimmune Disease so makes sense it would work. How long have you been cured? I took it in March of this yr. I have had nothing since then. Ok, so I saw your post from 4 months ago.. did you start taking the other hormones at the same time? Are you still taking anything else? And can I ask your gender?.. since it relates to the topic at hand.  I noticed you said they prescribed you testosterone and you also mentioned a husband.  I dnt want to make any assumptions or judgements.  Just trying to learn.\n\nI think I have seen women on here talking about benefitting from taking estrogen for LS but I dont think I have seen anything about male hormones in relation to LS. I started the Thymosin thr same time I started the Testosterone and Progesterone. I stopped taking both of those for a bit due to severe acne. I am back on them  now at a lower dosage.\nIt was def the Thynosin. I am also female and do not take Estrogen. Thanks a lot for sharing.  That Is pretty awesome that you have had lasting improvement from a single short term treatment.  Sorry I have so many questions..  So did it reverse any physical changes to your skin like pigment loss or skin shrinkage/fusing? So I had alot of cuts and tears along with Shiney white patches on my Labia. All have gone. The tears healed up in 3 days.  The white area was very tough skin but that went back to normal after the treatment. Wow! So cool! Thanks for all the info.  Do you know if  any other LS patients have tried this? I do not.. it was a fluke tbh. The company I went through for Bio Identicle Hormones suggested I take Thymosin for a \"reset and Immune Boost\". I am just thankful it worked for my LS. Ya, that is so neat! Kind Of odd that nobody else in this forum seems remotely interested in even learning enough about a new treatment to consider trying it. Yeh I have had ppl question whether it is a legit cure lol. I am not a Dr, but if I was on this channel and someone said it cured them I would at least ask some questions like you have to find out if it is worth trying. It cost me I think $400 ita cured me for 4mths. If I have to take it 2x yr I will.\n\nI try to let most ppl know when they post that it worked for me. Have had maybe 4ppl ask questions, one being a person who basically said they needed proof lol. Pretty sure I said that the proof was that it cured me. Haha.\n\nLmk if you have any other questions. If you look up Thymosin Alpha and read whet it is used for it absolutely makes sense that it would cure LS.\nI have also heard that the powers that be are trying to get TA taken off the market. So maybe look into it soon if you want to try it. yes im on a 5 day taper im scared because today is my last day taking the Steriod .ive taken NGU tests like for parsites but no avail I fully agree that its Temp but i believe the relief has allowed my body to heal in a good way it wasnt able to before 6 months does seem like a long time .. What did you do after? I got awful rebound effects when i tried to stop prednisone.    I had to spend a lot more time tapering down than the doctors advised.  I was also on it for like 6 months and not just 5 days, so that affected how long I needed for taering down.  \n\n  Eventually I was able to get off the prednisone, but the rash still returned even when I finally finished tapering super slowly.  I ended up getting rid of my memory foam mattress topper that i had started using around the same time as the rash appeared, and I changed all my soaps, laundry detergents, etc..  eventually after about a year the rash healed and six years later now the full body itch is 80-90% gone.  \n\nGood luck! Wow, ok.  Thanks again for sharing all this great info. Hmm I see that there is evidence suggesting that thymosin alpha can help treat Lyme disease also, so that fits in line with the evidence that suggests a link between Lyme and LS.  This is getting more interesting..  I dont really see any journal articles that discuss the use of thynosin alpha in relation to LS or Lyme though. Yeh its an odd area as it seems no one tries it. But what I do not get is if it helps Immune function and LS is an immune issue why are more Dr's not prescribing it. \nWhen I told my guy where I got it from he said that using it for LS made complete sense as it is used to improve your immune system. How did you find out about these injections? What kind of doctor did you have to go to in order to get this done? PeakPerforMax.com\nThey deal in HRT and Hormone health. Mainly for men but they do deal with women too. I had some issue that they thought Thymosin would help reset. So I took it not expecting anything tbh. Within 2 days I said to my husband.. \"This stuff is getting rid of my tears and LS\".\nI went to them as i was sick for days every single month. I had to get all bloodwork done though for thrm to start prescribing anything. I am never sick anymore either. My progesterone was super low. This is what caused the nausea. I took Thymosin basically coz they said it would be a reset for my immune system. How many milligrams was each injection? If you read my comments it does say where I got it from. \nPeakperforMax.com 20 Units", "Flare while using Clobetasol? I am on my 4th week of using Clob daily, I should be using it for another 2 months daily after that. But I am noticing that my burning sensation is not subsiding and my vulva is really dry. My gyno suggest that I use Vaseline - I tried, and my vulva turned a neon red and it made things worse! A shower to get it off helped.\n\nToday I spoke with a doctor at a clinic, as well as a pharmacist and they both agreed that if the Clob is not working, that it could be a skin infection. They have now prescribed me Mupirocin 3x a day for 10 days.\n\nAnyone else have this issue using this strong steroid cream? How long did it take your for symptoms to go away? There have definitely been moments through some days where I feel better, but it is never full relief, and now it feels full blown these past few days. Should not the Clob be settling it? Docs are also stumped as to why I am so dry, the Clob should apparently be helping with that as well apparently. \n\nIt is hard getting different advice for different people and not having any way to ease the pain.\n\nThanks! I am not an expert\u2014 this is just my experience\u2014 but I found using coconut oil helped moisturize the area and kept it from getting too dry. I did not have an issue with clob in terms of my skin but it is very strong and can definitely cause issues if you put too much of it on. I thought that vaseline was used to trap moisture in, not to moisturize (meaning you would moisturize first with coconut oil for example and then put vaseline over it) but I might be wrong about that. I am so sorry you have possible skin infection, that sounds very painful. I know how frustrating LS is, I have been dealing with a flare up the past week and it is been hell. Hang in there, you will feel better soon hopefully the medicine starts working for your skin! Thank you so much. I have been hesitant in trying the coconut oil, but what you say makes total sense! I will definitely try it. I feel like I have about a billion creams and whatnot, but I guess it will take some trial and error. I am sort of hoping it is just a skin infection rather than LS, as I am waiting for biopsy results. I have dealt with a lot of wrong doctors lately, so I will never fully trust them. \n\nHow long did it take for the Clob to start working in your initial treatment? Did you flare during it, considering it is supposed to be taken continuously? \n\nI hope your flare goes away sooner than later and you also feel better. \ud83d\udc95 I am wondering if you may be having a reaction to the clobetasol? When I used it, it made my skin burn even more and actually caused dryness. I am now using a dif steroid cream and its helping and does not burn. I would maybe ask your doc to switch to a different steroid cream? I also could not use Clobetasol. It burns really bad and I have to shower to get it off. It is way too strong for me. I tried other creams that did the same. The only cream I use and swear by is Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1%. It helps calm the itch within minutes. I put it in the morning and night during flare ups. I only have to use it for 2 weeks and the flare up usually goes away. I was also told by my OBGYN that coconut oil is safe to use to keep things moisturized and to help with cracks and cuts. Hope this helps!! I spoke to my gyno and also thought I would be having a reaction to the clob, she suggested going down to a lower dose but strongly advised against it because it would not treat it properly. And because it does not irritate me when I apply it, she figured it could not be the issue. Did it irritate you while you applied it? I also feel like the discomfort comes and goes, which apparently is not normal either. Thank you! Though the clob does not irritate me on application. I feel like it is fine when I apply it before bed, and in the morning I am in discomfort again and throughout the day til I can apply it again. Hmm, it didnt really irritate me while I applied it, usually the morning after I applied it at night. My discomfort kind of comes and goes too bit idk if that is because I only notice it more sometimes or if it is actually getting worse or better. I am using betamethasone dipropionate now instead of clob for about a week and there does seem to be a lot less irritation for me than the clob. Maybe you could try that? I also got diagnosed and treated by a dermatologist. After a year of gynos misdiagnosing me and treating me for the wrong thing. Have you seen a dermatologist for it? I went to pick up the other ointment my gyno prescribed me, but today I am feeling a bit better. A gyno diagnosed me and I had a biopsy done 2 weeks ago, I should have results in 4 weeks. No one would refer me to a dermatologist until I had the biopsy results. I definitely want to find someone who knows more about this, because I feel like my gyno pretends she does. Thank you! Ahhhh okay. I totally get that, I hope you can find a good dermatologist who is a bit more knowledgeable and can help. Good luck! Betnovate irritated me. The day I started using it, it felt fine initially but sex (or even a finger) caused immediate and severe burning. Was using 2x a day. The itch gradually got better over a week, so i reduced to 1x a day, then it got worse. So I stepped up to 2x a day and it continued to get worse and I had this awful weird pain develop around my clit hood. Stopped it, the weird clit pain disappeared, the itch was up and down but always there. The burning during sex is still there 2 months later but its a lot better.\n\nThen I tried mometasone ointment which felt like I would rubbed chilli over my bits and got worse over a few minutes, had to run to the shower immediately lol.\n\nThen I tried mometasone cream which burns on application but the itching is 99% better. \n\nKeep trying different ones until you find one that works. I am allergic to coconut oil (as well as baby oil, olive oil, semen, virtually every lube lol). I only had dryness once so applied a little \"yes oil based\" from the tube which helped. It is an amazing lube for sex and has basically enabled me to have a sex life again since it helps with sensation, does not dry out quickly like the only water based lube I am not allergic to and can be used as a moisturiser for people with LS. Oh you poor thing! Thanks for sharing and o hope you are doing well these days! Getting there thanks, still waiting for my hospital appointment and diagnosis \ud83d\ude44 i hope you are feeling better soon. Vaseline can also be an irritant down there too. Ohhh yes Vaseline was definitely a horrible idea! \nI am 3 weeks away from my biopsy results. The doc that did my biopsy just prescribed me estrogen cream to use inter-vaginally and I am a little hesitant. My gyno was against it, so I am a little concerned to be inserting hormones in there when I am on BC already and I am only 32. I thought it would be more of a topical thing. Do not hesitate to keep in touch, id love to hear about your diagnosis and how you are doing! Hang in there! Hmm not sure about that. Be careful with the antibiotics, they may well cause thrush. If so, take oral anti fungals as the cream can irritate your skin. Doesnt sound like an infection though, it it is not red/hot/swollen/pus etc I found that the antibiotics worked well, but then stopped before the 10 days. I have taken numerous anti fungal pills this year as all the docs thought it was yeast, with no success and now countless negative results. My vulva is very much so red, and I have been using the steroid ointment for over a month now with on and off redness and discomfort. Supposedly there should be no redness and burning at all by now. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Maybe the steroid is too strong? I read each time you go up in potency it gets 5x stronger. So clob would be 25x stronger than a steroid 2 classes down. The gyno told me that going to a different/lower dose would be a bad idea. I guess it is just a matter of me finding a second opinion once I get my biopsy results. In a study mometasone was found to be as effective as clob, that could be worth a try, both ointment and cream see which suits you best? also only apply once a day as 2x a day is not any more effective. For the dryness have you tried a moisturiser, daily? Theres lots of different ones. Yes oil based in the tube works for me, or you could use an emollient like E45, some people get on with coconut oil (I am allergic), or emuaid (couple of reports of people being sensitive to it and I am sensitive to everything so havent tried it). I have been using coconut oil and it seems to help a bit. Unfortunately it irritates my partner though and the lube we use just gets all sticky. That was a good thing about the oil, it did not dry up and get sticky! I am still hesitant about using the estrogen cream intervaginally though. Curious if it is something your doc ever recommended? Is estrogen cream a common thing women with LS use? Yeah I am going to see if I can see someone else. My gyno was even like \u201coh did I give you the ointment or the cream \u2014 the cream is an irritant and I accidentally gave it to some people and cannot remember who\u201d... ha! I am not sure sorry. My GP does not know anything about LS and I am still waiting to see a specialist. Yes oil based doesnt get sticky, it is been amazing for us. I would look at studies re estrogen cream, I am sure it said there was not evidence for using it when I looked before. That is shocking! My gp gave me fucibet cream which has antibiotic which I dont need, the steroid also isnt strong enough. It ended up causing more itching! Yes I recall an article about it not having effectiveness either, or it only being used in post menopausal women. I hope you get to see a specialist soon! Have you had a biopsy? I have an appointment for January- no, only the specialist would be able to do that here. Hope you are  feeling better soon \ud83d\ude0a", "Bf is put off by LS So my bf is well endowed and sex has been an issue because I am quite small down there (even before LS). With lube and patience, we have managed to have sex, but it is always been a hit or miss for me in terms of pleasure.\n\nA few months ago, I read up more on LS and realised I have most of the symptoms. I told him about this and assured him it is not contagious nor is it bacterial, but most likely an autoimmune condition. Recently I noticed that he is not into sex, and he revealed it is because he looked up LS and was put off my what google images showed him. \n\nI told him mine is not that severe and it is basically like having dry skin in a certain area and that is basically it, but he is still put off. I find the whole thing quite immature, especially since he has had dermatitis on his hands before and it was not pretty (but I was not that fazed).\n\nHe is generally quite prissy about things and is a bit of a germaphobe so it is in line with his personality, but I am still peeved. Any advice? Dump him Try to be patient with him. Maybe he can go to a doctor with you so the doc can explain it to him? Does he go to a therapist because of his germophobia? If not, he should consider it. No he does not. I have suggested it but he is convinced that therapists are there just to make you feel bad about your issues, which is BS As a guy with ls and who has a lot of discoloration, if someone is ever put off by my sex organs because of a disease I cannot control, I will dump them in a second. It is immature and wrong on so many levels Well then you only need to ask yourself one question: would you rather live with someone who thinks like that and resents you for an autoimmune disorder you can do nothing about and which is not your fault or would you rather break up with him and hope to find someone who can love you the way you are? I do not know his side of the story, maybe he just needs some time to understand and adjust\u2026 HOWEVER, if he does NOT make you feel supported, does not try to understand you really need to reevaluate if this is somebody you want to spend your life with. \n\nHaving this disease is both physically and mentally tough, having a great sex life is possible but it is going to take communication and understanding. There is nothing to be ashamed about with having LS. It is not a choice. \n\nI can tell you that during the beginning of my first flare my boyfriend was not understanding and he thought I was making things up because he could not see anything. Once things turned white and the first time I tore during sex he finally started to understanding, he apologized and we are doing much better now. Men sometimes take longer to understand women\u2019s feelings (I am generalizing, not all) but if he does not show steps in the right direction\u2026. You deserve better. \n\nThis is not going to be the first misunderstanding/disagreement you will have as a partner. Life only gets harder, and you need to know that your partner is someone who listens, is willing to change, and will support you. Use this as an opportunity to show you whether he can be that, if not.. plenty of fish in the sea. Throw the whole man out.\n\nETA: this condition can often require much patience and understanding from your partner(s). If you are not getting it now, who is to say it would be offered when you are having a particularly nasty flare? Or you are feeling \u201cgross\u201d or undesirable because of it? You said it yourself- the whole thing is quite immature. There are LS havers I know from online who have very understanding partners. My vulva is both white and brown because of my LS and my partners have never cared! I was open and communicated about my pain to my ex. It never put him off of sex but I did notice that he was not willing to be gentle. We clashed there, and for other reasons, we decided to end things. I am glad this breakup happened because I know I can find a partner who is attentive. It is so easy to blame yourself with this, but dude we did NOTHING to cause this. And we are worthy of love and pleasure!\n\nMy advice: Be open about your observations. Be open about your feelings. I would talk about it, but also stand firm because your pleasure matters too! This is not an easy convo but you owe it to yourself to find someone who you are compatible with. \nYou cannot be with someone who expects you to have a porn star vulva. Most of us do not to begin with (LS or not)! You are not less sexy because of it so please do not think that. yeah, that is not cool. it sounds like you have told him the gist of what LS involves and managed to not act icky about his skin stuff. so the least he could do is extend the same amount of nonjudgmental support and love your way, regardless of personal hangups. in general, we have no idea how bad LS might get or any other health issues in our future for that matter, and since they are out of our control, they should never be a reason to make someone feel insecure or unwanted. as partners, you are supposed to help each other navigate this stuff and feel great and sexy--even when you are dealing with a condition that makes you feel not-so-sexy sometimes. LS can already make you feel so bad and stigmatized on your own. the last thing you need is your partner's response to it making it worse.\n\ni do not know how long you have been together, how much you have invested in this relationship, or if this is a part of a pattern of behavior, so it is hard to give advice on what you should do next. if i were in your shoes, and i have had similar partners, i would ask myself: is this \\*just one thing\\* he is being an asshole about because of his germaphobiness, something we can navigate together with a serious conversation, or has he shown me that he is inflexible or makes me feel bad in other ways? \n\nat this point, he is actively refrained from sex and told you it is because he is put off by images of LS and by extension... your own condition and body. as you have said, that is immature. it is also really disrespectful. unless he is willing to see where he is been offensive and hurtful, offer a meaningful apology, and make up for it with his words and actions, i agree with other posters--you can do better! Thanks for the advice everyone! I will just wait it out and see if he understands the situation over time I would talk to him about how his behavior is making you feel. And if he does not understand that, dump him.  You have no control over that...I understand maybe he is not really aware of what it is that is okay like someone said he could go to the doctors with you so they could explain it to him. Maybe give him a bit of time...BUT if he is not willing to do that I mean...you deserve to feel wanted, supported, accepted and comfortable within the relationship. I feel like he is honestly doing the opposite of that. That is what being in a relationship is all about (being there for eachother) and unfortunately if he cannot give you support I would not stay with him. Your partner should make you feel sexy, not put you down and refuse sex because of a condition you have no control over!! You deserve someone who will accept you for who you are and that is willing to take the time to understand you better and understand your condition better! You deserve so much more than that girl...\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 I hope you know that you are beautiful and sexy as hell and any man you are dating should make you feel that way !!!! Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0fthis made me smile In my journey, I am leaving behind anyone and anything that is not conducive to my healing. \ud83d\udc9b", "I think I have this Hi, \nI have been dealing with an undiagnosed vulvar problem for the past 14 months, which I am starting to suspect is lichen sclerosus. But doctors have not told me that, it is just been a year of mystery and failed treatments. I have seen 5 OBGYN doctors and the last one put me on a steroid ointment (triamcinolone .1%), which has been the only thing that has given me some relief so far. I have been using it for 2 1/2 weeks now and I am not cured at all though. \n\nI have redness and tiny fissures in my vulva and anus. I am also suspecting I have them on the roof of my mouth now too. \n\nI do not have white patches though, which seems to be normal not to have sometimes?  If I go to a doctor and get a biopsy, would lichen sclerosus still be able to be diagnosed from it?\n\nWhich kind of doctor is better for me to see at this point? Does a dermatologist treat vulvar skin conditions like this? I feel so weird going to one to look in that area. Is that normal? \n\nI have also been diagnosed with low risk hpv, since I have some genital warts. Weird thing is, the warts showed up very close to where the fissures now are. Can HPV cause lichen sclerosus to develop?\n\nThank you\n\n\n I cannot answer all your questions, but I can share my experience! I had never heard of LS, and was at the urologist, the second she looked at me she was able to diagnose me by sight. Years later I had a flare and was at a different urologist and she biopsied the lesion just to confirm and it was definitely LS. I do have white patches and some scars. I believe a dermatologist can also determine this as it is a skin disease.  My doctor suspected LS and did a punch biopsy. This could not confirm 100% LS but it was a high probability. This was enough for them to feel comfortable to treat it was LS.  The biopsy will tell for sure. I have the patchy white spots and the occasional fissures. It can be quite painful. I have only seen a OBGYN for it. I am currently using clobetasol 5 nights a week and seeing her every 6 months. There is an increase chance of skin cancer so the appointments do help make sure cancer is not present. Perhaps that is why some see a dermatologist. \nStaying on the clobetasol is very important for me. If I forget a few nights in a row It will start to hurt. Also, too much sexual activity can make it painful. :(  Mine was confirmed via biopsy. Doc thought it was either lichen sclerosis or lichen planus when she first looked at it. You will not know for sure without a biopsy. I went to several obgyns who had no idea, went to one dermatologist who took one look and diagnosed it.  Confirmed with a biopsy. How was it recovering from the biopsy? Did they use a stitch so you did not have an open cut? No stitches, maybe aches for a day but did it quickly in office much like removing a small mole Thank you! I just made an appointment with a dermatologist. I am going on tomorrow and might have a biopsy done. Nervous, but maybe will finally get to the bottom of this.  Thank you! Going in tomorrow to maybe have one done.  Best of luck.  I think I got a numbing shot but if I remember correctly I was holding my codependant newborn through the whole thing and it did not take more then 10 minutes.  After the shot I didnt feel anything then it was sore when it wore off but I did not have to worry about wiping or doing anything.   I think I put some aquaphor healing ointment on it for a few days. Not sure if you have gotten help yet but yes a dermatologist will help you. They can diagnose and treat your symptoms if it is skin related. You mention fissures and that is really common with LS. I have them around my pubis mound, vulva and rectum. 2 and a half weeks is not long enough treatment for LS either. Depending on the treatment plan they have you on, it can take a couple months to see real improvement. \n\nI had to use steroid cream 2 times a day for 2 weeks, then 1 time a day for 2 weeks, then every other day for 2 weeks before I started seeing improvement and now I do it maybe just once a month. ", "normal gyno behavior?! possible cw? \n\ndoes your gyno normally tell you what they are doing right before they do a physical exam? like just give you a heads up that they are about to make physical contact? this one (first appt with her today) did not!! i really appreciate it when they say things like \u201cokay you are going to feel a little pressure\u201d etc. i dont want to go into detail if that would make anyone uncomfortable, but i am curious to know if what this doctor did was normal or not. Mine totally pre-narrates the entire exam experience. And warms their hands too :) my usual gyno always narrates everything she is going to do, but when she was not seeing patients during the pandemic the one i saw at a different office made physical contact without like atleast giving me a heads which was incredibly uncomfortable/ made me feel very weird and that was the last time i ever went back to that office. thankfully im back at my usual gyno! Same. Wow never have had one warm their hands that is next level compassion also what i am wondering (again, sorry if this is tmi) if it is normal for gynecologists to examine your clitoris when you have ls? i am sure my previous gyno looked at it, but never made any direct contact. and i just feel like if you are going to make direct contact with such a sensitive area, you should at least give the patient a heads up? i wonder if she thought i have probably had enough of these exams to the point where i would know the drill? it did not feel like there was ill-intent but i am still uncomfortable and dont think i will go back tbh. I am really sorry to hear you had such an uncomfortable experience with a specialist. But in regard to examining the clitoris, I would say it is at least relevant to examine the clitoris and specifically asess if the clitoris foreskin can move back from the glans clitoris, of if it has adhered completely. As it is something that can present itself with LS just like agglutination of labia and other architectural changes. But your doctor should in the very least have informed you before performing the exam. I had a gyno just shove the speculum in with no k-y jelly a few weeks ago. \ud83d\ude44 I have never even had (successful) penetrative sex before. \nSome doctors are ridiculous. I am sorry you went through that, OP.", "is it healing!? Hi I use a cream that is equal to clob in my country however even though the doctor says that it is healing I feel the opposite. I suffer from itchy feeling, burning after sex, tearing even more than before cream. How can this be possible :( does anyone have this problem? How long have you been using the cream?  Are your symptoms better than before you started treatment? How long has't thee beem using the cream?  art thy symptoms better than ere thee did start treatment?\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Sorry to reply to your question with more questions.  A little more info may help people give better answers though. I have been using for almost a month. But I have to be honest sometimes I forgot to use and skipped one or two day. Mostly my symptoms are okay but not better kind of the same. I recently got diagnosed and believe that I am in the middle of flare. Did you ever notice symptoms getting worse when you forgot to apply for a day or two? I think a month is too soon for certain symptoms to disappear.  Certain symptoms like itch and discomfort might be relieved relatively quickly, but other symptoms that appeard slowly may heal equally slow.  \n\nI would think that after a month you should see your symptoms stop progressing, and maybe some symptoms like itchyness could disappear.. but changes to the skin like pigment loss and shrunken or fused skin heal slowly, if they heal at all.  My skin took about 6 months of topical treatments to get its pigment and stuff back to normal. No actually never seen anything got worse on thoose days. I dont have any symptoms apart from ithcy feeling, tearing during sex and burnin after sex. These were what I had before and have now. However as my gyno said my clit is better now but that was something I did not know before which it starts to be closed.", "Butt crack? Hi guys! I think I may have LS but have not approached doctors yet. This week I have noticed I have got a very uncomfortable, painful red/whiteish line at the top of my butt crack, running to about half way to the anus. I did initially wonder if it was pilonidal sinus, but I do not think it is high enough.\n\nOther symptoms include extremely painful sex, skin ripping, dryness, and also whiter patches on labia.\n\nHas anyone else had the butt crack bit? Yes I did although it was not a line just a really itchy patch. It responded to the steroid cream. If you are having white patches definitely go to the Dr and get treated Yes! I have confirmed LS around my perineum and anus along with labia. Yes I have it all the way from the little dimple at the back end of my crack all the way to my clitoral hood. I have it around my anus and penis. Do you apply the steroid cream on the crack? I was diagnosed but I feel like my doc missed looking at me in all areas. I just noticed I have a red itchy line from my back into my crack as well. Yep.  I apply to the entire area where I suffer itching, burning, and/or pain from the LS.  I have got a small spot on my leg that I treat, too. I am curious to know if you have seen a doc and gotten answers? Saw gynae last week but they said they could not see anything. Woke up the day after with awful sores everywhere, skin nearby looked shiny (?). So I have booked another GP appointment to ask for a referral to dermatology. Glad to hear you are keeping on with this! I hope you can get answers soon! I had a biopsy done and they said likely eczema in the end.", "women with LS &amp; bath bombs! Just wondering what women with LS do about bath bombs! Specifically ones from Lush, I have used them since forever but since being diagnosed i am hesitant! any advice would be amazing :) I really love the Lush bath bombs but sadly, they really irritated me and led to a flare-up. Instead, I opted for some other Lush products that maybe reminded me of my favorite scents or experiences. \n\nYour experience may be different, of course! Nope, do not use.  Check out   \n\n\n( I wouldnt reccomend. They can be quite irritating. And cause a flare up.", "Low estrogen and LS? Does anyone have low estrogen and LS? Have you undergone estrogen cream or some type of replacement and if so has the helped with dryness and itchiness? My wife has had a hysterectomy and yes estrogen cream helps her dryness. She doesnt have LS but I do. I do not think I have low estrogen (have not gotten my levels check in awhile but it was not low last time). I use clobetasol as maintenance and for flares and every other day (works out to be 3x/wk) I use estradiol cream, it helps with tearing during intercourse and dryness. Low estrogen can cause a condition called Atrophic Vaginitis that has some symptoms in common with Lichen in the vagina/vulva - dryness, thinning/fragile skin and pretty much everything that comes along with that (bleeding, pain during sex, ect) and it is entirely possible to have both. Estrogen can help with dryness for sure, but if your problem is LS *without* low estrogen levels it is kind of a crap shoot as to if it will or not.\n\nIt is definitely something that is been tried for LS since it is more common in post-menopausal women. Testosterone too with pretty limited improvement but estrogen suppositories/cream are pretty accessible and not too expensive so it is totally worth trying and should be fine to try even if your estrogen levels are normal (limited systemic absorption so it should not raise your E levels, though I would talk to your doctor about it if you are on hormonal birth control). I suspect I have low estrogen as I have had other symptoms of low estrogen since getting covid and then even moreso since the second covid jab. Getting them tested in 10 days so I will report back when I get the results in case it is helpful! I was using clobetasol for 3 months and i still could not have sex, but after i started using estradiol AND clob i was able to in like 2 weeks.", "Vulvodynia? My GP now does not think I have LS, but Vulvodynia. He has put me on 20mg Amytripiline   Which can be used as a pain killer, but so far I am still in pain. I feel very deflated, LS is quite unresearched as it is, but apparently Vulvodynia is even less known. Anyone else been diagnosed with this? I do not know what to do anymore Have you been diagnosed with LS before this doctor? I did a quick look up and I am not a professional obviously, but the  Symptoms of LS seem more varying than vulvodynia (not to say that your diagnosis is easier than LS) i hate that you are in either ball park, especially bc the overlap between the two is one of the worst imo- LS just has alot of trademarks. I guess I am curious how they mixed those up if you have a pervious LS diagnosis. Yeah he said it was LS before, I tried out Clob for a while because I had a tiny purpleish lump under my clitoris and a couple white patches which the ointment cleared up, but I still have pain/aches and irritation down there. I asked him for a biopsy but he said there is no inflamed tissue to do a biopsy on. Thankyou for replying  Of corse. I know it is hard and confusing and we are all out here trying to help and support each other as best we can. I was diagnosed when I was 19 (25F) and they did not take a biopsy bc I had the very discernable figure 8 redness and some white patches. I started having an awful flair and seeing and new gyno (she is wonderful) and she was a bit shocked they did not take a biopsy to be sure bc my symptoms and I had responded well to clob in the past. She was 100% I had LS but for efficacy took one anyway. If you do start having patches or lesions again it may be worth seeing a different doctor or just opting for a biopsy. My doctor taught me alot, but one of my biggest take aways is that IM in charge of MY care. She gave me all my options and explained to me how they worked and what they meant. You have every right to request tests or treatments as a patient. Just to follow up, I was doing some reading and vulvodynia is categorized more as a nerve pain issue in the vagina it is self. LS rarely is in the actual vagina and is not Involved in nerve pain. It also foment have to be one or the other as they are very different conditions. It is very possible you have both (I have seen a fair amount of women that are diagnosed with both). I wish you the best of luck with your journey and care.", "Years down the line, next steps? 25, male, UK. \n\nBit of a long-winded history unfortunately. \n\nI had phimosis which I tried to cure myself for years, no amount of stretching or devices helped. Visited my GP and was told to use moisturiser in addition to stretching (no progress). Was then told to use Hydrocortisone &amp; stretch (no progress). Same again with Betamethasone &amp; stretch (no progress). Found mention of Clobetasol and asked my GP who prescribed it and I got a little bit of progress but nothing close to 'normal. \n\nEventually I got referred to a urologist who took literally 5 seconds to look at it, said \"you need a circumcision\" and ushered me out of the room. I then went back to my GP who told me that they would diagnosed lichen sclerosus and to continue using the Clobetasol and stretching and that unless I get circumcised it is never going to get better. I went back a couple of years later to say nothing had changed, I was still using this steroid cream with very little benefit (more of not getting any worse rather than improving), and my GP basically told me to continue with the cream to stop it from getting any worse.\n\nFast forward to now. About 5-6 years after starting to go to the doctors about my issue. I use Clobetasol 0.05% 4 or 5 times a week. I do not really get any itching, bleeding, cracking or tearing, but I do have some white patches and can feel a little lump of what I assume is scar tissue. Should I have had a biopsy at some stage or is a visual confirmation from a urologist enough to be sure?\n\nI am just a bit stuck. Not sure what I can even do next. Circumcision is not really an option I am willing to consider unless it gets drastically worse, I am already on the only treatment the NHS recognises, and I still have phimosis. Any suggestions? Why do you not want to consider circumcision? It seems like it would solve years of issues. It sucks a lot but also it might change your life, confidence, and sex life in general. Because I like my penis &amp; foreskin, I do not want to go through a permanent surgical procedure for something that is not that detrimental to me. Aside from the fact my foreskin is tight I have an otherwise totally normal penis, my sex life is fine etc. Fair enough. For me I cared a little bit and got cut less which is why I failed to see that point of view, but I understand.\n\nIt seems like keeping things as dry as possible can help a lot You shoumd be under supervision of a dermatologist. At least one visit a year. They are better at recognizing skin changes and possible side effects from clob. I can totally understand your concerns, for me circumcision is not really an option either.I did not really treat my LS for the last 7 years (which is going to change tomorrow, actually), but that 7 years ago I had a hydrocortisone cream and also applied olive oil every morning and tried to stretch my foreskin every day. After 3 weeks or so the phimosis was noticably better. Maybe the oil part is important, IDK, I heard some people/websites suggesting oil-creams, too, like coconut oil etc. In any case: I wish you all the best! :) Sorry for the slow reply - this has never been mentioned to me by anyone really. I have seen two GPs four or five times between them and the urologist for a few minutes but that is about all. \n\nI will probably mention it when I see my doctor about this all again.", "How to stoo white patches occuring or getting bigger Had this for over 1 and a half years and the 2 patches i have, havent changed. But recently say one of the matches extending and getting bigger. How do i stop this Hi, Are your white patches on your vulva?  White patches can be difficult to clear up but even if they do, it can take a long time.  Since you say one of them is getting larger, that would mean the LS is active and needs treatment.  What have you been doing for treatment?  Are you using a topical steroid or other Rx? Have you ever checked out the LS support group here?  \n (", "Do you *actually* have Lichen Sclerosus? Since you are seeing this I assume it is quite likely that you probably have LS, but I have never met/talked to anyone else that also suffers. Be interesting to see. Makes sense for me to start, I suppose.\n\nI have lichen sclerosus, but I am a guy. So it is on, uh, my dick rather than the more common female sufferers. Fairly recently diagnosed, currently undergoing the first attempted treatment and it seems to be going quite well. I was diagnosed with LS about four months ago by a dermatologist. Using the steroid cream, which is working well, but you have to take weeks off and those suck. Im learning my triggers, but with the cream and other basic stuff, I have finally seen improvement after like a year of people telling me I have chronic yeast infections or anything but LS. Fun! Jesus, that is rough. I have not heard of having to take weeks off, but then I was diagnosed by a urologist but actually prescribed steroid cream by my GP so perhaps he was not as clued up :/ Yeah I heard that like a month ago haha and I went to my GP at first, they were misdiagnosing me with all kinds of stuff before the dermatologist. My dermatologist said like 2 weeks on, twice a day, one week off of clobetasol propionate 0.05.... but again, everyone is different, and if you are in a different country, recommendations might be different too. You doing okay? I was diagnosed but was not given follow up. They said cutting back sugar might help. I wake up sometimes catching myself scratching. Tears in the morning that make it painful to urinate. It is not fun. Hmm, I am on the same type but only once per day indefinitely until symptoms are gone and/or I run out of cream. Just have to see I suppose, not had any problems so fingers crossed.\n\nI am doing surprisingly well actually, having tried seemingly everything up until I got the proper diagnosis. Was originally misdiagnosed as phimosis for the longest time. Yeah, LS is pretty rare I guess. My dermatologists nurse didnt even know what LS was, and was super surprised when I was prescribed the cream. Looking on YouTube showed a woman with a giant tube of the cream, and her saying something like if she stops all of her symptoms come back. Googling the cream shows that you are supposed to use a super small amount twice a day, but that is like it. At this point I am just grateful that it is working and hoping that it will continue to work. I just wish that there were more resources, or like any other supplemental treatments for that off week. It is an autoimmune disease that left untreated leads to bad scarring and cancer.  You should be on a steroid ointment twice a day. Find a dermatologist or gynecologist. I have both. There are very few specialists as there are supposedly very few of us that have it. Depending on what you read it is classified as rare or very rare. Some of us think is is under diagnosed and much more common than previously thought.  I was diagnosed back in 09 and could not use the clob ointment, too strong. But the Topicort ointment works great and eventually tapered off of it because using it too long can cause problems and now using Protopic, which works really good. Now i am just on a maintenance routine, using only using if there is a flare. There is also a really good support group,\n I learned so much there that helped my doctor better treat me since this is going to be a lifelong thing. To those of you on clobetasol:\n\n\nHow long did it take for you to notice improval/recovery? This would probably be a good post of its own. Done! No natural remedies.  If you can take an allergy pill, like a claritan sort, it helps some.  I use advil on my very bad days.  I find ointment works better and does not sting like creams do.  When are you going to be leaving China? For at least two years, though I am popping back to the UK for a couple of weeks.   I am late on this one!\n\n I do have Lichen Sclerosus, yes. I have had it for my entire life, I was diagnosed with a biopsy when I was 3. Looking through this subreddit is a little bit worrying for me though, as there is a lot of misinformation. I see a lichen sclerosus specialist regularly. I am late here too, just came looking for a sub.  Experiencing my worst flare in many years, not sure why.\n\nWas diagnosed in or about 2008.  Had the classic tissue-paper figure-eight thing, amazingly obviously under a light.  I am in the US but had a CRAZY hard time getting in to see a gynecologist -- I had not idea this thing existed, just that I had pain, tearing, and itching.  Could only get in to see nurse practitioners, who kept insisting it was yeast and getting nasty when I said it is not (and OMG how micanozole can BURN when things are bad!).   It was awful.\n\nOnce I actually GOT IN to a doctor, she knew immediately what it was and years of suffering was ended in two weeks with the clobetasol.\n\nI have had two kids since and most of that time has been completely clear, but for some reason it is really flared again this year.  Wish I knew why.  Not quite 40, but it is rearranged the bits and is definitely trying to smooth everything away.   LS is BS. Hey! I hope I am not too late to give some support. Have you made an appointment to see a doctor yet with your newest flare-up? Im sorry this is happening to you again.", "New here Hey everyone- I am new to this community (and diagnosis), female/27. I went to a vulvodynia specialist a couple of weeks ago bc that is what I was told I had. I wanted to find alternative treatments to what my main obgyn had given me and get more information. The specialist told me yeah I probably have that too but I have an autoimmune disease that affects my skin. I do not know that she actually stated LS (I was getting a lot of info at once). Before November I had never really experienced intense pain or itching in my every day life and never noticed tears or a problem with my vulva skin before. She told me I had minor changes and some scarring and gave me a steroid ointment RX to use 2-3 times a week. I have used it twice and it seems to help a little. I do not understand why this is just happening now when for 10 years I only ever experienced pain with intercourse. \n\nI am mostly just devastated because with my original diagnosis of vulvodynia I had hope that I would one day get to have pain free sex potentially. I remember thinking \u201cI guess I am one of the lucky ones I can just get surgery hopefully and it will be better\u201d. I really do not know how I can live like this. I tend to catastrophize(?) but I am single and have been for a while. I cannot imagine I will ever find love or be able to have a child (in the traditional sense) if I did want that one day.\n\nI know I am getting ahead of myself, does anyone have any positive stories? Suffered painful sex from my teens to age 30, diagnosed, treated, and LS is usually a total afterthought for me. 41 now. \n\nThere are occasional flares. Steroid cream beats them back in a couple of days. I might have worse pain a few days a year, if I have not been taking care of myself / paying attention to my body. \n\nNo problems with sex when not flared. No problems having babies (and one was nine pounds, one ounce, 42 weeks). \n\nThis is a total bullshit disease, but in my case, the treatment WORKS. I have to pay attention and notice a flare as it starts or it will be worse. But as autoimmune diseases go, this one has not been the end of anything important. It is embarrassing to explain because people assume it is an STD. It sucks because it is hidden and if you wince sitting down or do not want to do something it is hard to say \u201cthere is a big-ass crack in my labia and it fucking hurts\u201d. \n\nBut it is like once or twice a year and only if I let things get out of hand. \n\nClobetasol is my bestest friend in the whole wide world.  It is a simple and very effective treatment. For eleven years, anyway, it is almost entirely a non-issue.  Have to be open with partner if you are flared, and hold off on sex for a few days. \n\nBut in my case at least, that is it. Pretty simple. Still bullshit, but it is an entirely manageable package of bullshit and not a life-ruining load of bullshit. Having peer/partner/family (yes even family meaning sometimes awkward conversations with parents or chosen family) is everything. The important people know more details than they probably wanted to BUT they love me and know to check in... in different ways. Today all I have to do is saying I am feeling overwhelmed or upset because of a flare up, and a friend offers to bring me movie and food or ask if I need out of the house - and they pick somewhere with comfy chairs. It is a tough issue to have without being open. Not everyone needs to know everything. I am not saying that at all. But those who do know, make sure they understand how they can support and what you need. I had a very rough start with multiple years of appointments and no answers. Many years of being told it is \u201cjust\u201d another yeast infection despite symptoms not matching and swabs showing nothing. Many years of crying and depression because it felt like it would never get better. I am not a positive minded person and already have depression and anxiety - so even though I have now had 2 years of feeling better, as soon as I get a flare up or sex hurts more than it did the day before, it is so easy to completely forget about how much better I am doing today than even 2 years ago. You are allowed to feel sorry for yourself. There is nothing wrong with frustration and anger. It is unfair. And it is bullshit you have to go through this. BUT you also need a way to get through those moments. You need a partner or a friend and a plan for yourself that lets you cry/wallow but then move to what will make you feel better physically and emotionally. This is not something you need to do alone although it can be an incredibly isolating experience. This group has helped me so much even with those supports I have already established. \n\nFor treatment methods - I was super skeptical of pelvic Physio - I mean I was told it was a skin condition, what the hell would physio do? Find the right physiotherapist you trust. I found an amazing one that is worth the trek on transit. The sessions work as emotional counselling as well as physical help. Recognizing how I tense and how I hold the tension has helped tremendously. I have dilators that I use at home... helps stretch and relax if you have had a recent flare up. Worst thing you can do is rush into penetrative sex if you are body is not ready. \n\nThe medicated ointments work. Use how your doctor tells you to. I also have a \u201clabial moisturizer\u201d made from cocoa butter and stuff safe for vaginal ph that I use daily - I use body lotion on my legs and arms all the time, why not moisturize there too? My doctor is also great - she said if that works for me that is good but said even less expensive light Vaseline or coconut oil does the same thing. \n\nSleep without panties, when home wear loose boxer shorts or pj pants or nighties (or nothing) or whatever you are comfortable with that breathes.  Very simple salt baths... unscented. I hate baths. But they help. Once a week if I remember or just when everything feels itchy. \n\nThere is lots of different options. Combine scientific medical treatments with self care. But most of all, make sure you have support.  Thank you for such a thoughtful response and taking the time to write it. I really appreciate it. I try to remember that I have had good days/weeks/months in the past, but it is so hard when you are stuck in the moment. I know I am early in treatment, just very impatient and I wish I could date like a normal person! You have got this.", "Underboob Having what at first I thought was a fungal infection under the boobs, now have discovered is actually LS rearing its ugly head. Never had it under my boobs before.\n\nFor anyone else suffering, I am using Clobetesol (US perscription from doc) twice a day on the affected area, I bought gauze 4x4 and I stuff it under my boobs inside my bra and at night I put medicated gold bond powder there. I also used benzocaine spray in the beginning when it was hurting a lot.\n\nThe joys of saggy boobs lol. Do not get old ladies! When I was pregnant I would get a horrible rash under my boobs!!

Very curious to see the results! Done! What is up with the horseback riding question?\n\n(Fwiw, I answered no, but I did used to ride horses as a kid/teen.) Clinically, we see a connection between horseback riding and vulvar LS- it might be related to the friction. Wow, fascinating. Any thoughts on whether that would come on just for a current rider or if it could pop up 5-10 years later? \n\nThank you for studying LS! There is so much we do not know. (Like basically everything, it seems.) Vulvar LS is likely an autoimmune condition, so someone with LS is \u201cpredisposed\u201d but then certain factors can bring out symptoms related to increased inflammation within the skin of that area.  So, horseback riding is not a cause likely, but instead may \u201cuncover\u201d or increase likelihood of developing symptoms.

I will be going to a OBGYN appt next week but I have questions. 1. Is it necessary to have the typical white patches to get diagnosed? Are the white patches due to itching or are they there regardless?  (I do not have them)\n2. Anyone here have PCOS?\n3. Should I go to a dermatologist or OBGYN?\n4. How old were you when you got diagnosed? (I am a female in early 20\u2019s) As I understand it the patches are not needed for dx. Yes to PCOS. \n\nGo to a dermatologist, there are some that specialize in LS. Though I would bring it up to your OBGYN, they may prescribe steroids and refer you to a derm  because they might not be able to take a biopsy and tell you for certain what your diagnosis is.\n\nI found this resource and found it helpful,\n\n Not necessary to have the white patches! Some ladies in my LS support group do not have them but still have confirmed LS. \nI also have PCOS, and my specialist said there is not much of a tie but that hormones somehow contribute to LS flares. There are not many studies on it but from what my Dr. said, patients tend to notice that the week before their periods it gets worse. \nI would see a dermatologist, AND an OBGYN.\nI have been symptomatic for 10 years and was diagnosed last year. Fortunately, was dx during my first flare by obgyn by biopsy. I had treated it at home and online for a presc thinking it was yeast. A competent doc will give you a mirror at exam, show you exactly where to apply medicine, and may take pics as a record. Do not be shocked if you need to go to several docs bc some are clueless. I am umm old. 1.  No. I was diagnosed without white patched. I had lesions/think skin and itching and that is how I was diagnosed. \n2. I do not. \n3. OBGYN to start, they can refer you to a genital dermatologist if necessary. \n4. Female, 34 when I was diagnosed. Just diagnosed. Do not have typical white patches. Mostly redness and a raw feeling like my skin is being rubbed off. Got a positive diagnosis from a biopsy. \n\nMy doctor said it is controversial on who to see. I am seeing a dermatologist anyways, and I see my gynaecologist twice a year already. \n\nNot officially diagnosed with PCOS but my\nDoctors suspect it as I have high testosterone, heavy painful periods, and I do have cysts on my ovaries. \n\nI am 30. Is the biopsy a skin cutting or skin swab? It is a skin cutting, a punch biopsy to be specific. They inject you with anesthetic so you do not feel anything and cut about a 1/4 inch chunk from your skin then stitch it closed. Mine was taken from the labia majora and healed/stitches out a week after.", "Chafing between cheeks Sorry to do two posts so close to each other but I am a bit of a newbie to LS. My question is, I started using emollients a few weeks ago, and what I find is that they tend to melt over the hours and slide between my butt cheeks, which then creates some irritation, almost like the feeling of sweating a lot and getting a prickly rash. Has anyone else experienced this, and if so how did you fix? I do not shave or wax atm because I feel it might irritate the skin. I get this from time to time! I do not have a fix per say but I just make sure that I go to the bathroom and lightly wipe off the excess emollient that is worked it is way between my bum cheeks haha Yes, I have this exact same problem. The squishy feeling is not great. I found that a diaper cream like Desitin (yes, the kind for babies) works a little better. A pea-sized amount works for me for that area- stick to the period panties since the cream can cause some staining (altho honestly there so much downtown ointment action woth LS now all I own are period panties!)", "Traveling With LS Hey all!\n\nI will be traveling internationally shortly, and I wanted to know how everyone handles travel with LS. How do you care for yourself while travelling? How do you pack creams and medicines? Does anyone have any stories?\n\nThanks! Bring probiotics that do not need to be refrigerated! Also drink lots of water Also make sure the cream you have is small enough to carry on so TSA does not take it.  Thank you, I definitely will! That is what I was worried about. My Dr. Prescribed a year's worth of cream and I need a smaller container for it. I am not getting a year's worth of medication confiscated, not thank you My traveling got so much more comfortable when my dermatologist recommended using Vaseline to keep the area moist. And it is easy to get a small travel size version of it. So every time I would go to the bathroom, I applied some (when I am not applying the steroid ointment). \n\nNot sure how often you apply the steroid, but I would apply it in the morning (and put it in my checked bag because the tube was large like yours) and then use the Vaseline until I could get my steroid again.  I think that is a great idea! Thank you! Also try calling your doc and see if they will prescribe a smaller tube. Tell them you are traveling and need a smaller size for carry on. Does not hurt to ask! I just found out recently that I have LS and will be traveling soon too. Luckily I have a smaller tube of ointment that should not get confiscated. I do not know how long your flight or drive is but my dermatologist told me to use CeraVe hydrating cleanser to \u201cwash\u201d up instead of wipes. They come in tiny bottles which can easily fit in your pockets if you needed it to. You can just put a small amount on toilet paper and wipe it on. Do not have to worry about washing it off or anything. It helps keep you moisturized and feel cleansed. If you will be somewhere super hot, maybe avoid underwear if you can so it does not soak up sweat and cause friction. And like someone else mentioned, probiotics! ", "Wanted to share some tips on how I am managing sex with LS :) Hello!! I am 20F. For quick backstory: I lost my virginity at 16 and the guy was rough and it hurt for 2 weeks afterwards. I continued to have 5-6 sexual partners since and it always hurt really fucking bad and I never knew why. The skin at the back of my vagina opening would always rip and bleed. I had no LS symptoms aside from this, but this alone was horrible especially for a 20 year old: \n\nAfter a year and a half going back and forth between treatments (my gyno did not know what was wrong with me just tried a bunch of things) he sent me to a specialist who diagnosed me with LS. I was just diagnosed about 2 months ago. I know sex is a big struggle for people with LS and I have made good progress on making it not suck so I wanted to share what is worked for me. (I just want to mention I am also using proscribed Estradiol and Clabetasol) \n\n1) Positions that put me at a not natural angle are a big nono. This means I cannot do cowgirl/\u201criding\u201d because it will IMMEDIATELY cause me to tear. Kind Of sucks but hurting badly sucks worse. I am still exploring what positions work for me but missionary is a safe go to and so is lying on my back in general. \n\n2) Using tons of lube (but you all know that already) and going slow at the beginning (you probably do that already too lol)\n\n3) this thing called the OhNut. It sounds weird as fuck but it is this rubbery ring set that you can stack and put on a guy penis during penetration. It is been absolutely revolutionary for me in positions like doggie style or others that were painful. It acts as a cushion between your skin and his, and limits how deep he can go if that is a sore spot for you. It DEFINITELY helps with the pain. \n\n4) Weed balm- I know not everyone can get ahold of this but I will apply it to the outer area of my vaginal opening where I have issues a bit before sex. It obviously does not help with tearing but anxiety makes me \u201ctighter\u201d and more tense which = more pain. The THC absorbs super well (be careful not to use too much) because it is a thin mucousy area of the body. It just relaxes the area and helps with anxiety so I am \u201clooser\u201d in general which makes things go more smoothly. \n\n5) Clabetsol ointment vs clabetasol cream. The cream burned and made things so much worse and my gyno said that is a common experience so switching to the ointment formula made all the difference.\n\nI am now starting on taking fish oil regularly to see if that helps. I still tear a bit during sex but it does not hurt during the fact and heals up super fast since it is not nearly as bad as it used to be for me. \n\nI am looking into trying emu oil actually so if anyone reading this has any experience with it I would love to hear how it worked for you :) Emu oil does not heal my tears but makes it feel as though they are not too bad. I get them on and next to my clit so maybe it will work better for you since yours are vaginal and around the vagina. This is so helpful, thanks!  What do you use for lubrication?  And how often are you using the clobetasol and estradiol?", "Is this Lichen Sclerosus (Circumcised Male) any opinion helps thank you Before you read just a NSFW warning there is a link at the bottom of the text to picture of my penis.\n\nSo I am freaking out after a visit to the doctor. I have been dealing with balanitis or irritated penis head for months now and nothing the doctor has given has worked. She now is suspecting LS. The issue is she cannot diagnose it and the skin doctor she referred me to scheduled the appt for December. I am super super scared and freaking out. Symptoms are irritated penis head the head is usually red and around the head too. It also seems like the shaft is lighting around the top and getting some whitish spots. Any opinion would help thank you!\n\n", "LS or something else?  You will need to see a doctor to be diagnosed visually or by biopsy. It could be many things, not necessarily LS. I would look into an OBGYN or dermatologist.", "Does anyone else with LS look red like this?  My gyno visually diagnosed me with LS, and I am curious to know if anyone else looks like this?

Put it on just before going to bed... wear a long nightgown (optional) and nothing else?  Turn off the lights and be uncomfortable in the dark!", "White plaques I have an appointment on Friday with GYN but to get ahead of likely LS diagnosis- is anyone able to scratch or \u201cpeel\u201d the white spots? If I rub a towel to inner labia it can almost rub off the plaque and it is very bright thin white tissue that is removed. I have similar plaques adjacent to my clitoris that I have been able to remove but it seems like they come back. Side note- I bike a lot, could it be more related to biking rather than LS since it peels off? I would not recommend peeling anything off. Sorry that gave me the shivers. Put some A&amp;D ointment on it and peeling could cause some damage. Also wear more of a cotton material especially when biking. That is going to cause damage. Its not plauqe you are rubbing off if you actually have true LS. The white spots are skin. You are rubbing your skin off! I have plaque psoriasis on my labia and groin that does that but ive never had my ls do that. Could you habe psoriasis? Could it be smegma maybe?", "Need help! I have been to the Dr. 3 times now for itching around my vagina and in my butt crack- each time she is diagnosed me as something different. She thought it was a UTI, yeast infection, etc. \ntoday she said she thinks it is lichen sclerosis and prescribed me the clob. \nI do not have any white spots, and I just have a lot of itching, all external. I have read online that the steroid can sometimes make it worse, since it can make your skin thinner. I do not have any ripped skin, I am scared to start using this steroid because I do not want to worsen anything by accident or make my skin weaker. After all, I do not even know if her diagnosis is right. I am really afraid of how to navigate if I do have this and I could use any advice. \nShould I wait and just try something else like aquaphor? Does that help? \nI have another appt scheduled with a different doctor next week to be sure. At the moment I am just scared and do not know what to expect \n(I am 20 and female bodied for reference) Do you have skin thickening? Itching without white patches could be lichen simplex chronicus. Doctors like to rule things out by throwing different drugs at the problem.  Looks like a fungal rash? Dont bother testing for fungus, just try the antifungals and see if they work. (Fungual culture tests can take weeks to perform in the lab, so you can actually find out what is up quicker just by seeing if you react well to an antifungal cream).  If antifungals dont work then they give you antibiotics.. running tests to actually try to concretely identify the problem does not tend to cross their minds untill a few different treatments have been tried and have failed.  That Is just how things work. \n\nAt this point it wouldnt be unreasonable to consider a skin biopsy to get a more concrete diagnosis, but that is not always completely conclusive either.  I think it makes sense to proceed by trying the clobetasol, as your doctor recommended.  Since it sounds like you already basically ruled out the fungal and bacterial issues it makes sense to suspect something else now.   \n\nAt this point, whatever they diagnose you with is probably going to be something that they will treat with clobetasol or some kind of topical steroid.  Vitiligo, lichen sclerosus, livhen simplex, and a whole list of similar things are all treated basically the same way, so a biopsy to pick which one of those things you have is kind of irrelevant once you have ruled out the things that are treated with antifungals and antibiotics..  that is just my 2cents. One last thing you might want to consider trying before you jump to the next treatment your doctor has is to see if you might have developed a new allergy to something in your environment that is causing your symptoms.  Antifungals and antibiotics wont work against an allergic reaction, but steroids can definitely cover up their symptoms. \n\nI got a flare in my LS (or something that seemed like it) a while back after I was in full remission.  The flare turned out to be from suddenly developing some new allergy to something I was using down there and it caused symptoms that sound similar to yours.  For one week I stopped using topical moisturizers down there, and stopped using shower products, lube &amp;condoms and things cleared up.  I slowly reintroduced different replacements for those items one at a time so i could avoid another flare.  I think it was coconut oil that my body suddenly decided it didnt like on my skin for some reason.\n\nAnyway, its an easy thing to try and its fairly risk-free.  And just water can get you cleaner than you think in the shower! Haha. If your dr is correct and it is LS then Clobetasol should not be a problem for you to use. I have mentioned a few times before on other posts that steroids can help thin the thickening LS skin and while steroids do thin skin, it is less common with LS as the LS causes thickening from various things like scarring. \n\nI am not a doctor and I am not qualified to tell you what to do but if ur dr says try Clobetasol then I would maybe give it a go for now and see what ur other dr says. You surely will not have any serious changes or damaged to the skin in such a short space of time. \n\nTry not to worry too much and if the other dr agrees it is LS we are all here to share our wisdom with you and believe me, there is some wonderful advice and tips and tricks from people in this subreddit! You will be in good hands! \n\nAquaphor might be good to keep the area nicely moisturised and it might help itching cos I find I am at my itchiest when my skin is dry down there! \n\nThere is a lot of us around your age, I am 23F and was officially diagnosed a few months ago after years of misdiagnosis and just general dumbfoundedness. Really try not to worry, we have got you! \n\nGood luck with your Drs appointment, let us know how you get on!", "New to reddit and the group here. Hey everybody.   I just joined the LS group here yesterday and made a post about my success with reversing all the symptoms of my LS without using steroid creams.  Anyway, I guess was hoping that I might be able to help other people find releif from their symptoms like I did.  Nobody seems to have noticed my post about it though. \n\nDid I scare everyone away with the length of my post or what? I will even ship out some little jars of my healing salve for the first few people who request them.  For free my friends.  I want to help you all.  This disease can be cured. This cannot be cured. Not many people know about it and are still learning. Sorry, maybe it is just me, but I do not see that post? I see that you have this post and the post about Lyme disease when I click your profile. I would be very interested in your healing methodology though! LS is not curable. It is indeed manageable and can be treated to a point where one may forget they even have it, but the disease process will always be there causing damage, even if one is not having an active flare. There have been studies that have shown use of a steroid ointment is likely important to help lower the incidence of vulvar cancer. \n\nThere is evidence from a recent study that it is also important to use steroids after having surgery to remove vulval Squamous cell\nCarcinoma to reduce the incidence of recurrence:  Say what you want, but I feel pretty \"cured\" since I was able to reverse all the damage from my LS and eleminate all my symptoms. The plant I make my salve from has proven anticanerous effects also by the way. Take 2:\n\nGreetings fellow lichen sclerosus patients. I believe I have discovered a simple new plant-based remedy for treating lichen sclerosus and I have come here to share the good news.\n\n\nWARNING: The plant I use contains chemicals which can potentialy act as MAOIs (or REMAs to be more specific) if they enter the bloodstream in sufficient quantities.\u00a0 However, as I will explain below, my salve does not appear to have MAOI activity with the dosages and delivery methods I used. Still, Please DO NOT use this plant without adequate understanding of what MAOI's do, and please feel free to get more specific info or guidance from me if you intend to use this plant in any way.\n\n\nLast fall I was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus (LS).\u00a0 Fortunatey I caught on\u00a0to the symptoms fairly fast and at the time of diagnosis I had only just begun to experience relatively mild tissue damage and sexual/urinary dysfunction.\u00a0 I did however have all the other classic symptoms like figure 8 shaped pigment loss, pain, itching, shrinking of skin in areas affected by pigment loss, plaque-like raised bumps/growths on skin, and more..\u00a0 It was a pretty scary situation to be in, as I am sure many of you know.\u00a0\n\n\nI was prescribed the standard treatment with topical steroid creams, however after researching them I decided to hold off on the big pharma drugs (I never ended up even picking up the Rx) and instead I began experimenting with using my favorite medicinal plant\u00a0Peganum harmala, in spite of the fact that my searches of the internet revealed no evidence of anyone ever trying to treat LS with\u00a0P. harmala.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nLong story short:\u00a0 I used organic food-grade 190proof ethanol to make an ethanolic tincture of\u00a0P. harmala\u00a0seeds, removed &gt;95% of the ethanol via specialized vacuum-assisted low-temp distillation apparatus to get a full-spectrum\u00a0P. harmala\u00a0extract, then I melted it together with some coconut oil and was able to use the resulting salve ALONE(no other lifestyle/dietary changes or anything)\u00a0to eleminate/reverse ALL of the frightening and uncomfortable symptoms of my LS with the exception of a small patch of skin which has\u00a0not quite\u00a0completely finished regaining all of its pigment\u00a0yet.\u00a0 Improvement in most of my symptoms began within the first week of treatment but the return of normal pigment was a slower process than the others.\n\n\nI mimicked the standard dosing instructions for treating LS with topical steroids by starting with a high frequency of application (once in the morning and once at night) and eventually tapering down the frequency as symptoms improved.\u00a0 I currently usually use it once every few days.\u00a0 \n\nAfter the first few weeks of using my cream twice daily with only positive results I experimented with applying the cream 4 -6 times daily for about a week with no side effects before returning back to the standard dosing schedule.  I also experimented with varrying potencies of the cream and found that too high of a concentration of my harmala extract in the salve(or lack of adequate mixing to distribute the harmala extract into the carrier oil) sometimes resulted in what appeared to be slight skin irritation which caused no discomfort and healed quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough I do not take any medications that could interact with MAOI's I did do some experiments with consuming tyramine heavy meals and caffeine while using overly generous amounts of this salve on my genital region and I experienced no noticeable effects that would indicate MAOI activity of my salve via this delivery method and dosage.\u00a0 I do however still find it necessary to give these special MAOI warnings out of an abundance of caution.\n\n\nBecause of the potential risks of MAOI interactions, it is worth noting that certain areas of the body such as the temples, palms, and soles of the feet are known for being able to absorb things from the skin into the bloodstream much more easily and efficiently than other regions of skin.\u00a0 \n\nMany years ago when I was looking for a better way to treat symptoms of my palmoplantar keratoderma I soaked my feet in an alcohol tincture that I made from P. harmala seeds.\u00a0 About ten minutes or less into my first foot soaking experience I began to feel an undeniably potent and uplifting euphria from the transdermal MAOI activity.\u00a0 \u00a0** If I had foolishly ingested something that has a negative interaction with MAOIs that day then my exerience could have been a very unpleasant and potentially DEADLY one!**\u00a0 \u00a0(side note- the daily harmala foot soaks work great for treating the symptoms of my palmoplantar keratoderma and the euphoric effects were only really strong that first time.)\n\n\nIf anyone made it through all that and is interested in trying to treat their LS with the salve I described above, it is possible to preare it without the use of specialized vacuum-assisted distillation equipment.\u00a0 I simply used the special equipment because I already have it and it made the process much easier and more efficient for me.\u00a0 Using my special equipment also allowed me to easily prepare different small batches of the salve with varying potencies for my experimental purposes.\n\nThe journal article in the link below describes a simple method for preparing a similar harmala salve which can be replicated fairly easily in any kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe part you really want from the journal article is just this:\n\n\n\"product was prepared according to traditional treatise. Thus the plant material (1 kg of the seeds) was macerated in 6 times water (6 L) for 24 hours, boiled till the half of the water evaporated. The filtered extract then mixed with the same volume of olive oil (3 L) then boiled till all the aqueous part evaporated\"\n\n\n\nI really hope this info can help other people as much as it helped me.\u00a0 Good luck, and stay positive!\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n-the anonymous ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology enthusiast I am glad that you are feeling better, and I understand why you want to share something that has worked so well for you. However, I think that most people here are looking for options that are scientifically supported. When you say that a plant salve can cure you or prevent cancer, that is pseudoscientific and potentially dangerous. When scientific evidence shows that this condition will increase the risk of vulvar cancer, and that proper use of Western medicine can reduce this risk, it is dangerous to promote alternative medicine as the right choice. It is not kind to tell people who are scared and in pain that you can cure them with a plant-based salve. I do not think that you  are lying, I am sure that you have personally experienced symptom remission and I am glad that has happened for you. However that does not give you the right to promote a pseudoscientific cure to others. Whoah there dude. You seem to be stuck in a real negative mental place.  I am not promoting psuedoscience just because im working with plants.    The plant I use has been used medicinally for thousands of years and has been researched fairly extensively by modern scientists and doctors alike.  It just has not been officially researched as a treatment for this particular rare disease yet. Are you all this closed minded? Your doctors say it cant be cured because your dorctos dont know how to cure it yet.  It does not meant its imossible to cure. I just means it is not possible with the current tools and information that is available to your doctors.  If you all beleive there is no way to cure it then you probably arent ever going to find a cure are you?   No I am not of course I would love to get rid of this. Oh I enjoyed having this for 15 years and see my skin disappear and have trauma and pain. I do not know where you got your information but I listen to actual medical doctors Well ya, I know they all SAY it cant be cured.   Are you really all that hopeless though? I know how fruatrating and depressing it can be to get a diagnosis like LS. Dont let it make you lose hope though.  I am not a doctor but I have probably read more medical journal artices that most doctos have.  I often have to dumb things down a bit for my doctors when I talk to them.. Anyway, my only reason for being here is to offer my help to others who suffer with what I once did and are looking to try an alternative treatment. Ive seen that. I didnt just come here without doing my homework. I guess you guys dont understand that the cancer develops from LS that has been inadequately treated and that the steroids help reduce their risk of cancer because they can slow down or stop the progression of the disease.  Its not like steroids have to be the only thing that could possibly halt or reverse the progression of the disease enough to stop cancer from forming though. You reversed the damage? Like parts that had flattened and fused went back to normal? I didnt have fusing yet.  Pigment loss was reversed. Preliminary stages of phimosis reversed. Bumps on skin disappeared.. Pruritus, dysurea, pain after intercurse all disappeared within a week.  Etc.", "Newbie. Some questions. Hello all, \n\nI have been having some bad scrotal itching, foreskin itching and sometimes anal itching too. Done all std tests multiple times  which are all negative and also applied countless jock itch sprays and creams. Nothing worked. I went to a derm who did a fungal culture which came out to be negative. He offered some cream which did nothing. I recently came across this sub and I am wondering if i have lichen sclerosus or simplex or planus. Point is, my scrotal skin looks pinkish and irritated but there is no rash. I dunno if i would call it leathery. Can anyone relate to my condition?  Does this sound like lichen? I am a heavy guy so i think that might contribute. Sweat and moisture makes things worse. Summer is worse. So it has a very \"fungally\" nature.  I am apprehensive of applying steroids just to see if it will work because they might lead to another issue called Red scrotum syndrome which has even lesser cures.  Thanks in advance for your help. Unfortunately, not a lot of doctors, dermatologists included, are educated in LS. I know it is pretty hard for us women to get diagnosed because of that, and I would imagine it is even worse for men, since it is far less common. That said, it would not hurt bringing it up to them. The only way to test for it is with a biopsy, which is obviously not fun. I was able to find doctors that diagnosed me visually, but that always carries a risk of misdiagnosis (not that I have any doubts lol). \nSo anyways, sorry you are dealing with this! It gets better! Using a tiny bit of otc hydrocortisone should not be that risky and should provide some relief in the mean time. You could also try aquaphor or something like that. I love emuaid for itching. it is $50, lasts forever Sorry to give such a long answer...I  hope the details are helpful.\n\nSo, if you failed to respond to antifungals and such, then that would certainly support your hypothesis of LS.  Im a 30yo male and I have anogenital LS.  The itch seems to affect the edges of my scrotum also.  I get the itch all over my buttocks, and but crack as well as the bottom of my scrotum and the sides of my scrotum where it meets my legs. \n\nFor me, I developed an itchy anal area years before I began to develop any symptoms on my penis.  The symptoms on my penis finally led to my LS diagnosis last fall. For years I suspected my \"nocturnal pruritus ani\" as its called in medical lingo and my inconsistent bowel movements were due to some intestinal parasite that repeated tests had failed to detect.  Now it seems like LS may actually be the real source of those symptoms.\n\nThe itch on my glands and foreskin began long after the symptoms on my backside, BUT it preceeded the pigment loss and plaque like growths to the skin on the above mentioned areas.  For myself, disurea, pain during intercourse,  contraction (phimosis or atrophy) of skin that had lost pigment, and other classic LS symptoms also followed the initial itch (pruritus).\n\nAt this point it sounds like you may have successfully identified your LS before most of the nastier symptoms have presented themselves (Pat yourself on the back lol).  A biopsy can help your doctors confirm this diagnosis since it sounds like you may not have a developed enough case of LS to diagnose it based on symtomatology alone.  \n\nYa I know, a skin biopsy in any of the areas you mentioned probably does not sound like a great idea!   \n\nOne thing I will say is that steroids and other treatments tend to be able to relieve the itch quicker than they can reverse things like pigment loss etc. for LS patients.   If they are going to help you at all, it should not take too long to be able to tell.  You can give it a week or a month to see if it helps without having to worry too much about the long term side effects of topical steroid use.   If you do actually have LS, then the general consensus is that the positive effects of using steroids to treat LS tend to outweigh the possible negative effects of their use.\n\nThe tricky thing about just trying the steroids to see if it helps is the fact that steroids can actually mask the effects or symptoms of certain pathogenic things like yeast or fungal infections, while allowing them to proliferate unchecked.  Not good!  Basically, in some cases, you may feel better temporarily from the steroids even if it isnt actually fixing anything.  \n\nHope this info helps! I wish you the best. Feel free to ask more questions if you have them.\n\nEdit: Oh ya, and I have not seen a ton of scrotums or anything, but I think a leathery appearance sounds like a pretty normal description of scrotal skin.  Lol.  Something about the leatheryness seem different in your case though? Honestly, I actually tried lookin more closely at the skin on my scrotum a few times over the last few weeks ( cuz of my itch there, ya know?) and it seems like the more I look at it the stranger it looks.  Idk how to describe the appearance tho and idk if anything actually looks abnormal. Thanks! I appreciate your answer. I have many of your symptoms. I assume you have perineum itching as well? Does your itching become worse in the presence of moisture/sweat? I am \"making do\" (badly) using zeosorb and gold bond powder. Thank you. I am not a fan of biopsying my genitals lol. Yup, perineum is one of the worst areas for my itch.. and like the adjacent area of my upper inner thighs.  that, my anus, and glans/foreskin.  Itch and other symptoms are fully resolved for my penis (with the exception of the last drip or two of liquid that always wants to sneak out after using the restroom) because I started treating that months before I realized that the symptoms on my perineum, anus, etc could be attributed to my LS.  Still working to get the rest of the symptoms resolved for the areas outside my penis. Cant really say if sweat plays a role or not with my symptoms.  Well, I cant see any clear correlation in my case at least.  Days that I sweat more dont seem to result in any kinds of flares in symptoms.  Although, I might say that sometimes I feel like I perspire more than usual around my buttcrack and balls.  I also get hyperpersperation on my palms and soles of my feet as a result of my palmoplantar keratoderma so who knows.. Same here \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Hey sorry to hijack an old thread. My old derm had prescribed \"triamcinolone acetonide\" corticosteroid cream. It is not as potent as clobestol which seems to be the preferred medication here. But is this good enough? How long do you put the steroid on? No problem dude.  You doc may have decided to start with the weaker ones just to see if they work good enough, before jumping into the strong stuff. If the weaker stuff gets the job done, then there is no real reason to use the extra strength.   Actually..Was this steroid prescribed to you for LS or something else?\n\n\nIdk, im not a steroid expert, but I have heard some people here say they use a slightly weaker steroid for their anus, or sometimes their doctor will switch them to a weaker steroid if the strong stuff causes some kind of irritation to your skin.  \n\nAs far as how long..  that depends.  LS is an incurable disease, so most people will always have to continue some kind of maintenance dosage to keep their symptoms under control. --&gt; Another reason to not over do it with the steroids.  You dont want to increase your risk of long term side effects from the 'roids by taking more than you need to.\n\nHope this info helps Thanks man. I do not have a LS diagnosis yet. Just unidentified itching on foreskin, scrotum underside, perineum and sometimes buttcrack, anus. No discoloration so far. Derm gave this weaker steroid as a safe measure. He had no idea what I have. Only suggestion he gave was for me to lose weight. Hmm, well it could be early LS, but its tough to say without any visual changes to the skin.  Sounds like your doc gave pretty good advice.  Weight might not be your issue, but it cant hurt to lose the extra weight if you have it.  \n\nI have got basically zero fat on my body and I still get itchy in all those places if i dont use my topicals frequently enough. Thanks man. This condition has sapped my mental health completely. Id kill to have some diagnosis. I know what you mean man.  Luckily the itch can go away pretty quickly once you find a treatment that works for you, so dont get too discouraged yet.    The alternative topical treatment I use gives me nearly instant (although not permanent) releif from my itch and it has taken care of my other LS symptoms as well.    \n\nAt least your doctor is willing to try some (weaker) treatment out to see if he can help you, even though he couldnt make a definitive diagnosis.

You should see a doctor for sure.", "My (23M) experience so far - recently diagnosed and confirmed by biopsy Hi everyone. I would like to share my experience so far with you and provide as much details as possible, in hope that it may help someone or to learn something new.\n\nFirstly, a little bit about myself - things i consider relevant to the situation. I am a 23 year old male, uncircumcised. I have never had any major health issues, have no known allergies, i am only lactose intolerant. I have not been much physically active in the last few years. I am quite an anxious person, especially socially, have been pretty much my whole life and i get stressed relatively easily. In the past six months i have had trouble with groin and back pain and a loss of appetite. I am also very skinny, it is hard for me to eat a lot and gain weight. Since the loss of appetite i have lost some more weight, resulting in currently being a bit underweight.\n\nMy LS experience started around mid 2019 when i first noticed a change in color on the left side of the glans. At first it looked like a small white spot and i did not think much about it. The area of the white spot grew bigger as months went by, but i was reluctant to go to my doctor about it. It was not itchy or hurting or burning and I was embarrassed and had hoped it would just stop spreading and go away by itself. After around 6/7 months i started to notice some changes to the skin on the white spot, as if the skin in the center of the spot had started to thicken and i could feel it stick out (like a small bump) and there were sort of like tiny bumps around it too. The area of the white spot was around 7mm wide and i noticed a similar white spot with tiny thickened skin bumps starting to appear on the right side of the glans. This was really starting to stress me out and i went to see my doctor in february 2020.\n\nThe first time i visited my doctor she prescribed me an anti-fungal cream, told me to use it for a week and come back if i did not notice any improvements. Of course there were no improvements, so i went back, she diagnosed me with leukoplakia, told me to use a moisturizing cream every day and gave me a referral to see a urologist, for which i needed some blood and urine tests and an ultrasound of the abdomen (all the results were ok). After 3 months i saw the urologist and he just referred me to a dermatologist.\n\nThe dermatologist then diagnosed me with LS, gave me a biopsy referral to confirm the diagnose and prescribed me a corticosteroids/hydrocortisone-butyrate cream (Locoidon) and told me to apply it once per day in 2 week cycles - use for 2 weeks followed by a 2 week break and repeat until the biopsy. An important thing was to stop using the cream at least 2 weeks before the biopsy.\n\nI had the biopsy around a month later (in july), performed by a urologist. I arrived in the hospital in the morning, on an empty stomach. A bit before the biopsy i was really scared and anxious. I could only take deep breaths and could feel a tingling sensation all over my body. But in the end it was not that bad. I was given a few local anasthetic injections in and around the penis shaft, which was the most painful. After that, i could not feel any pain during the actual biopsy. I got a few self-degradable stitches and a small gauze with vaseline applied to the biopsied spot, which was held in place by the foreskin. After a few hours i was told to urinate and after the doctor checked if everything was fine, i was sent home.\n\nI was told to use warm camomile at home to clean the biopsy site. I had to pour it down the site after every urination and change the gauze (soak a small piece in camomile and apply it onto the site). I used the camomile for about a month or so, then just used regular water. The first few days after the biopsy were a bit uncomfortable and there was some pain at the biopsy and injection shot spots, especially during the night when sleeping and when i got an erection (night/morning). This got better after a few days/weeks. During the next few weeks i mostly wore sweatpants as they were much more comfortable than jeans. Showering was not a problem - i showered normally with shampoo even on the day of the biopsy - the biopsy site was covered by the foreskin anyway, so the water/shampoo did not really come into contact with it. The stitches i got were self-degradable and fell out after about 3 weeks, mostly on their own - i had to poke around with the gauze a little, but it was painless. It took roughly 2 months until i got the biopsy results and it was confirmed, i have LS.\n\nToday i had an appointment with my dermatologist to discuss the next steps. She recommended, as i understood, some sort of steroid injections. Apparently this is an aggressive form of treatment that works wonders in some cases and almost completely stops the progression of the disease (at least when it is in the early stages) and, as i understood, she has had good experience with it by some patients. I was willing to try it but asked some questions first, regarding LS in general and possible implications. I asked if LS could be connected with the health issues i have been having in the past 6 months (listed in the beginning), if stress/anxiety could worsen LS and the answer to both questions was no. After this, she changed her mind regarding the steroid injections, explaining that it might not be a good idea to take them now, as they have some negative side effects on the general mood and psychological state, so to say, and could worsen mine even more. Since my LS is luckily at an early stage (as mentioned before, mine does not itch/burn/hurt... yet), we decided that, for now, i am to use the before mentioned steroids cream Locoidon for 2 weeks once per day, a 2 week break and then for another 2 weeks. After that, i should completely stop with the steroids cream and use just a regular soothing-repairing balm until the next appointment, which is in 6 months, or earlier if i notice any new symptoms or worsening of the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sorry that this turned out to be such a long post. I now feel like i rambled way too much and that half of the stuff i wrote is useless... I was trying to include as much details as possible, in hope that it might help someone. I was a lurker on here for the past few months and saw some posts/questions regarding things i could provide my experince now.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions and i will be happy to answer if i can.

Go to a doctor for a punch biopsy.", "Small spot on my labia, long time LS sufferer and worried it could be cancer So last week while showering I noticed a small spot, kind of like a zit on my labia. I was only at my dermatologist about three weeks before for my annual check up and it was okay then but now I am worried because of the risk of cancer associated with LS. Has anyone had the same experience and how did it go? I have honestly had an actual zit like thing on my labia, it just got really big and it was extremely painful. I would keep an eye on it, either way. If you are on a regular steroid ointment treatment plan recent data shows a normal cancer risk. Ie reduced with treatment. \n\nObviously do not ignore and if it does not resolve itself in a reasonable time go see your dermatologist again. I had a zit there once, too. Could also be a buried hair follicle or many other things. I would ask the dermatologist if it does not go away in another week or so, or it starts to look less zit-like. You might be able to send her a picture since you just saw her. \n\nOverall I would guess the likelihood of cancer is low, but you are smart to keep a close eye on everything. I had \u201czits\u201d almost regular and both surgeon and endocrinologist told me it is a sign of poorly regulated blood sugar. I have insulin resistance and I take meds for it, but whenever I started eating sugar too much - I used to get those. Once I got on my meds and regulated my diet- those are really rare occasion. Just to be clear - I am not implying there is causality between sugar consumption and zits, or suggesting anything, this is just my personal experience. Something to look out for is if it feels like a zit or a genuine growth. I am a longtime sufferer as well. It is crucial to keep calm. I am in the middle of a scare myself, but it is important to note that even if it is something (which is rare), catching it early can be super beneficial. If you were just fine not too long ago and this popped up spontaneously, that sounds like just a zit to me me. I get those too on my legit vulva. Show your doctor.

Remission, symptom free and returned sexual pleasure and drive! \nWhat are your secrets! What triggered you and how did you overcome it? \nPleaseeee We have had success getting LS symptoms extremely well controlled with a combination of ThermiVa and platelet rich plasma injection (PRP). For the latter we do the usual \"O shot\" (PRP injection) but then also use a microcannula to deliver PRP comfortably to the labia minor and clitoral hood regions directly. ThermiVa is a series of 3 treatments standard ( one a month x 3). Usually our LS patients need the PRP more than once in the first 6 months, but after that can start to go longer in between sessions. We have some doing a PRP + 1 ThermiVa for maintenance every 6 to 9 months and not depending on any topical. I should add that we do a high dose PRP, meaning we do a 120ml blood draw,so the number of platelets and thus the amount of growth factor delivered is \"peak\". Some places that do \" PRP\" only draw 30 ml of blood so that will be a weaker treatment and results might not be as good.. Hope that helps. Hiya- I am so sorry you are going through this! I was diagnosed at age 5 and had symptoms for a couple years, then my LS went into remission for 40 years until last year (I got married and had kids in between there). I think it came back last year because it can be stress triggered (hello, pandemic!) and I also entered perimenopause. \n\nI responded well to the clob ointment and I am on my way back into remission. I had minimal symptoms after ~40 days of treatment, and I am now 4 months post-re-emergence.\n\nHang in there- it can be all consuming until you figure out the right treatment and things settle down. I am not sure I am a success story, but my LS is manageable! I do not know what triggered it, but I first noticed symptoms within one year of starting Birth Control so I do suspect that might have something to do with it. \n\nI would say my sex life is pretty good, considering.

But I have noticed white skin that will not change colour. Does this mean the disease is still active ? Or I am having a flare ? I was hoping to be pink again down there Mine went back to normal! It took a really long time, maybe half a year? Mine still has not and it is been at least 6.5 years. It is probably dependent on a bunch of things, how far along you are in the disease, the severity of LS you have, flares or not, etc. So has your specialist said that it is okay and your lichen sclerosis is in control ? Thanks for your reply, I just worry I might not be in control of the disease Unfortunately, I have had a bunch of bad specialists. My gyno is done with me (for that) and I have had a hell of time finding a dermatologist that has even the remotest idea of it...frustrating to say the least. General idea from the ones I have seen though is if I am not having other symptoms, it is \u201cin control\u201d (which I take with a grain of salt bc of my bad luck in finding a doc).\n\nThat being said, other than the patches I do not have any symptoms unless I am having a flare (and that is usually a small bit of pain/itchiness). My theory is I waited a long time before I addressed it and that may be why I still have the patches. But overall, I do not have a terrible case...it is just so different for everybody. Trust your doctor or find a good one and also trust your body, listen to it. My white patch went light pink but is not the same color as the darker pink around it. When touched or pulled tight though it flares white again. I think each case is unique. VLS specialist here- the skin pigment does not always return.

Is it urine trapped under the foreskin? Is it autoimmune? Wonder why I got it at 28 It is autoimmune I am pretty sure at least that is how my doctor explained it to me. Might be genetic.

So you see it in your foreskin because it is a special kind of sensitive skin, but not more rough skin. \n\nIt can be inflamed by pee under the foreskin, but not caused. It can also be triggered by it.

I am going to the doc next week.\n\nAnyways, I did some research and finally decided that I had LS. I read quite a few things on the internet and I think I read somewhere that LS, if untreated for a long time, causes the head to start merging with the shaft (coz the skin starts getting tight). I am not sure if this is true or not.\n\nI do not know whether I am biased or not, but it really looks like a small bit under the head is kind of merged with the shaft, while the rest of it has a really sharp edge, if that makes sense. Also, the botto, part of the head has gone a lighter color (almost white) compared to the top part of the head. Is this really due to LS, or just my anatomy? And is this reversible?\n\nSorry if these type of questions are not allowed. I am not even 100% sure if this is LS, but it really really looks like it. I would be grateful for any advice. Hi.

LS can also result in tightening of the foreskin as the disease causes scarring and thickening of the foreskin tissue, however the skin become more fragile resulting in tears in the foreskin, around the tip typically. \n\nA classic sign of LS is the development of white tissue, often in the form of slight raised flat patches however these are not always present. Initial development of disease around the frenulum is not uncommon as that area is particularly exposed to any urine retained in the foreskin. Retention of small quantities of urine in susceptible individuals is the current best fit and widely accepted theory around the development of the disease. \n\nPlease see a doctor. In the meantime you should wash your penis and foreskin with water only or an emollient wash such as e45. Soap is damaging. You should moisturise inside and out with something like epaderm cream. You should shake and also wipe yourself completely dry, or even wash with water, after urinating to ensure no urine is retained within foreskin. \n\nLS will not go away on its own. You need treatment with an ultra potent topical steroid, the most common being Clobetasol.  Weaker steroids are a waste of time for initial treatment. Initial treatment for penile LS is typically 2x /day application of Clobetasol and review ideally after a month.\n\nI wish you all the best but you need to take action. thanks a lot for the advice. I will visit the doc as soon as I can.", "Does this look like LS? Waiting on doc visit, considering biopsy I already discussed this on a video visit with my sexual medicine MD and she think\u2019s\nit is plausible that I have LS but her office is considered \u201cnon-essential\u201d so I cannot do an office visit yet. I am just wondering if my skin looks like other people\u2019s LS because I cannot find any early stage photos online. Are the white patches ever subtle? I have had problems with sex pain for 2.5 years and recently realized I have been getting small tears on my vulva during sex (see arrow in linked photo). I suspect they have been happening for a while. The last 3 times it is been in the same spot. My vaginal immune system has had a rough couple years so it could have triggered an autoimmune reaction like LS. I still get itchy a lot and when I see my gyno I am usually negative for yeast/bc/trich. Today I am noticing some peeling on the lower vestibular area and the skin seems ready to crack. I have so many issues with sex pain that I only want to do a punch biopsy if it is really necessary.\n\n(", "My white scarring seems to be reversing despite not sticking to my steroid cream protocol (male) So I got prescribed a cream back in July. If I am being honest I have maybe only applied it 10 times in the first few months. But the white scarring seems to be less obvious on the glans and foreskin. I think it is going away. Question I have is... would a handful of applications at the beginning been enough to do this or would it maybe be some other lifestyle things? At the same time I began using some supplements to try and address hormonal issues. Zinc, boron, vitamin e and P5P. As well as Finasteride. There is a theory that hormonal imbalance can cause LS. I had low Estrogen, borderline low free test and high prolactin. Just an interesting observation. Also this might not be applicable to most as I am a Male Interesting. Is there a difference between P5P and B6? I had it for 10 years untreated before symptoms showed up, so I would assume you can put it in remission. Did you make any diet changes as well? I believe p5p is a more active form of b6. You absorb it better and it is harder to take too much of it I have been told. I am taking it primarily to curb high prolactin levels. Why? Is by associated with LS in any way? Not really. Diet has remained the same. I am going to retest my hormones at the start of the year to see if there have been any significant changes. It does remind me of my experience with hand warts too. About 5 years ago, just before my LS started, hand warts i had for over 7 years, disappeared almost overnight. I had started taking zinc then too. Probably too easy to jump to conclusions but interesting how the body can turn around so fast. So happy for you! I am also taking boron, what dosage are you taking? Between 3-9mg. Usually 9 as this seems to be good at lowering shbg which was raised too high. I am still to get bloods retested to see if it worked but waiting 6 months Do you mean 10 years until symptoms left? How did you know you had it 10 years without symptoms? I had no symptoms for 10 years, then it started appearing. Who is helping you do your testing and giving you supplement recommendations? \n\nTesting shbg and taking boron to lower it makes complete sense, yet it is not a protocol I have seen or heard from via my doctors. Seems like you have some good info. Thanks for sharing! Can I ask how you know you had it for 10 years before the symptoms appeared? I know very little about LS. I had it a couple of years before I found out what it was. Then I got very worried. Mine started at a very stressful time in my life when a few other problems developed. I am very into supplementation so I have educated myself mainly. My testing was just done by an online trt clinic and then anything worth further investigation was done by my dr. But although my dr is very helpful hes not that up to scratch on these matters. He literally googled shbg when I visited him so I have a feeling I may have more knowledge on it. I had high shbg but also high prolactin, hence the Vit E and P5P. I also started finasteride for my hair and this made it more important to manage my high shbg. He prescribed me Mometasone cream for my LS but I have not been very good at remembering to use it and it ended up drying up my skin incredibly. However I can no longer see the white scarring on certain portions on my penis now. I cant say if it is the cream, supplements or something else but I will be making sure to do a more detailed post here if I can get this into full remission. It is a terrible condition and I would love to help as much as i can I actually did not know I had it, I had a biopsy 10 years ago and the doctor never bothered to give me the results. I recently had a flare up and did not know what it was, went to the doctor got a biopsy, got my LS diagnosis.\n\nLater I went to see a specialist who pulled all of my medical records and actually looked through them, that is when I found out I would actually been diagnosed a decade ago but never told. \n\nTo say I am absolutely devastated that I spent a decade not knowing when I could have been actively doing everything possible to avoid flare ups is an understatement. I live a very healthy lifestyle however I would have taken extra precautions I spent time learning about preventive supplementation nutrition and treatments. I am really impressed. I am into nutrition supplementation as well, I stumbled upon boron after reading every book I could get my hands on that had anything to do with LS.\n\nThere is a whole group of people using borax in their baths to soak in. Some even drink tiny trace quantities of it, and many, many people in some FB groups say it helps them enormously.\n\nI found the idea of drinking borax too weird / fringe-y for me, however I kept seeing people post about it so I did further research and realized it was probably the boron from the borax that was actually helping.\n\nNobody in that group seems to know exactly why it helps. But they report very good results from consistent use. \n\nWhich is why I was really curious about your boron supplementation and I am fascinated to know what you found out about shbg. \n\nThe LS specialist I just went to in Seattle actually mentioned a similar thing-- that the mechanism / pathway of testosterone processing may be an issue.\n\nI am very curious about this!", "Sex, can someone give me a straight answer? I am so confused, straight up. Everyone says different stuff online and so do my doctors. I need some straight answers. \n\n1. I have never experienced remission from a flare, I am always in a flare. For others who say they have periods of flare and then remission...what does remission mean? When you are \u201cin remission\u201d does that mean you can have sex without pain?\n\n2. Someone talked about dilator therapy, has anyone tried this? My doctor told me not to do it cuz my skin is not healed....but it is been 6 months since I started clobetasol and it is doing nothing so.....what the hell does she know anyways? Should I just do it anyway and see if it helps? \n\n3. Is this for real a condition that will ruin my sex life for the rest of forever? Online they say how things heal and it is no biggie but that has NOT been my experience AT ALL. \n\n4. I am a nympho, this is like torture for me. I do not want to have to tone down my sex drive at all but I have had no choice, does anyone else with a high sex drive literally feel like they have lost their identity to this disease? Like I do not even know who I am. I cannot even wear my lingerie collection cuz it is all lace and it hurts. If clobetasol is not working, you need to find another drug. A lot of women do not have a normal sex life and have to resort to other ways to satisfy their partner whether that is through foreplay, oral, etc. \n\nDilators might help but if there is skin tearing without it healing it might just cause more skin tearing. I tried some other drugs too, they do not work either. So what does remission mean? Is that just another lie that doctors tell me? No, that fucking sucks I cannot do that. I NEED to have sex, I do not care to live without it. Remission is remission. I have only ever had one symptom: itching. I never got a biopsy, but was given clobetasol anyway. I do not have hardly any issues and I only use it maybe\u2026once a month now. \nSome women need it regularly, along with emollients and other treatments to maintain. They may never experience remission. Lack of sex life is really one of the hardest parts for a lot of people. \nIf you join the FB group there is a lot of good information there\n\nEdit: another reason sex become difficult is fusion of the labia, sometimes the clitoral hood and labia start to fuse and it can look like structures are disappearing. Proper treatment can help prevent/reverse some of this But what does that MEAN? Like if you are actually in remission then all the symptoms go away? Or does it mean they just a bit less? \nBro, that is it!? That is insane. Yours sounds way more manageable. I have itching, burning, tearing, scarring, loss of labia minora, narrowing, white patches, red patches and sometimes pain with urinating that feels like a UTI (they said it is a less common symptom but can happen.) I use clob 3 times a week and it makes 0 difference with anything. UGH. This sucks, I am NOT okay with this. I literally do not want to keep going if this never gets fixed, like sex is my life. I am a fucking Scorpio. I tried joining a support group but I found it very annoying and fake. A lot of very miserable people trying to fake being happy but doing an awful job of it. Is the Facebook group like that? Because I realllllyyy do not need anymore more of that. I do not want to hear about that \u201cacceptance\u201d bull crap cuz I will never accept something unacceptable. They suspect it is some sort of autoimmune disease and remission means that whatever happened, your body is no longer attacking itself. \n\nFWIW: when I first started clob, my nurse practitioner told me to use it twice daily for two weeks to get it under control Right I knew this, but it just sounds like a lot of people who are in remission from LS still complain of many symptoms so maybe they are just using the wrong term. I have 3 other chronic illnesses and one of them is in remission and I am not on drugs for it or anything, that is remission to me but as I said lots of LS patients say they are in remission but Sex is still painful and they still have to use clob 3 times a week....that does not sound like remission to me, that sounds like ongoing hell. \n\nWhen I first started using it I was told to apply it once a day for a month, then once every other day for a month, then 3 times a week. In the month I used it everyday nothing changed, and nothing has changed now. You can be in remission with permanent physical changes that cause pain with sex. Women in remission use dilators during this period when the tearing/burning/itching is not an issue. Try low dose naltrexone, done wonders for my LS.\n\nI use betamethasone for steroid 0.1% and it works. There is hope! How long have you been on medicine for? I used to get testing when I was first diagnosed and it took maybe 2 months of very frequent use of Clob for my pain during stop. Now I use it twice a week and I will occasionally get a flare up of skin tearing (mine is more towards my rectum) and itching. That makes sense, thanks for clarifying. I am sure sure not even close to remission so I am not in a place to try dilators at all. I have been using \u201cmedicine\u201d since November, it has truly done nothing for me. Even after I used it everyday for a month, it never felt any better. What are the other side effects of that medication? I have 4 chronic illnesses and 5 comorbities...so I worry it may not mix well with all the other things going on. \n\nI have not heard of that one before, I will research it. Thank you for mentioning this. I am so sorry you are going through this!!!! I have been there. I also have a really high sex drive and it was really shit for me to have to \u201caccept\u201d that I have lost that part of life, so I fought back and am still fighting this shit. It is possible. You can find you again. For me, I had to use it once a day for at least 3 months before tapering, and used it twice a day for a month before that. I also bathed in borax once to twice a day, used estrogen, and stretched the skin with dilators. I infused coconut oil with weed, used that as sexual lubricant. After a couple months sex was 100% pain free for me. I had other symptoms but painful sex was not one of them. So long as I used lube, at least. \nIf you can afford it, I highly recommend stem cell therapy. It can heal the skin and repair the damage, I had it done. I look and feel so much better. Highly recommend it. I hope you find a way to relief Thank you so, SO much for saying all of this. You have literally made my entire day. I am sad I did not see this sooner! This is all so amazing to learn, I feel like knowing this I can have a bit more hope that maybe I could get to this point you are at as well! I also read the book \u201cLichen Sclerosus, Beating the Disease\u201d by Ginny Chandoha, I cannot recommend reading this book enough!!!! Thank you for this info, I appreciate it so much. I hope you can too! It is still rough for me and sex is not always pain free, but better than when I started! How are you? Did it improve from when you initially posted \ud83d\udc95 I am glad to hear your over all situation has improved. \nMmm...mine is very bad, but overall it is been a bit better since I quit using clobetasol (which never did anything for me anyways) and I switched to all organic pure Castile olive oil soap from an Etsy shop called \u201cunearth malee\u201d. I know some people swear by clobetasol but for me it never helped at all even after I used it for sooooo long. Now I just use pure organic coconut oil applied 3-4 times a day and it is been working much better. I also started working with a functional medicine doctor, Doctor Will Cole, and he is been helping me a bunch with my other 3 autoimmune diseases and he says just give it a year and your LS will either be gone or 75% better. There is a lot more treatment options out there than what conventional medicine tells us, it is worth looking in to. Also I read the book \u201cMind over Medicine\u201d which has been a GAME CHANGER!!!! I am sorry things are bad but I am happy you are getting on a good track! I have heard really good things about Castile soap! What have you been working on with your functional doctor? That is the route I am going next. Clobetasol helps me but not nearly enough to have a good life lol. I have actually been doing stem cell therapy instead which is working well so far. I hope you feel better soon!", "\"it is just yeast. trust me.\" says everyone, even my doctor...but my brain says otherwise. i am so scared. i do not want to have ls. i am so scared... i cannot stop crying in fear. i am scared that i will never be the same. no more sex or orgasms. nothing. It will be ok. \ud83d\ude0aThere meds that help stop the progression of LS. I know it is scary but there is help do not give up. Find the right OBGYN and you should be good. I have had it for over 10 years. how are you doing with it? I have have ups and downs but it is been pretty good. I have a biopsy to confirm Agreed, I have had it for almost 10 years too and the majority of the time it is dormant. It flares up every once in a while as itching and irritation. I would ask a gyno to take a look to be sure.", "Is this lichen sclerosus? I am a 25 yr old male.\n\nI have 4-5 white lesions (1-2mm) on glans near corona, all are annular.\n\nThey all appeared suddenly overnight 2 yrs ago &amp; are stable till date.

I am not familiar with penile LS, but if it is it does not sound severe in the slightest. Has a doctor taken a look? Even just a GP?

What do you guys think about those new laser treatments coming out? (TULIP, Mona Lisa)\n\nHas anyone had a treatment? What was your experience? I have not. There is a FB group Lichen Sclerosis Tulip about Dr. Coyle. Ive read elsewhere of women who see Dr. Nathan Newman in California for PRP injections and seem satisfied. The O Shot is similar. All treatments are pricey and not covered by insurance. Thank you! I have not had either, but the laser treatments like Mona Lisa are looking promising.  Several studies have come out on that in the last two years and all look positive as far as I have seen.  I am not clear on whether it is a treatment over a few months and done or if it will require repeat procedures.  Most of the Mona Lisa practitioners list a single three-part procedure as typical for most patients, but that is not specific to LS.\n\n\n\nTULIP, on the other hand, is not a laser treatment, but a platelet-rich plasma treatment.  Platelet-rich plasma looks promising for several vulvar conditions, particularly stricture, but the studies on it seem a bit mixed specifically as a treatment for LS.  It is worth keeping an eye out for further studies on this one.\n\n\n\nLS puts us at higher risk for squamous cell carcinomas due to scarring of the skin.  I assume that means that improving the condition of LS affected skin will also reduce our risk of cancer due to the LS.\n\n\n\nEdit to add:  I found something that says the Mona Lisa laser requires annual maintenance after the initial treatment (for general treatment, this still may differ for LS treatments specifically).  Not bad if that is all it takes for LS and if it is not too expensive.", "PRP and Lichen sclerosus Hi, did anyone try Planet Rich Plasma to treat lichen sclerosus? There are some positive research about this treatment, but i rarely see it discussed here Commenting to hear the updates myself! I posted this question months ago without response but I am curious! Yes I have gotten 3 rounds of PRP! Feel free to message me to hear my thoughts. Hi!!!! I would like to know how it went for you. Should i dm you? Sure! Feel free", "Food triggers Hi, have any of you noticed particular foods worsen your itchiness? Thanks! Triggers are different for everyone, but my biggest culprit is sugar, in any form-processed or naturally occurring. Second to that is alcohol. Exactly the same with me. And being dehydrated. Would you mind elaborating? Do you mean refined, high concentration sugars like ice cream or pastry? Or do you avoid  the sugars in, for example, apples or rice to avoid itchiness? Refined &amp; high concentration sugars absolutely (desserts and the like), but also if I have something like a fruit salad, or more than 1-2 servings of fruit in say a week, I will also get a flare. \n\nThe refined/processed sugars take less to cause a flare, but naturally occurring sugars like fruit will do it too. The alcohol I have not really nailed down yet (what types of alcohol). Ok got it, thank you! And when you say flares, do you mean itchiness for a few hours or could you elaborate a little? Flares for me are itchiness for a number of days, along with pain. Sometimes tearing with occasional bleeding depending upon the severity of the flare. But do not get me wrong, it is better more than it is bad. Leaky gut is root cause of LS. Heal the gut and you can eat anything again and LS will disappear. Start with probiotics and vit D.", "Cannot get wet during sex Does this cause any issues with being wet during sex? I just cannot get wet when my boyfriend and I foreplay, even when I am actually into it. I do not know if I am in my head about it because my mind does wander and think about myself not being wet enough and my skin having micro tears or just getting hurt. We cannot even use spit because I feel like it has the possibility of irritating my skin and it makes me anxious to even think that it could happen. I do not know how to stop being in my head about this, whether or not it is because of LS. We have not had normal sex in months because I am just so anxious Have you tried a using a really slippy lube. I could not get wet because estrogen was making me dry. But different kind of fore play role play blindfold, try Uber lube. Try and relax just try and have fun you will get there it does not always happen instantly. I only recommend water based lubes and try the flavored condoms for oral to try instead if your into that. There are plenty of other things to try without inserting anything. I also got a prescription for licoaine jelly and it helps. If you are using condoms, make sure you are using a water based lube as oil based ones can make the condom less effective. I personally find the lubelife brand to burn less and be more effective than most others.\n\nIf you do not need condoms, I have read that Yes brand is a good oil based lube for LS. But that could just be good advertising.\n\nIf you are younger, living with family, or shy about buying it at a store\u2014 Christmas now gives you a good excuse to buy some on Amazon (you could use a guest account I think). It comes in an unmarked box and you can say it is a gift for someone to avoid someone opening it \n\nLube aside- I also find that taking deep breaths to relax and really trying to focus on what feels good can make a big difference in enjoying it and having my body respond accordingly. Even if that means having my guy slow down or \u201chold it\u201d while I physically and mentally try to relax for a moment has made a big difference too. I have read that the autoimmune part of this disorder prohibits your body from creating your own or creating enough of your own lubricant, so dryness is a common problem.  I personally use coconut oil as a lubricant because not only does it lubricate and moisturize, but it does not irritate me like other lubes do. Just a comment - silicone lube is fine for condoms too and way better than water based for me personally Interesting... I can get wet by myself just fine but it is only when I am doing it with my boyfriend - might be because I am anxious or something\nI will look into coconut oil, seems like something that is recommended a lot in this sub. Thank you! I will look into Yes brand! And I should probably try deep breaths, you are right lol. I am probably in my head a lot since I had to start dealing with LS. Thanks for your help! Lube is a great option for lots of people, regardless of health conditions. Coconut oil is not safe to use with latex condoms, so that is just something to note. With latex condoms you will want a water based or silicone based lube. I think silicone does not dry out as fast as water-based. Or you could use non-latex condoms. ( Maybe try some different lubes when you are by yourself and determine what you like and does not cause irritation. \n\nI also read recently that many women produce a lot of lubrication, but it often pools in the back of the vagina (especially if they are lying down.) A finger can easily draw it out so that it lubricates the entrance to the vagina. \n\nWorrying about tearing definitely sounds like a big mood-kill, though. If this anxiety is bothering you a lot, and it sounds like it is, it could be helpful to talk to a therapist or even a sex therapist if you can find one. I also wonder what the conversation has been like with you and your boyfriend. Does he know and understand about LS? What is he doing to make sure he does not hurt you? What about other kinds of sex that do not involve the vagina, like oral sex, mutual fingering, or even outercourse? They are not scripted in most cultures as \"official\" sex, but they can be just as gratifying. If you and your boyfriend decide ahead of time that you will not do anything with your vagina, it might help you relax and put aside those intrusive thoughts, and get back into the habit of enjoying sex. Wow seriously thank you so much for all the information. And yeah my gyno actually mentioned that coconut/emu oil lures bacteria in so I will probably avoid that!\n\nYeah I may need to talk to a sex therapist or something, not sure if insurance covers that but fingers crossed. He knows some things about LS but him and I should both do more research. It is interesting you mention that btw - I can get wet by myself and I sort of wait until my vaginal lubrication naturally comes out, which works perfectly fine.. but if I am lying down + anxiety it may be the reason why it does not come out so easily. Thank you so much for the help &lt;3", "Is this possible or did I get misdiagnosed? Yesterday I finally got an OBGYN appointment for clitoral pain I have been feeling for a rather long time but always felt it would probably stop, or that it was an effect of my IUD (kyleena). Doctor asked me a lot of questions, told me theres no reason for my kyleena to cause clitoral pain (but probably was causing the abdominal pain), which im still uncertain about.\n\nShe said LS can be genetic, or can start because of trauma to the area. \n\nnsfw-ish)) I remembered that back in october 2019, a round of rough oral sex with my bf left my clit looking kind of messed up. I remember no pain during the act, but afterwards i was swollen, in deep pain, and the skin was kind of splotchy here and there, very red and inflammed. Thinking it was just an injury that would heal eventually, I put extra care into rinsing it, cleaning it, letting it air out. I couldnt wear anything with a seam running down the middle (anything that was even remotely bodycon) for a month.\n\nI felt like my clitoris never really went back to normal since then. I remember stating it audibly a few times, yet back then it was just a little more sensitive once it healed, that is all. At the time, I was on nexplanon BC. Last year june I switched to Kyleena, and its much better than nexplanon, but it brings occasional pain, especially on the ride side of my vulva, vagina, and lower abdomen. The clitoral pain is also on the right side. \n\nSometimes the pain would start in my right abdomen and then shoot straight to the side of my clitoris. I never had this happen before kyleena. But, i do kind of have these super small white spots inside of my hood and one on the right side where my clit meets the hood. Super tiny, barely noticeable. Currently im on Triamcinolone 0.1% for the next 2 weeks btw.\n\nWhat im kind of getting at is: is it true a whole autoimmune problem can start just because I had injury to my clitoris once? Or could it be a side effect from my IUD and im just misdiagnosed? I could be wrong but I have never heard of birth control causing clitoral pain. The hormones in birth control may trigger flare ups and immune responses though but I have no idea. But yes, I do believe that one instance of trauma to an area can cause LS. \n\nFrom personal experience, I had psoriasis patches appear on my legs after I waxed them (this is still relevant cos they are all autoimmune skin conditions) so it is very likely that this instance could have triggered LS in that particular area. \n\nThe beauty of autoimmune conditions is that they can just pop up whenever they like because of something that seems completely insignificant Agreed, except I tend to think of injury as a trigger, or maybe a contributing cause, but usually not the whole cause. For instance, lots of people wax their legs and do not get a rash, because they do not have the underlying disease of psoriasis (or at least the underlying potential for psoriasis). OP probably had some other genetic or environmental factors for LS, and it was just waiting for anything to set it off. Or, it may have already been there, but the injury brought it to their attention. \n\nAnd likewise I do not know about hormonal birth control causing clitoral pain. Some hormonal birth control drugs (anti-androgenic ones) are believed to raise the risk of LS, but I do not think Kyleena or Nexplanon are those ones (but I am not 100% clear on it). \n\nThis thing OP said\n\n&gt;Sometimes the pain would start in my right abdomen and then shoot straight to the side of my clitoris.\n\nReminded me of some of the newer approaches towards vulvodynia, where it is treated as a form of pelvic pain and addressed through biofeedback exercises to train the pelvic floor, or looking for trapped/pinched nerves, or giving drugs that help soothe the nerves. Sometimes nerves, especially that serve the genitals, get injured but keep sending pain signals after the injury has healed. I think that is what I am trying to say, it is more of a trigger for an underlying condition :) Precisely :)", "Male looking for advice on LS post-circumcision Hi all, I am a 30 year old male with LS who had a circumcision 4 years ago (phimosis caused by LS). I had hoped this would resolve the issue, but in the last 12-18 months I have noticed changes to the skin on my penis. I am scared, I am hoping someone can help give some personal experience to help calm my nerves.\n\nThe changes began with white dots appearing on the shaft of my penis, about half a centimetre away from circ scar. They are situated where the skin kind of folds on itself, making like a pseudo-foreskin (for lack of a better term). These white dots slowly developed further into white patches, all around the shaft at the area where the skin folds, with the sides being more like one big patch each side rather than little dots. I also noticed my meatus has turned white, where as it used to be a healthy colour. Due to covid I could not get a urology appointment until this Monday, but I will be honest, I am terrified and extremely anxious about my LS, so I am seeking answers from my fellow sufferers.\n\nWhat I would like to know is the following:\n\n1. Are there any creams that can reverse the discolouration caused by the white patches? If so, what are they called? How effective are they?\n\n2. How do I prevent any further white patches from appearing? \n\n**As a note, 1 &amp; 2 can be answered by any gender if you have experienced and successfully treated/reversed the white patches**\n\n3. What are your experiences with LS on the actual shaft of the penis and gland after circumcision? (Only articles I seem to find are pre-circumcision)\n\nThanks in advance, I am terrified, anxious and depressed by my situation. I will take any and all help. You should visit a dermatologist instead of a urologist (or at least both). \nSteroid ointment is the number 1 treatment. Clob or clobetasol is the stongest and probably preferred in your case. But do not hesitate any more. Go as fast as you can. Reversing the skin changes is more difficult than stop progression. \nWhen you cannot visit a dermatologist fast, ask your gp for a prescription.\nGood luck! I have LS. Treatment is using betamethasone ointment. \nThis removed the thick white scaring on underside of penis . Also a patch on glans. I still have some from adhesions on foreskin.\nCurrently being told to keep pulling foreskin down to keep adhesions open to heal. This is where foreskin attaches under glans. \nYes pink color returned. \nKeep your fold dry and with steroid treatment you will see a difference.\nBTW a regular steroid treatment plan lowers penile cancer risk to normal. Yes I expect to be on this for life.\n\nGood luck. Get to an LS experienced dermatologist ASAP.", "confused af. been going through a lot of confusion for about 2 years now. was unofficially diagnosed and given steroid cream around a year ago, did not find much help in that, then was undiagnosed and told i do not have LS. finally got to see a gynaecologist today and she thinks i have LS. now on a different steroid cream for a month and then i will have\na biopsy?? had the worst experience with the gynae today, was so insensitive and did not want to listen or answer any questions \ud83e\udd72\n\nmy one question is, because this is hopefully early ish diagnosis, am i unlikely to experience fusion of the labia and clitoral hood ? Biopsy after steroids?? Im no doctor, but im pretty sure the steroids will suppress the reactions they are looking for in the biopsy tissue..\n\nAlso, to answer your questions: people's results with steroid creams will vary, but topical steroids will usually halt the progression of lichen sclerosus. So, if you dont have fusing yet then you probably dont have to worry about it. i thought this too, tbh she did not really seem to know a whole lot and was not giving me the time of day, it was tough! not really sure what to do now\ud83d\ude12\nand thank you for the answer to my question! Sorry to hear you are getting less than satisfactory care from the medical system..  i totally know what that feels like.  Dont give up hope though. Maybe your doctor was just having a rough day that day.  Or maybe you just need to look for another doctor. Good luck! Theoretically if you can get the inflammation under control it should not progress that far.\n\nI am not having a lot of luck with topicals either. Hoping for the both of us that we do find the thing that works and are done with this damn thing.", "VIN (after LS misdiagnosis) Hello,\n\nI hope you do not mind me posting this here, but I recall from when I used to read posts in this group, that there are a lot of people posting when they are in the diagnosis phase, looking for advice.\n\nI have been to hell and back trying to get a diagnosis and the doctor at colposcopy said I likely had LS based on my examination. I told her I wanted to go through with the biopsy regardless, and it turns out I do not have LS. I have VIN caused by high-risk HPV that I was unaware I even had. \n\nVIN can present with incredibly similar symptoms to LS. I have itchiness, tearing and even areas of discolouration. The treatment is also clobetasol but it is used purely to manage the itching.\n\nI do not mean to offend anyone with this post, I just thought it might be helpful to make people who are waiting for a biopsy aware of this condition as it rarely seems to be talked about.\n\nI have had my HPV vaccines, so stupidly, I thought it was impossible to still get it. I am seeing a pelvic floor PT at the moment, who said another of her other young clients was also miss-diagnosed with LS that turned out to be VIN, so this appears to happen fairly often. Sorry but I do not understand what is VIN, what does it stand for ? I have never read that term \nNo worries! I had not heard of it until I was diagnosed! It stands for Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and it is a skin condition of the vulva that involves abnormal, precancerous cells. this is a helpful post and a reminder of why the biopsy is so important to confirm the diagnosis. Thank you so much for saying so. I did not want to undermine anyone by posting it but honestly, my gynaecologist did not even want to do the biopsy because she was so sure I had LS. It just demonstrates the necessity for being able to advocate for yourself. I do not think you undermined anyone at all. there are so many conditions with similar symptoms and it is always best to make sure you are getting the right diagnosis so you have the right treatment. I had never even heard of VIN before - this will help a lot of those with vaginas who are in the early stages of getting a diagnosis. Were you negative for inflammation when the biopsy came back? I am thinking now. My biopsy came back as inconclusive for LS, but they saw inflammation which likely meant LS. I have no idea about inflammation, I was just told that I did not have LS and that I have VIN and HPV instead. Glad you have figured that out! Hope you get better. And I totally agree that biopsy is necessary. Diagnosing by the looks is so questionable, minding that a lot of people having the same condition can showcase different symptoms. For sure! I do not know why doctors make it so difficult to get a biopsy. I ended up having to go privately because the NHS refused. Had I not done this, I would have been throwing clobetasol at a condition that does not need long-term steroids. My biopsy came up negative for LS (or anything), but my doctor thought we just tested too early / in the wrong place. I have been being treated for LS for 5 or 6 years. I do (*did* actually, as I finally cleared it after 3 years) have high-risk HPV, though! So your post caught my eye. \n\nCan I ask what the treatment is for VIN? Do you just wait it out? This is good news\nSo for the last three years you have no LS symptoms? That Is really great to hear\nAre you still using steroids? Because my VIN is only grade one at the moment, my gynaecologist is hoping that my immune system will just knock it out. In the meantime, I have been given clob to help with the symptoms, such as itching, although it is purely for symptom management rather than treatment. Nah, I still have LS symptoms (though mine have never been that bad). I use triamcinolone as needed. But my Pap smear and HPV tests both finally came back normal, so my body\u2019s cleared the HPV. Wow, interesting. Can you have physical changes from VIN like you can from LS? Like fusing, losing your inner labia, etc.? I am not too sure about that. That said I have mild clitoral adhesions, although I have always had these. My gynaecologist did say that some adhesions can happen due to general inflammation rather than LS though! May i ask when you are strict with the treatment how often do you flair? Like what is the longest you have been without symptoms Wow! Thanks for sharing. Hmm. Like usually I feel it if I go 1-2 weeks without using steroids at all. \n\nI was supposed to use steroids 3x/week. But when down to \u201cas needed\u201d when things got a little better. Honestly I think once a week is probably the sweet spot for me.\n\nETA: It took years for things to get better, btw. I also was not very good about using steroids for the first year or so because my symptoms are so mild and I was not convinced I had LS since my biopsy was negative. But I got more serious when I started noticing physical changes. Did you have a Pap smear Yes was it negative? It came back clear, the strain of HPV that causes VIN tends to be different to the strain that results in abnormal Pap smear tests Hi, was there a test that you took to get diagnosed with VIN? I am being treated for LS and I am scared that I have VIN. I have major anxiety because my LS symptoms have been present for at least 7 years. I did not get biopsied for LS but I think me being treated will ruin chances of a good biopsy. The test for VIN is typically a biopsy. I totally understand your anxiety about it all - I felt the exact same! \n\nDo not worry it will be alright - I am not sure how the biopsy works if you have been treating it but it might be worth talking to a doctor and seeing what they say Hi I am just seeing your post now. I had the same experience. Told I has LS at age 25! (Even though its older menopausal women who mainly have LS). I had CIN2 twice and had to have LEEP around the same time but the doctor never thought to put two and two together. I was then told to use clobetasol the strongest steroid for about 5 years. Steroid makes you immunosuppressed which allowed the HPV to go wild. It then spread to the back anal region, opening of the vag and all over the vulva. It was not until another doctor intervened and said get her a biopsy now! I got the biopsy and VIN3, VAIN3 and AIN3 I was gutted and very angry. The NICE guidelines in the UK state anyone NOT menopausal with LS symptoms should have biopsy within 3 months of steroids not helping. This went on for 6 years! I then had to have surgery, immunomodulator therapy and am now on chemotherapy. Needless to say I contacted a solicitor and am taking legal action as it has ruined my life. I cannot pee properly, I cannot have sex properly and it has stopped me starting a family. This disease is cruel.", "Pregnancy and clobetasol I have one child and was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus a year after his birth (but probably had a mild case at least 4 years prior). I have been using clobetasol twice a week since my diagnosis and it has helped my symptoms immensely. Now we are considering having another baby and I do not know what to do. I cannot find any studies that say it safe during pregnancy and in fact, most say it is a no-go and can cause low birth weight. I hate the idea that this disease might prevent us from growing our family (along with all the other bs it causes). Anyone have experience with LS and pregnancy/breastfeeding?? Did you stay on clobetasol? How were your LS symptoms during pregnancy?", "What is \"remission\" to you? Been using clobetasol for three weeks now. Symptoms are reduced, a lot of recovery, and inflammation is down. But not fully. I am M, so there is still a white spot just below my glans, as well as redness along the inner foreskin. I would rate it about a 2/5 in terms of symptoms - no pain, no itching, no burning, however, visually, there is still inflammation. What does remission, a term thrown around a lot without really being defined (even in the scientific literature) mean to you? Does it mean the LS is invisible? Does it mean perfect normalcy? Does it mean low-levels of inflammation, like some redness and whiteness? Or does it simply mean not progressing? Just wondering what people's experiences have been.", "Has my LS returned? Hello all! 25F\nWhen I was around 6 I was diagnosed with LS. For years I would go to a dermatologist who specialized in genitalia and was being treated from what I can remember by ointment. My doctor deemed me \u201chealed.\u201d At 14 I had a 5 year check up and everything was normal and she said I did not need to come back. I was under the impression I was healed forever. I am now 25 and for the past 2-3 years around winter time, I experience itching that cannot be identified. I have gone to my gyno and gotten tests, all came back clean and the gyno would just say maybe it is just a yeast infection or they would say change your underwear. I have never experienced tears until this year. The tears are around the vagina opening. Is this normal? Is it possible that the LS has returned? As I read online it says there is no cure... so in my mind the LS has returned and I need to make an appointment with the doctor who diagnosed me. It is not easy for me to orgasm, no guy has ever been able to. I have always felt weird about it because I had no idea why it was so difficult for me... now I know and I have been putting all of the pieces together these past few days.   Any input or advice would be so appreciated. The only cases of cure are usually those who have it as children, and do not have it again as an adult. That is a case of being cured, and it looked lucky for you. Like my kid outgrowing his peanut allergy. \n\nItching and tears are a good reason to very directly chat with gyno about LS. I had gynecologist office NPs chase me away for a year saying I had yeast infections, increasingly nastily. It was not a yeast infection. NPs and many gynecologists just are not familiar with LS. \n\nYou should not have itching left unrelieved by a course of yeast treatment and you certainly should not have vaginal tears unless you are engaging in some wild activity while far too dry. Assuming you are doing all the environmental things - detergent is dye and fragrance free, undies (not thongs) are mostly cotton, careful of lube (saliva is good, anything else might irritate but you got to try and figure it out, many prefer coconut oil) - it is more than reasonable to check back in with doc on this specific topic. Just tell them up front you already treated for yeast and it did not help. \n\nAssuming you are sexually active they may want to do an STI screen and that is a totally reasonable thing to do, not embarrassing or insulting. LS is rare, but you already won once, so...  good luck !! I have had LS since I was a kid (8ish-10ish). It disappeared on me for quite a few years until I turned 18 and got more sexually active then BAM! Our most despised friend made its appearance. \n\nLS commonly disappears during puberty for people with it as kids. Its likely you have got it again (or rather it is active again). Talk to your gyno or specialist about your symptoms as it definitely sounds like LS. My gyno specializes in LS and has told me that most gynos have very little knowledge on it and will often test using biopsies though they are not effective for diagnosis. Try and find some one with experience in LS.\n\nYou will figure something out for treatment and it WILL get better! Thank you for the info!!! I am just ready to feel some relief and for my gyno to stop thinking I am psycho lol. I was recently tested for everything in the book, all came back negative so now I am just like okay..... what could it be and my mom mentioned the lichen sclerosis which I never thought anything about because I was so young. I am not sexually active at this point so I know it is not irritation from that. I have been putting vagasil itch cream in the area to give it some sort of moisture. I just wish my gyno would hurry up with the referral!!", "so confused and need some help i am F(21) and have been dealing with a bunch and need some advice. so for over 2 years now i have been dealing with a tear at the bottom of my vaginal hole after sex. and then i started itching on just one side of my labia in a little area. i had the tiniest little skin colored bump that i would not have noticed if my OCD was not the way it is but it was so so itchy. and then one day it stopped. a few months later i notice it looks like my clit hood is fusing a little to my clit and the tip of my clit has started attaching to the top of my labia, and the tip feels hard and calloused. suddenly the itchy area comes back, so i went to my gyno and brought up my concerns of LS. we did a biopsy of the super itchy area and i was prescribed clobetasol in the morning and night for two weeks, and after that clobetasol in the morning and estrogen cream at night to break up the adhesions. so that was 3 weeks ago and i am currently doing the clobetasol/estrogen but my biopsy came back negative? i am so so confused and my gyno does not have much of an explanation either. i am just very scared of more fusing, and i am so tired of the tearing after sex. my OCD has been horrible about this for a long time, and i am 21 with a long term partner and cannot even have a sex life :( if anyone has any input that would help so much! thank you :) I am so sorry you are going through this! I just wonder, had you been using the creams etc up until the moment you got your biopsy? Could it have been a false negative? \n\nI do not know much about these things, however my gyno always asks me to avoid using any steroid medications on the skin before a check up so they can see how the skin looks without being \u201cremodelled\u201d by the steroids\n\nI really hope you get answers soon! thank you, it sucks so bad :( and no i got prescribed the creams after the biopsy! Biopsies (and pathologists) are not 100% accurate. It is possible you do have LS and it is a false negative, or maybe you have something else. The good thing is, most inflammatory skin conditions of the genitals are treated with steroid creams anyway. If the treatment seems to be helping at all, I would keep with it, as long as your gyno agrees. I have same issues at 56 yo. It is because of low to no estrogen I am told. I was prescribed Premarin (estrogen) and it got better for a bit but is back. I also have a tear at vaginal opening and labia is fused in some areas. It is so painful and itchy. Aloe from my plant helps with the pain and itching more than the cream the doctor gave me. I got to doctor again this week. It truly is awful and I totally understand. It is impossible to enjoy intercourse. Anything down there is off limits! i am so sorry you are dealing with that! hopefully we get out stuff all figured out and can enjoy it again!! Yes!!! Ive read that petroleum jelly everyday is helpful....", "Diagnosed with LS... but I do not think it is correct. I would appreciate your input, esp. if you are a male with LS. I am a 48-year-old healthy male.  I was circumcised as a baby.  Never had issues/problems with my genitals.  In late February I developed a small sore on my penis.  About 1/2\" round.  Slightly reddish, like inflamed, but no bleeding, oozing, etc.  Some days it would have a small whitehead in the middle... other days the whitehead would go away.  Tried steroids on it for several weeks with no help.  After 9 weeks my dermatologist decided to do a biopsy.\n\nDuring that 9 weeks the only real negative was the warming pain I felt about half the time... like I had scratched my skin and touched an alcohol swab.  Or like a moderate sunburn.  The pain would range from non-existent about a 3 out of 10.  It never itched.  Skin never flaked or anything.\n\nThe diagnoisis came back as Lichens Sclerosus.  I really do not think it is, though.  For several reasons:  a) I was circumcised as a baby and have heard LS in this situation is extremely rare, b) never had any scaling or itching or weird skin anywhere on penis, c) the biopsy was 23 days ago and just will not heal.  It looks like a hole in my penis with scar tissue all around it.  It stings again like it did before.  d) the photos I have seen online of LS in males is nothing even remotely like what I am dealing with.  \n\nSo I guess I am wondering if anyone else with LS has symptoms like mine.  Pain for about 75% of the day (gets worse as the day continues) and sores that will not heal.  Anyone had a biopsy to confirm? Did the biopsy heal in a reasonable time (3 weeks or less)?  \n\nAny men with LS that were circumcised as a baby?  What was your experience?\n\nI am seeing my dermatologist again tomorrow, and would love some feedback before I push back.  I feel very alone in this, as I do not think my dermatologist really knows what she is talking about. Hi there, I am 41 and have had LS for about 15 years. Never any real big symptoms other than a small area on my glad would go white with one 3mm circle becoming white and hard before disappearing again. \nSix months ago however it changed to more of a red sore (lesion). It did not bleed or ooze either but it got me sufficiently worried to go get it checked out. \nIt felt painful in the same way you described too. Not always there but uncomfortable all the same. \n\nUrologist agreed that i should get a biopsy to rule out anything bad. \nI ended up getting a punch biopsy, which removed the lesion and goes deeper into the skin. I had a couple of stitches snd it healed up pretty well. Took a couple of weeks. The scar from the stitches still look obvious but it is only been about a month since surgery. \n\nMy biopsy came back all clear thankfully, so these things can be ok if you get them looked at.  I do not have any pain there now so the punch biopsy removed  what was causing it. \n\nI still have a white area around the glans, but it does not burn or tear or anything. Just the skin looks whiter. \n\nWhat type of biopsy did you have? I would have imagined you would have had stitches too but maybe not if you have a hole? That would be something I would get sorted. You maybe need to see a urologist?\n\nGood luck with your appointment. Not sure if hearing my experience can help you in anyway but for me, I know how it is not an easy thing to talk about with others so know you are not alone. \n\nAll the best. Thanks for your input... I am curious... were you circumcised prior to your diagnosis?\n\nI had a scrape biopsy... it was fairly deep but they cauterized it.  Seemed to be healing fine for a bit, but then it just stalled.  Not sure why it still hurts after 3+ weeks. I am circumcised and have LS and it sounds similar. I have LS with a lot of restriction in my skin and burns, tears, etc. I justwent about a month with no burning sensation and today got a new tear and boy does it burn. \n\nI have white patches and tears that do not really heal just scab and many times will real tear. So maybe not the same but still... Sorry, forgot to mention, I am uncircumcised. You are right in that Lichen Sclerosis is uncommon with men who are circumcised.\n\nIt could be still healing, or trying to heal. It will be good to get a professional opinion on how that is going. I was told to keep it dry, avoid using soap, which can irritate the area. Water is enough while you are healing. If you do use a little soap, then use a very mild one. \nA small amount of petroleum jelly (Vaseline) can be applied as a barrier, but I did not use this much.\n\nIt took me three weeks for the stitches to dissolve. I had a little pain while it was healing but nothing after that.  I do believe sometimes we can amplify the pain in our heads when something is worrying us, though it sounds like you are not healed properly. \n\nIt may just be that you have had a non specific lesion. It may not be lichen sclerosis.  The white appearance of the skin seems to be the most common symptom, and you say you did not really have this before the lesion appeared. \n\nIf you do not think the dermatologist knows for sure, maybe see if you can get a second opinion?  Over the years, I got different opinions from different Doctors. It is not a condition that all seem to be familiar with.\nThat said, they should have tested the sample taken from the biopsy. Ask what was actually checked for. Was it to confirm LS or rule out cancer, is the diagnosis still just their opinion or a fact after the sample was analysed. If you have only redness and no white patches, LS does seem like a surprising diagnosis. It is possible the histology was very definitive, but it could also be a mistake. I have a relative with Zoon's that was misdiagnosed as LS for several years, even after many biopsies. \n\nMaybe you could ask for a second opinion on the histology? Perhaps a pathologist that has more experience with these conditions. You could also ask your dermatologist to confer again with the pathologist, and you could try seeing a different dermatologist and bring them the pathologist's notes.", "FREE vulvar Lichen Sclerosus eBook  Hey everyone,\n\nJust wanted to let you know that I am offering my eBook, 'Three Keys Things You Need When You Have Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus' for FREE.\n\nWhether you are newly diagnosed, or have been diagnosed for years but are struggling to find acceptance and stability, this book is for you.  \n\n\n1.

It is partially my fault for masturbating too much. These sores are giving me anxiety because my mind keeps going to cancer but I am a teenager so statistically I should be fine. I suspect I have LS, anyone help? ok so LS can not cause mouth ulcers. Lichen Planus affects the mouth. LS is relatively rare in younger people so it is unlikely you have it. It is not related to masterbation at all. You probably just have simple mouth ulcers. Gargle with salt and warm water. See a dr if it does not improve Correct me if I am wrong but LS can effect the penis It is not your fault at all. \n\nThe sooner you show it to a doctor, the sooner you get relief from either LS or anything else you might have. Get an appointment, they will be nice for sure! Hey, not your fault. My onset of LS was at like 17, so you can definitely get it as a teenager/young adult. Go see a doc for diagnosis as it is a relatively mild steroid ointment should keep things mostly in check. I get cracks/ fissures from bad flares- mostly before I was diagnosed. Good luck. Yes it can. Best you go to a doctor to get it checked", "Clit Adhesions I (19f) have had clit adhesions for as long as I can remember. I always wondered why sex never felt that great and I have the lowest libido.\n\nI am really desperate to get the adhesions reversed and I thought I would ask people on here for suggestions regarding the best way to go about this? I have the same thing :( I am 25 and have never had an orgasm. I had a surgery a couple of years ago (the doctor tried to remove the scar tissue to expose my clit) but it failed. The adhesions grew back within a week. I have been on clobetasol for a while but I have not seen any noticeable improvement. My new doctor is considering plastic surgery. Have you made any attempts to break them up yourself? Does not work for everyone, but worth trying. Gently pulling the skin apart in different directions. If there are still places that you can get a q-tip in, you can cover it in vitamin E oil and push against the scar tissue. Google and talk with your doc about it. If you are on topical steroids, make sure you are getting it on every possible surface. My doc told me that the Mona Lisa laser can sometimes be used for this problem as well, might want to ask. I am curious about this too since my glans is mostly buried. I think it has been phimosed for many years. I am hoping my adhesions will get better since I started clob but I do not know a lot about the prognosis re: clitoral adhesions.\n\nI have good luck with vibrators since they give deeper stimulation without a lot of friction. I would recommend trying that if you have not already. Yes to the vibrators! I have even had good luck with a vibratory over the underwear on the clit to avoid too much friction. Honestly, with straight up vaginal penetration type sex the clit does not always get that much action anyways. Devoting the time to foreplay and trying different things out (for most ppl with vaginas) is the best bet to climax.\n\nI do not know much about how to heal adhesions, but I am using the clob and gentle tissue stretching/massage in an attempt to keep it from getting worse.\n\nGood luck to you and keep on trying different things. It is definitely possible to have a good sex life with LS I am scared I have this what does it look like It is when you cannot fully retract the hood because it is stuck to your clitoris", "I am in panic i dont what it this on my inner thigh.

Please help because my doctor\u2019s appointment takes time. Thank you! \n\n", "Diagnosed Yesterday Hi all,\n\nI have been reading and lurking on the sub since Thursday but am deciding, nervously, to reach out for some hope and optimism. I went in on Thursday to have my IUD removed (normal, just time for it to come out) and my Gynecologist shocked me when she said she saw signs of LS - something I had never heard of. I had not, to my knowledge, been experiencing any symptoms aside from occasional itching, which I thought to be bearable and normal. I had never even considered mentioning it at my annuals nor did I find it to be abnormal. \nNext thing I know, the IUD is out and she is talking me through a biopsy. I remember nodding along when she explained LS to me and was more afraid of the biopsy process until after it was complete and I got home and hit the internet. Hard. I terrified myself reading tons of pages and looking at all the pictures, which I am sure was not the best idea but I could not help it. \n3 days later, yesterday, she called and told me the biopsy was positive for LS and at first, I felt relief that I would not have to spend a week wondering. Now I am feeling scared and like my own body has betrayed me. I broke down in tears leaving the pharmacy this morning after picking up what I am told is the first of a lifetime of Clobetasol tubes and the pharmacist told me to keep an eye out for thinning of my skin. \nLooking for some hope and what to do to stay optimistic with a surprise diagnosis of LS. I just want to say thanks in advance for whomever created this sub and for any information you all can share with me. It certainly takes some adjusting. I was diagnosed 6 years ago. I remember googling LS and looking at those pictures, it is hard to resist when you are trying to figure things out but it probably is not the best thing to do.  What I have learn is that although LS is lifetime and does require more visits to the doctor because of the increase in cancer, it can be controlled with time. You will learn what triggers flare up. I can tell my skin is getting too thinned so I reduce or stop the clobetasol for a day or two. Sometimes sleeping with a pillow between your legs can help. I use zinc ointment when it hurts. Not as a substitute to clobetasol but to cool things down. One thing I have always found difficult is explaining this to a new sex partner and also if you have a partner applying the cream before bed kind of kills it for spontaneous sex. So be vigilant and learn your triggers, it is not pleasant to have I understand that. Best of luck and do not be shy to ask questions, it is not a very common issue, it can help to get some real life advice. Thank you so much for the advice! I guess I am just hoping to figure things out like you said. The skin thinning was definitely a big concern to me, so it is good to know to monitor it and back off the Clobetasol if I notice that. When you reduce or stop using it, does your skin bounce back in thickness? And yeah, I am worried about this weirding my husband out but I am hoping it will just be something we learn to deal/work with. Hi do not be scared, it does not have to be that bad!  Mine is not, anyway.  Have you heard of Whole30?  It is a way of eating that is super healthy, and they actually have a Whole30 AIP (autoimmune protocol) that you can follow to keep symptoms at bay.  I try to keep the Clobetasol to a minimum because of the skin thinning.  I read on here somewhere else to use cerave moisturizing facial wash if you feel you must use a cleanser, otherwise try to just rinse gently with water only.  Honestly mine is not bad I think because I am doing these things and keeping stress to a minimum and always a shower before bed with the gentle rinsing.  Do not be embarrassed to speak up and ask questions, I have learned so much on this thread. Yes, one thing about LS is that you get very aware of difference in your vulva. I find it thickens up fast enough. The small tears can be painful I find when peeing and with contact with sperm.  I have no idea if that is specific to me. But it can get uncomfortable. Being consistent with the clobetasol is key I find. I was diagnosed a few years ago. The Clobetasol cleared it up quickly, and I use a maintenance dose 3X a week. I have experienced no problems since I started the medication. I get a checkup every year just to make sure nothing's changed. I will also add that I have a pretty high libido and it is unaffected.\n\nI have friends with lupus, one with MS, and one with rheumatoid arthritis. If I had to have an auto immune disease, this one is not bad. Thank you! I was thinking about whether there are dietary changes I can make that could be beneficial to me in this, as well, so I will definitely look into Whole30. This comment made me feel a lot better, so thank you so much! I know I need to be realistic but it is good to know that it is manageable. Touche in terms of AI diseases! In terms of libido, how long should I wait after applying Clobetasol before it is safe to have sex? I cannot seem to find anything on that. Like others have said, this is a totally manageable condition. It will get better. \n\nHere are some tips I picked up along the way from various experts:\n\n* Apply petroleum jelly to the area when not using the steroid. My dermatologist recommended this to protect the skin and prevent cancer. (I am **not** saying you will get cancer, just be careful with dry skin.) So if you apply the steroid in the evening, apply petroleum jelly in the morning and around lunchtime. I just take it with me when I use the bathroom. \n* Consider a nicer (read: weaker) steroid once Clobetasol gets things under control (less itching, tearing, etc.). Triamcinolone is an option. This was recommended by a doctor when I expressed concern about thinning skin. And it works. Plus, it is MUCH MUCH CHEAPER. \n* Not sure about your insurance situation, but always check GoodRx.com for pricing on your steroid. It saved my butt several times. You do not have to wait, unless you are going to have oral. I usually apply first thing in the morning after my shower. It really is! Medication is important, but honestly, trying to remember to take my reflux pills twice a day is much harder than remembering to put on a tiny bit of ointment M-W-F! How waz your biopsy experience? I have one scheduled in a few weeks and I am super nervous :( It actually was not too terrible, do not stress too much about it! The numbing shot stung a little but after that, it was pretty quick and painless. The whole procedure took less than 5 minutes and it healed up within a week. I think the worst part was the anticipation of my doctor trying to decide where to take the biopsy from. Good luck and hang in there! Do not let your mind run away from you, it is no worse than getting a typical immunization. Aww you are so sweet, thanks for the reply &lt;3 this made me feel a lot better. Thanks for sharing this. And thanks to all who replied! I just got diagnosed today and I am really upset and worried. My sister has had LS for years and has really suffered with it and experienced a lot of sexual dysfunction, but it is SO good to hear not everyone has that experience. I know I will learn to live with it regardless somehow, and life will go on, but hearing the diagnosis today was so hard. \n\nOn the up side, for a year now I have been struggling with the itching and the painful tearing and the pain with sex, so at least now (after trying antifungals and antibiotics and vaginal moisturizers and everything else that did not help!) I know what the cause is and I can make a treatment plan. \n\nI hope you have success with the Clobetasol and the other treatment options!! Your story could be mine as well, but in my case, I also developed lichen planus in my mouth. \n\nHow old are you? I am in my 60s, and past my childbearing years, but the scarring and such has made vaginal sex just not possible for me, too much pain is involved. My husband and I are still trying to find our way through what this means for us. My urologist has suggested a laser treatment for the scarring, but of course it is not covered by insurance. I guess pain-free sex is not really important. \n\nMy sister is currently incapacitated by MS, and my brother is dealing with the complications of being HIV-positive. u/PM_me_allthepuppies is correct, it is a rather benign kind of AI disease, but it still has implications for your quality of life, and of course there is the future risk of cancer that goes with it. Do not skip future monitoring for that last tidbit. yeah, mine was initially diagnosed as a staph infection. When the swab came back negative for staph, the nurse practitioner's response was to just keep using the topical antibiotic! No intent to investigate further. I just happened to have a regularly scheduled dermatologist appointment the week after, and asked her to take a look. LS. Yes! It is important to have regular visits with your gynecologist to make sure that everything is OK. This is a disorder which most of us will continue to have for all of our lives, unless/until new treatments are developed. Unfortunately, these autoimmune diseases still seem to be very mysterious as to why we get them or how they can be cured.\n\nGive my regards to your sister and brother; I hope both regain as much health as possible. I hope your doc can do something for your lichen sclerosus. &lt;3 I just had my 6 week check up after being diagnosed and wanted to thank everyone who commented for making me feel like this is manageable. \n\nMy doctor said things look good and we found it before any damage was done. She also said she was glad I decided to remove my IUD when I did because otherwise, who knows how long it would have been before I realized something was off. Guess I got lucky for not having any noticeable symptoms and for having a OBGYN who knew how to spot it. \n\nAnyway, I hope all of you are doing well and thanks for being my strength through a very scary surprise diagnosis! It really truly helped pull me out of a scared, lonely place.", "Lost after Diagnosis Ive just received my results from a particularly traumatic vulvar biopsy, and as I have suspected for 2 years, I have lichen sclerosis. Despite my suspicions, I feel very unprepared, very alone, and very confused. \n\nI just turned 24, and I have had symptoms for probably around 4 years. Every doctor before told me I had chronic yeast infections or that I was allergic to something in my environment. When I asked about LS specifically, I was told that I was way too young, and LS was way too obscure to consider. \n\nMy Fiance and I have been planning to start trying to have children right after we get married and now I feel like that is all gone... like I will not have the delivery options that are there for everyone else. \n\nI do not want to be angry, or upset, or embarrassed but I am finding it very difficult to process and I am hoping to find some encouragement, advice, or anything to make this easier to handle, as it feels very life-altering at the moment. Of course I am grateful to finally have an answer, but it is a bit much right now. I am so sorry if this sounds dramatic, I am just afraid and I do not really have anyone to discuss this with. There are several groups on FB that are very active and supportive. I would suggest starting there if you are looking for people to talk to! Oh, I hear you!!\n\nI can tell you that clobetasol was a life changer for me. I had similarly awful experiences with medical types telling me my pain did not exist. If I could channel that rage into something useful, it would be amazing. But once I got a diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the improvement was dramatic and fast for me. \n\nI had a 9 lb (and one ounce) baby well after diagnosis. Natural normal delivery and recovery. I used a lower-potency steroid (triamcinolone) a couple times when I felt like a flare wanted to start and it was fine. I was exhausted and sick as hell and he was two full weeks overdue, but none of that is related to LS. Everything healthy and fine. Better than my first delivery before diagnosis, with a worse tear, but I healed from both quickly and was up and around fine. (The shower after delivering just the BEST.) Delivering a baby is undeniably traumatic (and so is pregnancy), but if you are treated effectively, options are not off the table.  I used a doula to speak up for me and to help me through it. I cannot recommend a doula enough. You need somebody to massage your vagina with some oil? They will do it. You need somebody to tell the nurses you only wanted intermittent monitoring and no you are not hooking up to a monitor that will not let you move? They are there handling that for you. They can negotiate for trying tricks doctors do not care about to turn a baby that is sunny side up and not progressing. If you want a vaginal delivery and you know you have got challenges, look for a doula once you are pregnant.  \n\nSo, it is possible. It is not the same for everyone, but my experience was that family planning was not affected by LS. \n\nConsider it auto-immune. Keep yourself cared for. You might well be sensitive to something in the environment (detergent scents? Thongs?) that are setting off crappy chain reactions. \n\nHopefully you have some clob now and hopefully you will be improved in a few weeks. \n\nThere will be crappy days or weeks with pain, but hopefully they will be few and far between.   If treatment is effective, go do anything you want with your life and this may hopefully be a footnote. \n\nAnd communicate about pain. Do not endure the last five minutes of sex to please your partner. If you are already hurting, stop penetration. (Switch to oral?). Just stop. For you. That is got to be without shame or without anger or resentment. That is on your partner. It is inconvenient but livable. Thank you. Like seriously, thank you. Reading that it is possible to still have those experiences is so reassuring. My mother has always suggested a doula so I am absolutely on board with the idea. I have not gotten any treatment yet, I accessed the biopsy results via a patient portal so I have not heard from my Dr but im hopeful about treatment results. \n\nThankfully, my partner is incredibly supportive. He actually helped me monitor flares before I even knew what they were, bless him. \n\nI cannot express how much better this made me feel and I really appreciate your response. I went through something similar but (only?) a year to get diagnosed. I too was told by multiple doctors and even a gyno that it had to be yeast even though the cultures were negative. \n\nI was also told by one of the doctor\u2019s that I was too young to have lichen (mid-30s). \n\nWhen my dermatologist diagnosed me I was relieved to finally have a diagnosis but like you, I was gutted about the life-long part of it. \n\nI have not had any children yet so I cannot speak to how that goes but my dermatologist had told me there should not be any issues. \n\nWith treatment, lichen sclerosus is manageable. About a week or two after starting treatment with clob, the constant inflammation and irritation I had had for a year started to fade. It got better as time went on. I had forgotten what it was like to not have an irrited vulva.\n\nLichen sclerosus sucks but with treatment it really does get better. For me, it was important to get used to a new routine/ritual with using the clob so it became a natural part of my routine and after a while, I did not feel like my life was revolving around it anymore.\n\nThere is hope OP. Thank you so much for this response! I just got off the phone with my gyno and she is just sent over a prescription for clob and she is got some estrogen cream samples she wants to to try as well. I am feeling a lot less devastated (it comes in waves but it is not all-consuming now) and I have been able to look into it a bit more with a (somewhat) clear head. I am wondering if in your case you had any loss of architecture in the labia and if the treatment helped re-claim any of that at all? My labia minora, perineum, and clitoral hood have been affected but my Dr says that most of that should clear up with the clob. took me awhile to get diagnosed as well (also f 24) and was doubted by my doc when i mentioned LS due to my age. so annoying to not be taken seriously because of that. the clob and estrogen have helped me a ton and i hope you start feeling better soon!! That is great! I totally understand the all-consuming feeling. For me, it passed with time, especially once I started feeling better.\n\nI think I was lucky in the sense that I did not have a lot of architectural change before getting diagnosed. I had lost a little bit of labia minora but there was no fusing yet. \n\nI would not say that my labia is back to \u201cnormal\u201d but the damage definitely has not progressed. It is also less inflammed now so even with the architectural changes, it looks and feels better. \nClob also works on those white spots. Hello!\nFellow 24 year old woman with LS here! I am so sorry you are experiencing this. I am slowly getting off the wave of feeling what you are feeling now. Like you, I have LS. I suspected my symptoms began in 2015. My labia minora fused to my labia majora. I have irritation, white patches, and occasional itchiness. It definitely changed my sex life because I did not know I had it! My partner at the time of my diagnosis was not considerate and very aggressive. We never used lube, and also I was not on the clob when I was first diagnosed. \n\nThings have changed\u2026 i am single (woot woot!) I am using the clob every night for one month, every other night for the next month, then twice a week for the rest of my life. It is the ointment version which is better than the cream because it does not sting and it is potent! Obviously because everyone is case is different, listen to your doctor.\n\nI want to recommend this podcast, and this episode in particular because it will certainly give you hope, as well as tell you all about LS! \n\n \n\nSo many ladies with LS learn to cope in different ways and live their lives fully and confidently. I recommend following  on Instagram. She is the leading researcher for LS and also treats thousands of patients with LS. \n\nFor me, the diagnosis left me depressed, in mourning, fearful of the future, and numb. I cried and cried and felt that I would never find anyone who would be patient with me through this. But I have spoke to SOOOOO many women who have had this for years and are so strong and reassure me that your life WILL NOT revolve around your vulva!! Feel all these feelings, learn about LS, speak to women who have it! I am keeping you in prayer and sending you all the love my friend! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n(Editing this to say it is not as rare as you think to have LS at this age. Nearly all of the research on google that you see is so behind and old. The reason why doctors do not diagnose young patients is because LS symptoms tend to worsen in post-menopausal women due to the drop in estrogen levels\u2014 leading to more itching and heightened symptoms. You are NOT a weird rare case girl!) I am 28, I have LS! It is really not as uncommon as doctors think. I have a hunch it gets misdiagnosed. Loss of architecture does not happen to everyone but it certainly can if you itch the area too often. I was told to keep it that area VERY moisturized. I use coconut oil 2x daily. It is safe for the vulva and can be used as a lube. The last thing I want is for my clitoris hood to fuse over or worse, the labia minora completely disappear. Moisture prevents fusing! \n\nThere is a lichen sclerosis support group on Facebook I joined. I learned that the white skin and fusing can be reversed with a borax sitz bath. For reference I have the link. ( Me too! And then finally I saw a new doc who diagnosed me immediately, no question. I see a dermatologist now as well as my obgyn for it which I have found helpful! Came here just to scroll, I have been diagnosed and treating it for 3 years now, but this post made me (24f) feel better too! I am coming down from a 2-month stress flare-up (thank goodness for the topical medications) and it was a reminder that this condition is not always linear. And reading this made me feel hopeful again! We have had success getting LS symptoms extremely well controlled with a combination of ThermiVa and platelet rich plasma injection (PRP). For the latter we do the usual \"O shot\" (PRP injection) but then also use a microcannula to deliver PRP comfortably to the labia minor and clitoral hood regions directly. ThermiVa is a series of 3 treatments standard ( one a month x 3). Usually our LS patients need the PRP more than once in the first 6 months, but after that can start to go longer in between sessions. We have some doing a PRP + 1 ThermiVa for maintenance every 6 to 9 months and not depending on any topical. I should add that we do a high dose PRP, meaning we do a 120ml blood draw,so the number of platelets and thus the amount of growth factor delivered is \"peak\". Some places that do \" PRP\" only draw 30 ml of blood so that will be a weaker treatment and results might not be as good.. Hope that helps. Your OBGYN can contact me directly if she would like to discuss this! I train docs and nurses on how to perform these procedures, which I have been doing since 2015. What were your symptoms? I mostly had general irritation. My vulva was constantly red and irritated. It was not itchy though, just irritated and uncomfortable. But eventually, my labia minora started to shrinking which is probably what finally got me diagnosed. The irritation was there all day long? Pretty much. There were days where it was better than others but there was always some level of inflammation. Can I message you? Sure", "Pain Confusion A bit of backstory: I was diagnosed with LS in January 2021 after noticing two white spots.  I went back for a follow-up after using clob daily 2x/day for about 9-10 weeks. The light spots spread, and I was having pain in the form of aching/soreness, but no other issues.  I mentioned this to the doctor and she said pain is not usually associated with LS, and suggested I might have vulvar vestibulitis. Everything I have read about LS mentions pain as a symptom, so I am curious to know what kind of pain you experience as a result of LS, aside from stinging or pain resulting from tearing.\n\nTL;DR: Doctor said pain is not a normal LS symptom but the internet disagrees. What kind of pain are you experiencing from LS aside from pain associated with tearing, if any? Pain and soreness are both common and \"official\" LS symptoms. Sounds like your doctor got things mixed up. \n\nVestibulodynia/vulvodynia/clitorodynia are sets of symptoms, not diagnoses, kind of like \"headache.\" So you could, for instance, have vestibulodynia that was due to LS. I think that would be the proper term if the pain or sensitivity stays even when the LS has calmed down.\n\nI have a sensitivity in my vestibule, such that a q-tip feels like a sharp object, but it does not hurt all the time (like when it is not being touched). I do not know if it is because of LS. I also have had occasional aching pain, like my vulva was bruised all over, even though I had not done anything to it. I also used to get that kind of pain after bike riding. I often get a scratchy tearing sensation around my fourchette that is aggravated by walking around, but I think that is due to micro-tears rather than directly from inflammation. Pain not being part of LS is sure news to me.  When mine flares badly, it feels like somebody taking a belt sander to my nether regions (I have got it all the way from the little dimple at the very top of my butt down to my clitoris).  When it is just a little flare, it is sore and sometimes itchy.\n\n\n\nYour doctor is wrong.  You should find one that knows what they are talking about.  My LS was misdiagnosed (as a fungal infection!) and left untreated for many years.  That is a bad thing and you do not want that. Yeah. She sounded knowledgeable when I initially spoke with her after being diagnosed by my GP, but that follow-up left a bad taste. I am following up with my GP (who also does gyno) this week. I cannot have this getting out of control.", "Sex help I was diagnosed with LS back in 2016. I have gone through a lot of feeling down and embarrassed that I did not want anyone down there. I recently started dating someone and we decided to have sex (my first time). I tore in the perineal area and it bled a little and now stings. I feel like my partner was not enjoying it because he felt like he was causing too much pain. Any time he even tried to insert if it hit that area I wanted to cry. We decided to stop and let it heal. Any tips? Does this get better??? We tried oral before for a natural lubricant and water based but the problem is that lower part of the vaginal opening. I have not had a flare up for months (after I used my clob cream) but I noticed that area where it ripped has turned white (was not in 2019). \nI could use any tips and tricks like how to prevent the scarring even when I am not having flare ups. But mainly the sex tips. I feel like a failure and I want to be able to do it and enjoy it. My boyfriend is very supportive and sweet but I cannot imagine how he feels that we cannot just have sex like \u201cnormal\u201d people. So, I have a very similar issue to this, I often get tearing in the lower / back part of the vaginal opening from sex. The skin there just is not very strong I guess. It can also happen without sex sometimes. And then it stings for a few days until it heals up.\n\nI do not really have any tips for LS management, as I have not really managed to make it better, beyond using the ointment. \n\nFor sex though, what helps me is making sure I am really, really turned on, before we do any PIV at all. Lube does not really work for me, I do not like how it feels and mostly get irritation from it, but I know it works for some. Spit, from oral or otherwise, is also not helpful at all for me. It is not viscous enough to really protect the skin. So for me the only thing that helps is making sure I am really turned on, so that there is a lot of \u2018natural lube\u2019 involved, it that makes sense. The more turned on a woman is, the more the vaginal canal relaxes too, which makes tearing less likely. Also, making sure to keep clitoral stimulation going during PIV helps so that I stay in that really turned on/ excited place. \n\nOn days when I am not up for PIV at all, there are plenty of other things we do to still have a sex life too. I enjoy giving oral, but not receiving it, but my husband has gotten very good at making me climax using his hands for example. Oh honey! What a rough intro to sex. I am so sorry it did not go as you must have hoped. Now that you have a first-time out of the way I hope it gets better from here. \n\nAbsolutely give yourself time to heal before you try penetrative sex again. You will know you are good to go if he can use his hands and fingers all around and inside you without pain.  You may also want to try being on top (aka \u201ccowgirl\u201d) when you try again - that will let you control the angle and depth and speed to penetration.  Sit up straighter or lean forward, whatever is working better fit you. \n\nIf your skin is all white, you were having a quiet flare. Use the clob for a week or two and wait for the skin to get back to normal. (Note, that works for me. If your doc has given you different instructions, by all means ignore me.) Do not try penetrating sex again until the skin is happy and his fingers do not hurt. Maybe even introduce a toy - you are looking for a basic dildo there. If you can insert that repeatedly without pain, you can try a penis next. \n\nNext tip is: You fucking love going down. You love sucking cock. It is the best. Blow jobs are amazing. If this can be true for you, you do not have much to worry about relationship-wise. If you are getting busy and realize you might be having pain and you are worried about it, stop the PIV plan and switch to the oral plan. No dude is going to complain if you sometimes suddenly and enthusiastically have a need to blow him right away. Use your hands, get good at this, find out what feels amazing to him, and you will snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. I know this sounds sexist and awful - what about you? I am all for getting yours too, but my assumption is that it is going to be tough because you had some little pain but you still want to end up snuggled with a happy man wrapped around you and the pain is not enough to distract you as long as you are not banging on it. A good blow job gets you everything except your own satisfaction, and you can pick that up later. Or first, next time. And you still get the warm happy cuddly man all snuggled around you after a blowjob. Fall in love with blowjobs. They do not hurt and everybody is happy. Get so much practice. Be amazing. \n\nThat is my graphic tip. It might be awkward for you since you are new to sex. But it really can be fun, and if your boyfriend can give you good verbal feedback you will wind up watching him come unhinged with pleasure. It is a good thing. And hopefully it inspires him to do the same for you. \n\nSpeedy healing to you!! Thank you so much! I never liked receiving oral but my boyfriend is very good about making sure I am comfortable that he gave me oral and made me climax then we tried penetration right after and it seemed like it helped some I do not know if it hurt still just because I did not let that little tear rip. I am like the same sometimes if I strain from a BM or even fingers sometimes can cause those little tears. Thank you. Honestly gives me hope that I am not the only one and it is common because my friends and family cannot relate. Thank you!! We have done a lot of oral just because I was really nervous to have sex with the LS, he is weird though and enjoys giving more than getting!! But loves it when we are both giving and getting. I cannot tell the difference if the skin color changing is a flare up or scaring. Is there a way to know? Because usually with my flare ups it gets irritated and itchy but usually at the top where my major meets is where I have my flare ups I never even knew that lower part was an issue until I looked for the tear and saw it white. My doctor has me do a strict regimen of when I am flaring up to do twice daily for like 1 month then back it down to once daily for 2 months then every other day until the flare up is done then I do not use it again until I have another flare up. Go to your Dr and ask about Thymosin Alpha. Ita a peptide used for Immune Functuon. It cured my LS back in Feb (think feb). No symptoms since. It was $450 for 1 course of treatment.  So worth thr money. I took it for I think 10 days. I can go back and look if you need more info. Hey! First off, it may take some time and some trial and error, but you are going to be fine, and your sex life is going to be fine. Fully understanding and internalizing that is key because we often subconsciously tense up if we are worried (either about satisfying ourselves/partners or about pain). For me, the first step to overcoming this mental hurdle was to never, ever continue if it started hurting (doing so reinforced in my brain that sex = pain). I also talked to my partner and we agreed that I would be the only one to initiate sex. (His initiating triggered my worry about satisfying him/his expectations and caused me to tense up during sex. Then I would continue anyway, which would hurt more and further reinforce \u201csex = pain, and my partner needs sex,\u201d causing a vicious cycle. Do not fall down the same rabbit hole I did!) \n\nAs for physical tips, coconut oil is the only lube I have tried that does not make me burn. We used that for years, and it helped a little, but I recently discovered CBD lube (even found a brand that was just coconut and hemp oil! Called Foria), and wow has that made a big difference. They have an arousal oil and suppositories too, which are also helpful. I feel way less pain (basically none) and way more pleasure (which I have been losing as my clit fuses over, sadly). IMPORTANT NOTE: You cannot use oil-based lube with condoms! If you depend on condoms, you should try to find a water-based lube instead. \n\nI tend to get the tears in the same place you do from sex, and over time all these things have helped. My doctor also prescribed a numbing ointment, which I initially used for a while before I kind of broke the mental cycle that was causing me problems. That helped a lot in breaking that cycle.\n\nOther than that, I would def recommend talking to your doctor and making sure your current approach to LS is working. If you are having symptoms (yes, discoloration/tearing count, even if you are not also itchy), she may want to have you try increasing the frequency of your steroid or trying a different steroid. I have had to do both. \n\nBest of luck!!! Let me know if you have any questions. Happy to help. This has been a long learning process for me. Was diagnosed around the same time as you at a fairly young (for LS) age. Thank you so much! Definitely getting over that subconsciously tense up is hard but trying!! For me.... I noticed the water base line, \" dried up too fast\" I use a silicone base... I even resorted to a stupid dildo to just get me to climax so there is extra natural lube... He has to go in SUPER, SUPER SLOW UNTIL I GIVE THE HO AHEAD... AND EVEN THEN, he has to go slow. .. I have suffered with avoiding him because am humiliated, feel DISGUSTING,( ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE YEAST INFECTIONS SEEM TO HAPPEN A LOT MORE) *lube", "London specialist recommendations? Hi, I\u2018m looking for a dermatologist or gynecologist to diagnose me. I suspect I have LS because of different symptoms including white patch on inside of labia minora.\nI would prefer a female doctor.\nPlease share if you know someone good! Thank you. Dr Victoria Swale.\n\nElse a very good gent, Professor  Christopher Bunker Thinking of going to Dr Bunker for male LS. Have you any experience personally? I have seen him twice, very very professional and very nice bloke. Big cricket fan if you want an ice breaker... He is extremely thorough and will take his time with questions etc. Great, I am planning a trip to london around Sept so I will see if I can get a referral to see him then. Did you just go to your GP and say, this is what I think I have, can you refer me to this Dr..? Kind Of.. I got referred to a urologist.. NHS took ages, got lucky and found out I had private healthcare through work. Saw urologist twice, Asif Muneer in Elstree hospital who referred me to Prof Bunker. \n\nIf you are self paying, get your gp to write you a referral letter to a dermotologist.. tell them you want to see professor Bunker and then call his secretary to arrange appointment. He does have an NHS clinic at Chelsea and Westminster but I am sorry I have no idea how long it would take to see him. He is one of the top derms in the country, I am going to guess the turnaround to see him through the NHS is massive buddy so do it privately if you can!!! King Edward hospital. I have private health insurance but he doesnt seem that expensive either so hopefully it goes well. Hope it worked out for you Thank you! Did you manage to see Dr Swale through the NHS or privately? I would like to go through NHS if that is in any way possible No but she does have a day at the royal free in London with the NHS \n\n Highly recommend Dr Beski. She has both a private and NHS practice. She is one of the only doctors in the country who performs the stem cell treatment for lichen sclerosis.  Thank you!! Do you know how to get an appointment with her through NHS? Can my GP refer me directly to her? Mine seems very unhelpful The way it often works is to pay to see a specialist privately once and they will then write to your NHS GP and ask you to refer them via the NHS. Did this loads of times before I had private medical insurance. You could potentially ask for a referral to her specifically first and see if she or he will do it? If your GP is unhelpful can you register with another one? Another idea is to call her office and just ask her PA what is the best way to get referred via the NHS. Update for anyone who sees this, Dr. Swale is now retired Privately?\n\n", "Protopic- tacrolimus ointment Hi all!\n\nJust wondering if anyone else was prescribed Protopic (tacrolimus ointment) in addition to steroids? I am using it but am not confident it is actually helping. Feedback on results and how you are using it (everyday? Once a week?) would be very helpful! I was told to use K-Y to stop sticking of foreskin, but it caused a huge white patch !\nSo now use vaseline if I need something to stop sticking or adhesions, but dermatologist advises caution because long term risk, hence the original recommendation. This is for use between twice weekly betamethasone.\nThe description for Tacrolimus is non steroid treatment for dermatitis. \n\nGood luck. I was on a one month Protopic treatment. With an additional month of Cutivate, I am now in full remission.", "Is there any treatment for men that does not involve corticosteroids and circumsicion?  Yes. \nTacrolimus and pimecrolimus ( ointments that reduce inflammation through immunosuppresing the area ) they are mainly made for eczema but are used for LS and their side effect profile is safe with no adverse effects even babies and infants they use it. \n\nGo to a dr and get a confirmed diagnoses then discuss treatment options. \n\n\nWhat are your symptoms? Do you have burning pain and itchiness or just discoloration? There are, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus creams, but they are generally viewed as fallback options if steroids are not working or steroids are not recommended due to other conditions. They have a materially lower success rate than ultra potent steroids. Thanks for the answer! It is just a discoloration, at first I thought it was fungal infection because of how similar it looks to it but after using anti fungal cream for 2 months and without seeing any effects I started researching what it could really be and lichen sclerosus seems to be most similar to what I have. It is only visual issue but a big one, it looks like if i had an STD so obviously I am scared of having sex and my mental health is in ruins because of it.", "Does this look like LS?  I was told that white patches on/around perineum usually meant LS. \n\nAnd the right side of my inner labia is definitely bigger than the left, wondering if the left is starting to fuse. Differences in labia is 100 normal every one has one side of their body bigger than the other be it foot hand boobs testicles etc etc\n\nPicture is too poor quality but that skin discoloration in the perianal area is atypical", "Females, what kind of pants/shorts do you wear for working out (that do not irritate)? I love yoga pants but LS does not love yoga pants. What types of clothing do you wear for exercise (running, yoga, lifting, etc.) that do not give you issues? Also, what type of underwear? Or no underwear? Sometimes I need to wear underwear to protect myself from my pants riding up but if I can find the right pants and underwear that would be stellar. I find that my favorite yoga pants (or skinny jeans) can give me a flare up... especially if it is hot outside... not always, but sometimes.\n\nGive me your favorite brands and styles. Since I work out in my home, I wear my white 100% cotton boxers and no shorts or pants. I do 100 % cotton men\u2019s long boxers with dresses. They are long enough that they do not ride up they go down to mid thigh. Best underwear ever. I love this. Love this idea. Thank you :) I have been wearing basic Hanes 100% cotton bikini cut but they usually leave a panty line. Boxers sound like they would work well for loose fitting things. Your welcome I found them at target", "Structural loss on glans\u2026 Have any men here experienced structural loss on your glans? I am very self conscious about it. It looks like one side of my glans is under developed. It is almost as if there is no start or end to the glans and the shaft. It is only been getting worse. A cream I tried made it even worse and cause heavy peeling. Never fully been diagnosed because im a circumcised male and it is as if they do not want to go against he idea that it happens only to uncircumcised men. Been applying colbatesol on and off. Idk it seems to get better then worse etc. I just wish I never had structural loss. Overall the color would not bother me that much. Has anyone had reconstruction surgery? I am only 23 and do not want to lose my sensitivity but also really want to have a sex life. if you can post some photos is better, you may not have this disease man I do not know what else it can be! I have/had all the symptoms, skin discoloration, white thick patches, when it first started skin peeling/itchiness, and they have taken a skin sample and said they found nothing I assume they only look for stds though.", "Does this look like LS?  I have been struggling for years. Doctors cannot figure out what the white patches are. My gyno brought up the possibility of LS. White patches and the small blue circle shows a tear. \n\nI am seeing him in Nov, an may get a biopsy or be referred to a specialist. \n\nLooking for some insight. I feel so defeated. I cannot help you with the picture because I am not a doctor, but regarding the sex, my doctor said that the cream is quite strong so it is best to either have intercourse on days when you are not using it, or to wipe the area with a wet cloth beforehand. The cream will have absorbed within a few hours that you apply it, so even if you wipe the area off afterwards you do not have to apply it again, but you do need to wipe in case there is a layer of the cream remaining on your skin as this might hurt your partner. \n\nMy own experience with clobetasol has been very positive. The first week I would feel very  itchy right after applying it (probably because of rubbing the area) but after 5/10 minutes it would numb the itching for the rest of the day. I initially used it everyday, then my doctor told me to do a day off and a day on, and then 2 days off 1 day on. \n\nWhen staggering it, I had a phase where on the days when I was not taking it, I would feel very itchy. I did apply the cream anyway on those days because it was unbearable. This passed after about two weeks and now I can go on the two days without applying it, no problem. I have not had symptoms (aside from the white patch which looks fainter but will never go away) for about a month now and will have a follow up appointment in november. \n\nI hope this was helpful, and please do use your cream if the doctor has told you to use it... it is very important! Best of wishes I am not too sure if the circled areas are LS, lots of people have fordyce spots and they look similar in texture. I also have this similar texture, but I am waiting on my biopsy results. You should honestly get a biopsy to really make sure. I feel like the Center clitoral area that is white and looks like it may be fusing might be LS. I do not really have said \u2018white patches\u2019 \u2014 just painful infercourse, burning &amp; itching.\n\nFor the ointment, there is no problem having sex. I have not had issues and I spoke to my gyno, and she kept asking me how sex was going. The sooner you start using it the better. I have been using it for 1.5 months and my symptoms still come and go. It also slid around and burned my bum cheeks a bit.\n\nDo you have any other symptoms?\nHope you feel better and can get some solid answers soon! It does not really look like LS but only dr can confirm Thank you- going to the dermatologist next week Thank you- this was very helpful to read- good to know about the cream! Thank you for your help. I had a biopsy in Jan 2020, and I was told it was HYPERKERATOSIS AND SQUAMOUS HYPERPLASIA... basically its not cancer. So they did not test for LS. But the spots have spread greatly since then. \n\nIve been noticing my clitoral hood has been looking odd. No idea what the white patch is. That Is new. \n\nAfter reading the responses I feel better using the cream.\n\nFingers crossed for solid answers. Thanks again! Yes, definitely do not worry too much about using it. Is it cream or ointment? My gyno said the cream tends to be uncomfortable and the ointment is better. If you have the cream and feel discomfort, do not be afraid to ask for the ointment! I think you are on the right track!\n\n\ud83d\udc95 Thank you! I think I have the ointment.. its clear, but I will look when I get home. Thank you!!", "Any stories of hope? I just got a biopsy to see if I have LS that I am still waiting on. I have had severe itching (among other things) for 4 months that started after I had surgery for endo. I do not know if this is a weird reaction, or the stress of that surgery triggered this flare?\n\nAnyway, my doc thinks it could be LS as a short course of prednisone cleared the itching meaning there was some inflammatory / autoimmune component.\n\nI used to be a super sexual person. I got married in April and the last thing I want to do is have sex. I feel awful about myself and for my partner (who is so patient and kind). I guess I am looking for any words of wisdom, guidance on how to not doom spiral about rhis. Between the endo, IC, vulvodynia and possible LC I feel broken :/ \n\nI am 34 and want to have kids but just feel so defeated :/", "NSFW Going of first impressions, does this look like LS? So I have explained my story before and stuff but intill I see my doc in December just want to know what you guys think. The link has ten pics so please look at all of them. I am so stress that my derm cannot get me in sooner if it is LS I do not understand why they cannot get me in right away.\n\n Judging by pics, I dont think you have LS. \n\nBut only a trained dr can confirm If it is it is very mild. Again my advise would be to see a dermatologist who has other LS patients \nGood luck. Thank u sir, I cannot see him till december\ud83e\udd7a I will know December and see if ur prediction is true I do not think it will progress much if its LS by then.\nGood luck. Ok thank u since you are cut its rather unlikely that this is LS. as of 2020 over 90% of men suffering from LS were cured in 3 months after circumcision and never had to deal with the desease again.\nbut this is just statistics. only a doctor can tell for sure. Thanks for this Do u have any idea of other possibilities of what it is sadly i dont have an idea. to me it doesnt even look unhealthy. but i havent studied medicine. im a automation engineer, i am knowledgable about statistics and know a thing or two about how to spot a shitty study. Did u see the pics? All of yhem different question: do you have any other symptoms? itching, burning pain, haemorrhages? just had a look at  them. the darker spots look kind of weird. are they persistent or did they appear in the last 14 days? Darker spots are from circumcision when I was little I think tbh i cant tell, if there is something. ask your doc in december and monitor changes until then. also get a notebook and write down symptoms together with day and month. if you have an itch, write it down. if you feel pain write it down. at the end of a week look at your notes. is there any kind of pattern? did symptoms disappear or persist? did it get worse or stayed the same? things like that. right before you see the doctor, you have to organize all those notes and then tell him/her.", "Rant: gynaecologist choosing not to provide care out of spite. I do not understand how some doctors are fine with just dismissing their patients. Choosing not to believe us because they do not find it valuable or worth their time? \n\nI continually sit in their office crying and begging to be heard, just for them to say\u2026 nope! Better luck next time. And this goes on for YEARS.\n\nI have been in itching agony for four years now. And pain during sex just started a year ago. It is unbearable and I fear it is never going to get better. But since the gyno \u201ccannot really see THAT much paleness\u201d on my vulva, it is not worth their time. \n\nMy family doctor FINALLY acknowledged that something was wrong and that I probably have lichen sclerosus. Sent me to the gyno for it to be confirmed but I did not even get a biopsy\u2026 I took time off from my brand new job for this waste of time. \n\nHer receptionist made me feel awful about getting upset about not being heard, and said the only reason I got this useless appointment is because their other patient DIED. Could they be any more insensitive? It is like they did this just to spite me. Maybe I am just being too self involved, but I cannot deal with not being taken seriously anymore. You need to be referred to a dermatologist instead. This is BS. Never go back to this gyno. I feel weird about showing my coochie to a dermatologist, maybe just because I do not associate them with vagina issues. \n\nAlso, my derm switched from clinical to cosmetic and it is REALLY hard to find a new doctor in Canada. I do not know how to go about this. Feels like this will never ever ever be solved LS is a skin disorder, and not a gynecological disorder. You need a dermatologist. Find a proper one, and not just a cosmetic one. Or just continue to suffer. You can find gyn-derm or genital dermatologists, but you will likely need to travel a bit to get to them. Unfortunately some gyns can be clueless and you need to give up on this doctor who has not bothered to help you with your pain. You could call around and ask different practices- gyn or derm- to see who works with LS. I wish you relief.. for now I suggest applying whatever the strongest over the counter steroid ointment is in your country and trying borax soaks. I have a regular dermatologist that diagnosed my vulvar LS. She also diagnosed my butt psoriasis. Skin problems can occur anywhere; a good derm will not shy away. (That said, the first derm I saw was totally weird about it, and ignorant to boot.)\n\nSadly, I think you have to keep trying until you find a decent doctor. You could also try back with your GP. You could call her and tell her you had a terrible experience at the gyno, and they did not offer you any solutions, and is there any chance the GP could prescribe you a steroid like clobetasol and you could at least see if it helps. I am planning to stick with my family doctor. I finally got to see a urologist after a 6 month wait (due in part to the pandemic) the appointment was 30 seconds long - \"looks like the Clob is working\", he asked if I struggle to pee (no), and that was it. That is awful! Absolutely stand up for your own health. We know our bodies and what is normal and not normal. I have felt brushed off many times and it took me years to get help. Although my experience was not quite as bad, it was not easy either. \n\nWhen I complained to my GP of insistent itching and pain on my vulva he actually gave me diaper rash cream. Not once did he attempt to do an examination so I asked for a referral to a gynaecologist. Once the gynaecologist took one look at it she immediately did a biopsy. Once lichen sclerosis was confirmed as the diagnosis she immediately referred me to gynaecologist colonoscopy clinic who specializes in gynaecological disorders and cancer. \n\nSince LS is an auto immune skin disorder which normally can be treated with a dermatologist, it is a whole different ball game when it is on the vulva. 10 years after I first started itching I ended up developing vulvar cancer. It is a very rare cancer and many doctors still do not know much about it, so the symptoms are always overlooked. Although LS alone is not a cause, LS is frequently found along side vulvar cancer which takes years to develop so it is imperative to keep fighting for yourself. Pain and insistent itching is not normal and should not be ignored. If a biopsy will not be given because it is \u201cnot pale enough\u201d then request a referral to a colposcopy clinic to assess the vulva for any skin disorders the naked eye cannot see. Good luck. I am so sorry that happened to you\u2026 it is so ridiculous how little research is done in this area. \n\nAnd thank you! My biopsy is not until Dec 17th. They (begrudgingly) said they could get me in Nov 26th but I said no because I am out of town that weekend for my boyfriend\u2019s birthday and I have had this planned since June. Another reason I took the later date is because I hope by then they will be a little bit nicer? I am in the process of finding other doctors who can help me though. Congrats on the biopsy date. I hope you get some answers now and can finally begin the path to healing. I was diagnosed by a dermatologist, if this helps.", "Is this LS  It does not appear to be Does not look like anything to me. Be thankful. Seek the care of a doctor if you have itching or skin breaking.", "Tips? I was diagnosed 5 years ago (by 2 doctors) at 23. I have the dryness, itchiness, stinging and a small inner labia but I do not have the white patches (which is nice but confusing, could not do a biopsy). I do have the scarring and atrophy. Has anyone found that their flare ups come at a consistent time every month? Or has a diet change helped? I use Elidel cream from my dermatologist at night which has stopped the stinging part of the flares. It strengthens skin and I like that I can use it without risking thinning my skin with steroids. Anyones else using Elidel? One of the most difficult things is not being able to predict when I will be ok and able to have sex. Even when I think I feel fine and ready it can end up being painful. I have a narrow window when I am ovulating where I can have  pain-free sex but that is still not always the case. It has really taken a toll on my partner and me. Desperate to take control of this somehow instead of it controlling me and stopping me from enjoying life. I have even had the mona lisa laser sessions done and it helped some but not enough. So I would love to hear what you have learned about diet, or specific tampons or toilet paper that help, specialists to see or anything that makes sex less uncomfortable. I am lucky, it could certainly be worse, but I need to do more. Thanks in advance.  Hey girl! \n\nFirst of all, there is unfortunately no way around the steroid cream - if you need it, you need it. But it is great that you have a solution that does not require it all the time. On top of that, I have a cream that protects my skin. I use it every morning, so that when I need to use toilet paper, I wipe the cream off and not my skin. This has helped tremendously.\n\nI do not know about the sex part. When I am aroused, I do not feel any itchiness or pain. I hope you get good tips on here.\n\n What is the cream that protects your skin? I live in Germany, so I do not know if you have it, but the brand is Bepanthol, this particular cream is Wund- und Heilsalbe, and the ingredient is 5% Dexpanthenol (there are other brands that use this too). Not sure if I have many tips. I use a menstrual cup which I find is way better than pads or tampons for me. When I have flare ups I try to use the least amount of toilet paper. \nAs for sex, it can certainly be difficult. A\nLoving and understanding partner is a good thing. In my case, I find meeting a new partner stressful. I feel the need to explain why I look different.  I have some atrophy but so far my clitoris has stayed intact. I can get quite itchy after sex.   I wish you the best of luck How was the Mona Lisa treatment? I was intrigued but it looks painfull and is really expensive here. It was not extremely painful because of the numbing cream. Then it is sort of sore and raw feeling for the next 24 hours but you keep it covered in Aquaphor so it is pretty manageable. My main issue was I was extremely itchy for weeks after as it healed. Like I needed a prescription for Lidocaine. I was concerned I was going to add more damage with all the itching. Overall, the sessions take place over such a long period of time I sort of forgot where I started and could not tell how much it really helped. I did not have a clear before and after. I think it did help some though and I am glad I did it because it is not an unknown option anymore. But overall, I am still dealing with dryness, itchiness, and the tight/shrunken feeling I have felt in the past.  Thank you! How often would you say you use the clobetasol? i am going to my dermatologist to ask what is an acceptable number of times a month to use it, but thought i would ask what works for you.  I really cannot tell you that because it went down as follows: I was diagnosed and then my obgyn put me on the following schedule: first month once a day, second month once every two days, third month twice a week. Now I only use another cream which does not have to be prescribed. It protects the skin from urine, humidity, etc. Should the itching start again, I am to see the doctor again and I will get more clobetasol. It seems like it should be used for some time so that the problem goes away and stays away, at least for some time.", "Can LS Attack only the outer lip where pubic hair grows? I have some discolouration there following a period of intense itch. Pic in my profile.\n\nIs this LS? you would have to get this confirmed via biopsy, but LS can affect all over the vulva, clitoris, ass, even elsewhere on the body (less common) Can confirm. Just had a small outbreak under the boobs. Yes, though it is much more common on mucosa (in the mouth, on the inner labia). Mine is mostly in the inner labia but it is spread to the anus and the skin folds outside of the labia... past where the hair tends to grow. It can actually happen anywhere on the body including the scalp. Yes. Vulvar LS can present anywhere on the vulva, which includes the hair bearing lips (Labia majora). That said, I am not a doctor so I cannot say for certain if it is LS. You would need to go see a doctor and potentially get a biopsy for a differential diagnosis as this could be a couple things. Yes, most likely. I have chronic LS. I am almost certain I have it on my scalp and inside my ears. There is actually a form of Lichen called Planopilaris that primarily effects the scalp, so I would not be surprised.\n\nHonestly, when we thought this was all Psoriasis, I was fairly certain it is... basically everywhere including my scalp, ears, back, chest, hands, feet, knees. Add the anogenital region and the mouth where I most certainly have... I guess those are definitely Lichen because they ulcerate... yeah that is pretty much the entire body.\n\nSuddenly it makes a whole lot more sense why I go through this inflammatory stage with my skin and swear what is left over is scar tissue (it tears so easily). I have no idea what is Psoriasis and what is Lichen (my feet and nails are pretty classic Palmoplantar Psoriasis).\n\nUgh! I do not understand ANYTHING anymore. -Facepalm-", "Burn from clobetasol. I have been using clobetasol every day for 6 weeks now, I still have another 6 weeks to go as per my gyno and the one that did my colposcopy. \n\nI noticed that I got an extreme burn from it on my bum from it sliding around. I only use a very small pea sized amount for the entire area and use the leftover on my anus as my gyno \u2018thinks\u2019 my itching in that end is also LS. (Though I think it may be hemorrhoids, but regardless steroids are used to calm that too.)\n\nI managed to get the burn to go away, with the use of polysporin and I stopped putting it in that area.\n\nNow I am noticing that me perineum is also starting to burn like crazy. (I was told to put it there as well.)\n\nI spoke to my gyno about the clob not really helping, that my constant burning/itching always comes back even after 6 weeks of treatment. Now with these \u2018burns\u2019 I am starting to get concerned that maybe I should not be using the clob. I asked her for another solution and she told me that using a lower steroid will not work well enough to treat this.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nI am still waiting for my biopsy results, so I do not really consider this \u2018confirmed\u2019 yet.\n\nHope you are feeling well today! This may be completely off from your specific circumstances, but I wanted to throw it out there in case it was helpful.\n\nHas your doctor explored the option that your symptoms might be an allergy? I have one Dr who thinks I have LS, but my gyno does not agree, so I have been looking into other possibilities. My gyno has been treating my symptoms (constant burning feeling) with estrogen cream, but it was not really doing much. I stumbled upon research discussing the idea that vaginal mucous can be affected by allergies, just like sinuses can. Adding a daily Claritin (morning) and a Benadryl (night) dose has significantly helped me. I am waiting to go back into the doctor for a follow-up, but I think my issues may be allergy related and might have been triggered by several rounds of antibiotics / yeast infection medications last fall, creating a hypersensitivity to yeast. \n\nThe whole thing is incredibly frustrating, especially with conflicting theories, the wait to see drs and no real answers. I hope you get clarity on your symptoms soon.\n\nEdit: Adding a link to an article discussing allergic vaginitis- \n Thank you for sharing! I had a urologist prescribe me strong allergy pills just to \u2018calm the inflammation\u2019 it was more of a bandaid solution, and they cause drowsiness, so I never took them. (As I do not see how I could function taking something in the morning that makes me drowsy. And I would need to take it twice a day.)\n\nI tried switching my laundry detergent about a week ago, and I noticed a small improvement. Maybe it takes time to fully get out of my system?\n\nWill you be doing some sort of allergy test? I am waiting for my biopsy results, so I suppose that would tell me if it is some sort of allergic reaction.\n\nMy only other option at this point is to try stopping my low dose hormonal birth control after I get my biopsy results. \n\nThank you for your suggestions and kind words, maybe I will try a different form of allergy pills with less side effects.\n\nI hope you find clarity soon as well! \ud83d\udc95 Ah, if the urologist thought it might help, maybe a less aggressive allergy medication would also help. I was surprised that Claritin helped as much as it did, and it is non drowsy. I make sure to space out the Claritin and Benadryl, since they are both antihistamines, taking one in the morning and one at night. My tissue went from looking very pale and almost white (which is why one Dr thought it was LS) to back to pink. Def worth discussing with your Dr to see if it might help. I am not entirely ruling out LS yet, but hopeful it might be an allergy instead.\n\nI switched my laundry detergent as well. I imagine it probably takes a little while for inflammation to go down. From what I have read I will need to do a skin prick test with an allergist next to check for various allergies, including candida. I am not sure if a biopsy would include that sort of result, but maybe?\n\nAt this point we are trying various things and I am going in for follow-ups every month or so. We were just starting to address the issue in the spring, and then everything shut down because of covid so I have just been dealing with the symptoms all summer. My gynecologist was really only seeing pregnant patience or people with urgent needs during that time. It is finally gotten bad enough that I needed to address things, but it is still such a slow process. I am trying not to use Dr Google but feel like I need to do my own research to try to narrow down possibilities and find an answer.\n\nIf you are interested, I can send you links to the other articles and studies I have found on allergic vaginitis. I totally feel you! Antihistamines reduce inflammation, and I was taking a different antihistamine at some point which also was not really helping. But I will definitely have to try Claritin  and Benadryl to see if those maybe work! At this point I am willing to try anything!\nI have an ongoing list of demands for when I get my biopsy results, regardless of the result. I am even considering getting tested for urea plasma and mycoplasma.\n\nI am glad you are able to finally get the proper help and can dig deeper into this. For me, when all of this started I broke my ankle a few months in and I am basically continuing from where I left off. Not so lucky this year and the world is in shambles!\n\nHaha, well put - Dr. Google. \ud83d\ude02\nIt is a curse and a blessing! Good for you collecting your list! I hope your doctors are good about listening to you and hearing your concerns. That helps so much.\n\nDefinitely ask for urea plasma and mycoplasma test. I got tested through my GP in February (negative results) before I was referred to a gynecologist, but that was one of the first ideas my gynecologist had and wanted to rule out. You can find the test code on Quests website - I just pulled those up and sent them to my doctor before I went in for the test to make sure they requested the right test. I think it uses the same swab as the vaginosis panel, it is just sent in with a different code for testing. Great! I am in Canada, I am not too sure how anything works when it comes to requesting tests. I have a phone consult with my GP so I will ask about it! Unfortunately through this journey all I was tested for at the beginning were normal STI and Yeast, and my biggest symptom was urinary issues, until someone looked at me and told me I had yeast. (Which was negative) but I found it odd that no one sent in a urine culture after my UTI strip came back positive twice and I still had symtoms. I am glad you got tested for those early on, as you can see my situation has been a little backwards. Seems like no one is considering the obvious from the beginning! No one ever bothered telling me to try sitz baths or changing my laundry detergent! The gyno I saw just assumed LS based on my anatomy and the itchy, but my anatomy has always been that way. I even asked an ex boyfriend from 15 years ago and he confirmed. Everyone is body is different and she made me feel like a mutant! \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThanks so much for commenting \ud83d\ude0a \nI will be keeping you in my thoughts, I am curious to see how everything pans out for you! *hugs* Oh I see! Well hopefully they know which tests to order and are willing to give it a shot. There are some \"test at home\" kits, but I am not sure what options are available in Canada, plus they are an out of pocket cost.\n\nIt does seem odd that they would not have cultured the UTI sample. That became standard when I started having recurring issues. I have had ongoing urinary symptoms since this all started a year ago - everything started with a UTI, which was treated with antibiotics. When the symptoms came back a month later, we tested and treated again, then again another month later. Because of the recurring UTI's the gyno gave me an antibiotic to take after intercourse. The urologist referred me to pelvic floor physical therapy. Neither really thought the constant burning sensation with urination was that big of a deal (uhhh, ok??) The physical therapist thought the burning was due to trigger points in fascia connected to the urethra, but I did not get much relief from therapy.\n\nI feel like the progress I have made has come from my own research and requests. The urinary burning got better after I started taking a high dose cranberry extract (Ellura). It also seems to be related to the amount of inflammation I am experiencing - more inflammation = more burning.\n\nI hope you find the answers you are looking for! Feel free to message me if you every want to chat or throw ideas my way. :) I love research, especially if it helps me figure this out! I wonder if you could be allergic to it. Clobetasol ointment contains propelyne glycol which I believe I have an allergy to. Oh that is interesting! I would have never thought of that! Thank you! Is there an alternative that I could maybe request? Hopefully when I get my biopsy results I can be referred to someone know actually knows what they are talking about! I am not sure there is, it is a common ingredient in a lot of skin products unfortunately. I discovered this by becoming suddenly allergic to face moisturizers. Allergy included extreme redness and burning, then peeling skin. My story is very similar to yours actually, Qi the of course a few minor detail differences. All started with a UTI \u2014 after visiting the public pool. \ud83d\ude11 I found that aloe Vera pills did help me a bit at some point, as I was also experiencing bladder pain which I no longer have thankfully. My symptoms have changed over the course of time! I have very sensitive skin, so it would not surprise me. That is so unfortunate! \ud83d\ude11 my burn was exactly as you describe it \u2014 redness, burning and skin that looked very dry. Thankfully polysporn helped to heal it. Same. I also have an allergy to propylene glycol and had to stop clobetasol because the burning only got worse over time. So sorry to hear \u2014 What do you use instead? I am on immunosuppressants for a different autoimmune disorder. Humira then enbrel and it is care of all but some relatively minor flares. Hey! Just checking in to see how you are doing now! Hi! Thanks for reaching out! The burning sensation was still bothering me a bit, even with the antihistamines, so my Dr ended up giving me betamethasone cream last week. So far that is really been helping! I am using estrogen cream every 2-3 days + betamethasone daily. I am still planning to follow up with an allergist, it is just impossible to get in right now. I do notice more burning when I do not take the claratin daily. I have gone to taking the benadryl only nights when I notice more discomfort.\n\nHow are you? Side note - betamethasone is also used to treat LS, and given the positive response, it is possible that is still the culprit. From what I understand I need to be off it for 3 weeks prior to biopsy though. That is great news! My burning is a lot less now, but it does fluctuate. I went to the infectious disease walk in clinic yesterday to see if they would test me for ureaplasma. They do not. Anyway, I got tested for everything I know I do not have, and they took blood to check my liver and kidneys, as well as a complete blood count just in case they need to prescribe something. I am hoping I can ask and get those infos on paper so that I can bring it elsewhere to be evaluated or something. I am also dealing with pretty horrible abdominal bloating. My doc just told me to go back to my gyno and get an ultrasound. My appointment is in a month. I was supposed to have my biopsy result this week but apparently the hospital will have it this week and it cold take up to 3 months for them to call me just to book for the results. In the meantime I called in to get a lost prescription and they threw the note they had for me in the trash and forgot to ask the doctor on the one day she came in. I am honestly losing all hope in doctors. I feel lost and keep getting dismissed. I may spend my money to see a gastroenterologist or a t\u00e9l\u00e9 doctor to test me for ureaplasma. But I would like to get my biopsy results first to rule out LS. It took 7 weeks for me to get some relief from Clobetasol and it is not even a full relief like my doc said it would be. \n\nI am really glad you\u2018ve found things that work for you for the time being. Waiting truly sucks. \u2764\ufe0f", "Do I have LS? So this started around two or three years ago, the area around my vaginal opening was just super itchy and would often tear during sex so was very sore for a good few days afterwards. I have noticed a patch of skin only on the right side of the vaginal opening that is paler in colour and smooth, it also wrinkles when I push the skin around. This is also the part that itches. Along with this, I have been experiencing itching to the anus and everyone I open my bowels, I create new fissures. The skin around the anus also looks paler in colour. My GP is completely useless and ordered swabs because its itchy but I know its not thrush or anything. Any ideas? Thank you Sounds like classic LS symptoms to me. I recommend visiting a dermatologist (since it is a skin condition) and requesting a skin biopsy. LS can only diagnosed through a skin biopsy. I wish you the best! Thank you! Could be! Definitely see a specialist - I hope you can get answers and hopefully get the treatment you need!", "Help!!! Hello everyone!!!\n\nI had this bad YI that lasted a few months. It is been about 2 months since it cleared. I still experience some itching and stinging now and then. I do not have the typical white patches or any architectural loss. Can it be LS? LS can be misdiagnosed, commonly as yeast infection or jock itch.  You need to see a knowledgeable gynecologist (if you are female) or a urologist (if you are male) for a proper evaluation. I have. She said it is some leftover irritation. But should not it be gone by now? If you are concerned that she is wrong, get a second opinion from another doctor.  A dermatologist is also an option to determine if it is a skin problem such as LS. I have consulted a dermatologist as well. What did the dermatologist say? She also said the same thing and asked me to wait for the left over symptoms to subside. Doctors can be wrong sometimes, but you have two doctors who are trained to diagnose these things and they are both in agreement.  I think there is a pretty good chance that they are correct.  Follow their instructions and just have them check again at your next checkup (or sooner if they directed to followup sooner) to be certain. I will do that. Thank you \ud83d\udc95 Could be, luck you do not have skin loss or white patches. Mines bad :( What other symptoms do you have? Occasional itching. White thick skin, years ago when it started peeling, big chunk of skin is missing from the peeling it really messes with my self esteem :( So you had the classical white patches? I do not have white patches. The gynaecologist said it did not look too bad but diagnosed me with LS. I have had my partner look and they said nothing abnormal but they are not a professional. Is there another test that would conclude that it is LS? Or just an elimination of other things and diagnosis based on symptoms? There must be some inflammation, right? I mean I would assume there is inflammation, but I do not know how to compare. I would assume there is inflammation but difficult to compare. What are your symptoms? I have extreme itching. Typically around my period. It is been around for years. Went to a gynaecologist for an IUD and asked about the itching and he said it is LS. Looked and said not too bad prescribed steroid ointment and said try not to itch \ud83d\ude12 And when you are not on your periods? When I am not on my period or around it it is random itching here and there but not consistent. I do not use the ointment every day. Only when I cannot stop itching and it subsides the itch. I think I am lucky because it is not a constant itch. Can it be cyclical vulvovaginitis? I am not sure! I have never heard of that but I will certainly look into it. It is basically an yeast infection. Happens just before or during one's menstrual cycle. Thank you for that information. It is frustrating not knowing what you have and doctors not really caring to help figure it out\u2026so I appreciate your knowledge or what it could be! :) I am glad you found it helpful This is exactly how mine started. You can probably look through my post and comment history to get more details. Okay. Thank you.", "Is there a \"lichen sclerosus awarness day\"? Happy international women's day to all the girls here! Specifically today, I just came to think of: is there any day for lichen sclerosus? I googled and \"Rare disease day\" popped up. Does LS count as a rare disease? Sorry if this question maybe dosen't belong here... Yes, LS is a rare disease and fits in rare disease day (which is the last day of February). Okay, thanks \ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f", "Possible toy I saw this on goop and thought it was an interesting concept since it is supposed to decrease pain during sex for females. I have zero clue if it would actually help due to the nature of LS, but wanted to share in case it is helpful. It is $65. \n\n\n\n This is my opinion only,  please do your own research.  would not trust anything from goop. I think the company is dangerous and they offer pseudo medical/wellness items that can cause harm. I think if I recall this was designed to help prevent the pain of deep penetration for  couples who may have large penis/short cervix combos. You can add or subtract rings.  My concern is this extra silicone ring stack could still cause ripping or tearing to both men and women who may have thinner or weaker spots. Plus, anything Gwyneth Paltrow/Goop is hawking for vaginal health is highly suspect. She was on a trip for a while getting women to sit on boxes to steam clean their vaginas as some sort of detox/cleanse.", "Can LS be a very small patch with no pain Just wondering if I have LS because a few months ago I noticed a small white patch under my penis head, no idea how long it is been there. It is hard to see but it has not changed in size at all. There is no pain, but I noticed it will itch sometimes but not often. It is looks like a small white line and you can feel it with a finger so it is just not the skin pigment. Yep. Some people have no symptoms whatsoever and only realize something is up because they notice the white patches. Mine started as a small patch on my bottom that would intermittently itch two or three times a year.  My doctor at that time misdiagnosed it as a fungal infection, so I was directed to use an over-the-counter fungal treatment whenever it itched for several years.  \n\n\n\nI now have pain and itching pretty regularly over my entire ano-genital region as well as a patch on my leg nearby.  If you believe it is LS, find a urologist (gynecologist for the ladies) or dermatologist familiar with LS and have it checked annually or how ever often the doctor feels is appropriate to keep ahead of it.  \n\n\n\nYou might never suffer symptoms, but better to keep and eye on it just in case.", "Recently diagnosed, no biopsy yet - Questioning diagnosis? Recently went to the doctor because I was having mild irritation on clitoris/hood area. It felt raw and uncomfortable, and I stopped being able to orgasm during sex. Thought maybe it was a yeast infection because the area got a little itchy on and off, but tested negative.\n\nDoctor took a look and immediately said it looked like lichen Sclerosus. She said the area was a little bit whiter than the skin around it. She did not want to biopsy because it is my clitoris and it is apparently a difficult area to deal with.\n\nNow I am a month into treatment, been on Clobetasol for 3 weeks with no improvement, and started Estrodiol last week, still with no improvement. It seems now that I have lost sensation in that area during sex. \n\nCould the doctor have have misdiagnosed me? She said she wants to do a biopsy if the treatments do not help within the next 2 weeks, but I am worried of going through that painful experience if it is just something else?\n\nAny advice is helpful!!! This is very similar to my story. I actually did get a biopsy of skin near my vagina because I get splitting there, but my itchiness and skin discoloration is mostly around my clit. Anyway, my biopsy was negative. Doctors still think I have LS and that maybe we biopsied too early or in the wrong spot. \n\nI have been being treated for LS for a few years now. I did not really notice an improvement for the first couple of years, but I was not great about using the steroids anyway because I was in denial about having LS and my doctor told me to use them when I had symptoms (itchiness), which was not often. \n\nI have lost some sensation in my clit, which sucks, so I would recommend following your doctor\u2019s orders and continuing treatment to avoid/slow any other permanent changes. \n\nThere are a few different types of steroids to use, and my doctor had me try out a few different ones (for ~6 months at a time each) until we found one that seemed to work best for my body. We also switched from \u201cas needed\u201d use to \u201cthree times a week\u201d use. \n\nI would recommend talking to your doctor about your concerns and options. It can take a little while to find the right treatment for you, assuming you do have LS. It never hurts to get a second opinion either! I just wanted to say. I have lichen and have had a positive biopsy. There are areas I have that still remain white despite clobetasol usage and others that go away with use. It has not necessarily gotten better in those areas that remain white, but it has not gotten worse. It itches or is irritated on and off as well. \n\nI am not sure about the loss of sensation because mine is in a different spot, but you could consider getting a second opinion before a biopsy. Not sure what kind of doctor you went to. I know some see dermatologists. I saw my gynecologist who recognized it. It never hurts to get a second opinion. I am sorry you are going through this. It is difficult when you do not have something that works and you are still waiting on a confirmation one way or the other. I guess maybe I will just need to be more patient and play around with the different steroids/treatments like you are saying. I do not have any splitting yet luckily so I will just wait for my next consultation at my gyno and hope for the best. Thanks! I have been seeing my gyno for this issue - she is the one the recognized the issue by the discoloration.  Should I still get a second opinion? Thanks for the help Good luck!! This is a sobering reminder to actually be good about using my Clobetasol. It is nice to hear that I am not the only person that deals with it around my clitoris. It is awful! I really had to mourn the loss of some sensitivity in my clitoris because of the hood fusing. :( Keep up with your Clob!! I think that is really up to you. My Gyno recognized it by coloring as well and sent off a biopsy. I am not sure if there is any way to know for sure what it is without a biopsy..but I am not a doctor so I am not sure. It seems like the doctor you are seeing is doing all the steps a good doctor should. She seems concerned about a biopsy risk with the area affected. She is prescribing the meds used to treat it. I suppose it depends on how you feel about her next steps. Sorry I cannot be of more help Have you gotten a biopsy finally? Are you feeling better?", "22F just diagnosed Just got diagnosed about a week and a half ago and I just do not really know how to emotionally deal with it. I have gone to several different gynecologists for recurring UTI, BV, and YI that I have been getting since probably 2017-2018 and I am only now ever even hearing of LS. I am just so stressed out about it. I am shocked that so many doctors dismissed my concerns and never noticed anything out of the ordinary when getting exams. \nI am just really really sad about it. I have been in pain for so long and now I know what it is but I am so scared treatments will not work and I will eventually have to stop having sex with my boyfriend which makes me so so so sad. \nMy doc has not prescribed me anything yet but I see her in a few days for getting an IUD inserted. I do not really know what I should do and I just feel really hopeless at the moment. Can anyone relate or share how they are coping with the uncertainty? \nMy doctor said I basically do not have labia minora anymore and I am so scared I am closer to a point of no return than I am to having a mild case. It is just been hard. Hey! Totally know what you are feeling. I got diagnosed about 3 months ago. It is a very devastating diagnosis. I was started in clobetasol ointment, I was convinced I would never return to normal because of how much pain and discomfort I was in. I am 3 months into treatment, I now am on a maintenance dose of steroid and sex is 90% normal now. I still have some residual irritation especially when I wear tight pants, but I can enjoy life again and enjoy sex!! \n\nIt will get better \u2764\ufe0f. Until you get control of your symptoms it will be a rollercoaster but it WILL get better. Clobetasol will help. I felt similar when I was first diagnosed in 2016. The book \"Help! I have Lichen Sclerosus\" was helpful for me. I cannot use clobetasol, it is irritating. I use tacrolimus 2x a week and do the soak they talk about in the book. I have not fused so far and the little bit of fusing that I did have seems to have reversed. Everyone is different, so it can be frustrating to find what works best for you. Hey there. So sorry to hear about your diagnosis. It is such a heavy diagnosis to receive. Your doctor probably did not give you very much information, so here is some to start. LS is an inflammatory skin conditon and is considered an autoimmune disease with a potential genetic component. Current science suggests that our body detects a protein or collection of proteins in the basement layer of the vulvar skin and it identifies that protein as \"not self\". When the body identifies something as not self, it attacks it. This attack causes an inflammatory response that creates thickening of the skin (which can cause anatomical changes). The gold standard of treatment is ultra potent topical corticosteroids such as Halobetasol, Clobetasol, etc. The general guidelines for usage is 1x daily for 1 month, every other day for 1 month, and then moving into a maintenance protocol of 2x a week indefinitely. However, the guideline varies based on the severity of your LS so take that with a grain of salt. The steroids are extremely effective in treating symptoms and slowing down the progressing of the disease.\n\nOK, that is general info. Now some mental health stuff and my experience which will hopefully give you hope. The mental health side of this can be just as heavy if not heavier and harder to work with than the physical. This is a big diagnosis and it is completely normal to feel scared, confused, anxious, angry, etc. Be gentle with yourself and show yourself compassion as you process various feelings and emotions. Finding a support group and getting a sex therapist helped me tremendously with this. I would suggest finding a support group to help you feel less alone and empowered and therapy IF that is accessible to you.\n\nSome hope. I was diagnosed 3 and a half years ago but was symptomatic for over a decade. Over ten years I suffered in pain and distress, each doctor telling me I was fine, to just relax, try drinking wine etc. Thus, by the time I was diagnosed, I had clitoral phimosis, fusing of my Labia minora to the majora, significant whitening and I was in so much pain( felt like someone took a razer blade to my vulva and slashed me everywhere). I had to stop having sex with my husband because the pain was unbearable. However, I dove into the literature, learned the science, and with consistent and proper steroid use, I got into remission. Remission is when you doctor examines you clinically and says there is no more active disease on the vulva. Further, since being in remission- almost a year and a half now- I have no burning, itch, pain, discomfort. My skin that was white returned to pink and I have had no further architectural changes. AND...I CAN NOE HAVE PAIN FREE SEX. And despite clitoral phimosis, I can still orgasm.  This was amazing because sex was always painful as long as I can remember and for the last 8 months I have been able to have sex multiple times a week with 0 pain. \n\nSo there is hope and you can get into remission and have a great sex life. However, it does take patience and work. I have a blog called The Lost Labia Chronicles where I write a lot about sex and LS, mental health and LS, body dysmoprhia, etc. If you are interested, you can read the blog at  and you can subscribe to the newsletter at  . Also, you can find me on Instagram or Facebook  -  I have informational igtv videos on questions like does LS thin or thicken the skin and the other day I uploaded part 1 of 3 videos where I interview my husband and talk about LS from his perspective (ie the person married to someone with LS). I post a lot about mental health and sex there \n\nBut you are not alone and there is hope.\n\nI find it odd that you were diagnosed with LS but not given a steroid - be sure to ask your doctor for this when you see them again. Please DM here or ig if you want to chat more. Oh my gosh this sounds almost exactly like when I was diagnosed 3 years ago at 21! If it helps, while I do not know what the future holds, I am currently just about in remission &amp; my symptoms are very well-controlled and not bothersome (if they are even there) with 2-3x a week medication. And mine was reeeeally painful in the beginning (took me a while to get down to maintenance treatment regimen). I still have to be careful, and I know everyone is different, but I hope this can provide some hope that you will get to a place where you are comfortable in daily life again! Thank you for sharing, it is good to hear you are in remission :) your comment really helped me feel less alone I really appreciate it \u2764\ufe0f You really know your stuff! I really appreciate the detailed reply!! I did get a prescription for clobetasol and I have been using that once daily, I have felt some slight relief. I am definitely going to keep up with your blog and socials, I find that certain days are just really hard for me mentally with this diagnosis.\nMore than anything at the moment I just feel very off-put by the act of sex and I am not sure if that is me being nervous about pain or just feeling gross with the diagnosis or maybe both. It just makes me feel bad about myself. I have been talking with my therapist about it but I think it will take some time before I find real mental peace with it.\nIt just sucks a lot. I really really appreciate your time to talk with me though. You have no idea how relieving it is been to have you and other people tell me their experiences. Thank you so much I have been using clobetasol for about 2 weeks now with no irritation so far. So hopefully I am in the clear but it is good to know there is alternatives. I will have to look into the soak that you are talking about too. Thank you for sharing! In just 3 months?? Wow that is a lot sooner than I thought it would take. I might have a different time table of course but that is really hopeful. Thank you, your comment has comforted me tremendously \u2764\ufe0f Thank you. It comes from lived experience and hours and hours painstakingly reviewing the medical literature on Lichen Sclerosus and being on the board of a Lichen Sclerosus not-for-profit org. It can take some time to feel relief from Clobetasol; personally, it took a few weeks for things to settle, but we are all different with our timelines. What you are feeling re: apprehension with sex is so so normal. You are not alone in this. I felt the same way for quite some time. I am glad you are speaking to your therapist because this honestly really messes with our mental health and I found a therapist shortly after my diagnosis because it plummeted my mental health to the worse it had ever been in my life. Honestly, there is a lot to process. Healing happens when we let ourselves truly feel our feelings, stay with them, and learn and grow from them. And of course, that takes time. Surrounding yourself with a strong support system and proper education can do wonders when it comes to processing complex thoughts, feelings, and emotions and heals. Do not hesitate to reach out if you need support! You got this. Honestly, I felt like my life was over when I was diagnosed, and now I fully accept my LS, I am in remission, and probably the happiest I have been in my life. For some people it takes longer. But this was just me -- sometimes its worse, sometimes it better, but all in all -- it improves i think. Do not get me wrong -- my vulva is now a lot paler and looks different but, my symptoms do not ruin my life like they did before. Everything is manageable.", "Question for the Men about Dermovate/Clobetasol Did you find that your pale patches on the glans returned to a normal colour (or close enough to normal). And did it improve your bruising/eccymiosis on the glans? I had a define white patch that has faded. Plus The underside was thick white scar tissue. This is resolving but slowly.  The overall improvement is noticeable  but takes time. ", "Undiagnosed: Advice needed Hi everyone. I have been having mystery issues with my vulva for over 2 years now. Around the time this all started, I was diagnosed with Vulvodynia and vestibulitis but that is never explained these symptoms i still suffer with today. \nMy symptoms:\n-I tear everytime my bf and i have sex. (fourchette, folds)\n-I tear in anal area almost every time I have a bowel m.\n-Peeling skin\n-Raw spots of skin\n-Itching from vulva to anal area (worse with heat)\n-sensitivity to products/pads\n-Redness on and off \nMy skin is like paper. but i have NO WHITE PATCHES. \n\nThe past two years, i have been tested for every std you can imagine, around 20 times. Herpes maybe even more. I knew I had to rule that out first. \n\nSome background: I have Hashimotos, I have allergies and am atopic and suffer eczema all over the top half of my body. When I was little my vulva fused and my mom would have to put estrogen cream down there. \n\nVulva Specialist who diagnosed me with vulvodynia said I do not need to be tested for LS since I have no white patches. Is that really needed for a diagnosis? I have every other symptom. \n\nIt is been a long two years. I spent so much time and energy (and money) worrying about this issue. I have bad OCD and this does not help. I just want an answer. I really am ready to just treat this like LS. Vulvodynia does not cause the skin to tear like how mine does. \nAny advice is appreciated. I definitely think you need to see a gyno that specializes in rare vulvar disorders. Try googling vulvar clinics in your area and you should be able to find a doctor well versed in the lichen skin conditions. I think a biopsy would be helpful. Without white patches, it is hard to confidently say you have lichen sclerosus, but just because you do not have white does not mean you do not have LS. \n\nOther than a gyno, you can try going to a dermatologist. They will be able to biopsy and prescribe steroid ointments and estrogen cream. \n\nIn the case that you do not have LS, consider your birth control if you are on any. I was treated for potential LS just to find my OCP was causing a hormonal imbalance and my estrogen levels were low causing itchy vulva/anus and burning. I did not get relief from steroid creams, but I have since stopping birth control and am considering asking for estrogen cream. I have also seen other stories of birth control causing itching in both the vulva and anus, dryness, and tearing. \n\nIf one doctor does not take you seriously, go to the next. Just keep trying until you find someone you trust and will listen to the research you have done. Google until you find a doctor that helps women with chronic disorders. Call gyno offices and ask for any providers that are familiar with lichen sclerosus. \n\nYou know your body most than anything, keep pushing for answers and explain to doctors why you think the way you do Can I ask what kind of birth control you were on? I take the minipill and it is hard to find information on it re: LS. I tried both a low dose combo pill and the mini pill. Both causes hormone issues for me Are you in birth control? My obgyn suspected that I had LS, I had a biopsy done and they suspect eczema from it. Negative for LS. I have similar symptoms in addition to a few other issues. Hope you feel better soon!", "Reactions to Clobetasol?? Anyone have any bad side effects to Clobetasol? I have used it off and on for over a year since being diagnosed. The more often I use it, I tend to get weakness and palpitations (yes, I am one of those sensitive freaks).  I swear it also thins the skin.  However, when things are on fire down there- sometimes it is just necessary!!  I have tried all kinds of alternatives- Vaseline, coconut oil, emu oil, A+D, KY silicone based, etc.... had even worse reactions to most of those.  My best friends are- cold weather, cold water spray, no underwear and long skirts.  Pants are pretty intolerable unless a thin loose cotton sweat pant and no undies.  Seriously, this is impairing my life.  Would love to hear other thoughts/experiences. First of all, Im sorry you are going through this. Secondly - are you using clobestol cream or ointment? I have heard of people having reactions to the cream and then switching to the ointment and being okay. The ointment is supposed to have less additives and when you go to your doctor it should be a quick switch.\n\nThirdly, it is possible to be on a different steroid that may also work. From what I know, you can be on one that is slightly different but just as potent, and some that are a little less potent that can still work.\n\nAdditionally, there a immunosuppressant pills you may be able to try that might work (although I think those are usually the last resort). How often are you using the cream? Are you soaking in warm water before use and rubbing it in for 90 seconds? Have you looked at your toilet paper, laundry detergent, shampoo/conditioner/body wash/condoms for chemicals you may be reacting to? \n\nLastly, when things were really bad for me and I could not get to the doctor very quickly, I was taking allergy pills to kind of chill the area out. It worked for a while and every little bit helps, right? \n \nI hope you feel better! And this site really helped me when I was still figuring out my triggers.  Good luck!!\n Thank you thank you for response!  I do use the ointment and only apply tiniest amount 1-2 x's a month when absolutely necessary. Obgyn and Dermatologist recommended 1-2x's week as maintenance care but I get too weird side effects with that much use.\n\nI am going to make an appointment here about other medications to  possibly use.\n\nI use only Aveeno soaps/ lotion- never directly on area! Only rinse area once a day with cold water- warm or hot water is unbearable!! I do need to maybe switch my detergent to an organic brand, but I have used ALL free &amp; clear for years...I never use tp directly on area. Use cold water spray every time after bathroom.\n\nAllergy pills I discovered actually worsened things as they must dry me out?? I do not know- stopped using them and my periods went from 10 days long to 6 days- so hmmm- not sure what that was all about.\n\nI do have appointment with allergist coming up for skin prick test.\n\nIt is amazing how different everyone is with what works and what does not as well as symptoms-so I am finding.  It is nice just to hear other people talk about it though!  It is so hard to explain to non- sufferers this disorder and the pain that comes with it.  Would not wish this blessed little problem on anyone!\n\nThanks again- I will check out the link fo sure!!! Oh man, it sounds like you know your triggers and you are pretty on top of things! It took me a while to realize  my triggers and oh man were they weird. Stuff like deodorant (which goes nowhere near the area!) And drinking alcohol and Aussie brand shampoo of all things. I agree - non-sufferers seem to have a hard time understanding what it is like, or why we cannot do certain things and it is really nice to be able to talk to someone who understands :) even the doctors I talk to are sympathetic, but do not really get it you know?\n\n I really hope your doctor listens to you and you can get this handled asap :)  Hey, so I am new to my lichen sclerosis diagnosis, but having had eczema my whole life I can tell you a bit about steroid creams. Clobetasol and other steroid creams for skin issues do cause thinning skin in the long run, the insides of my arms have thin skin due to years of eczema treatment. ", "Acupuncture? I may get downvoted for this, but just out of curiosity- has anyone tried acupuncture for LS? Or at all? No, but I am open to it. Personally, I love acupuncture, although I get it done more for chronic tension headaches and chronic pain than for my LS. That said, my acupuncturist knows I have LS and will try to use the needles to bring blood flow to the area (*note, the needles do not get placed in the vulva). I cannot speak to how it helps LS, as I do not see her for this and am already in remission, and there are no studies on this. However, as an additional method of treatment, I do not think it would be harmful. Acupuncture can help reduce stress and produce calming effects, which while they do not address the inflammation causing the LS locally, can have some benefit as stress is a huge trigger for LS. If you cannot tolerate the steroid ointment can you do steroid shots?", "Lichen on/near clitoris? Hi. I am not entirely positive I have it but I have some whitening of my clitoris, fissures on it and next to it, and whitening near my clit too. I am just wondering if anyone else has it on that area only? And if so how do they go about doing a biopsy? Cause I assume they are not going to biopsy directly on the clit, right? Thank you That is where mine was localized. My gyne took a biopsy of my labia where she saw some lighter skin. To me it still looks the same shade as everywhere else, but I am not the doctor.\n\nThe discoloration along my hood is still there but has gone back to a light pink instead of white. The fusion and fissure issues I had there have also returned to normal. Does it itch or do you have a pinging sensation if you have pants on that are tight in that area?\nThank you. I can deal with whiteness tbh I have just had non stop fissures for the last year and I am soooo tired of it Yeah. It is not intense itching, never has been. But it is like a weird itching sensation more than actual itching I would suggest seeing a doctor right away. If you have been dealing with this for a year you may be losing structure as well. Not to mention you should be using clobetasol if you do have LS. Yeah, I have seen about 7 doctors and they all just treat me for a yeast infection You need to see a specialist for LS or a dermatologist with OBGYN background. LS puts you at a higher chance of developing vulvar cancer and it needs monitored. I have Medicaid and have not really been able to find any doctor that specializes in LS :( my dermatologist diagnosed this and is treating me, added cancer screen to annual because higher risk in the LS areas. btw I am on Medicare too When I went to a derm she looked at me for 2 seconds from far away, under normal lighting and said it does not look like it. That was before it got this bad, though, but it certainly discouraged me from dermatologists The problem is this is relatively rare, gp admitted she knows little. my urologist has no other male LS patient. so my Dermatologist is the queen bee.\ntry another dermatologist practice, maybe ask someone, a nurse, to talk to by phone about a doctor that deals with this. There is not really a doc that specializes in it. You can try calling and asking if they have a dr that has any experience with LS and try to weed them out that way. Also, you do not necessarily have to have a biopsy to get a dx. Some docs just diagnose it by looking, and some say \u201ctry this clobetasol, and if it works, then it was LS Thank you for your advice \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 I have white patches only around my clitoris too and right now I am waiting for results of my biopsy, they just took 2 from the area around my clitoris and it was alright, nothing like the horror stories I read before. It is been two weeks and it is almost healed Thank you for your advice!! I am just worried about loss of feeling and scarring Hi I have similar, did you get your biopsy back? Wondering also if they got their results Ill probably get my results on Monday and let you two know! The white patches have disappeared suddenly even though I had them for at least 2 months before the biopsy so I am really curious about the results Is it still healing right now? The biopsy sites? It is now been almost 4 weeks and I cannot even really tell where they were taken from even though 2 weeks ago I could see pretty big dark holes in my skin. I feel some mild pain when I touch there though. Guys my results came and they say it is hyperkeratosis, I have not consulted my doctor about the result yet though so i do not know if it can be connected to lichen or not", "Is it ok to masterbate and engage in sexual stuff with Clobetasol Male? I am using Clobetasol on my penis for LS is it safe to masterbate still? My understanding is that you need to wait a bit. Doc quote when I asked was \u201cat least ten minutes\u201d, but I think that was an educated guess. \n\nYou do not want potent steroid cream on your hands regularly, for starters. It can thin your skin out. Bad news for hands and fingers. You also do not really want it on unaffected parts of your body. \n\nOnce it has had time to seep in (the aforementioned ten minutes if you are brave, but maybe an hour or so if you are more prudent?) you could surely clean off any remaining ointment and have at it. \n\nNote: I am not a doctor and I am not a male. And I have definitely bent the rules flying solo and just not touching anywhere I put ointment. Somehow still always wound up with it on my hands, though.... Thank u for the response, I waited a few hours so I think it is all good.", "Is LS linked to elevated Prolactin? Has anyone had hormone tests showing high prolactin or hormonal imbalances? I did (male) and after introducing supplements to lower it, mine is reversing. Worth thinking about and considering. Hope this helps. Interesting. I had that diagnosis 20 years before my LS diagnosis!!! What supplements please? Well I started taking Boron, zinc, vit E and P5P which is an active form of b6. People say boron is great supplement for LS. I used 6-9mg Thank you very much. I will research. Hello. \nI also had my hormones tested and it showed high prolactin too. \nI Believe I have LS.\nMy only symptoms are white spots on foreskin and glans. Maybe some redness sometimes too. \nMy doctor thinks it is vitiligo. And treating it like it was that. Feels bad as I see it is getting worse ower the months. \nI will take a look into balancing my hormones\nThank you for sharing!\n\nBtw Tests also showed very high morning cortisol\nAnd very low vit D.\n\nDid you tested it too? So mine started as a tight foreskin and moved up the  frenulum to the tip and there were white spots or patches. Now there is just a little whiteness on the foreskin but not as tight. In order to lower my prolactin I took 100mg P5P (active form of b6), 400iu vit E and also for general hormones... 9mg boron, 22mg zinc picolinate and 3000-5000iu D3. Wouldnt do any harm to get a prescription for Mometasone cream. It is not vitalago if it is just on the end of your penis. Ask them to research BXO the make type of LS. Hopefully whatever helped me can also cure you. Dm me for any further info Btw I also experimented with Ashwaganda ksm66. This is known to reduce Prolactin but also it will lower cortisol. Worth mentioning.", "Just had my second round of PRP AMA I posted a little while back, but I have started the platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) treatment for my lichen sclerosis after suffering from LS for many  many years and a lot of recommendations from my physical therapists and doctors. \n\nMy nurse practitioner told me it could take up to three treatments and I just received my second one. It was a bit pricey ($1000 each round) but I think it is been worth it so far. I decided to take a leap of faith because LS is chronic for me and I have a long life ahead of me, and I would like to finally have pain-free sex and healthy skin. I have tried ointments and clobetasol and I figured why not try one more thing if I have already invested so much time and money. After all, your sexual and reproductive health is important! Let me know if any of you have questions. I would love to share more about my experience and what the process was like as well as compare other treatments for LS. I would be more than happy to be your guinea pigs!  How are you feeling after the second round?  Did your doctor tell you how other people have been responding to the treatment? I felt a little sensitive and a bit sore down there after both sessions, but nothing too painful. I was numbed appropriately with topical anesthesia as well as lidocaine injections, so the pain was very subtle and I could not really feel the needle especially the second time. My nurse is very experienced with seeing patients who suffer from LS, so she is had a lot of people come in for the same treatment. She told me she is had several patients whose LS was so bad that their clitorises were fused with the vulva, but that they had a lot of success with PRP. Let me know if you have any other questions. She also mentioned that there was some improvement after the first session. There was more pinkness to my skin and the white patches were more isolated and decreased in size. I think I have to wait another 2-3 months to see more drastic changes though. Congratulations on taking another big step toward hope and healing. I hope it works for you! What was the prognosis for this type of treatment and is it long-term or does it require upkeep? It sounds like a promising and interesting option. Oh my! Can this reverse some aspects of LS? I have not heard of this. I am 28F and just had a follow up with my doc a few days ago and things are looking slightly worse than six months ago. Feeling defeated because I thought I have been doing all the right things. I am not too sure if it can reverse fusing as mine seems to have gotten pretty bad. I do not have any labia minora and my clitoral hood was starting to fuse, but it does seem like my white patches are not as big or obvious and some healthy pink color is returning. So sorry to hear that. I think clobetasol and other ointments are meant to help maintain the skin and keep it from getting worse, but your doctor might have to prescribe something stronger. I am still using the clob as well as an estrogen cream and occasionally a vaginal moisturizer and I was told I should keep using them even after my PRP shots to maintain the quality of the skin once it is improved. Best of luck! Thank you! My nurse practitioner said it takes up to around 3 treatments for most of her patients and I just had my second one. It is pretty long term, but still requires the use of clobetasol and estrogen creams or whatever you have been prescribed to maintain the quality of the skin since LS is a chronic autoimmune condition. I am still doing all the upkeep, but I am hoping for better results and even some better quality of skin than I have been used to in the past. It was a bit of a gamble since I know there is not too much research done on this, but it was a risk I was willing to take since I felt like I had exhausted all other options. I am a bit late, but I thought I would chip in for anyone else reading this. I am a 26 y.o male who have had the treatment 3 times during the last 6 months. I have experienced a good amount of unfusing of the foreskin, so it can definetly reverse some of the aspects. For me, parts of the foreskin had sort of melted together before the treatment, and seemingly just atrophied away, leaving the glans uncovered. After the treatments the white \"atrophied\" skin started sloughing off, and normal skin grew underneath. Parts that were completely fused together before started to come apart! I still have some fuseage close to the frenulum, but I am the only one who can really see it because I know how it looked before the disease. When I tell the doctors where the skin is still somewhat fused, they struggle to understand where it is because it looks normal/healthy to them now. I have not used anymore steroids since i started the treatment, but I might have to start if the disease returns.\n\nThe effect can vary a lot from person to person, but I wholeheartedly recommend trying out the procedure, especially if you are a young person who would have to use strong steroids for the rest of your life... \n\nAs a side note: For the males reading this, I would take caution in trusting the guidance offered to you through the doctors you will meet. I have visited 2 general practitioners, 3 doctors who worked at clinics for venereal and skin diseases, one urologist and one private dermatologist, and NONE of them even knew about the PRP treatment. The only treatments they even mentioned were continued application of steroids for the rest of my life, and circumcision... I suspect that a lot of these doctors do not know much about the disease because they do not diagnose and treat it very often. I think that the ones who usually find it first, treat it and know much about it are gynecologists, who tend to only treat women (duh), so as a male, you might have a hard time finding someone knowledgeable on the disease. I would recommend anyone to spend a lot of time reading up on Ls studies because of this. Hey thanks for your response. I just had my 3rd session. I was told it could take up to 6 months to see full results, but so far the white patches have shrank a good amount. My clitoral hood is coming back by a little and I have more of a clitoral mass than before. Still not a lot of unfusing because my labia minora was essentially all gone before this treatment and I am not sure if it will ever come back. But yes, while this treatment is expensive, I do recommend checking it out for anyone who is at their wit\u2019s end.", "Hot tub soaking...yes or no? Same question for pool/swimming? Does any have any thoughts regarding soaking in a hot tub...not a hot bath but a privately owned, chlorinated hot tub/spa/pool. Is it a no no with LS? Do you cover your affected areas with an Occlusive like Lanolin before soaking or swimming?", "Start of LS? Or HSV?  Does not look like HSV to me. LS is not known for discharge often it is the opposite. When was your diagnosis Yeah LS is not known for discharge and the tearing is usually due to extreme drying and thinning. So really neither. i actually did not mean to include the discharge comment! I was reading another article and must have added that on by mistake! That aside, would this tearing be what is known for LS? Sorry! as stated below, i actually stupidly included that part due to literally reading an article mid post. Total brain spazz! With that aside, are the tears here what they refer to with LS? i have had intense itching (usually bothersome at night), this cut 16 times, and the white patch that never goes away! Do you experience LS tears? Could you perhaps explain what that is like :) If possible! All okay if not too! thank you for the response back I think that is your bartholin duct and not a tear to be honest. But as far as the discoloration of the skin, possibly. You need to go to your doctor and have a work up. That does not look like my experience of it Have you booked in to get them swabbed? I have something similar but wasnt able to get them swabbed in time as everything in my town was booked. Could also be thrush! I have had it swabbed three times with PCR! All negative, just still dont know what it could be It does look like lichen sclerosus with the white patches. Do the cuts appear after your period or at a certain time of your cycle? I wonder if its hormonal. I have been having less noticable breaks in the skin but my skin is quite textured anyway so it is hard to tell. I believe I have been exposed to hsv but then also my mum has lichen sclerosis so I am not sure. Have you tried using thrush cream on them? Yes! I tested negative for all thrush though. Have you been blood tested for HSV? My thing is, I dont even think I was exposed to it, or at least people have said no when I asked. the swabs being negative help, but my blood test was inconclusive and they suggested not getting another due to the swabs hence the worries!", "More questions Hello all, \n\nI am new here and trying to learn more about this. I am a guy, overweight, uncircumcised - which i have read are the two most important factors for the development of this condition. So here are my questions. \n\n1. Does this condition come on suddenly or is it something that comes from a young age?\n2. I have read that circumcision cures many cases. My itching if i remember correctly started from foreskin but now has moved to scrotum, anus, perineum and region around it. In that case, how will circumcision cure it? Also, i do not understand how itching can spread if it is an autoimmune condition. Is it something like the nerves at the foreskin become irritated which travels down to these regions and cause nerves to be irritated?\n3. For me, moisture makes things worse and cool air helps it. I do not understand how air can make nerves feel better?\n4. People say that a biopsy is definitive in this diagnosis. But if there is no infection, what exactly is the biopsy looking for? I do not have any skin discoloration, yet. So i dunno what can be seen in a microscope? \n5. If this is an autoimmune condition, it means that there is no cure to it. Why does steroids cure it? As i understand, steroids reduce inflammation. So i do not quite understand. \n\nThanks in advance for everyone who is responding. Appreciate it. If you do not have any white spots and your itching is so spread out, I would guess that LS would *not* be the most likely diagnosis. I think scrotal LS is rare, and anal LS in people with a penis is even more rare. I am not saying by any means that you do not have LS. I guess what I am trying to say is, even though I tried to answer you questions below, I would not recommend planning every detail of an LS diagnosis before you see a doctor and find out if that is even a likelihood. (Definitely see a dermatologist or urologist ASAP, though.)  \n\n\n1. I think both are possible\n2. My understanding is that circumcision is more likely to be curative if the disease is limited to the foreskin. But it might also help other areas like the glans, since after circumcision, there will be less moisture and irritants trapped to promote inflammation. As for how it can spread, I guess it does not really \"spread\" in the true sense. It is more like whatever disease process is going on, it can worsen, making the lesions bigger and popping up new ones. \n3. Moisture can be irritating for sure, which is why breathable cotton underwear is recommended, and no underwear at night. It makes sense that cool air helps too, since cooling the area would reduce inflammation, like a milder version of an ice pack. I have heard that soaking makes a better environment for the nerves, although I do not understand precisely why. I do find that air tends to be more comfortable than chafing clothing, so I mostly wear skirts + commando these days. \n4. Some people think every case should be biopsied; other people think it is not always necessary, especially if the way it looks and the symptoms you have point to a clear diagnosis. As for how the biopsy works, they will look for a certain configuration of certain types of immune cells. They actually look like a layer of lichen sitting on rocks, which is why \"lichen\" is in the name of the disease. They will also look for other things that could be a sign of other possible diagnoses. But, if you do not have any lesions yet, it might be hard for a biopsy to be helpful. \n5. It is not proven that LS is an autoimmune disease, but I personally believe that it most likely is. You are right that steroids reduce inflammation; they are your body's own way of telling itself to chill out immune-system-wise. I think if steroids work very well, they may be able to get that inflammation down to zero, and it might never start up again. As I understand it, this is sometimes the case for penile LS and for vulvar LS in preadolescents. But, sometimes it is a chronic condition, where even after you get the inflammation down near zero, you have to keep applying steroids (or similar) once a week or so, to keep it from coming back. Thank you for the detailed answer. I feel depressed if you think my condition may not be LS. I have been searching for an answer for so long without success. Thanks anyway. I did go to a derm. But it was kind of useless. He had no clue.  He did a fungal culture by swabbing the region which came out to be negative. Again, I am not saying it is not LS. It might be.\n\nI would try and see a different dermatologist or a urologist. Unfortunately it can take a few tries to get the answer. The first dermatologist I saw was super useless. Try another doctor as some are clueless about LS. It is not unusual for women to go for years until LS is diagnosed bc it can mimic a yeast infection. Hi. I am not going to answer your questions directly as they indicate a number of misunderstandings around LS \n\nI strongly suggest that you see an experienced dermatologist and get a proper diagnosis and put your mind at rest. I know you have seen one already but as DopeGrandma observed, many dermatologist are not switched on to this. I can recommend one in London. \n\n Please do not be surprised if a diagnosis of penile LS does not include a biopsy, particularly if you are not in USA. \n\nI would observe that scrotal, anal and perineal involvement is rare in penile LS, although some men do report these, but this might suggest some other lichen. \n\nI wish you all the best but see a dermatologist I ended up going to two gynos and a derm, Derm was the definitive, but I had to convince gynos not to do a second biopsy cuz the first one was bad enough. Thank you. I will make an appointment. What other lichen is there? I read about lichen planus and lichen simplex. I am sorry but i am completely ignorant here. Those are the main/obvious ones. They are more likely than LS given the areas you are describing as being involved. Whilst both women and men get LS, the presentation can often be rather different given the anatomy evolved. All the best.", "is it true that clob is dangerous? (thins the skin, makes you lose feeling in your clitoris, etc)  No not if it is used correctly ah, okay! what is the correct way to use it? Tbh I cannot quite remember what they told me. But I had to was use it twice a day until the itch subsided then it was once a day. Gradually got it down to once a week. Anytime the itch came back I apply it twice a day and wean back again. Best to apply a pea sized amount after a bath. Weirdly an ice pack can help with the itch too You use just a small amount and only put on a thin layer. do the white patches go away with treatment? Yes the clobetosal will help the itching white patches and cracks you have. The best time to put it on is before bed then when you have to pee just dab thank you! Your welcome:) My pharmacist told me never to apply it right after a hot shower/bath because it will absorb too much (and more is not better with Clob). I never had issues with it thinning my skin and I certainly never lost any feeling.\nJust apply a small amount (I usually did about half a pea?) and spread it in a thin layer every day for a couple weeks until the symptoms subsided. That is contrary to the advice specialist gives in relation to applying on the vulva. Its applied differently on other parts of the body. Lichen is thickened skin so steroid has to be strong to work. The heat aids absorption. Sorry if it is too personal but did you use it on clitoris? It is where my ls is located and I am nervous Yeah I some whitening around and on mine and I did not have any issues using the ointment!\nFor me it took at least five+ days of constant use before I saw my symptoms start to subside. Welp, my pharmacist should definitely know I put it on my vulva. She told me to wait five minutes after a bath/shower. I guess I will check with my doctor at my next appointment.", "Tips for managing LS! Hi Ladies!\n\nI am new to the group. I was recently diagnosed with LS and immediately felt both a sigh of relief (there is a name for what is wrong with me) and extreme sadness (how the heck am I going to manage life with this). \n\nI would LOVE a thread where anyone/everyone can post their general tips on how they managed LS so we have some solid tips in one place. All tips welcome from brands of soap you use down there, exercises/stretching (does this exist), foods to eat /foods to avoid, etc. I use dr bronners baby soap for body soap. When I am all done showering I use a handheld shower head and rinse the area off really good. My doctor recommended to do this to remove any soap/shampoo etc residue.\n\nI use coconut oil for lube. I use emu oil for days when it is irritated or feels dry. I use clobestol once a week as maintenance.\n\nI see my Gyno once a year for my regular check up. If anything seems off and it is not getting better with the above treatment I send a message to my doc to let them know. \n\nI enjoy working out. As long as I get out of sweaty/wet clothes ASAP I tend to be ok. I try to keep my home cool during workout times to avoid excessive sweating as that is irritating for me. \n\nWhen it comes to swimming/beach days I change out of wet clothes right away. If I am going to spend all day at the pool I bring 2 bottoms to change into dry ones after a swim. It is annoying but it really helps keep my symptoms under control\n\nI wear 100% organic cotton undies. I like the brand skin organics. They are expensive but I think they are cute and the only ones I can tolerate. I go commando whenever possible at home..maxi skirts/dresses and loose sweats are my bffs Here are my go-to products:   \n\\- The Honey Pot Company's Sensitive cleanser. It is been fantastic for cleaning/odor reducing without any dryness.  \n\\- The Honey Pot Company's Vulva cream. It is coconut-oil based, absorbs right in, and keeps my nice and hydrated without being moist.\n\nHabits:  \n\\- Cotton panties all the way. Or commando at home. Nightgowns are fantastic.  \n\\- Workouts have had no issue, just shower right after.  \n\\- Swimming. Get the heck outta that swimsuit as soon as you can. Otherwise it is misery, rip.  \n\\- Personally, I hate pants. Skirts and dresses for me 90% of the time. Shorts are okay, too.  \n\\- Epilating! So easy to do at home to keep down there nice and hair-free, as hair tends to build up moisture and get uncomfortable fast. It is also less painful than waxing (well, not painful at all once you get used to it), and covid-friendly, lol. Also pretty affordable- a cheap, but decent epilator will go around $30\\~$40, and last you a long time. That is less than a Brazillian!  \n\\- Sex- good communication, and good partner. If it hurts, it is a no.\n\nPrescription:  \n\\- Clob as needed for flare-ups, as prescribed by my derm. I do not even use it weekly or every other week, since it makes the skin thinner.  \n\\- I can call if I need more clob, or I can go in if I am feeling concerned. But my PCP also checks up on my LS, so I do not have to worry too much about yearly checkups.\n\nDoctor:  \n\\- Good lord, if you identify as a nonman, go to a female doctor. I was misdiagnosed twice (twice!!!!) by mxn who thought it was just a yeast infection, twice!! Yet on first glance from my derm, she knew it was LS and a yeast infection. Visited my (new) PCP later (also F), and she also recognized it as LS during my pap swab. Never happened when I would mention it to my previous male PCP. God bless their hearts, I am lucky to currently have two great doctors. Is it okay to use emu/coconut oil? I talked to my gynecologist and she said that they both lure in bacteria easily. I am also new to this sub- I got a probable diagnosis yesterday. Can we get an FAQ page for this sub? I think it is really helpful for new people and as a reference. I also inhabit r/psoriasis since I have that too, and their FAQ page is an amazing resource. It seems like there is a lot of experience here that is been shared in this or that post; it would be wonderful to have all the highlights in one place. Interesting I have heard the opposite! My Gynecologist and her nurse have recommended coconut oil to me as lube. I have used it for years without an issue. \n\nI would never tell you not to follow your doctor\u2019s advice though.\n\nHere is a really brief answer about using coconut oil as lube. Again I would follow the advice of your doctor..if you would like to use it I would bring it up again.\n\n\nEdit- I want to add I only use emu oil externally on the vulva, perineum, clit. I am not sure if it can be used internally. A little goes a long way and it is really moisturizing. I do not use it often, but I usually have to pick up use of it around my period. There are others on here that use it that can may be weigh in.\n\nYou can also check out mint green living on YouTube. She talks about her LS routine Thank you so much, I will look into this!\n\nI mean I go to a Planned Parenthood gynecologist and I am sure she is super experienced in the profession.. but with LS it is uncommon &amp; not much info is known so I am not sure how much she knows other than general guidelines. I wish there was a gynecologist who specializes in LS! I feel for you! I lucked out with my 2nd gynecologist. My first was not that great. He sort of put me through the ringer for a year. My 2nd diagnosed it on the spot and sent a biopsy off just to be sure.\n\nBefore I was diagnosed I thought I was suffering from a continuous cycle of bacterial/yeast infections. It was awful. It was then that her nurse recommended coconut oil as a safe alternative to traditional lube. When I saw my doctor next she mentioned the same thing.\n\nI actually have issue with their lube irritating me at the office. They have me bring in my own coconut oil for check ups. Ugh I feel you! I also went through a year and a half of being told it was just a yeast infection by 4 different doctors. I am so glad we have both found relief in at least knowing what it is.\n\nHmmm if the coconut oil seems to be working for you I will definitely be looking into it :) I do take awhile getting naturally wet anyways and it irritates my skin if we use anything else. Thanks for the advice! It is such a relief knowing! I am glad you found one that could help! \n\nIf you look into it and decide to try it, I use extra virgin organic coconut oil..make sure nothing else is in it. I hope it works out for you and if it does not, I hope you find something that does! Thank you so much for taking the time to write this! I really appreciate it!", "Diet and Lichen sclerosis I am a 61 YO female diagnosed with LS this year. I also have what could be Lichen planus in my mouth. I have been reading all kinds of things, but I came here for your opinions - have any of you pursued a low oxylate diet for LS benefits? (\n\nLow oxylate diets are often recommended for reduction of kidney stone frequency. High oxylate-containing foods are usually plant based, and include spinach, swiss chard, rhubarb, cocoa, almonds and cashews and many others. ( I have been trying to avoid high oxalate foods and I do not know if I am imagining it or not but I feel like my symptoms have lessened. Thanks for sharing that! I am headed towards full carnivore eating...", "What other conditions does LS often appear with? I was diagnosed with LS two years ago (21f). I had biopsies and it was all confirmed and I have steroid cream which helps keep it under control. But I also have other weird non-LS symptoms. Had a lupus test and that came back negative but was wondering if any people knew of other conditions that LS often appears with? Many thanks :) What kind of symptoms?\n\n\nAnd when you say under control, you mean (no labia itchiness or burning and sex/masturbation is pain free)? I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and LS. I know there are a few others on my Reddit EDS board who have LS, too. EDS causes all sorts of problems because it is a connective tissue disease. Thanks so much for sharing! In terms of under control i mean not constant crazy pain and burning. Still get flare-ups every couple of months with cuts and pain etc. \n\nOther non-LS symptoms include constant tiredness, bleeding after sex, recurrent kidney infection which was shown in blood test, nausea, dizziness, rash on face and shoulders occasionally. Super random and broad presentation of symptoms so has made it difficult to treat or for a Dr to diagnose.... I was diagnosed with LS two years ago as well, I am 24 now. I have had rheumatoid arthritis since I was 5 and vitiligo since I was 18. Autoimmune diseases are notoriously tricky to diagnose and treat. Sending you positive vibes on your diagnosis journey. Thanks so much for sharing! Sending good vibes your way also :) Whoa this sounds a lot like me. Kidney infection was one-and-done for me, and my rashes happen all over my body, but other than that, same. Have you had any other diagnosis or treatments which have helped? Thanks for sharing :) So at the same time as LS, I was also diagnosed with desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, which doc said may be related to the after sex bleeding, bc my vagina and cervix are inflamed. Also pelvic floor dysfunction, which as I understand it, can sometimes predispose you for kidney infections because of something about how it puts pressure on your bladder? \n\nNobody seems to have any idea about the fatigue or rashes, although the symptoms started at the same time as my LS really flared up seriously for the first time. I have found that taking antihistamines (benadryl at night, cetirizine during the day) seems to help with the rashes, so I suspect they are autoimmune related. I have been reading a bit about Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, and I think it is a possibility. This all sounds so similar to what I have been experiencing! I am glad you have had at least some diagnosis for your symptoms, and hopefully you will get further explanation for what you are experiencing! desquamative inflammatory vaginitis diagnosis is interesting; I thought my bleeding after sex might be because I have got the hormonal IUD, but I have had it for over a year and only in the last few weeks have I seen more intense bleeding! Thanks so much for sharing all of this, I really appreciate it. You are welcome, best of luck! I have read that a lot of women with LS also have autoimmune conditions which often go undiagnosed. I have been to the doctor multiple times to talk about symptoms but I have yet to have a doctor actually give a shit lol. Took three years just to get the LS diagnoses and that was after begging the gyno to take a look. I am so sorry to hear! I can really relate to this; in my first year at university, the GP constantly told me I had thrush instead of taking my chronic symptoms seriously... I hope we will all get the answers we are looking for. Sending you good vibes!! :) Sometimes LP which is lichen planus. I have crohns disease but idk if its related anyhow. It is an auto immune disease tho As others said, LS often co-occurs with autoimmune diseases. \n\n( I read lists these as associated with LS in women: \n\nThyroid diseases, vitiligo, IBD, alopecia, RA, anemia, morphea/scleroderma, and psoriasis\n\nAnd in men:\n\nAtopic dermatitis, diabetes\n\nI am sure there are more. I hope you find some answers and solutions for what is going on! I have Raynaud\u2019s and I am going to get my thyroid tested when covid is not quite so bad in my area. I suffered from ovarian cysts and weird periods for a long time too which apparently can be a thyroid thing? I hope you find your answers! Pretty much any autoimmune disorder! And chronic illnesses. Thank you so much for sharing this; really appreciate it! Thanks so much and you too! I have significant endometriosis and chronic fatigue. Male with LS and I also have Cold induced urticaria. It is like an allergy yo cold exposure on the skin that causes swelling, nettle rash and itching. Is there really no trigger for LS? Why would I develop it at 28 suddenly?", "I have tried almost everything So two weeks ago I was finally diagnosed with LS. Visibly there is not a lot to see but I am experiencing tearing. This has been going on for over a year with no answers. I am 40 years old and had my last kid in January 2020. Ever since my last delivery (csection) my body changed drastically. Every time I have tried to have sex my vaginal skin has split at the opening toward the bottom (like the 6 0\u2019clock point). Painful. Yes. As you can imagine this has taken away my confidence to relax and have sex and also affected the intimacy with my husband. So, after 3 Mona Lisa treatments, estrogen cream, testosterone cream, heat laser treatments (10 to be exact) and lastly the clob, I was feeling hopeful to have sex last night. I have been in clob for 2 weeks (2x a day) and was going to taper off for the  next two weeks (1x per day). So god forbid, I had sex last night \u2026.and here I am back the beginning. Skin tore and it is like everything I have done over the past year+ did not matter.  Maybe it is because the skin was thin from the steroids. Will this ever change? Will I ever heal? This has taken away my womanhood. I just want to be back to myself. This was never a problem until this last year.  Has anyone experienced the tearing and did you overcome it? Any advice is helpful. My wife had bad tearing. She drastically changed her diet and has had success keeping the tearing at bay. The white spots even went back to pink. She cut sugar/carbs completely. She is essentially on a paleo diet. Changing her diet was the only thing she did as she was adverse to using steroid creams. I personally feel if she did both diet and creams she would not have any issues. She only occasionally has minor tears when we get a little too rough. Thanks for that feedback. This tear is pretty painful. It is like a split, not a tiny tear. I follow the keto diet (have fallen off a bit) but was also reading to eat foods that do not have oxalates. The steroids are a catch 22. It helps heal but then also causing thinning. Ugh I just want to have normal, fun sex again. So sorry to hear about your painful struggles.   Just curious though, you said you were diagnosed just a couple weeks ago but you have already tried Mona Lisa, laser treatments, and just about everything everything else you can try to use in the treatment of LS.  Did you try all those things in just the last couple weeks or were you trying some of these treatments prior to your diagnosis? I am so sorry to hear your story. I also have had a hard time with tearing, I feel your pain. Here is a few things you can try that I see you have not yet tried: \n\n1. PRP injections \n\n2. Read the book \u201cLichen Sclerosus, Beating The Disease\u201d Lichen Sclerosis Beating the Disease\u201dthis book has been a GAME CHANGER for me. I will link it here:\n\n\n\n3. Read the book \u201cMind over Medicine\u201d this book has also been a HUUGGEE GAME CHANGER! \n\nMind Over Medicine - REVISED EDITION: Scientific Proof That You Can Heal Yourself \n\n4. Get yourself a functional medicine doctor (if you can afford it)! I see Doctor Will Cole, you can look him up on Instagram. Functional medicine doctors can find things that a regular doctor cannot. They aim to heal underlying root causes instead of just trying to hide symptoms. They aim to truly heal not just hide. Understand that all autoimmune issues and especially skin issues do begin in the gut, and functional medicine understands the gut better than traditional medicine does at this point in time. I will link the practitioner directory: \n\n\n\nIf you would like more info about things you can do that you have not yet tried and most people do not know about, feel free to message me. I have 4 chronic illnesses and I have been studying health and nutrition for the passed 2 years because o got tired of being passed from doctor to doctor and never getting any better....just having them try to layer more and more pills on to me, which was not helping at all either. I chose to take my health into my own hands, and to become truly knowledgeable in the fields of new science that could truly help me. Functional medicine and the study of epigenetics have really shown me there is hope, for everyone. You can do this, you just have to be willing to read like a mad woman and transform the way you think about health. You got this \ud83d\udc97. Nobody knew what was wrong with me so they were trying everything to treat me over the last year. I just went to a new doctor a few weeks ago and she said nothing has been working for a reason. So after the exam she determined the reason was LS. I can barely see any white patches so part of me is still skeptical. I truly appreciate the time you took to respond to me. I just feel at a loss. Maybe I just need to give it more time. I do not know. Thank you so much. I will definitely take some time to digest all the information you sent me. I have spent thousands of dollars so to keep going is deflating both mentally and financially. What are PRP injections? And what is the deal with stem cells therapy. I keep reading that but that sounds expensive.      How long was your clob treatment Started 2 weeks ago. 2x a day. Now supposed to start 1x a day for 2 weeks. Also applying estrogen daily. 2 weeks is definitely too soon to see any improvement. I started feeling some relief about 3-4 weeks in but still not 100%. Depending on how bad your symptoms are it may take up to 12 weeks to see a difference. The skin tears because it gets thickened due to LS. I got some tears to but with continued clobetasol the areas really improved and I do not tear anymore.\n\nSkin in vulva is also resistant to thinning from clobetasol according to studies they did. I would focus on doing the clobetasol daily until you see more improvement with time and touch base with your doctor for a follow up later. So would you suggest I do not have intercourse for awhile and apply clob 1x a week?  I guess I just feel like everytime I have intercourse (which is very rare), I am starting all over again. I guess what I am trying to figure out is do I have intercourse while I am taking clob? And I assume you meant the skin is thinned, not thickened? No. I would suggest you continue clobetasol every day. My routine is to take a bath or shower, and then massage clobetasol into the skin at night time. Also make sure you are using the ointment, not the cream. The ointment is thicker and will not wash off as easy and will not burn as much.\n\nI would wait to have sex until you feel ready. I am about 5/6 weeks into treatment and I am still hesitant to have sex. It is all mental though. I would just wait until you are comfortable. Go slow, use lots of lubrication.\n\nAnd no, I did mean the skin has thickened which is causing the cracking. Lichen sclerosus is caused by an immune response where your body is attacking specific proteins on the cells of your vulvar skin. In response to this inflammation, the skin actually thickens to a type of scar tissue. Because it thickens and it is so irregular, it is also prone to cracking which causes the fissures.\n\nI read a lot of scientific literature about this disease and doctors think that the vulvar skin is highly resistant to thinning from the steroid. In fact, if the skin did start to thin in the area it would be a good thing, because it is getting thick in the first place. \n\nBack to the intercourse though, I will shower, have intercourse, then apply the clobetasol to avoid it getting on my partner. It is safe to have sex as long as it does not hurt you. I have had two stem cell + PRP treatments. It is expensive as hell but worth every penny to me. Feel free to PM me :) This is solid advice, from what I have been reading. Get on a daily schedule with the ointment and give it time to work and heal. Hi!\n\nI have heard your story tons of times through different women. Having a normal sex life is so possible! I have seen it happen in women who have suffered for decades. I recommend  on IG and  (an LS researcher and specialist). So much great info. I am in their support group and my vulva is doing much better! \n\nThe clob ointment is really supposed to be continued for maintenance therapy. 2 weeks every day, 2 weeks every other day does NOT work. Trust me. My dr. told me that too. \n\nI begged for the ointment rather than the cream and that was a godsend. I used it every night on the affected areas for 1 month (after a bath bc soaking is really a must), every other night for 1 month, and now I am at 2 times a week forever. \n\nMaintenance therapy is a must for keeping flares at bay, helping skin keep elasticity, and preventing cancer (sure it is rare but it is important to prevent). \n\nI recommend vibrators for increased blood flow on the vulva once your skin gets better. Also dilators!! So helpful!!", "just diagnosed, still learning about it hi everyone, was just diagnosed a few days ago with LS. i am 33F and a few months ago i had intense burning and itching on the left side labia minora. I thought it was due to stitches from childbirth, which I had for a few years (or so i thought!). A few weeks later i had burning and itching on the other side, then went away. Just last week i only noticed the white spots on my labia minora and i freaked out, did the google md thing, and made an appointment w my gyno. I did not like what I read online about LS, but  did not want to diagnose myself... well at my appointment the LS diagnosis was not shocking. My doctor said it was not really common for my age and does not get many patients who have it but it is not too uncommon. He said i did not need to get a biopsy and he did not recommend it right now because he is pretty certain it is LS. I am on clob now and he said after the treatment, discuss what is next if it does not get better. \n\ni have been feeling down since then, but I am glad i found this sub because your posts seem positive and I am thankful for the tips.   I am on clob and I will start working on diet changes. Do the spots go away (is that it flaring up?) or does the steroid treatment just stop it from becoming worse? \n\nFor diet I am planning to try vegan again, i saw some GF posts as well. If anyone has any foods to eat recommendations also that would be great :) \n\nThanks :) The spots never go away completely for me but they get better and occasionally barely noticeable. Then they get worse. Alcohol or lack of water during the day usually puts me down a bad road. Clob helps reduce the symptoms and chills everything out for a while. It is important not to overuse it because it can cause other issues. Use it a decent amount in the beginning and then see how things go. Ls can seem super scary and you think you are life will change a huge amount but the reality is you learn to live with it and get used to it quite fast, honestly just listen to your body and if you feel discomfort stay away from sex and drink tons of water. Different natural oils may help calm the skin and ease the symptoms Going vegan is one of the best things you can do! I have been intermittent fasting and tried going vegan for a week or two. I still run daily and exercise a ton. If you are constantly looking at it and freaking out about it you are brain will play mind games on you, it is not worth overthinking or stressing :) keep a positive attitude and you will be fine! It does depend how bad the flair up is but usually take a couple weeks to month to notice a big difference. Where only cotton underwear. You do not need a biopsy if he definitely diagnose it by examining it. Always use only a very small amount of the ointment because using too much can cause thinning of the skin. It is your body attacking it is own tissues it not a cure. It might make your stomach feel better by going vegan but that has nothing to do with your vagina. You will be ok I have have this for 15 years. thank you for the advice. And true, as I am reading more there is a \u201cfoods to avoid\u201d trend I am noticing but not necessarily vegan~ I have not seen any reputable information about the role of diet in LS. But LS is suspected to be an autoimmune disorder, and many autoimmune disorders do have food triggers. For example, my dad has psoriatic arthritis and gets flares if he eats red pepper or nightshades. But even with PsA not everyone has that particular trigger. \n\nMy gut feeling about food restrictions is that they will not necessarily help unless you have a problem with that particular food. Eating well will make you feel better overall, but I guess my take is do not feel like you have to cut out every \"suspect\" food to control LS. The main things are to apply clob on schedule, moisturize, wear loose cotton underwear or no underwear, avoid fragrances and strong soaps, avoid tight leggings, and avoid and any irritating activity like scrubbing the vulva with a washcloth.  \n\nAbout the \"see how things go\" after clob gets it under control- the general consensus is that LS is a chronic condition, and a maintenance dose will be required, like once or twice a week, to maintain remission. Most people will get symptoms again if they stop taking it completely. So if your doctor wants you to go off clob completely, I guess I would ask him why and maybe get a second opinion to make sure. thanks for the feedback! yes i was thinking about autoimmune diet! It is interesting how much unknown there is. In general i should just be eating healthier anyway lol. \n\nRegarding my dr, he mentioned 6-8 weeks treatment and then maintenance but in terms of the \u201csee how it goes,\u201d he meant to check back in in two months to advise if the clob was working (though, I did not ask what happens if it does not) but will try all the other tips you guys have suggested **pitahayaco**, kminder 2 months on ( 14:46:07&amp;reminder_id=ef460c22731f43f0b33c1ff716c6934f&amp;subreddit=lichensclerosus)\n\n&gt; (/r/lichensclerosus/comments/mj0st4/just_diagnosed_still_learning_about_it/gt8zizu/?context=3)\n\n&gt;  thanks for the feedback!

If the clob does not work, which happens for a fraction of people, you would just try a different topical like tacrolimus. They also might biopsy it to confirm the diagnosis. But clob does work for the large majority of people.", "Looking for Lichen Simplex help! Hi! I have just discovered this community and wondering if anyone can help as I have been suffering in silence for years. \n\nI was first diagnosed after a biopsy following 2 years of not being able to have sex without tearing. I had zero itch and no thickening of skin (multiple dermatologists and gynaecologists have told me there is not any and were surprised I had LS). \n\n7 years later I still cannot have sex without tearing and it is massively impacting my relationship. According to the last Gyne I saw, the anxiety has caused me to develop vaginismus. She also told me I could have an operation to get rid of the scar tissue left from repeated tearing but I need to get my anxiety/vaginismus under control first. \n\nI have been having CBT and using dilators but I still feel so anxious about sex and have ZERO libido. My vaginismus is not severe, we do other things together and I can use tampons but I can feel my entire body tense up when we try to have sex, no matter what I do! I am working on it though. \n\nAside from that I use a hypoallergenic detergent and wear cotton underwear. I used to use a steroid cream but was told to stop as there was no need, I had no thickening/itching and only tear when I try to have sex. \n\nI also have eczema on my scalp and eyes (which IS itchy) if that is relevant... \n\nIs there more I need to be doing? Should I have the operation? \n\nThanks :) I cannot tell you if surgery is right for you, but I will say that if you ever do have vulvar/vaginal surgery, make sure to get an expert who has done many such surgeries before. \n\nYou might try a pelvic pain clinic first. My dermatologist referred me to one but I have not gone yet. Supposedly they have biofeedback/physical therapy exercises and things. The CBT sounds like a good idea. I did CBT for a while and it helped a lot with my depression + anxiety. You could even try seeing a sex therapist about it since they would likely have more expertise about the vaginismus. There are also medications for vulvodynia, like low dose tricyclic antidepressants that also help with nerve function, but I do not know if they are appropriate if you only have pain during sex. That is something a specialist doctor like at a pelvic clinic should know. \n\nSoaking once or twice a day may also help the skin and nerves to feel better. Make sure you moisturize afterward. For penetration, of course more lube always helps. I find it helpful to insert something smaller like a finger first to sort of give my vagina a chance to adjust. Being on top helps sometimes because I can control it and go as slowly as I need to at first. And be generous to yourself and help yourself to whatever you need to be aroused before and during penetration. \n\nI have to say that the Lichen Simplex Chronicus diagnosis seems odd to me, too, like you said your other doctors mentioned. The classic idea of LSC is that it starts with an itchy condition, like lichen sclerosus or eczema, that leads to chronic scratching, which leads to thickening of the skin and more itching. So to have LSC without any itching does not make sense to me. But I am not a doctor. But, I could see how you could have eczema which is itchy in some areas but just causes dryness and cracking in the vulvar area, which leads to over-sensitization of the nerves and associating pain with sex. Who told you to stop the steroid cream? Did it help you at all? When did you use it? Dermatologist. The derm told me to stop using it straight away, the Gyne said use it twice a day for x amount of time and see if it makes a difference but it did not. \n\nI have no itching/thickening so I did not expect to \u2018see\u2019 any difference but did think It may stop the tearing...unfortunately it did not. I have used it for a period of time advised by different gynaecologists about five times now, never noticed a difference! Yep the gynaecologist I saw said she does that operation several times a week so hopefully she is a pro! \n\nWill look into pelvic pain clinic and sex therapist, thank you! \n\nWe do spend ages building up to it and ofc use lots of lube but never seems to help. When we first got together four years ago, it did not happen for a month of having lots of sex so I thought it had gone but it started again and I have not had painless sex since then. \n\nYeah it is weird, I would not say there was even dryness or cracking at all on my vulva, it is literally just one small perennial tear which appears on penetration and is healed within a few days.", "Issue with cuts I posted here a couple of months back. Basically I have been experiencing a tear after sex for around 6 years now. I have been constantly batted back and forth between Dermatology and Gynaecology with no solid answers. Currently I use dilators and if I keep up using them then they seem to make the cuts subside and I am able to have sex without tearing. I would started to feel ok about the situation and accept that I just might have to use dilators long term. Fast forward to this week and I started to notice a sting pain when going to the toilet. I then looked in the mirror and saw lots of little cuts on my perineum area. The skin was extremely dry and flaky but not itchy. I have been applying Aveeno moisturiser for the past few days and the dryness has gone and only one cut remains. Experiencing this has resurfaced my worries about LS. This is always what I have thought was causing my problems but I constantly get told it is not when I suggest it, even though it sounds so similar. When you experience cuts, is there a skin dryness with it? Does it improve with moisturiser? I am so terrified because I am still young and looking up pictures online is scaring me so much that I am just in tears This sounds quite similar to how I started out - my cuts were on the perineum and they were not itchy but the skin was incredibly dry and stung so badly particularly when I pulled the skin. \n\nI know aveeno is relatively low in chemicals and reactants but I would maybe find an emollient used for eczema to use on the skin instead. \n\nI would demand a biopsy from your dr and stop looking a pics online because it is almost always the worst cases of it! Do not worry too much!! We are here for you! Did you find that moisturiser helped your cuts at all? Or did they not subside until you started steroid treatment? Did you have any other symptoms apart from the cuts? Sorry for the 20 questions!\nI actually used to have eczema elsewhere really badly so I am hanging onto that as my last hope but I think I am reality it is something more. Currently I am under a Gynae for the cuts I get when I have sex. They told me it is because my pelvic floor is too tight which I do not buy. Now that I have developed these other cuts I am going to contact them to see if they will expedite my next appointment The moisturiser helped to soften the skin and prevent pulling on the skin when I moved etc, and for the most part the rate at which the cuts were appearing slowed down, but moisturiser did not do anything for healing, just changed the conditions that my skin was getting the cuts in. I noticed major improvements with the steroid treatment. The cuts I had on my perineum were so deep it was like an extension of my labia essentially so when the gyno looks at the LS she points that out as the most scarred and white looking. I would say the other main symptoms I had with this was a constant discomfort whatever I was doing, particularly sitting down, it just felt like I needed to hold my bum cheeks apart (which I could not cos it ripped the skin). My skin also peeled, and this made them think I had a really resistant thrush for the longest time too but the skin would just keep peeling even after treatment leaving the skin underneath unbelievably red and raw and bleeding. \n\nI have psoriasis too, mild on my scalp and occasionally pops up elsewhere so they thought it was that for the longest time, then they realised the treatments they prescribed did not work, and visually it did not match a diagnosis of genital psoriasis. It could be eczema, it is always a possibility but I would definitely try to get them explore LS more. \n\nI think the pelvic floor stuff will play a factor but to me that is a symptom of a bigger issue. I believe it is called vaginismus. You tighten your pelvic floor muscles and this causes discomfort in things like sex and it can usually be linked with an anticipation of pain in sex so the muscles tighten up making the situation even more uncomfortable. I do not know how it would cause cuts from sex but I am not a doctor so I cannot really make a judgement call on that haha So your open cuts did not heal until you started with the steroid treatment? I have managed to get a telephone appointment with a Gynae nurse this morning so I am hoping they might be able to talk with one of the consultants and get me in to be seen \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb They tried to diagnose me with something for 4-5 years so I tried everything from Canesten HC, to calcium psoriasis liquids intended for scalps, daktacort, eumovate, trimovate and eventually Clobetasol. The only time I ever saw improvement was when I had a cream or ointment with a steroid in it - no matter how low level it was, it gave me some relief. \n\nSo to answer your question - yes I only saw improvement in my cuts when I used steroids, but not exclusively potent steroids.\n\nCrossing my fingers for you, hopefully they can get you seen in person!! Good luck x", "What is this??been there for ages itching comes and goes seems to get better than worse? Seeing a dr soon  Ingrown hair?", "Sudden symptoms postpartum I am almost 3 weeks postpartum. About two weeks ago my clitoris started feeling swollen and uncomfortable. I at first thought it was just normal post baby stuff but when I looked really closely at it I saw white discolouration on it. \nGyno thinks it is LS and has me taking monostat7 for two weeks I guess to rule out a fungal thing first? \n\nI also noticed that post birth my inner labia have kind of disappeared, the whole opening looks more sunken in. However it would literally have happened overnight with the birth as it looked normal before (I checked things down there frequently while pregnant).\nSo I am confused if that is just giving-birth stuff (I had stitches for a second degree tear), and that is why I feel smaller. Or if it is related to Ls if I do indeed have that...would the inner labia disappear that quickly?!\n\nI feel super in the dark about this whole thing. I should also add I have not had any itching and it seems that is a big symptom of LS.  When I have a flare up it is more burning/tearing/sensitivity than itching, although the itching can be bad. I think this could totally be LS. Your body has been through a lot of trauma, and yeah, LS changes can happen quickly. Have you been biopsied? When I have LS flare ups it is more like a yeast infection but without the discharge. So it burns, sex hurts really bad, the skin gets fissures so it is like having paper cuts, and the itching is so intense. I used to scratch so badly I would bleed. I did not have any swelling and nothing was really visible to the eye except the fissures.   Hmm. I do not have itching or burning. Just whiteish clitoris and what appears changed labia (and I am not convinced it is just postpartum stuff). :S  Maybe it is swelling that makes it appear that way? I do not think so. It is pretty clearly not there compared to the other side.\nHoping I can have a biopsy to know for sure what it is. The doc prescribed me an antifungal cream for 2 wks I guess to see if that would do anything and if not then a biopsy.  Good luck and hope they are able to figure things out for you.  I do not know how things looked after my pregnancy but I was super bloated from all the fluids they gave me before/during/after my c-section for awhile.  I think I only lost 2lbs coming home from the hospital which is crazy since I had a 7lb baby and vomit after surgery so was not eating a ton plus I breastfeed so I should have at least been down 7lbs plus the fluids the baby was in. I definitely read somewhere that a possible trigger is a traumatic event (like giving birth). However it would be weird if it really happened so fast. It is great that your doctor knows about this disease - many do not, and you will definitely feel better with a diagnosis and treatment. Lichens sclerosis is often affected by hormones so makes sense a flare postpartum. I had major problems with my last two pregnancicies", "Nervous So there is a possibility that I(F/25) have just had/am having my first flare up - I think. Thought it was a yeast infection, but then I looked and saw some lighter white, thin skin all around my clit, and now am mildly freaking out.\n\nI am so grateful for all of you who have posted about your successes and it is helping me calm down a little bit.\n\nI have made an appointment with planned parenthood, but it is not until the end of the month. Do you think I should go to an urgent care sooner than that? I am reading about fusing and loss of tissue and getting a bit worried. \n\nAlso, for those of you that work with their diet, what foods have you noticed cause a flare? I am so sorry you are going through this! Did you take anything to treat the yeast infection? If not maybe email your doctor for flucanazole to rule that out. \n\nUnfortunately, for many doctors LS is really hard to diagnose because doctors do not know much about it. It may be worth visiting a vulvar specialist after ruling out yeast. I am not sure about planned parenthood since I have not been there since I was in high school but hopefully they have an educated gyn on staff! \n\nFor diet, google AIP diet or try low oxalate. For me, going gluten free helped but everyone is different. Hugs\u2764\ufe0f There is no need to go to urgent care, they are unlikely to be prepared to help you with this condition. I am actually a little concerned that Planned Parenthood will not be able to help you either, but I understand that is the best available option for a lot of people. Sometimes gynecologists are not comfortable diagnosing and will refer you to a dermatologist, pelvic pain doctor, or other specialist. Make sure that you leave your appointment with a clear plan for next steps, whether that is recieving medication and getting a follow up or scheduling an appointment with someone else. \n\nTry to keep your vulva moisturized in the meantime. Aquaphor Healing Ointment is a good option, coconut oil can work too. It is also a good time to consider whether there are any potential irritants such as your laundry detergent, soaps, or wearing tight pants or underwear that do not allow your skin to breathe. \n\nI am sorry that you are feeling worried and anxious. It sounds like you are doing your best to care for yourself, and you should be proud of yourself for being proactive! I did get do flucanazole and took it last night. I am worried because I do have white thin skin all over my clit and it is still pretty itchy/uncomfortable.\n\nThank you for the support \u2764\ufe0f Okay, thank you, I kind of figured that. I am hoping planned parenthood will be able to do something/tell me what is up. I do not have a gp where I live yet and my insurance is not really helpful where I live, since I am still on my parents.\n\nI will make sure to keep it moist and clean.\n\nI already changed my body wash, and was hoping it was that, and still am \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\n\nWhat worries me most is that I noticed thin, white skin over my whole clit today, and I cannot tell if it is just because I have had some herb oil on it for a few days (thinking I was having an allergic reaction to something) or if it is a LS spot.\n\nThanks for the support and input \ud83d\ude0a You are welcome, I am sorry you are going through this. It sounds like you have got a solid plan to get some help. Can you say a little more about this herb oil? If you are using something out of the ordinary on your clit, it is probably best to stop until you have spoken to a doctor about it It is olive oil that was heated with some calendula flowers in it. It is supposed to help with skin healing and irritation- ironically.\n\nBut your right, I am going to switch to plain coconut oil and see if that helps!\n\n( Yeah, you got to be extra careful with what you put down below. I will put infused oils and stuff like that on other parts of my skin, but under the underwear is a no-go. Just too sensitive, you never know what might set it off. Yeah, I will switch to coconut oil, and hope that that is it. Aw I am sorry. I am 22 and was diagnosed recently, so if you ever want to vent to anyone my inbox is open! If you bathe in a small amount of baking soda and or borax it can really help, might hold you over until you can see PP. Tbh idk where I would be without borax. Using a good moisturizer can help too, and should be applied after baths and several times a day in general! I love coconut oil, Egyptian magic (Costco), v magic, emuaid, emu oil, jojoba/castor/olive oil, all can help soothe you too. Maybe even get an OTC hydrocortisone ointment (NOT cream), it is not strong enough to effectively treat LS alone, but can help reduce the symptoms until you can get diagnosed. I hope you can find a way to be comfortable. \nAquaphor, Vaseline, or A&amp;D ointment are also soothing and inexpensive, and work as great barriers to use before and after using the bathroom. Urine can irritated the skin. I am having a procedure soon, and had to stop all clob for two weeks, and thought I would actually die.. but to my surprise relying solely homeopathic/otc methods like emuaid, borax, occasional OTC hydrocortisone ointment when necessary, and I have been able to remain comfortable. So hopefully they will help you too! \nIt is a hard disease but you are stronger than you know and there is a lot of hope out there. This group is great and so are the ones on FB. I highly recommend the FB groups because they are larger and more active, but they can be overwhelming. Do not freak yourself out if you see scary posts or Google though. Even if you have it, you are far from the worst case scenario and will address it quickly. \u2764\ufe0f Thank you so much! I appreciate the advice and support.\n\nI have been mildly freaking out all day. And part of me is like \u201cwell, if you have got it you have got it - not too much use worrying about it right now\u201d haha.\n\nI am hoping that planned parenthood will have someone that can diagnose or can do a biopsy, even if just to ease my mind. I do not have a gp or an obgyn so that is kind of my only route atm.\n\nI started using coconut oil today and that has already helped, so I am wondering if it is the calendula oil I have been using, but it is so localized and looks like the description of LS, that I am leaning towards that.\n\nI have heard borax is great, and will probably end up getting some if it persists for more than a few days more.\n\nHow often do you have flare ups? I was able to get a biopsy and a confirmed diagnosis at planned parenthood. Luckily I had a caring doctor who took a few months to get go the bottom of the situation.", "Anyone to chat about vulvar itching and the way it impacts our daily lives? Can you describe your symptoms and if you have been diagnosed", "Does this cause a high ph? I have been having vaginitis symptoms for several months now. Went to the gynecologist and she measured my PH and it was 7 so thought I had BV. Did the metro gel, which was super painful to insert, and that did nothing. Went back, same high ph. She did a culture and it came back negative for yeast or bacteria. \n\nI am still very inflamed and itchy. I tried some RePHresh last night and now it is kind of painful. I am going to the dermatologist tomorrow, is it strange to ask them about vaginitis? I have not faith that my gynecologist will know anything (I did she an NP so maybe the MD would know) but I am seeing the derm anyway for another condition. \n\nI have Crohn\u2019s so thought maybe this was autoimmune but I am on immune suppressants and none of my other extra-intestinal Crohn\u2019s symptoms are displaying. \n\nI feel really stupid asking the derm, but I feel like maybe he will be more knowledgeable? Would he also know if it is due to low estrogen? I have had low estrogen in the past with hypothalamic amenorrhea but never had this much itching so I do not know. \n\nHow do you know you have LS vs LP? I had a biopsy done because my obgyn was so sure I had LS. I am still waiting for the hospital to call to give me my result, but the kind nurse over there told me me my result did not come back as LS. That it may be eczema. I highly recommend getting a biopsy done. My cultures also came back normal. I am still in the process of figuring this out, I have been using clobetasol steroid ointment for 3 months now because the big un was sure it was LS. By now the itching should have resolved, even if it were eczema. It has not. I am now suspect to the idea that it might be my birth control messing with my hormones. (I do not know why docs are so opposed to me going off of it?) I have so many other symptoms, and I do not think it is just all a coincidence. So I think hormones can certainly play a big role in this. I think seeing a dermatologist that specializes in vulvar skin is key. \n\nI tested my PH at home, it was a 6. My obgyn told me no one uses PH testing anymore. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI hope you can find some relief and feel better soon! \ud83d\udc95 Feel free to keep in touch if you have any questions about my experience, or if you do get a biopsy and need some insight! Thanks for responding. I am so sorry for all the issues you have been dealing with. Is your inflammation internal? Like is the inside of your vagina very red? I have itching outside which is not red but inside is super red and the last time I had sex it was pretty painful. \n\nThat seems like a long time to be on steroids and to have no relief. How long did it take to get your biopsy back? And do you have eczema elsewhere? Do you mind sharing what other symptoms you have? \n\nI am 42, so I am assuming my hormones are fluctuating. I was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism which may be caused by a pituitary issue, so I had a bunch of hormone tests done and my estradiol came back low but I had the test in the beginning of my cycle which I guess is when estrogen is low. Do you have other hormonal symptoms? Sometimes I have night sweats, but I have had those for over 10 years and I think sometimes they are Crohn\u2019s related, so I do not know. \n\nHow long have you been on birth control? Do you have other female issues that your BC is controlling? If not, I do think it is strange that nobody wants you off them.\n\nThat is funny about the ph. I did not even know that it was a thing to test before my last couple visits. I wonder why they are not usually used anymore. LS does not really cause internal symptoms. It is a dermatological issue with the skin of the vulva. This sounds like aerobic vaginitis or atrophic vaginitis, which is caused by low estrogen. Lichen planus is also possible.\n\nI would suggest seeing another doctor. Unfortunately most doctors only know BV and yeast as causes of vaginal irritation. Your treatment will likely consist of corticosteroids and/or vaginal clindamycin if you have AV or LP. Metro gel is not going to help. Thanks for your kind words!\n\nI feel some itching inside, my vulva is also very red! I am not sure if the inside is red.\n\nMy symptoms are: vulvar &amp; urethra itching/burning, pain during intercourse, pain is even worse after intercourse, painful urination, frequent urination, abdominal pain/bloating, itchy anus.\n\nThe initial treatment for LS is to use the very strong steroid non stop for a few weeks, in my case they told me 12 weeks. I am nearing the end and only have some relief, the itching inside and on my vulva comes and goes. I have not gotten a call to formally discuss my biopsy result yet, the nurse was just kind enough to tell me what she saw since I kept calling in and asking questions! I do not have eczema anywhere on my body, nor do I have any allergies at all.\n\nI had a hormone blood test done, which I will only be able to discuss with my obgyn in 2 weeks. But from searching online, everything seems normal. But I know there are other hormones that she did not ask then to test me for, and of course if one hormone is off it throws everything off. \n\nI do actually have night sweats and I wake up 3 times during the night for absolutely no reason at all! I do not have any other health issues as far as I know. I have been tested for diabetes, done a complete blood count, had my kidney and liver checked and everything was normal.\n\nI have been on birth control 13 years. I expressed my concern for being on them for so long and I was told that birth control is good to avoid a ton of cancers, but over 10 years can cause ovarian cancer. \u2018But do not go off them, you will be fine.\u2019 \u2014- a little contradictory I would say.\nFor reference, I am 32, my problems started just before I turned 31. Over the years I did notice my libido drop and I was not as wet as I used to be. They also told me since I have been on my pill for so long, it is impossible that I suddenly have issues due to it. I find that hard to believe, since I was so young when I started it. My body has obviously changed!\n\nI was told that swabs would be enough to see an imbalance, so no need for PH testing. \n\nWhen I went for my biopsy, as they noticed a lot of dryness, they prescribed me estrogen cream to use internally. I asked my obgyn and a nurse about it and they both told me not to use it. So I never did. They told me I was too young to be using such a thing. Which is weird to me, considering she suspected LS and a lot of ladies find relief from the estrogen as well. Have you been suggested to use estrogen? I feel like this may help you, since your estrogen is low? I suppose you are getting to that age where your hormones are going to change quite a bit too. Thank you. I did read about both aerobic vaginitis and atrophic vaginitis as well and was wondering about them. That is good to know that LS does not cause internal symptoms so that can be ruled out. \n\nI see the derm tomorrow and will ask if he thinks it is any of the three. Do they do biopsies for LP? And then how do they determine if it is aerobic vaginitis or atrophic? It is not unusual at all for you to ask the derm- I went to a derm for a diagnosis instead of a gyno. Then they can give you treatment accordingly, or a biopsy if they are not sure. I personally would say wait for a biopsy, since if it looks like LS and they think it is LS, the steroid cream will help within a week or two. Biopsies imho are painful and not worth it unless absolutely unsure. Did you stop the clob before getting an LS biopsy done? I have read that you need to be off all steroids for 3 weeks for an accurate biopsy. I have not done one yet though. Oh, thanks so much for easing my mind about asking the dermatologist. And thanks for the the heads up about the biopsy. I was about to be really adamant about getting one, but if they are painful I will probably just see if maybe he can determine a diagnosis without one.", "Anyone with extragenital presentation? Especially if yours presented extragenitally first. Hi all! I am 28/F, diagnosed via biopsy at age 24. I initially had the biopsy done because I had two U.S. quarter-sized white patches (symmetrically placed) on my shoulders/upper back and I was about to get married and wanted to get rid of them (I thought they were fungal). Went to the dermatologist and they were really weirded out that the biopsy from my shoulder showed lichen sclerosus but I had no presentation on my genitals at that time. They used to be white and papery thin, now they have browned and look like freckle clusters.\n\nSince then, I have developed symptoms in the typical \u201cfigure 8\u201d perianal/vulvar region, it is actively flaring and progressing, and I have developed some other weird symptoms (severe lower back pain, extreme fatigue, long-term low-grade fever, etc.) that I feel may to point to a connected autoimmune issue. I have not been tested for any other autoimmune diseases.\n\nAll this to say, I always thought it was weird that my LS started where it did, and I have always wondered if it reveals something about what is going on in my body. Hoping to hear from others with similar experiences. Of course, feel free to message me if you prefer your experiences remain private.\n\nThanks you all! Sending strength and healing vibes to you &amp; yours. Yep, I had it appear first on my thighs and back when I was in my 30s. (I am 53 now)I had no symptoms except a purple, mottled rash. No itching or pain at all. \n\nMy back was another story. It started on the back of my neck with severe itching, but no rash. By the time the rash finally presented, my entire back was involved. \n\nI had the typical genital presentation after about a year of absolute misery on my back.  Years later, it continues in all those places, as well as torso, ankles, arms, back of knees, etc., but the worst of it continues to be on my back. It is bad enough there that I am sometimes in real despair. My story is similar. I have it on my stomach and aswell thought it was fungal. Until my dermatologist told me it was linchin sclerosus. Then I went home and examined my vulva and indeed had it but luckily it seems that I am asymptomatic. I had noticed the white a year ago on my vulva but never thought anything about it becuase I felt nothing. Knock on wood it stays like that", "Pregnancy Anyone else here pregnant or been pregnant? My LS has been awful since early pregnancy and I have been told different things by different people about Clobetasol.  It works wonders for me and not had a flare in 5 months before this, however it is a strong steroid and the effect on baby is unknown\n My labia is red and swollen, I wear socks on my hands at night otherwise I itch myself awake, right now I am smothered in sudocrem and it burns so bad my eyes are watering. I am at my wits end and although the doctor said use clob 'as often as 3 days a week ' I feel reluctant because of the unknown effect on baby. I used it last last week but it only clears symptoms for a day or two rather than weeks or months. I have a 5 month old.  My OB asked me \u201cwhy would you stop using that.  It is fine for baby.\u201d  When I went in for an appointment during a flare up.  I would say go for it, get it under control and then try to stop little by little if you can.  It is not worth feeling the itchiness of a flare up while being pregnant.  Put the cream on while you can still reach down there.  Good luck! Thank you,  I am paranoid about every little thing but the itchiness is driving me crazy so the stress is probably just as bad for baby! So sorry that is happening to you!!  That is miserable!\n\nHave you considered that you might have a yeast infection?  Pregnancy is a prime time for that.\n\nI used a lower dose steroid cream during pregnancy, here and there when it started to flare up for a couple days.  Triamcinolone, I think, and also a simpler OTC cream.  It was enough that I did not need the clobetasol during pregnancy.\n\nI hope you can get some relief :-( :-( :-( Thank you x I did think it might be a yeast infection but I have no discharge and the itching is in 2 specific lichen spots. Its always was worse when I was on progesterone birth control so I assumed the hormones bought it back Maybe try boric acid sits bath or cotton soaked with boric acid solution. Boric acid its really good for the vagina and vulva. I know lots of people use it with success. My OB told me it was ok as long as you are using it externally, so just avoid the direct vaginas opening. I used it during pregnancy as it is important to have your skin happy and healthy if delivering vaginally!", "Help. Painful Sex, it is ruining my relationship I am 25 I have been dealing with LS for one year, I am on clob cream and have been prescribe a lidocaine ointment but the pain during sex is often times unbearable. For some reason my clit swells and can become purple at least 2 times a month and have been to multiple gynos all who have said to keep a log but cannot understand what triggers it but it is very painful, anyway that is some background i am looking for any suggestions of how to make my sex life better in any way because my relationship is suffering and I have guilt that our sex life may never be the same, most of the time I force myself to have sex and almost always bleed and have so much pain during and after I have tried lubes coconut oil the lidocaine ointment and still the pain is so bad that I do not even want to try but to save my relationship I force myself. Is there any hope that I will ever get better or go into remission? Desperate for any help!!! I do not know if this is your answer, but it seems to have been extremely helpful for me.  I added a sprayer to my toilet - not a bidet, but an actual sprayer - and I spray my vulva every time I pee.  My labia and clitoris have not swollen since I started this and the pain is much more sporadic and less intense for me.  I got ( and there are cheaper ones made of plastic in the same style (I chose this one because it is metal).  It is very easy to control the water pressure with your thumb while rinsing.  \n\n\n\n( includes some articles about the potential affect urine exposure has on LS.  While I do not agree with the supposition that urine causes LS (see my comment on that post for my thoughts on that), urine can exacerbate symptoms and wiping may not fully remove urine from your skin.  It is my belief that rinsing can go a long way to improving symptoms.  \n\n\n\nYou can also use aloe or coconut oil between clob doses to soothe the area.  If you use aloe, be sure to get as close to natural as possible (I keep my own plants).  For some people, latex condoms can be an irritant, but I find that my husband wearing a lubricated condom helps me feel less discomfort during sex.  \n\n\n\nIf your relationship hinges on whether you can have sex, you may be setting yourself up for not only the physical pain, but a failed relationship in the long run.  There is far more to a relationship than sex.  If he is not being sensitive to your physical limitations, the two of you may not be a good fit. My boyfriend is very supportive and we have a great relationship but sex is very important to both of us but it is so painful I would like to assume I wipe well and have a bidet so why is sex still so painful??? Hi, \nI am 23 and have also been dealing with LS for about a year now! I am sorry you are going through this, it truly is the worst thing. First of all, you mentioned clob cream? The ointment is much better! It is far less irritating and it absorbs better. I recommend you switch next time you fill your prescription. Anyways, these are the things that helped me regain my sex life, I hope it helps you too. \n1. Borax baths, 1-2x a day (as much as your schedule allows!), for at least 20 minutes each soak. Borax is found in the laundry aisle at target or Walmart.  It is about $5 a box. You add 1/4 cup to begin and can build up (I use 1-2 cups now). It really really helps heal the skin, I was reluctant but it was a game changer for me! I also add coconut oil, Epsom salt, baking soda, etc if I am feeling it. I rub my clob in for 90 seconds after my baths, which is best for absorption \n2. Estrogen cream could help you! I used it and it helped strengthen up my skin for sex. \n3. I like emuaid and v magic as moisturizers :) \n4. Dilators to stretch the skin, once its healed enough, this was key for me! \n5. Foria has some good options for CBD lube and suppositories which can help with pain \n\nIt does take a lot of time, but it will get better. Taking sex off the table for a bit will also help speed things up, that was also really important for me! \u2764\ufe0f Happy to hear you have a good relationship.  Unfortunately, intercourse may not be a great option most of the time.  \n\n\n\nI used to use a bidet, but it does not get the front, especially around the clitoris, as well as spraying from the front.  I heartily recommend switching to a sprayer.  Rinse your entire vulva every single time you pee and give it some time to see if that is effective for you. I hope you are on clobetasol ointment NOT cream. Hey, I am sorry you are going through this, I mean there is always other forms of intimacy that do not require penetration, such as oral on each other, sexting, sending nudes, and many other things you could do. I did those with my partner until it just did not workout between us anymore. Another thing you could do is exercise and keeping up with your doctors appointments helped calms things down for me, I would really think though if you feel the need to force yourself then maybe this is not working out for you. I am sure your boyfriend would not want to do it with you if you are forcing the matter. I do not mean to sound heartless, I am sure he is very supportive and great like you say, but maybe calling it a quits will save you a lot of emotional trauma down the road and might be the best thing you can do. I wish you all the best and hope everything works out for you. Those are all good methods, I have used some of those myself and I found that they have helped. I mean I am glad her BF is very supportive and what not. I understand both sides cause it must be hard on him as well, but Its a good thing he is being supportive. Hey again, I wanted to check in on you and how you are doing? I resonate with you so much, I was in the exact situation you were in with my bf. There are other methods of intimacy you guys can have does not have to always be penetration, it could be oral my bf would give me head and that was worked for us and I would return the favor. You could send nudes, handjobs, idk about you but fingering was tolerable for me but that worked as well, we used dilators to help stretch me out that helped big time like huge difference, and we used vibrators. It really comes down to how much you two want to work on this together. This hopefully is not a permanent thing and you go into remission or have less severe symptoms. One thing that is very important is to stay on top of things medically and not to delay. Communication is key, this is something you must sit down with your bf and talk to about. I am sure if he knew you were forcing yourself that he would not want that. I think it is very caring of you to see his side and his needs and it is nice of him that he supports you, but you two need to sit down and talk and tell him this is how you feel. I assume since we are the same age you guys are not married or have kids so both of you guys have no obligation to each other than the love you guys have. It is crucial you sit down and talk to him and say how you feel like your forcing yourself and see how he reacts. My bf lowkey said he knew it felt forced. Anyways talk to each other about this because to make this work there is a lot of communication needed and honestly it might be better you guys just maybe stay friends or go your separate ways to save heartache in the end. My bf and I ended up splitting, but we remained friends and I still personally do not have much desire or drive for sex with him or anyone, but we are very close friends and we hang out a couple times a week and talk, it sucks but what can you do. I hope things work out for you. You can Pm if you ever need to talk  It is the ointment I misspoke Thank you for sharing, I know how hard it can be. I am a 24 year old woman and managing my sex life has been very challenging with LS. If your LS is hurting your sex life this much, I would encourage you to seek out a provider with a more aggressive approach. Steroid shots are cheap and very effective - it actually gave me my sex life back after just one appointment. 2 in my perineum and I had the most relaxed, intimate beach trip of my life with my fianc\u00e9. Other than that, I agree with the other commenters: lots of lube, try positions where you are on top/in control, take it as slow as possible. If all else falls, start giving amazing blow jobs. Seriously, start giving amazing oral sex.\n\nI am actually undergoing the laser (FemTouch/MonaLisa) treatment now. It is very expensive ($1000 per dose) but it is supposed to have amazing results. Thank you everyone!!! you have all been so supportive I cannot wait to try everything and hopefully can somehow manage!!! Replying to say YES YES YES to the ointment instead of the cream. Man that cream burned my vag and stung all my irritated spots. I also recommend taking a bath and THEN applying the ointment. I was told you got to rub ointment in because lichen sclerosus is the thickening of skin, not thinning. You want that ointment to penetrate into the deepest layers! These are great tips! :)", "Question about steroid creams M(21) uncircumcised\n\nSo I have not been officially diagnosed with LS and my dermatologist seems to believe I do not have LS but I hope I can ask this here. Last year due to some penile skin issues I was prescribed an antifungal mixed with Betamethasone 0.05 After about four days of usage I stoped and then I noticed some redness among other things. It is been months since and now I have developed LS issues, such as discoloration, dry skin, etc. I read up on this only to find out the treatment is MORE steroid cream? My initial concern is that I caused skin damage. To other men with LS, does more steroid cream truly work to combat these issues? Can I speak to someone who regularly uses steroid creams to see if they have similar issues? Clobetasol works for penile LS. Clobetasol is a lot stronger than betamethasone, which is a strong steroid in its own right. It only damages skin if you over use it. You need to follow your dermatologist\u2019s instructions and follow the course for the directed period. If you get unexpected reactions, speak to your dermatologist, do not self diagnose. I have used both betamethasone and Clobetasol with no negative reaction but the skin of my glans peeled off - like sunburn - as part of the resolution of the LS. Stop double guessing the doctor. If you have concerns or doubts, ask. If you do not get straight answers/trust your do today, get a new doctor. I wish you all the best. Makes sense, had the same thing happen while I used the Betamethasone. My glans had never looked to pink and so healthy I was over joyed as they had not looked that great in many months. Then when I stopped I felt like I was living a  nightmare :(\n\nYou do not think that even liberal application once a day for four days is enough to do damage? I am not a dermatologist. I am told my my dermatologist who was part of the drafting group for the British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for LS, that the standard regime for Clobetasol as a treatment for penile LS is twice a day for 1 month. You would typically take a break after that of at least a month or drop down to a materially reduced dosage. Please note that Clobetasol is only about 60% successful in the treatment of penile LS and requires support of an ongoing regime designed to reduced exposure to urine. Circumcision is a more effective treatment, c.90% successful, but I personally find circumcision to be an unattractive solution.", "LS Diagnosis? Hi all - new to this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have been having pain for about a year during and after sex. It hurts around my labia and around the entrance of my vagina. It can feel like a burning sensation and sometimes has been so bad I have had to put ice on it after to help the pain. I also sometimes get bad inflammation after sex. Doctors keep diagnosing me with thrush and I ended up going on a 3 month treatment, starting around October 2018. I got a bit better with the occasional split in the labia and did not really have sex anymore. Since then, I think I got thrush again about a month ago and did the usual treatment and was all good. But I still get the occasional split and still do not bother with sex. The last split was last Wednesday and had sort of healed up by Saturday or Sunday (today).  I have had the issues of painful sex and splits and the occasional (assuming) thrush for a year now and I am worried it is more than just thrush. I googled so much about labia tears and the main thing it leads me to is LS and I am so scared to get diagnosed! I do not have any white patches, it does not sting to pee (however it does after sex), I am 22f. As previously mentioned, my main symptoms are vaginal tears, painful sex leading to burning/stinging/inflammation, occasional thrush (according to Drs). Does this sound like early LS? :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery time I present to the doctors (incl. two gynos) they have diagnosed me with thrush and I am honestly sure it is not thrush because it is been going on for too long. Also, I do not usually have any other symptoms of thrush such as itching and discharge... I assumed the only symptom of thrush I had was the splits. Sorry if this is all over the place, I am sorta freaking out and was wondering if this does indeed sound like LS? Going to another gyno tomorrow... I was sent home and condescendingly told that I had a yeast infection and to stop complaining - for years. I was not diagnosed until I was thirty and called for an appt. they told me it would be 18 months to see a doc and I started bawling on the phone. I thought I had ripped open a scar from childbirth. They took pity and got me to a doc that actually knew something, and as soon as I got there and she put a light on me she knew what it was and asked why I did not come sooner. I had been trying for years!\n\nYes, your rips and pain and experience sound very much like mine. \n\nTearing of the labia is not normal. That is not yeast/thrush. \n\nThe pain finally stopped when I was diagnosed and got clobetasol. Years of pain and burning and itching so badly I could not sleep - ended in days. Over. I still flare when life is rough and I do not use the cream for a while, but clobetasol, a very potent steroid cream, knocks it down fast. \n\nFind another doc. Tel them about the tearing. Might say that your skin sometimes rips as easily as tissue paper - tissue paper is a key word for LS. \n\nLook in a mirror with a very bright light. Whitish skin in a figure-eight shape around the vagina and anus, over the perineum, is a classic appearance. You cannot see it without a mirror and bright light, though. \n\nYou can get relief with a regular topical steroid cream, but it is not as effective as clobetasol. And you do not want to calm a flare before seeing a doc. But they do work a bit. You would not use it more than twice a day and you would apply to slim where hair does not grow. \n\nReally worth seeing an experienced doc. Maybe ask on the phone for a doc familiar with LS. Many docs have no idea what it is at all. Too uncommon. Tearing labia should get their attention though. \n\nSorry you are going through this and good luck getting it figured out, whatever it turns out to be!  Do not be afraid about the diagnosis. It is really not that bad. Google makes it sound horrendous and it is not. \n\nSee a DERMATOLOGIST. They specialize in skin. For three freaking years I kept going to my obgyn. She was a monster and kept telling me I was imagining things and that I need to quit coming in for something that was not even visible.\n\nI did a lot of googling to figure out I needed a dermatologist. I finally got the help I needed. It sounds like you do have LS and an easy way to fix it is to use steroid gel/cream they prescribe. \n\nBefore you start thinking terrible things like steroids are bad because your libido might drop or you might grow a beard, no that is not really true. It just helps repair the skin and you will be able to have painless sex again. It is important you get treatment sooner than later as it will just get worse.  Thank you so much for your response, I appreciate taking the time to write all this!\n\nI still do not see the white patches, however the light just might not be bright enough, or maybe it is too early stages? Anyway, I have got a gyno appointment in an hour or so, if I still do not get anywhere I will see what dermatologists are available around here! Still pretty anxious about the diagnosis being LS, but it is better than suffering with incurable \u201cthrush\u201d or something else unknown.\n\nThank you! Yeah, I have been diagnosed with thrush sooo many times even after the tests were negative for thrush... seems like gynos cannot even do their own job D:\nLS has never once come up when discussing the tears\n\nI am super anxious about getting diagnosed with LS, but as I said in the other comment, it is better than not knowing what is going on. Hopefully can get this sorted out\n\nThank you so much for your reply :) And if they say it is LS, feel free to DM me with any questions! It is really not that scary to have. Treatment is easy and they do not always need to take a biopsy or whatever it is called. My dermatologist just took one look and new exactly.  It could be early stages so it would not be white yet. I was diagnosed by a dermatologist after a punch biopsy. Clobetasol is a gift for LS sufferers. I hope you get some answers soon. Thank you!!", "Biopsy Recovery How long did it take your vulva to fully heal after biopsy? I got mine done on Tuesday, so I am about a week into recovery. I think I heard it can take two weeks, but maybe I am misremembering\n\nAlso, does anyone have any good remedies or medicine to help it heal faster? I have just been using vaseline. Honestly I think mine took 2-3 weeks. Two different spots seemed to heal differently. One about 2 the other closer to 3. Thank you for sharing! Yeah my doc did not tell me how long it would take just to keep applying vaseline until it is better. 3 weeks is long!! lol For me, for the site to completely stop hurting was around 2 months. The biopsy itself healed within 1 month but the skin was (and still is fairly) very thin and hurt. I used betadona cream that my doctor gave me.\nWishing you a speedy recovery! Thank you for sharing!! Mine does not currently hurt unless I touch it weird or rub against it fast. I will look into that cream!", "Lidocaine helps me so much ", "Is this LS? Vitiligo? Trying to provide a close-up shot because the skin does feel slightly different in this area (I just applied cream fyi)  second image shows the lightness a little better.

I have been using clobetosol for about a week. I did notice this about a week after an unprotected encounter, so I was thinking it might be an STI, but I am unsure. \n\nAlso, they say they do not know what causes LS but could it be like....... moisture?

Whole glans turned white ! Looked like Frost on a winters day. \nSo use vaseline now and no repeat.\nBTW since the white was new it was removed by the Betamethasone ointment in a week. This is a steroid crem, weaker than clobetasol. \n\nSo yes its water sensitive and an autoimmune system reaction , anyway that seems the most likely.\nDemotologist is best spells, especially for men. \nWe do not have gynecologists !", "Some advice/thoughts? Hey! (F19) here. So I finally finished the 3 month clobetsol treatment and saw my lichen getting better -slowly, still occasionally have itching and pain  unfortunately. Anyways i went back to my gyno and she said stop using clobetsol since I cannot use it long term and now has me on tacrolimus? I have never heard of it but was wondering if anyone has used it or has had luck with it? \n\n(She told me to use it when needed but I get itchy almost everyday\ud83d\ude2d)", "Does this dry clitoris looks like LS?  NSFW", "Laser Treatment for LS Hello LS siblings!  \n\n\nI (24F) hope you all are well. This thread will be about my journey with the Fem Touch laser treatment for LS. Other brand names are Mona Lisa Touch or Tulip. A new dermatologist recommended Fem Touch for me after steroid ointment was not stopping my flares and I wanted a more longterm solution. There is new research showing how lasers designed for vaginal rejuvenation for post-menopausal women have great success in treating LS. It is considered a cosmetic procedure so it is not covered by insurance. It is expensive, around \\~$1000 per dose, and you need 3 doses. \n\nThe appointment was easy to set up. The laser technician asked that I shave completely before our appointment. A physician's associate examined me for any genital warts and I underwent a pap smear a few weeks earlier (I believe you cannot have this treatment if you have an STD). The experience itself incredibly painful. I yelped and gasped many times. I am 4 days out from the procedure and the recovery was very painful as well. I bled sporadically over the next few days. I will list some helpful recovery tips below.\n\nAt this point, I have no recommendations as to whether you should do it or not, but this procedure is not for the weak of heart. If you are scared of this pain, I would recommend steroid shots, which were quick and just a short sharp pinch in the affected area (like any shot you might get). I plan on continuing the laser treatment in six weeks.\n\nTips for recovery:\n\nAquaphor or vaseline often\n\nWet wipes or a bidet for wiping\n\nPerinatal cold packs - tons on amazon. I recommend the re-usable ones so you can just toss them in the freezer and wash their covers.\n\nTake it easy!!! The doctor will tell you no exercise or sexual activity and she is NOT joking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone had a different experience or would like to share their tips, please comment below! I have been curious about laser treatments for LS for a while.  Thanks a ton for sharing your experience with us! Keep us updated please\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc following for updates! I hope you have a smooth recovery and find some relief Please share updates!", "does anyone get bruising? i have a terrible flare but i noticed the skin also seems to be bruised and tender to the touch. does anyone else experience this? \n\nwould icing the area help? Bruising is actually one of the symptoms of LS so this is actually normal. I only noticed bruising once during a flare...looked like a deep purple bruise around the clitoral area. Eventually it just went away. well i am relieved that it is normal but god damn, this disorder is awful. I get a tender bruised feeling sometimes, without any visible bruise. I take it as a cue to step up the topical treatment. \n\n Actual bruises are definitely a thing with LS, though. I get bruises all over and I am not sure if that is related. People have told me that I look like someone beat me up!\nFor me, I think that is autoimmune in nature (and systemic autoimmune conditions are pretty common in women who also have Lichen --- easy bruising is extremely common in a variety of autoimmune conditions). When I started Sulfasalazine for my arthritis it got a lot better (if only it had done something for my skin!).\n\nI also have bruising all over my groin area boarding the Lichen, which my guess is that it maybe has to do with the damage and thinning that it causes... might make the blood vessels in the area more sensitive and break easier.

It different for everyone. Try not to think about that too much it will make you crazy but it is good to be aware if you think anything changes. I have had it for over 15 years and I have changes but I just take day by day. Do you think waiting a month for a gyno appintoment is detrimental Depends on if your having symptoms and how bad they are. Does your tissues look very thin or any tears Would that mean it is progressing quickly It would mean that your having a flair and you would want to see someone sooner rather then later. It can cause issues if not treated but there are medicines to help keep it healthy. I do not want to scare you. It was slow for me, I was fused completely when I was little but my doctor used Estradiol to separate my labia. \n\n When I was 17 it came back, I noticed itching and \u201cpaper cuts\u201d at first, there was some bleeding and then about two months later I had my first re-fusing, I woke up one morning and noticed that I was in more discomfort than usual and I felt a \u201cpulling\u201d sensation but I diddnt look down there for a few days then when I did I completely freaked out.", "Periods and flare ups and cunnilingus Hi all!

Can we then have sex? \n\nThanks for any advice in advance.", "Have a feeling I have LS Hi all,\n\nI thought I would make a post on here and just reach out. I am pretty scared and need to talk to someone. \n\nSo, back in December, I started noticing my vulva area was just plain dry. I had just ended my period so I figured it might be some issue with being touchy from wearing pads. I have sensitive skin. So, I figured I just might switch to a different type of pads and that it would solve the problem. \n\nThis dryness stayed though and then I started itching down there a lot. So, I went to my dr. He thought it sounded like a yeast infection and I was sent on my way with a diflucan pill and a suggestion to try antifungal cream. \n\nWell, this solved nothing. So, I went back. He decided to do an exam. I tested negative for everything.  Bacterial vaginosis, yeast. Etc. I also expected to not have an std because I have never been sexually active. Of course, that was negative as well.\n\nThe itching finally started to go away and I seemed less dry down there. It is started in again now and the itching has came back.\n\nThe Dr gave me two diflucan this time and again.. no change. Very itchy and I have noticed too my rectum is also itchy.\n\nI am going back to see him tomorrow and I am going to mention LS.   I see no white patches.. everything looks normal. It is just this dryness and itchiness. \n\nI am completely puzzled and feel down about it. I am 24 and a female. Not on any birth control. I have heard horror stories about this condition and I am very scared if I have it. \n\nDoes this sound like LS or something else? Have you experimented with any personal lubricants? Not kind people use for sex, you will want to look where the feminine hygiene stuff is. Look for something water-based to start with, but try a couple of different kinds. That way when they ask you at the Dr. what you have tried for it you will have input for them that can help inform treatment decisions. I will say when I was your age (I am 35 now) I never saw white patches. I always assumed it was a yeast infection until I was diagnosed with a bladder condition and the doc discovered LS as well. But for me anyways it is try and itchy sometimes. I ended up getting a punch hole biopsy to confirm diagnosis years later. Sex always seems to make me flare. So I use a medication sometimes but when I am feeling itchy/dry I use aquaphor. This creates a nice barrier from urine and soothes the itchy skin. \n\nGood luck! I read sooo many horror stories and was terrified. I will say I rarely get flares now but they do come.  Thank you. :) If I can pry, can I please ask what bladder condition you have? Doctors told me they suspect I have interstitial cystitis. I see a urogyno in May for further inspection and tests to rule it out.\n\nI should check into Aquaphor. Is it safe to use on the vulva? I am going to ask him about LS tomorrow as well as a regular exam to rule out any infection. \n\nI am quite scared but trying to keep stress levels low.  No I have not. What would that help?  The dryness, which may or may not be causing your itchiness whether or not you have LS. I could definitely look around at Walmart No problem! I have IC as well!   \n\nAquaphor is safe. It is my go to because I am heavily tattooed and I use that on my tattoos to heal as well. But you can use vaseline as well. You just want a small layer to act as a barrier. \n\nI was scared and ready soooo many horror stories. Plus I do not know anyone with the condition which is how I ended up on this thread !  But I rarely flare up that said I am not currently sexually active. When I was I was having to use the cream a bit more. I think as long as you are proactive about it and maintain apts. I only see my doc about once a year bc I am not having any current issues. I do know that it is not that common. What did we do to deserve this lovely thing lol. \n\nGood luck today!!  Thank you!! I will look into aquaphor. I am hoping my dr takes me seriously. I sometimes feel like a joke to him coming to him about these issues.  I have been there! I went undiagnosed for years with my IC and was miserable. Finally I found one doctor who took the time to look at my symptoms and listen to me. I have had great luck with female urogynos but I have not been able to find many that are in my area. It is the best when you find someone to listen and take the time. I was being treated for bladder infections for years when really it was just IC. If your doctor is not taking you seriously then I would consider looking around. I have had about 5/6 urologists just bc I was not happy with the care.  Oh boy, do I know that. I had to practically persist repeatedly til I was referred to a urogyno. I just got back from the dr office. He did an exam. He said everything looked normal though there is like a little piece of the inside of my labia that is now raised a little from how much I have itched, the texture there too feels rougher from itching. He said though everything looked normal and not cancerous at all. He also said that nothing looked indicative of lichen sclerosis at all. I was pleasantly surprised he was familiar with the condition.  He says it sounds like I am allergic to something such as the pads I am using or the laundry softener I am using.  I wanted to sigh hearing this as I have switched to hypoallergenic pads.. hypoallergenic laundry soap or softener. If I am allergic to something, it is possible it is the texture of the pads. I do not know. I notice an allergy pill helps to make it less itchy. He has suggested for me to diligently apply Vaseline or aquaphor to the area for two weeks. This is not a bad  idea as he thinks it is dry skin from irritation. If it does not work, I am going to see a gynecologist. I hope Vaseline is safe to use there. Well that is good that he does not think it is LS! I am also very sensitive to everything! I only use hypoallergenic and sensitive skin for everything so you should be ok with the Vaseline or aquaphor! Good luck. Hopefully that is all it is and you can try and eliminate more even though it seems like you have eliminated a lot!

I am having a follow up soon to discuss this more but there does not really seem to be much of an LP community so here I am. \n\nI have read a lot of posts on here but I have a few things that I have not got a clear answer on sorry this is long but I am young and worried! I will be going over these things with my doctor next appointment anyways but it is a few weeks away. \n\n1. Can you go swimming? I am thinking of joining a gym that has a salt water pool but im not sure if swimming is irritating or bad for the steroid creams? I am only using hydrocortisone 2.5 right now because clobetasol was irritating and so was Halbatosol. \n\n2. Does exercise or weight loss make your symtoms better or worse? I have lost 60 pounds right before being diagnosed and I want to lose another ~ 30ish but I am scared that will make me have a bad flare. \n\n3. Sex, I am a virgin so I do not know if it will be painful for me or not but exams are very painful for me. My doctor said I would be able to have sex because I have not fused over and that my length and width are normal but she did not mention anything about pain. Do you use dialators? Where did you get them, how long have you used them and when did you see improvement? What lube and condoms do you use and does the steroid affect your partner? \n\n4. For those of you who have lost your labia minora, do partners care? I still have some of mine left but they are discolored and small. I basically have nothing near my vaginal opening only around my clit area. \n\n5. Pubic hair. Do you find that having hair irritates the skin? I have always been a bush woman and have never shaved but recently I have been trimming pretty short and I think there is been less irritation. I am thinking of getting an electric razor but not sure if that would be good for LS skin. \n\n6. Toilet paper and underwear, best brands? Right now I am using MD and Jockey but curious about what other people use. \n\n7.  Has anyone here gotten their covid shot? I just got my first dose of Moderna yesterday and I am not having any symtoms but I am worried that the 2nd shot will cause a flare. Has anyone had a flare after the second shot? \n\n8.

Sorry if formating is bad im on mobile", "Borax soak? Hi,\n\nJust got diagnosed with LS. Been reading online and lots of people mention that doing a sitz bath with diluted borax has cleared it up. Just not sure about how safe borax actually is? On the box it says it is not to be ingested. It is also used to kill insects. However I know that it is used in lots of processed meats in Southeast Asia and in lots of food that I ate growing up there and have had no toxic side effects that I am aware of.\n\nSo. To borax or not to borax?", "Pants recommendations? I am (F25) newly diagnosed and have seen a lot of people saying they do not wear jeans or leggings. Mine is pretty mild, but I want to prevent it from getting worse. I basically live in jeans, but want to know what types of pants you all recommend? I find looser and softer clothes to be more comfortable.  Try loose sweat pants and no underwear. What do you do for work? I am a teacher and so I cannot wear sweatpants there. I can occasionally get away with joggers.  I do landscaping. What about dress pants for you? Dress pants tend to have a lot more length between the waistband and the bottom of the crotch area, probably due to the fact that old guys wear their dress pants up to their armpits with their shirts tucked in..  if you wear the pants with the waist around your waist instead of your stomach or chest then you end up with a cool amount of extra space in the crotch area compared to your typical jeans.  I wear dress pants(from goodwill haha) casually just for the comfort. I dono what your taste in fashion is like but something like this would work well also. \n\nMen's White Drawstring/Elastic Waist Yogi Indian Cotton Casual Pants  Thanks! I will have to see if I can find anything I like! You could try dresses/skirts. I usually wear those and rompers if weather allows. Softer pants/slacks could also work anything with a lil breathing room. Cotton (white if you can) underwear if you wear any I (47F) wear a lot of jeans, and have good luck with thinner denim - Sonoma brand from Kohl's does okay and some higher end brands in lighter weight. You might also, depending on your body type, do well with a men's brand like the Ballroom Pants from Duluth Trading (pun intended as they are mean to leave room in the crotch); if you are on the curvier side those may not fit well tho.\n\nThere is always (gasp!) skirts but then I struggle with too tight tights or hose underneath in the winter. Those are good suggestions! For the underwear I have been seeing a lot of 95% cotton, but was told 100% cotton by the doctor. Do you know if the 5% makes a difference? A lot of times the 5% is for the elastic band so it should be pretty good! I think I have heard Calvin Klein and aerie have some good ones but it is $$ Thanks! I am new to all this and there is so much information to figure out! I appreciate it! I had to stop wearing jeans after my bowel resection because the button pinched into my scar on my belly. I constantly wear light knit pants but my fave are yoga pants with a flare at the ankle. And I switched to pure cotton underwear, but a spandex mix works too. I am a teacher, too. Athleta has some pants that are on the sporty side of professional, but they are great in the classroom. My favorite ones are the Brooklyn ankle pant and the Venice jogger. I will definitely have to check those out! Thank you! Mine is mild and only leggings seem to bug me if it is been too long. Also certain underwear, cotton seems to be best! Mine is mild as well and have not had many issues with clothing so far. Is it best to wear lose clothing to avoid flare ups or just when you are having a flare up? I tend to have a flare if I wear pants that are too tight.", "Not diagnosed yet: Hi, I am like 99?9% sure I have Lichen, I have a biopsy on 1/28 so it is not completely diagnosed. I had noticed last year in January I had started to get vaginal/anal discomfort and I pushed it off as hemorrhoids/yeast infection/BV. I had gone through multiple treatments and tests for yeast infections and BV with no prevail and it was not until just recently I was able to finally see my gyno in person due to the covid restrictions. She stated that she believes it to be lichen due to the white patches on my skin. I have not had any kind of treatment or anything for relief and lately the itching has been so bad to where sleeping is becoming so uncomfortable. What does everyone use for itch relief?", "9 year old daughter (long post, seeking advice) Hi everyone. Thank you so much for this community! I have been reading so much in here and now I have decided to make a post because I strongly suspect my little girl has LS. \n(Btw I truly apologize for any grammar mistakes beforehand since I am Scandinavian and English is my second language.) \n\nWarning really long post!\n\nIn late February my 9 year old daughter had a lot of itchiness down there and I just put on some yogurt thinking it was some typical yeast- thing (my mother used to do the same thing to me when I was a little girl and it always worked ). When that did not work I tried to let her sit a couple of days with some white vinegar diluted in water, I had found that instruction on NHS\u2019 website, but to no avail. (please do not judge me I tried natural remedies first and did not know any better\ud83d\ude1e). \n\nThen one night, I see that she actually has a reddish pink sharply demarcated plaque on her labia majora and clitoral hood that is shaped almost like a an almond or a key hole. It starts on top of the clitoral hood and it ends just below her vagina, it does not exceed down to the perianal part. Her skin was also very very crinkled and scaly and super dry, and on her clitoral hood she had two little porcelain white raised, smooth hard papules along with a small raw patch and two deep cuts at the entrance to her vagina. \n\nSo I called the doctor who, because of COVID, did not want to see her but just prescribed her a mild steroid cream over the phone and said it sounded like yeast. Because I had heard so much about steroids being \u2018dangerous\u2019 and because I felt unsafe with the doctor prescribing it without even looking at my daughter, I decided to wait and see. \n\nI called again a couple of days later and this time insisted that the doctor took a look at her because I had googled and Lichen Sclerosis kept showing up in my search results, and so we got an appointment after both getting the mandatory COVID tests that would allow her to be seen in the clinic. \n\nAt the clinic my doctor (another one) started out by saying that Lichen Sclerosis is VERY rare in young girls (even though I had read that it was not THAT rare but okay) and she took a look and did some swaps with q-tips to test for bacteria. She said she also suspected yeast, because there was also quite some pungent smell. I on the other hand suspected LS from the moment I found it online. The doctor said that I should use the mild steroid cream and call back when the test results came back. \n\nI used the cream for 10 days and the test results had come back all clear but her patch had now turned really pale pink. I told my doctor that I really wanted a referral to a clinic I found online that specializes in vulva diseases including LS, but she did not want to give me that because she said it could be something else than LS, so instead she sent me to the pediatric department at our local hospital even though I disagreed because I was so sure it was LS (at this point I had googled every day all day 24/7 and cried many tears). \n\nI was afraid that it would be a waste of precious time and I was worried about the loss of architecture I had read so much about. \n\nAnd so today we had our appointment at the pediatric department at the hospital and I am sitting here so sad because it was exactly how I imagined. \n\nFirst of all the doctor starts out by saying that she never sees girls with LS only boys and she does not know why that is, besides the fact that \u2018it is super rare in little girls\u2019. Then she looks at my daughter\u2019s genitals for literally 8 seconds and then asks me about our treatment with the steroid cream, how long she was on it etc. She then brings up pinworms because they itch at night and I tell her that I am familiar with those and it is not that. \n\nI then show her pictures I have taken to document my daughter\u2019s condition and on some of the pictures I have managed to gently pull back the clitoral hood and on the clitoris you can see some swelling and a white patch along with something that looked like a flake of dead white skin which I had then tried to remove (gently with a clean napkin but decided to leave it to not make anything worse).\n\nThe doctor reacted to those pictures and said \u2018there is swelling hmm... wow it is really good you have those pictures\u2019 and I am like -\u2018are not you going to examine her clitoris ?\u2019 and she crosses her arms and is visibly uncomfortable and just says that she will not do that it is too invasive or something like that. \n\nAnd then she says that she wants to do a biopsy in anesthesia because she suspects LS and my heart stops because I have read EVERYWHERE that biopsy is not recommended on little children!? \n\nAnd then I ask \u2018local anesthesia?\u2019 and she says \u2018no, general anesthesia\u2019. And I say \u2018but she is only 9?\u2019 and then the doctor said \u2018no she is a big girl and it is only a little piece\u2019. And I am just shaking inside and I repeatedly express to her how hard this decision is for me, especially since she has not really looked at my child but wants to order a biopsy based on a picture I just happen to have?? \n\nShe said she wants to make sure that my daughter actually has LS since the treatment is \u2018strong steroid cream twice a day for up to 6 months\u2019 (her exact words - which also confused me because I had read everywhere that it was only 2x a day for a month, 1x a day for another month and then a couple of times pr. week for the last month). \n\nThen she says that as an alternative she can refer me to a dermatologist since they are more experienced with LS and maybe they can diagnose my daughter without needing to do a biopsy. But she could not guarantee that a biopsy would not be needed eventually. And so I said that I would like a referral to the vulva clinic I mentioned earlier and she hesitantly said that she would give me that and told me that my daughter must have had the patch longer than February I just have not noticed. :(\n\nI left feeling sick to my stomach because I felt so uninformed and confused and had to explain to my daughter why the doctor did not really examine her, since we had a talk yesterday about what was going to happen today. I just told her that she is going to the real experts this time but I am just so sad and scared. \n\nI am completely 100% on board with getting a proper diagnosis before starting the strong steroid treatment but I really could not agree to an invasive biopsy with my little 9 year old daughter having to undergo general anesthesia when the doctor have not even examined her AT ALL? If they feel like a biopsy is necessary after a thorough exam at the vulva clinic then it is something completely different. \n\nThis whole experience has just been awful and everyday as I am putting on almond/olive oil and mild fatty lotions on my daughter I just pray for this to go away but it will not and I feel like this is my fault for keeping the toilet paper in a storage room along with (100% closed) paint and utensils etc. and I also used to keep cleaning products in the bathroom next to the toilet roll\ud83d\ude13\n\nWe live in the city in a super small apartment and her older sister and I have never had anything down there no itchiness or cuts or anything and we have lived here all their life, it is just so hard to make room for things and the thought of something like this happening had never crossed my mind\ud83d\ude13.\n\nI have always used non-perfumed detergent and never washed her with soap down there either and the shower gel and soap is organic and mostly non-scented, so the storage is the only thing I can think of that I must have done wrong\ud83d\ude13. \n\nI have since then removed everything and educated myself 1000% to help her through this. I am just heartbroken and I am seeking advice from all you wonderful people. And again please do not judge me for my mistakes I wish more than anything that I had stored things separately.\n\nCan I ask what your opinions are about our situation? \n\nTLDR: Would you feel that a diagnosis for a 9 year old girl could be possible to obtain without a biopsy? And if not, do you think that is was okay for me to wait with the biopsy until she is had a thorough exam? I know it is unlikely but do you think that the plaque could be something else than LS?:\n\n-The plaque is now light pink (my daughter is tanned so there is a contrast), still sharply demarcated and her labia majora are still partly wrinkled, paper like and shiny, and partly thin and shiny. \n-The hood of the clitoris is still scaly, thickened and with a raw- ish patch although softer. \n-One of the two shiny pearly spots is gone but another smaller one has shown up elsewhere. -The entrance to her vagina has two small cuts (the two earlier cuts have almost healed) and once in a while it hurts a bit when she pees but other than that there is no itch or pain. \n-A little bit of smell still and it could be smegma but I am not looking into the clitoris because it left purple-ish marks on her clitoral hood the only time I looked and I will not do that again. \n\nBesides that everything looks fine especially with the oils and lotions and all and she is completely unbothered by it. \n\nThank you so much for your time!!\n\nSincerely, a sad mom (who also suffers from anxiety ) 1. LS is very possible in young girls, I had it myself (since \\~13 y.o) and was misdiagnosed for a decade. So kudos to you on being proactive!\n2. In the end, you are not a medical professional, so diagnosis is not your specialty. For someone her age, I think that a biopsy is probably the best way to go to ensure that she is properly treated. Biopsies are not a huge deal, and they are fairly routine, and your reaction reads as severely overprotective- you are going to have to give at some point, you cannot oppose everything yet want a solution. A biospy will give you a the best insight into diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n&gt;\u2018strong steroid cream twice a day for up to 6 months\u2019\n\n3. Up to 6 months. This depends on her reaction to the cream, the effectiveness, etc etc. Also, the strength of the cream my vary- it depends on which steroid she is using.\n\n4. The cause of LS is unknown- it is not your fault :) some suspect it may be an autoimmune disease, but nothing is certain. I agree with u/sproutgirl, I am so glad you are being proactive. It is possible in young girls and doctors telling you otherwise are probably just not well versed in LS. I am 35 and I have had to see many different professionals for this issue and it is clear some of them just do not know what they are talking about. \n\nI do not think it is unreasonable to wait for the specialist at the vulva clinic before deciding on a biopsy (hell, I wish I had a vulva clinic near me!!), but a biopsy is vital for a proper diagnosis. I have read so many stories of misdiagnosis bc people are being diagnosed by sight (this goes for diagnosing LS and not diagnosing other conditions by sight). A biopsy is important because there are soooooo many skin conditions and they can certainly mimic each other in many ways. \n\nYOU did NOT cause this, where the TP is located did NOT cause this, allow yourself some leniency and forgiveness, this is not your fault. \n\nLS for most is a livable condition, as long as you educate yourself in how to treat it, what to do to avoid flares, how to accommodate yourself in your intimate life. It can be scary, but it will not be the end of her world. The more educated you can make yourself and her if it is LS, the better. Arm yourselves with information, not stories. When researching myself, I came across some horrifying stuff. But you know, those personal stories you find online- people do not post things when life is going normally, only when their condition is out of control. \n\nAlso, find a medical specialist you trust for this, bc the internet is a scary place. Anyone can go on the internet, put a few words into Google and convince themselves they have a terminal disease. Learn to filter what you are finding and only read from widely trusted medical/scientific sources. \n\nYou have got this! And so does she! It is manageable and you will both get through it fine. Do not sweat the small stuff Mom. This is entirely treatable and manageable. Remission is possible yet a life long use of clobetasol maybe needed when flare ups happen. Unfortunately no cure... you have got this! I do not think you need to worry or feel guilty about the toilet paper storage. I really doubt that caused it. I wonder if anyone on her other parent's side has a history of it? It is suspected to be hereditary so it can be passed through either parent. For instance it could be relevant to ask paternal grandmother, paternal aunts etc. Even if she does not have a family history, LS is something that just happens. There are some suspected triggers, like past genital surgery, but I am sure you would have mentioned that. This is probably just bad luck and not something you could have prevented. \n\nLike you, I have read that biopsy is not recommended in young children because it can be traumatic. Instead, they refer to an expert who has a better chance of diagnosing by sight+history, and it sounds like you finally got a referral to a vulvar clinic so hopefully that is that. I wonder, how does your daughter feel about getting a biopsy? Nine sounds old enough to understand what is happening, and I imagine it would be less upsetting for a child who understands what is going to happen, knows why, and knows they have a say in the matter. Whereas for a toddler it could be really confusing and they could misinterpret it as a punishment.  \n\nI do think it is possible for it to be something else, or a combination of things. For example, a person can have lichen sclerosus and lichen planus at the same time. My grandma was believed to have LS for a few years and recently they decided it is actually plasma cell vulvitis, so these things can be difficult to diagnose. The redness and scaliness also sound kind of like eczema or a psoriasis. I am no doctor and it is impossible to say without seeing her, but it might be difficult even for an expert and in that case a biopsy could be beneficial. There is not a right or wrong answer. I understand why you refused the biopsy from a doctor who had not taken much time to try to diagnose it on sight. I was in the same situation two months ago where the dermatologist barely glanced at my vulva and then insisted on a biopsy. I think my vulva looks like 100% classic LS. If she had disagreed after taking a thorough look then I might have agreed to the biopsy, but I really do not want an unnecessary biopsy. I think it is right for you to protect your child from a potentially unnecessary biopsy. But if at some point an expert thinks it really is necessary, it is worth considering, like you said. And again I think your child's wishes are an important factor. \n\nYou mentioned (now the itching is better?) your daughter is totally unbothered. It sounds like she is taking this in stride, which is great. Children do take cues from adults, especially about when they should be worried. I have anxiety too and I know it can be impossible not to worry, but I would also try to avoid encouraging your daughter to worry. Is she stressed about needing all these oils applied and being examined by you? Are you getting support in dealing with this and in treating your anxiety? Thank you so much for commenting sproutgirl! \n\n1) Thank you very much. This means a lot and I am sorry to hear you were misdiagnosed for a decade! Hope everything is well now!\n\n2) Yes I am definitely what you could call overprotective and I am completely aware that I am speaking from an anxious mama\u2019s point of view\ud83d\ude14I am not at all opposed to her getting a biopsy, I had just imagined a thorough exam beforehand. This doctor started off by saying that she never sees little girls with LS only boys in her practice, and did not seem comfortable nor experienced with girls\u2019 anatomy and that made me feel very unsafe with the whole thing. \n\nBut I am really really glad to hear that biopsies are not a huge deal and that they are routine! That absolutely gives me some relief! It is just that I had read almost everywhere that biopsies were not typically used when diagnosing children but I can see that it is necessary when there is uncertainty about the diagnosis. \n\nCan I ask whether you have had one? Did it hurt afterwards and did it need suture? How long was the healing process? If you do not mind me asking of course! \n\n3) Okay so 6 months is not out of the ordinary thank you! \n\n4) Thank you \ud83e\udd7a Thank you so much for commenting bangzoomdone!\n\nI am glad to hear that you finally have a diagnosis!   Certainty is absolutely everything. \n\nMy Google search led me to LS, but reading all your heartbreaking stories of suffering through years of getting misdiagnosed has absolutely played a huge part in me not settling with the whole \u2018it is yeast\u2019 thing that is always suggested when something is a bit off down there for us girls/women. I still would have brought up LS because I am convinced it is not yeast, but your stories really fueled my courage to get a proper diagnosis now and not later, and I hope my little girl\u2019s story can help other parents out there. \n\nThank you for sharing your insight regarding a biopsy and I am glad that you think it is okay of me to wait until she can get an appointment at the vulva clinic! That is also my gut feeling since I am really attentive to her condition and dedicated to keeping everything moisturized, and she does not have any complaints about itchiness or pain whatsoever (only seldom bouts of burning when peeing). \n\nI just need to have someone who actually knows how LS looks like in little girls to examine her and hopefully let me in on their thoughts. \n\nI suffer from anxiety so I just know that if I do not feel informed then there is way too much mental room for me to overthink and catastrophize things \ud83d\ude14\n\nThank you so much\ud83e\udd7a It means so so so much you have no idea. The guilt has been so heavy\ud83d\ude14\n\nAnd thank you for sharing your experiences living with LS and reassuring me that it is indeed manageable. I just want her to have a normal life\ud83d\ude14 I admit I have been intensely going down the Google road reading everything and looking at every picture, all in an attempt to identify what my little one has and it has been overwhelming and scary. So you are absolutely right, it is counterproductive and probably not very good for my mental health. \n\nI am moving forward now knowing I have such a wise and helpful community in here. Thank you again for taking the time to respond! Thank you so much MelanieMFTAsh !!! \nYour words give me so much hope I am 20 kg. lighter today\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc You are welcome! This is a helpful community, so always ask if you are concerned, need clarification, reassurance, or even just to vent \u263a\ufe0f Thank you so much for replying myristicae!\n\nFirst of all thank you so so much for giving me your input on the tp storage\ud83d\ude14 The whole situation has just been so confusing and scary and during my intense googling I was reading about the complexity of it all and it said something about environmental factors being a possible theory and I guess my mind just jumped straight to this somehow being my fault.\n\nYesterday as I was reading all of your replies I felt so relieved and got teary-eyed from the kindness in every response. It gave me the extra strength to tickle my little girl and swing her around and give her so many extra cuddles that she quickly fell asleep, even after the appointment at the doctor earlier that day, that normally would leave her a bit uneasy. So your words made a real life impact on our little life and I am determined now to take this in stride!! \n\nAs far as I know there are not anyone who has LS on either side, but my side does have a few autoimmune diseases. My sister has Hashimotos and my maternal grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis.\nBUT for years I have suspected my daughters and their father, paternal grandmother, paternal aunt etc. of having Ehlers-Danlos, which is interesting because of the way the disease impacts the skin. It could all be unrelated but I am definitely going to mention it when we see the specialist. \n\nYes, I am definitely hoping that the specialist will be able to diagnose her by sight and if a biopsy is inevitable well then I am pretty sure that she will be absolutely terrified, even with me reassuring her constantly that everything will be fine\ud83d\ude13 So I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. It is either a biopsy in general anesthesia or treating her with steroids without a 100% certain diagnosis. I hope the next place can provide me with some more knowledge and guide me to what they think is best. At least I am glad to read from the comments that a biopsy is pretty routine so that is absolutely something to calm me down a bit. But yeah it is hard. \n\nOh no that same thing happened to you? That is just terrible! I feel that a doctor should take the time to explain what they are observing, why they are considering this or that diagnosis and what they believe will be the best way to move forward etc. and they should also take their time to listen to the patient and answer any questions that they have the best way they can. And especially when the patient has to decide whether or not to have a biopsy done, because that can be a pretty scary thing for some people! \n\nCan I ask if you are being treated now for LS? Is the cream helping? And was the doctor okay with you being treated with steroids without a biopsy? If you do not mind me asking of course!\n\nMy daughter has no itching whatsoever but she unfortunately suffers from anxiety too :( Just like me when I was a little girl.. I have always tried so hard to shield her from my anxiety but she is born with a hypersensitive personality like me. Her big sister on the other hand has nothing.. So yeah this has been extra hard on my little one especially with COVID shutting down schools etc, everything has just been way too turbulent for her. \n\nBut she is definitely gotten a bit more used to it all by now, and having the oil+cream applied twice a day is getting a bit more routine now\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc \n\nAnd that is very kind of you to ask me that, unfortunately no I am not going to therapy at the moment. I am a single mother of two who is had anxiety and OCD for several years and I just finished my last session when this came along and it has most definitely taken a toll on my mental health, so thank you for reminding me to look after myself as well! \n\nI am sorry to hear that you are suffering from anxiety too! Has your diagnosis had an impact on your mental health or is it manageable? \n\nThank you so much again for replying. What an amazing group of people in here\u2764\ufe0f THANK YOU! \u2764\ufe0f My aunt is thought to have Hashimoto's, which as you probably know is a thyroid condition, which are known to co-occur with LS. Also my dad has diabetes and psoriatic arthritis, two autoimmune diseases, and my maternal uncle has type 1 diabetes. So plenty of immune stuff on both sides. (And anxiety and depression are definitely in the family history too. I am grateful that treatment is so much more accessible to me than it was to my parents' and grandparents' generation at my age.)\n\nThe derm I saw (she was actually a physician's assistant) agreed to a \"wait and see\" approach with using the clobetasol, since I guess she realized she was wasting her time trying to sell me on the biopsy. I do not have a lot of symptoms, mostly signs, so it is hard to tell if the ointment is helping. I have a follow-up tomorrow (with a different doctor) so hopefully she has some better input. \n\nI do have some feelings about LS (which I am glad my therapist has been kindly listening to). Primarily I am frustrated that this was not found earlier, because I think I have had LS for quite a long time, and I have some irreversible changes that I think could have been prevented. But it is not super bad. I have seen lots of pictures in journal papers where it has progressed wayyy more than mine. And I am grateful not to have awful symptoms like many people do. But I do still get sad or angry about it sometimes. But yes, it is definitely manageable. I think LS is, for most people, a very manageable disease once they get diagnosed and find the right treatment. OMG thank you so much for remembering my daughter in all of this! You are seriously an amazing person\u2764\ufe0f\n\nI am so glad to hear that you finally got an appointment with a competent dermatologist who actually KNEW about LS. I can totally understand why you went through with the biopsy for the rash since she had managed to establish the trust needed because of her professionalism. Exactly how it should be! \n\nAnd thank you for the tip with the numbing cream but they are actually going to put her in general anesthesia if they are unable to diagnose her on sight, and that is so scary :( But on the other hand I am listening to all you amazing people in here who say that the procedure is standard and that there are ways to manage the pain afterwards. I am trying to tell myself that getting an answer is the most important thing I can do for her health. \n\nAnd I will definitely have snacks and nonstop cuddles ready for her as soon as everything is over! So thank you for suggesting that, I truly appreciate it. \n\nI am also glad to hear that you are doing well after the biopsy and I hope that the results are going to show that the rash is nothing, and if it is something then something completely curable. Rose hip oil is good for scars so I can definitely recommend that! \n\nI will be sure to update in here as soon as we get an answer:)", "Get a prescription for a dermapal I researched and learned about phototherapy. I discussed it with my dermatologist and was told I could try it but they had a huge stand up phototherapy bed (similar to a tanning bed but vertical). I had to put sun block all over the place plus drive out a ways to do it. I pointed out how rediculous it is and they suggested a hand held but insurance would not pay. It cost me 500 usd to get it outside of insurance. I haggled it down from 1000. \n\nAnyways, it works when steroids did not. It doesnt increase or decrease risk of cancer. It is so small it isnt hard to block it from lighting up non affected areas. I recently moved to Arkansas and my new dermatologist said they did not utilize uv light for L.S. so keep that in mind, not every clinic will work with you.  No it is not. It is a narrow band spectrum of ultraviolet light. It can burn you if you do it for too long. It also helps psoriasis: \n\n A dermatologist will give you a prescribed dose and length of time. The bulb you get with it is prescribed to you with a certain strength so you cannot take someone else's bulb and put it into your unit. It was specially made for you. Do not try and buy one online.\n\n( ", "Safe skin cream to put on glans (circumcised), advise? I had circumcision 10 years ago in my twenties, due to lichen sclerosis. Unfortunantly I still have some sensitive/sore skin areas both below the line (on the skin of the shaft) and on glans. Especially the skin where my frenulum was, below the tip of my penis, the skin is sensitive, dry and easily get tiny red soars. I think maybe it has something to do with my urine coming alot into contact with (dripping from there after urinating) and drying this skin out.\n\nI also believe a year of unsuccessful use of Clobetasol prescribed by my skin doctor, before I finally got circumcised, might had something to do with this, idk.\n\nI have asked my GP, and 3 different skin doctors about advice, but they are bit dismissive and do not have any other input than \"use a standard skin cream\". I have tried a couple + one type of baby oil, but without much success. Also, I am reluctant to try \"anything\" on glans, as it is not normal skin + I am scared to trigger any skin reactions or risk infecting the sores.\n\nDo anyone have any good advice for me to improve the skin on glans and/or shaft, that is safe and meant to be used on these areas?", "Remission stories Heya!\n\nI have recently been diagnosed with LS \u2014 I am currently on my second week of using clobetasol. I have been told to use it 1x a day for 3 months, followed by 2-3x a week for maintenance.\n\nI am curious to hear what others have experienced after their initial treatment? I know everyone is treatment is different. \n\nI often feel bouts of soreness, as well as painful urination only after intercourse. I also feel extreme burning after intercourse. I am curious to know if some of you have felt relief after your initial treatment. I feel like there is acid on my vulva, even though throughout the day I am not experiencing much pain.\n\nI know everyone is different and experiences it all so differently. \n\nTIA! I have had those feelings (burning, itching, soreness, irritation) before. I feel like the intensity does go down as you go into remission. Of course when you are having a flare up it will act up again. \n\nI think the key is finding what works for you. I use emu oil when it feels irritated. \n\nWhen it comes to sex have a self care routine in place to help deal with the side effects. I use a ton of coconut oil during sex and I wash off with a handheld shower head afterwards too. Sperm is really irritating to me so he pulls out. I do still get burning when urinating after sex and some bleeding. I find that doing that self care helps the burning and itching I feel after sex. Ive heard others say and ice pack works really well after. I can see that. \n\nMine has usually felt extremely itchy and dry when it is acting up. I find the emu oil helps keep the irritation away..that and loose clothing..no underwear at home when possible. \n\nI use clobetasol 1x a week as maintenance. I was diagnosed about 2-3 years ago.\n\nPatience and trial and error...you will find stuff that works! It does get better I have had a very similar experience! Cannot rave enough about coconut oil during sex, loose clothing, and finding the routine that works for you. I was diagnosed 7 years ago and am down to using steroid ointment once every couple of weeks. Cotton underwear, staying moisturized, and occasional Clobetasol \ud83d\udc4d Twelve years in and I have problems only a few times a year. It sneaks up on me - one day I will tear and be surprised because I did not notice it was starting up again. Then it hurts like hell for a week or two. Clobetasol fixes it up again. \n\nMost of the time I do not have pain or itching or any problem really. Dry sex is a big NO, so if the lubrication slows down it is time to stop and make some more. Or it is time to switch to oral, which is smarter if there is already a little pain. Little pain mid-sex means it is going to hurt a lot more later, best to stop penetration.  Does not happen often. \n\nI was dramatically improved after 2 weeks - all that horrible itching just ended. Everything for happy and pink again in the few weeks after that. Most of the time I do not use it at all - just a few times a year for maybe a week at a time if there is a little flare. Other than that, it is not a big impact on my life  \n\nI call them little flares, but sometimes they really suck. Those few days before a crack or rip heals are intensely painful. I hate them and I always wish I would paid more attention to it going south. But after they are over, it is back to status quo. Thanks for sharing! I am curious to know if you have found any way to decrease the burning while urinating after sex? I am sure waiting to pee is not the best idea, but it is just so darn painful. I find myself screaming in the washroom. Hey, I guess my story would be considered a success! My onset was around 18 and went undiagnosed for probably 3 years, so there was a fair amount of damage which needed to heal. My main symptom was itching and tears, which i fully scratched myself raw and bleeding for years :(    I FINALLY was referred to a specialist OBGYN who immediately diagnosed my LS and gave me the meds you mentioned, and referral to pelvic floor physio to help repair scarring and years of nerve damage diagnosed as vulvodynia.  \n\nIt took time to heal (that was over 15 years ago) but my skin is now healthy and I only use creams 1 or 2 times a week to keep things stable and in remission. It definitely flares on my period (or leading up to) because of my hormones, so I always make sure to use the ointment a few times around then. \n\nSex, like many others have said, takes lots of lube - and honestly took a number of years to go back to a 'normal' and healthy sex life after all the damage that was done initially (and on my psyche).   I was originally told I would likely never be able to have vaginal birth because my skin was so thinned and scarred, but at 30 I gave birth to my daughter (5lb) naturally and with no tearing. So that was a huge WIN! \n\nOne thing I think is a little interesting - my onset was during a lot of stress in my life, and was just the start of a number of autoimmune diseases which I have (and have a strong family history of). So not to say that everyone has AI problems, but for me, LS (and my vitiligo) is an indicator of the stress and inflammation in my body. I have used low FODMAP / gluten free diets for years to help manage this. Thanks for sharing! I also think mine was brought on years ago due to stress.\n\nAbout 6 years ago I had a GP tell me that I might have cancer down there, and I was referred to a gynaecologist who said everything looked normal. I was then sent to a dermatologist that took a biopsy, and nothing came of that. After countless visits to urologists this past year (referred to by my GP) I finally pushed to see a Gynaecologist instead, since I could not get any answers from urologists. I was then diagnosed with LS, so I presume this all started about 6 years ago. I am beating myself up knowing that the further damages could have been avoided. But at the time, no one gave me a name for me, and I guess all the docs I saw did not know much about it. I just hope my urethral pain during urination after sex can go away! \n\nGlad to hear you were able to have a child without tearing! I have not had any tearing luckily. My small lips have disappeared and I mostly struggle with vulvar burning and that dreaded urethral burning while trying to pee after sex. I also feel like my flares come right before my period. I have not found a way to get rid of the burning when peeing. I always go right after to avoid bladder infections. You could try icing it first..in an attempt to numb the area, that might help. Hopefully someone else who has had some success will mention what works for them.\n\nI have not noticed that with the clobestol. You could totally ask your doctor too. I have found that most doctors and nurses are extremely sympathetic to our situation and want to help the best they can. Hey! I am curious to know if you experience urethral burning from day to day? I am curious to know how LS effects the urethra. I have also been using the Clob for a month every day now and I still experience flares every single day. I spoke to the gyno twice and she just does not know what to do to help me. I am still waiting on biopsy results, so there is not much I can do until then. I hope I can be referred to a better gyno. And urologists just tell me I probably have bladder pain syndrome... yet I have no symptoms of that. Just a very irritated \u2014 burning/itching urethra and a urethral caruncle that no one wants to treat! I am just curious to know if LS bothers your urethra outside from \u2018after sex\u2019. Thanks a bunch and I hope you are feeling good today! So I do have some burning sometimes..almost feels like a bladder infection...although it is not. If I urinate and feel the burning...(and I am not dehydrated) I normally attribute that to the LS. I am actually having a flare up and i have had burning. \n\nMy go to is the clob, keeping it moisturized, clean, staying hydrated and being patient..hopefully your new Gyno will be able to help Thank you! Do you put clob on your urethra?\nIm in pain every single day on and off, constantly feels like a UTI that keeps coming and going. \ud83d\ude2b I put a small amount of clob all over the exterior vulva skin from the clit hood down to the perineum when I feel irritated. If I have no irritation and just white spots  I put it just on the white spots.\n\nI am sorry you are feeling so terrible. It sounds like you are seeing the right people hopefully someone will be able to get you some answers! Thanks for the info! I have had to stop in some areas as I broke into a rash \ud83d\ude05 hopefully the rash from the clob does not damage my skin \u2014 hopefully I can find the right person to stick with! I do not have any white areas, but I have seen lots of people mention that they do not either. I am so sorry to hear that! Sending good vibes for answers, healing and a great doctor! Hey! I am curious to know if you ever have abdominal pain? Since you mention burning urethral irritation. I am still waiting for my biopsy results, but I just feel like there is so much going on that it might be something else. I do not have pain when my bladder fills, just the occasional itchy urethra and frequency. And my abdomen is bloated/aching.", "Tacrolimus. Hello! I am curious about Tacrolimus.\n\n\nIf anyone here uses it I want to read your opinions on this drug, how effective it is, how often you use it, and any side effects you have when using it.\n\n\nThanks I tried this initially and did not have as much luck with it as I would have liked (improvement with the stinging pain after two months use... did not appear to make much improvement with the redness or sex).\n\nIt appears it is not approved for Lichen but is used off-label. Some people say they have good luck with it, others not so much. It is used for a variety of sensitive-area inflammatory skin conditions so it *should* help.\n\nIt is definitely worth trying to see if you can use it rather than steroids because the side-effect profile is much lower and it will not thin the skin like steroids can.\n\nMy experience is that it burns like an SoB but some people have that problem with steroids. Personally for me, water burns, so not sure how much of the is simply that everything burns when there is broken skin. I found it to be very irritating though.\n\nIt is also pretty expensive if the insurance does not cover it (try GoodRX to get it cheaper). Pretty sure it burns for almost everyone at first but after a week or so gets better. I think if you refrigerate 30 min prior to application it can help with that side effect Ugh I did not have that much luck. Refrigeration helps for sure because it is cold (I usually just keep it in the fridge honestly), but it burned for the entire time I used it (two months straight). I know some people have had similar experiences but obviously that is not everyone... and maybe my skin just finds it to be too irritating? I started using it for LS because I had a rash that I thought might be a reaction to the clob (although in hindsight it probably was not.) I had also used it before for perianal psoriasis, for which it was SUPER effective. Psoriasis and LS are both off-label uses for this drug, which I think is part of why it is not a first-line treatment, even though it has the benefit of being steroid-free and therefore not causing skin thinning. But as I understand, clob is still the more powerful treatment that works for a higher percent of people. But some people who fail clob do have success with tac. \n\nFor me, tac does burn for the first few applications, but it is like a mild minty burn that is not a big deal for me, and I only notice it for the first couple of minutes after applying. I think for some people it is much more uncomfortable; it just depends on how your body reacts to it. I cannot really tell if it helped with the LS, because my symptoms are kind of transient and I mostly suffer from the long-term changes like fusion. Hi!!\n\nIn March I was diagnosed with Pelvic Floor Dysfunction and LS. In April my derm prescribed me tacrolimus to put on twice a day. I have more pronounced LS on my vulva. When I would apply the tacro, it would cause me horrible stinging and burning. I would apply it right before bed so I can fall asleep through the pain. Then when I would wake up I would apply more. With the tacrolimus, I did not have a life. I was constantly stinging and would have an ice pack on 24/7. I then stopped putting it on twice a day and started putting it once a day. The stinging and burning continued. I then went to a different pelvic PT for a second opinion and she told me to stop the tacrolimus for now to give my body a break from the stinging. The stinging was causing my pelvic floor to tighten even more. She recommended to me clobetasol. Has anyone gone from tacro to clob and seen results? I am at a standstill when it comes to the LS symptoms:/.", "Angry and in awful pain, rant and pls advise *UK* \nFairly sure I have LS, posted on here before. Worst symptoms is skin constantly peeling away (like wet tissue paper) with the slightest touch (not dry). Even sitting down to pee is agony because the skin is splitting and very raw and burning intensely. I have been seeing Drs on and off since August and had steroid ointments with a little improvement. I have been using Diprobase ointment between steroid treatments as it is left alone it immediately gets 10x worse.\n I was supposed to be reffered to a gyno in October but every time I call they say 'we are still seeing patients from last February we have no space'. \nSometimes the pain is so awful I just have to lay in bed and take painkillers - there is no healthy skin left. I have no idea what to do. Apparently you cannot use steroid creams for long because it thins the skin.\nWhat treatments are available and or have worked for you? I am desperate for it to improve, I am so tired of being in so much pain all the time. Also have not been able to sleep with my partner for almost a year because it is gotten so bad so it is putting a bit of strain on the relationship at times. \nI am totally at a loss \ud83d\ude1f Smothering Vaseline over it when you pee can be really helpful with prevening that awful burning. I was told to use the steroids twice a day for a few weeks till symptoms improved and then taper down slowly until I was just using it once in a while for maintenance. Ice packs help a little. I wish I could offer more advise. Hang in there. I am sorry you are in so much pain; that sounds miserable. Maybe try getting a dermatology appointment and see if the wait is shorter? Especially if you have a skin condition that may or may not be LS, a dermatologist might have a better shot at diagnosing it. Also maybe your GP could put in a word for you to be expedited since this is urgent. I do not know if that is a thing but I feel like it could be. \n\nI am not aware of LS commonly causing such severe skin peeling. I am not saying you do not have LS, but I would still consider another cause. Maybe severe contact dermatitis or a rare disease like epidermolysis bullosa acquisita or Zoon's vulvitis. Do you have any blisters or ulcers? Did this start happening after taking a new medicine or getting an infection?\n\nWith LS, it is considered worthwhile to use steroids for some time, like twice a day for several months, and then taper down to the minimum effective dose/frequency. It can cause skin thinning, yes, but I guess it is minor compared to the effects of LS. If steroids do not work well enough, other options are tacrolimus/pimecrolimus, and systemic treatments like retinoids, cyclosporin, or methotrexate. If the steroids seem to be helping, as you said, I would hit it hard twice a day with the ultra-potent steroids (clobetasol proponiate) and not taper until things have vastly improved. But I am not a doctor lol.\n\nDiprobase is just a moisturizer right? I think it is recommended to moisturize the vulva twice a day for LS so that sounds like a good idea. \n\nI heard that after giving birth they give people a little squirt bottle they can use when urinating to dilute the urine as it comes out, and that that can be helpful for skin conditions, too. It might help the burning. Peeing into a bath is the same idea.\n\nI assume you are avoiding underwear and tight clothes and wearing cotton or silk already. Tepid baths help soothe some skin conditions as well, and ice packs, especially at night. I wonder if they could not prescribe you a topical painkiller as well.\n\nAs for sex, the only advice I have is to go for all the things you can do that do not involve your vulva. Mere naked cuddles can be very nice, and they release endorphins that are great natural painkillers. \n\nI hope you get some answers and some relief! Xylocaine (lidocaine 5% ointment OTC) has been an absolute god send for managing my LS flare ups. I have been managing it with this topical anesthetic and clobetasol for 6 years now. It hurts like hell for about 5-10 seconds when you first apply but then it completely numbs the area and makes urination manageable again. \n\nCurrently, I have had an extremely bad flare up and the lidocaine is only temporarily helping (~1-3 hours). Does anyone know of any other topical anesthetics either OTC or prescription that has helped? My LS presents in white, flaky dots. It can often peel off after I shower and if I am too rough with a towel or something. But mine is on my breast, I cannot imagine urine on it or something. OP, I hope you can get help soon \u2764\ufe0f I am so sorry you are dealing with something this bad. I do not have a whole lot of advice other than if you have tried to take colder showers, since I heard that warm water irritates it a lot more Thankyou, I really appreciate the advice, I will try to get hold of some. I hope you are feeling better soon I did not get on with most the emollients . I found many too thick to actually lay a barrier layer without tearing at very fragile skin\nI use something called dermol. It can be bought OTC Agree about Vaseline! I also use Tacrolimus, which I got from a dermatologist, and treats the LS while preventing the side effects that the clobetasol causes. Do you think you would have any luck getting in with a dermatologist? (I am US based, so different care system) Also, I am so sorry your symptoms are so bad right now. It is so so terrible and I hope it will improve soon \u2764\ufe0f", "Having a difficult night I honestly cannot believe I found this group. I just searched it on the off chanced it existed because I am having a hard time tonight. I was diagnosed about 7 years ago after MANY years of suffering and not having answers. I am on dapsone and desinide ointment (I am sorry if I spelled either wrong) and with the 2 my symptoms are contra or the most part but I still get flare ups and still have pain with sex. I am currently having a flare up and am in pain. I have a wonderful marriage except for issues with our sex life because of me always being in pain. My husband is always sexually frustrated. He got pissed tonight because he sometimes feels like I am not trying but I do try. I try to have sex once a week even though it causes me pain. He wanted a handjob tonight because I could not have sex but I did not want to give him one because I was in pain but he argued that since it is not sex it should not matter. He went to bed upset and I am still up. I feel stuck. I am upset and frustrated. I am so sick of dealing with this for so long. I just want to cry. I relate to this so much. I am so sorry you are going through this. It is so frustrating to be almost afraid of sex, and have a mental number of how many times you \u201chave to\u201d do it... not to mention not getting to enjoy it yourself at all. You and your husband are both in a frustrating spot. \n\nSome things I have learned over 20+ years of enjoying this disease: I have found that a hot shower or bath (especially with Epsom salts) right after sex makes me feel a lot better. Also TMI but having them pull out seems to help... that stuff stings! Lube definitely helps as long as it is something super natural, like coconut oil. Any amount of friction is going to feel awful. Also, My dermatologist prescribed me an antiseptic ointment called pramasone that helps a little bit. It does not take away the pain but it is still soothing. I hope you feel a little bit better tonight! You are not alone. Your husband is not being understanding and is being manipulative. I had a boyfriend of 4 years who behaved this way. The pressure and stress caused by his frustration with me made sex even more upsetting and caused flare ups! Please consider getting couples counseling or sex counseling. How in the world can you \u201ctry\u201d??! WTH does that mean, that you should be trying not to have a disease? Does that mean you should try when you know it is flared and just see how much you can take before the pain is wildly unbearable? Try to let him hurt you for just a little while and see if that is ok?  That is MESSED UP. \n\nI am so sorry you are going through this :-(\n\nI second the probable need for counseling around this issue. There are sex therapists out there and couples counseling. You both have needs here. His needs for sexual connection are valid. Your needs to NOT BE HURT are also valid.  You may need a flexible marriage or you may need to work out ways to connect that are not PIV. \n\nMy go-to-line is for everybody to love them some oral. Subject to the same general concepts of time and place, of course. If you have communicated that your pain is at an eight and he is making a demand, rude.  Otherwise, swap out every damn day if that is what it takes to keep people happy. Hands are great too, if that is what you like. (I find it less intimate, but whatever works is whatever works.). And unless you have got tearing up around the clitoris, no reason you cannot also get some fun. Maybe we will discover that the extra blood flow from excitement / orgasm is a treatment for LS or something. I am working under that assumption. \n\nBut do address it. You both have needs. He needs to be unselfish it honest. You need to be kind to your body and empathetic about his. Hopefully you can find good ways of connecting regularly that do not involve pain or frustration. Schedule a damn blowjob if you have to (and schedule your turn too). And if it turns out you want absolutely nothing to do with any kind of sex anymore, you will have to be up front about that: it is not fair to him to say \u201cI will not have you but I do not want you with anyone else either\u201d.   This happens all the time and the outcome is unhappy people. \n\nDo not have sex that hurts. It is a terrible betrayal of your body and your self. \n\nBut I do hope that the background pain recedes enough that you can enjoy the rest of your life and then connect in non-painful ways. I still think swapping oral is the way to go, but I am just an internet nut. He is up for non-PIV if he is asking for handies, so if you would rather do that than divorce or find out he is got somebody else in his life, frickin be awesome at handies. And he can learn to give the best foot rubs or whatever you need. That is just fair. If you can spend half an hour polishing knobs, he can spend half an hour kneading feet.  That is still pretty damn intimate.  And a woman with happy feet is going to feel much more like sex when her skin is done tearing itself up for a while. \n\nBut if he thinks you owe him sex favors regardless of how you feel, and he is unwilling to do anything to connect with your body, fuck him. In the non-literal sense. If your marriage is otherwise wonderful, though, I hope he will ecstatically meet you somewhere you can both have what is \u201cgood enough\u201d to keep on.  It is not going to be perfect, you are not both twenty with untested bodies free of difficulties. But shooting for good enough is totally fine. Good enough is a win. \n\nSo sorry you are dealing with all of this bullshit. I hope today is a better day. This. Yes. This is not healthy. Things need to change! You stole my post basically so I agree with all of this. hey i am new here too... but i just wanted to say i really related to your story and that you are so strong, in coping with this. i dont know but i am half dead right here, and yet you are here, trying to fix your sex life despite your pain and i think that is really brave.\n\ni dont really know what to say about your husband because i feel like he should be more understanding. but it must be hard for you too cause there might be a sense of inadequacy that you cannot satisfy him. \n\ni hope you have a good cry and recover from this flare up soon too.", "any success stories or hope? I just got back from the dermatologist who diagnosed me with LS. I have struggled with irritation for years and years and briefly wondered about it 4 years ago but it was quickly brushed off by my OBGYN at the time. Last summer I went to the OBGYN for irritation yet again, and they said it was likely to be dermatitis rather than an infection, which felt like life changing info. They gave me a steroid ointment and I felt mostly better, but still had a ton of redness and always felt like I was on the verge of irritation so they finally referred me to the derm.\n\nSo I just applied my first dose of clob and have been researching LS for the last hour or so. I should feel relieved to finally know what is going on, but I feel hopeless, disgusting and ashamed now. Every health website describes it as a lifelong condition with possible permanent scarring/damage (and I am so mad that the damage could have been done in the 4 years it is been since I initially wondered about LS). It seems like I will have to use the clob forever and that it can have side effects that cause other sources of irritation like infection. I really feel like I will have to deal with this forever and never have a normal sex life and like my whole life will have to revolve around doing everything I can to avoid flare ups. I am thinking back to everyone I have had sex with over the past few years, especially recently, and wondering if it was noticeable to them and thinking I must have completely disgusted them.\n\nBasically it just seems like there is not a ton of hope and it is really getting me down. Does anyone have any success stories or things that have helped them? Also has anyone found that they do have an autoimmune disease that has caused it and figured out anything about that? Oh nooooo I hate reading posts like these because I see my past self in them so much!! OK ok first off no your life is not going to revolve around your vulva I promise. I have LS, have a very fun sex life, and clob has essentially meant that the irritation never gets past mild discomfort when I first notice the signs of a flare coming. Once I get those warning signs, on goes the cream and that is the end of that. Usually after a couple of days it feels grand again. \n\nI used to not be able to have sex without it being excruciatingly painful, which prompted me to get a proper diagnosis. Now for the vast majority of times I can have sex with no issues at all. Sometimes if I am having a flare, I might get a little tear and have to just do other activities while it heals for a few days, but that is not something that should be the end of the world. I know it feels like that right now! But it will be OK now you have the right diagnosis. Just lubey lube lube (make sure you get one that does not irritate you...maybe try before use because I have had that issue before! It is extra delicate so just make sure not to use super fragranced ones with any harsh ingredients.)\n\nNo partner I have ever been with was disgusted or thought anything odd about the appearance of my undercarriage. I really do not think they care that much. For me it is just a bit lighter sometimes, and I lost a bit of my labia due to fusing before we caught what it was. Tbh it just kind of looks like a naturally neat one. It does not bother me, and I have never had any complaints. Think about how different everyone is genitals are, people will not notice unless you point it out.  I tell sexual partners about it, and just explain I have an auto immune condition that can sometimes make the skin down there a bit delicate, and honestly anyone I have ever told has just been really understanding and chill about it.\n\nYou are catastrophising rn because you have gone on Google and reddit and all you see are people who have the WORST time with it. Yes it is something that will take monitoring, and you will adapt to that. But do remember the people who have an OK time with it are not posting on the Internet. We do exist :) As for the auto immune thing, yes as far as I am aware it is an auto immune condition. I noticed that when I took extra care in looking after my gut that flares became less frequent. That meant drinking Kefir, cutting out sugar, eating healthy. Not a bad idea to do that anyway. Others have said that helped them but I do not think there is a mad amount of research on it. Hey there! I am a woman who was diagnosed about 10 years ago, in my late teens, through a biopsy. My inner labia are almost completely gone and I have noticeable scaring around my clitoris. You should know that it gets better, and I have maintained a good sex life (yes I still orgasm and no partners have ever cared about the physical effects) with minimal flare ups since getting the disease under control. Here is what is worked for me: \n- Topical steroid treatment DOES work and it is the best treatment we have right now - keep with it daily until the itching and pain goes away. After that, use once a week or so. \n- Especially while dealing with a flare up, stay moisturized all the time and avoid underwear. Coconut oil and unscented lotion work great. Coconut oil has also been a great lube during sex (with LS - lubricant during sex is not optional). \n- Shaving (while not in a flare up and I recommend using an electric razor so cutting yourself is less likely) can help.\n- Only wear 100% cotton underwear. ( have been good for me. \n- Avoid fake sugar sweeteners - they freak out the immune system and can cause flare ups ... ie Acesulfame K (brand names: Sunett and Sweet One, Advantame, Aspartame (two brand names: Equal and Nutrasweet), Neotame (brand name: Newtame), Saccharin (two brand names: Sweet \u2018N Low and Sweet Twin), Sucralose (brand name: Splenda)\n- Taking high doses of vitamin D every day helps (recommended by a friend who has Lupus and LS). I take (\n- Having an alternative cream on hand to use in between the steroid like ( ) is great (it works but smells and stains underwear - use black undies). I can vouch for the Creme Complete! \n- Avoid damaging the area further - you know your body... careful with rough sex, wearing a harness for too long, too long on a bike.. etc. During a flare up, do everything in your power not to itch! For me, knocking myself out at night is the key (edible or sleeping aid).\n- Seeing an OBGYN and a dermatologist is a good idea. Both have had helpful recommendations for me over the years. I have been told to purchase estrogen cream as that can be helpful in addition to the steroid - still on my list of things to do with my new insurance.\n- Do not be afraid to ask for help. This is a deeply personal disease to be diagnosed with. Most days, after this many years, I do not even think about it - but having a mental health resource is always a good idea. Yay therapy! If you are employed full time, see what is included in your EAP / health plan before paying out of pocket.\n- Know you are not alone! I recently found this site  and have found it helpful so far. I am at a point where I sometimes forget I even have LS. I use triamcinalone not clob, but after the first intensive treatment protocol I did in 2019 I only use it once or twice a week. I did an elimination diet (autoimmune protocol diet) to see if any foods triggered a flare (or a flare of my undifferentiated connective tissue disease) and now just do not eat foods that caused issues. \n\nIn between steroid days I will moisturize with almond oil or emu oil. Baths with epsom salt made me feel better when I had a flare. I honestly cannot remember the last time I had a flare though, so it is possible to get to a point where you forget you have got anything going on down there! It may take awhile for you to figure out what works for you, but you will! I totally understand your worries about appearance. But I would bet you money that your partners over the past few years had no idea anything was different, unless you happened to be with an experienced dermatologist or gynecologist. My vulva is textbook diagnosable-on-sight LS, and I have had doctors tell me it is perfectly normal. My partner definitely had no idea and they are learning about it along with me. It is true that even completely healthy vulvas have tremendous variety in size, shape, and color. But because of that mantra, I had no idea until last year that white patches were not normal.  But even knowing that they are a sign of my disease, I do not think they are ugly. For instance, I think people with vitiligo are still beautiful. Recently a supermodel with vitiligo became famous (Winnie Harlow) so I guess I am not the only one who thinks someone that looks different is still beautiful. \n\nTo your question about autoimmune diseases, I have psoriasis and family history of several other autoimmune diseases. I do not think that the psoriasis caused it- I actually think I had LS first although it was diagnosed second- but I just have a shared predisposition to both. I just posted a very hopeful success story today! I beleive I have found a simle new plant-derived cure for lichen sclerosus(LS) and I just created a reddit account to share my results with other LS patients. Please take a look.\n\n-the anonymous ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology enthusiast Shoot I meant to reply much sooner but thank you all so much for sharing your experiences \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f I appreciate it a lot I only use it if I have a flare coming on or if I notice the skin getting a bit pale. So really depends. And cream version. Hiya, hope you do not mind me asking here, but I saw the link for underwear and it took me to Calvin Klein but no specific pants, is it their 100% cotton range? Any particular style? And have you found that white is better than darker colours? Thank you! Hey! Sorry about the link. I like the Logo Cotton Thongs in black because some of the creams I have used (like the Creme Complete) leave a stain. Plus I think they are really comfy, but I am sure any of their cotton underwear would work! Thank you!! Yes, Borax baths, 1/4 C in bath daily for 6 months and LS disappeared &amp; skin infused. Also healed my leaky gut through probiotics, vit D, L-glutamine, zinc, methyl-folate &amp; methyl-b12.  Leaky gut was root cause, Borax bath reversed symptoms. Almost 3 years symptom free.", "(M51) Over 30 Years Seeking Answers and Relief Warning, Subject matter is obviously Adult Oriented and NSFW\n\nHi everyone!\n\nI just wanted to share my story and maybe someone will at least learn something from my experiences or at least not feel like they are struggling alone.\n\nFrom the beginning..&lt;deep breath&gt;\n\nEverything started around the age of 21 for me.\n\nI was dating my now wife, my High School sweetheart and although not yet engaged we both new we wanted to get married.\n\nWe were each others first (and as it turned out only) sexual partners, we started dating as virgins and fumbled through it all together.\n\nI remember clearly the night it happened...we were out partying and eventually ended up in bed at my place drunkinly pulling each others clothes off, she was insistent that we get right to the main event...\"put it in!\" she ordered. I protested that it was too tight/not wet enough but again was told \"just put it in\". \n\nWell...as my training to be a good Husband was already well underway...I did as I was told, and \"Ouch! Fuuuck\"\n\nI pulled back to see a trickle of food...nothing major but a clear tear of the frenulum. And an end to the fun that night for sure.\n\nThe next morning I put Polysporin on the cut and assumed everything would be fine, but it was not really.  It took some time to heal but was compromised, Often even with KY it would still sting and sometimes re tear.\n\nI have often wondered if part of the problem was that I am a grower, not a shower lol.  I would heal in a flaccid state, but because if the extreme difference between erect and flaccid, when I became erect it was already tight.\n\nDue to the embarrassing nature I avoided going to the doctor and just continued using lots of lubrication and being careful.  This worked somewhat for a while, but soon another problem developed.  My uncircumcised foreskin became tight right at the opening.  Not exactly dry but very tight and clearly whiter, even slightly cracking.\n\nEach time we had sex slightly more damage, and then healing would make it tighter until it would not retract at all and I had no choice but to see the doctor.\n\nI was referred to a local urologist with a heavy Chinese accent, so if he ever mentioned an actual diagnosis I missed it. But I was assured a circumcision was the answer and agreed to the procedure. To be honest, I was always self conscious of being uncircumcised as pretty much everyone I had ever seen in the gym showers or in porn was circumcised. So I guess I was kind of looking forward to my new streamlined torpedo lol.\n\nThe procedure was done (I still get the odd Christmas card from some of the nurses lol, sorry if I do not make light of this I would have gone insane years ago!)\n\nAfter that life was good for many years, maybe even a decade for the most part, but slowly there were signs of complications.\n\nit started to sting a little once in a while again, the same spot, right at the top of the frenulum.\n\nNot wanting to believe I was having the same problem again I just tried to be careful, but more and more I noticed that the skin were my foreskin was removed was slowly attaching until it was attached right close to my Glans, more so underneath so that my frenulum was pretty much swallowed up.\n\nNow living in a different city, married and one child, I headed off to a new Urologist, he scheduled me for a hospital appointment and in-between his out patient vasectomy procedures fit me in.\n\nFirst the needly to numb the area, then as I clenched my fists and ground my teeth I lay there while he manually pulled the skin apart, separating the adhesion.  I could not really feel the pain, but more the tugging, and of course knowing what was happening had me near passing out!\n\nBut, for the short term it worked, it healed within a week or so and soon, we had our second child.\n\nAnd...it happened again, and again he pulled it apart.\n\nThe Third time he just shrugged and told me there was nothing he could do and sent my on my way suggesting my family doctor refer me to a dermatologist.  Still I had no diagnosis and it seemed nobody had ever heard about anything like this before.  The internet was in it is infancy, but I continued to search often on line, looking at one picture of a mangled penis to another, but nothing like my problem.\n\nTrying different things myself, and with the advise of the dermatologist I moisturized often and then used over the counter Hydrocortisone cream. This helped with the itching that was getting worse and worse but made no difference in the condition.\n\nOver time the dreaded \"White Band\" began to appear, starting where my frenulum is attached to the glans and all the way around, like a literal white rubber band around my penis. Not really visible when flaccid, but choking tightly when erect.\n\nAt first I could deal with it, it was not too painful and things still worked relatively normal, and they still do other than this ridiculous white band constricting my penis by 25 percent when erect. Sex was still doable.\n\nAbout a year ago at a doctors appointment, my Doctor asked what ever became of all that with the Urologist and Dermatologist, neither had sent her any updates.\n\nI told her how he pretty much told me tough luck.\n\nMy Doctor is a very caring and passionate practitioner...she wanted to find me some help...she recommended a different younger urologist and sent me a referral hoping he might be more up on this sort of thing.\n\nThat turned out to be a total waste of time with him also telling me there was nothing to be done, it was not a urology problem but a skin problem with no solution \"If Hydrocortisone helps keep using that\"\n\nSo I felt pretty depressed, like nauseously depressed, I considered that soon my sex life would be over completely and who knows...would this turn into cancer? would I have to resort to more drastic surgeries? Could a plastic surgeon reconstruct the area? I mean if they can reattach John Wayne Bobbit's severed member surely that can release this tight band somehow!\n\nthen about 2 months ago, with me applying cream almost every night to receive the itch that seemed to come on only as I slept...I woke up one morning to a VERY sensitive glans, I mean the slightest touch was like a needle.\n\nAn inspection in the bathroom revealed some purplish discolouration surrounding some white ash discolouration...out of the blue, in one night.\n\nI waited a couple days and no improvement...so back to the Doctor.\n\nShe asked the usual questions about sex and had I maybe been stepping out, I told her I had expected the questions and assured her neither of us had been with anyone else and had not had sex together for several weeks.\n\nShe tested for Herpes anyway to be sure, although she was pretty sure there was no risk of STDs. She also requested an update from the last urologist, I told her he had no interest and at my follow up with her a few days later she agreed and was ticked that he could not even suggest a next step.\n\nBut there was a bit of a breakthrough between the first and second visit, I was back on line and finally found a condition called Lichen Sclerosus, and holy shit...there were even a few pictures of that same white band!\n\nI mentioned this to the doctor and she said that the last Urologist put that in his report, that was what he thought it was, she had looked it up and also thought that! FINALLY, at least a name! now I can at least search it properly!\n\nShe sent out referrals to both Dermatologists and Plastic surgeons, as well as a \"Cosmetic Urologist\" who specializes in reconstruction and implants (Hmm...maybe while he is in there he can give me a little more to work with lol).\n\nNow we are up to today, the family Doctor had given me a prescription for Betamethasome for the \"Band\" while I waited for a Dermatologist appointment, and that worked very well, the itch is gone and the bumps of cologne on the underside disappeared, but no effect on the tightness.\n\nToday, the Dermatologist Had a look (I suddenly strikes me that I have shown my dick to way more guys than I care to)\n\nI quickly told him what we thought the diagnosis was and I was there for his opinion and hopefully he had something he could offer for any kind of relief. \n\nI was thrilled when he said he totally agreed with the diagnosis \"That is definitely what it is\".\n\nHe prescribed Protopic which I have applied for the first time tonight and have been researching more and more about its use and results.\n\nThis research also led me to Lichen Planus, which I believe was what happened on my Glans...I googled images and found several pictures that look exactly like what I had.  That has seemed to have healed but has left some discolouration. Compared to some of the images, mine was mild and thankfully subsided for now. I asked the Dermatologist today if the two issues, the white band and the flare up on the Glans was related and he said \"yes, it is the same, they are part of the same condition\"\n\nSo...If you made it this far I would be surprised, even if nobody reads this it felt good to write it all out...Oh I forgot, somewhere around 25 years old I did have a plastic surgeon do a procedure where he cut the frenulum and folded over to make a bit of slack, at that time the problem was pulling down like frenulum  breve.\n\nAnyway, I would love to hear any comments, questions and especially advice if you think I have been given any bad advice.\n\nApologies for offending anyone with my attempts at making jokes or NSFW terminology.\n\nThank you, especially to the founders and moderators of this Reddit!  I am a woman and have had this for a few years. I think it is astonishing how few doctors know about this condition. I am on my third gyn now, it was obvious to her while two others missed it. I have two pieces of advice because this is what helps me: you will probably need a strong cortisone treatment. Mine was 1 month every day, 1 month every second day, 3 month tapering off. That helped, and until now I have had no other flare up. This means: if you get prescribed cortisone take it like the doctor says, do not stop using it. While it may have side effects, right now it is more important to get rid of the pain and itchiness. Second piece of advice: I do not use moisturizing cream but a fat based cream, it has approximately the consistency of warm butter. This is good to give the skin a break: it creates a barrier between the skin and everything else. (Obviously, do not use condoms while having this cream on. Just shower it off before using one.) I do not know if you necessarily need it, but you can ask your doctor if and for when she would recommend something like that. My doctor told me I can use it as often as I want to but at least twice a day. Even if a little itchiness comes back, the cream takes care of it as nothing irritates the skin further. That said, I hope the doctors will give you your quality of life back. Good luck! Thank you for posting this.  I have a similar experience though not for nearly as long.  White ring and all.    \n\n\nDo you think it was the  Betamethasome  or the  Protopic  that helped the most? Have you sense tried any other treatments? Have you considered laser treatment? Feel free to PM me, I could use someone to talk to about this in general.", "Hot showers vs LS Hello everyone, did you ever notice a relation between hot showers and flare ups? I have been really itchy for the last week and could not find any other reason to be apart from hot showers. Do you use any soaps or other products on your body when you shower?  I went through a period where i always got more itchy after a shower and I eventually realized it was from a skin sensitivity to my body wash and/or shampoo Hot water can be drying, and dried out skin is more prone to inflammation. For psoriasis, I know hot showers and hot baths are recommended against for this reason, and I would expect the same to apply to similar inflammatory skin conditions like LS. However, I saw someone on here saying she was instructed to take really hot baths for LS. I could see how it could be helpful for pain and tension, and maybe there are other benefits? \n\nI know I like hot showers and hot baths, so I take them anyway. I think the drying effects can be mitigated if you moisturize well immediately afterward. Yes I am taking colder showers and baths. Previously used hottest water possible but skin is too sensitive now. Also was told (not by a doctor) to be careful with hand held sprayer on shower. I personally have not \u2014 I enjoy bathing with hott water and find it soothing What moisturizer do you use down there. I do use coconot oil as moisturizer and medical cream on a daily base Thank you so much for sharing I do also enjot bathing with hot water but not sure about soothing That can be the cause! I do not use a lot but use regular body soaps, do you have any recommendation? What kind of moisturizer you use?   Lol it may sound odd or extreme, but I honestly just cut my hair super short and stopped using shower products alltogether after my LS diagnosis.  I have got a filter for my showerhead so that the junk in the tap water doesnt damage my hair and skin as much, but that is it.  Super simple, and works super well- for my body at least..\n\nEverybody's body is different though.  I dont really get stinky armpits, and i dont wear deoderant because my body sweats more from my hands and feet than from my armpits..  (a symptom of my palmoplantar keratoderma) but I have to do a whole special routine for me feet every day to keep them from stinking super bad.  \n\nYou can try using nothing in the shower for a week or something just to see if it makes a difference for you.  Dr. Bronner's unscented soap is a good one for sensative skin also! And you can make your own conditioner at home by mixing a spraybottle with apple cider vinegar, water and a couple drops of (your choice of)essential oil. Recipes for diy conditioner are easy to find online.  It didnot sound odd cause I literally have buzzcut lol! When you mentioned I also thought about the past weeks when I have just showered only with water and being fine; you may be right. Thank you so much No problem.  Hope it helps!  Haha after ditching all my shower products i really started wondering why i ever even bothered with them in the first place?  My scalp was less healthy and more dry with the products, and my body is just as clean now without them.  Plus theres never any worry of residual soap taste down there :P My go-to is Aveeno, but I am not actually sure if it is crotch-friendly. I also like shea butter and just plain vaseline. I would personally suggest Aquaphor. The trick here is you will want to apply right after the shower which will help hold in any moisture the skin has gained from the water.\n\nConversely, olive oil is an incredible moisturizer with some anti-inflammatory effects (esp \"Early Harvest\" or high polyphenol varieties (if you can find one that totes heart health this should be tested for high polyphenols or else they cannot make the health claims) that might be helpful.", "My foreskin has gotten much tighter after the inflammation 6 months ago. I also feel the length of my erected penis has decreased because of that, sounds weird I know. After an erection it can take 5 hours before I am able to pull the foreskin back over glans again. Anyone experienced the same?  Yes. Several times following taking antibiotics.  Then I got a fungal / yeast infection.  Last time dermatologist gave me steroid ointment and it was much better or even cured in under a week.\nHope this helps. Check out ginny chandohas beating the disease on amazon\n\nI am also a male who was diagnosed with LS, and my LS is 90% gone now. read some reviews of the book on amazon One of the main issues with penile LS is it is propensity to cause phimosis arising from scarring of the tissues of the tip of the penis. I find myself in a situation where the PLS is in full remission so no symptoms but I have mild phimosis due to the original inflammation and scarring which has changed my sexual experience somewhat. \n\nI have been advised by my dermatologist not to stretch the foreskin for fear of creating new scarring. I am currently in the process of exploring surgical and non- surgical solutions for this issue although it looks like surgical options are the only real flyers and I am not prepared to consider circumcision at this point as it is a minor inconvenience rather than a major block. \n\nYour situation is potentially a bit more serious as you appear to be describing paraphimosis where the foreskin becomes trapped behind the glans. This can sometimes lead to swelling,  loss of blood supply to the glans, and becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment. \n\nI suggest you read up on how to bring the foreskin forward in this situation - basically reducing the size of the glans by gently and slowly squeezing the blood out back towards the body and using the thumbs to bring the foreskin forward. 5 hours is a long time to leave the foreskin trapped in the position you describe. \n\nI wish you all the best. Hey dude, i also have scars from LS/phismosis on the tip of my penis, is there any way to fade it out or getrid of iy no surgically?", "How do you know when the clobetasol is working? I am on day 4 Hi! I have been on clob for four days now and taking it twice daily. I have not received a formal diagnosis via biopsy, but my gyno agreed to prescribe the ointment when she saw my white spots on the vulva.\n\nI am afraid I am damaging my vulva with it though, because it feels slightly off. It just feels SLIGHTLY more raw/ sensitive but it looks the same. Zero pain. Is this normal? I never experience itchiness or anything like that, so it is hard to tell if it is helping. My symptoms are the white spots and pain/ cuts after sex.\n\nCould it be that I am just being hyper aware of it down there? I am trying not to obsess, but I also want to stop if I am one of those who experience a bad reaction to clobetasol   so that I end it before it gets worse.\n\nThank you in advance. I did have itchiness so I knew from the itchiness going away, but I noticed healing from the tearing around week 3-4. The steroid cream slows down the healing process so it takes longer but also prevents fusing, so I would give it until week 3 and then take a look down there with a mirror.\n\nIf pain keeps up or gets worse definitely tell your gyn as it could be a sign that your skin is thinning and you could benefit from an estrogen cream to rebuild the skin layers. \n\nIt was about day 6 of clob when I had the thought \"I would like to go a day without thinking about my vulva\". It was about day 32 before I finally did. This is soooo helpful! Thank you! I guess since starting the ointment, I feel much more aware of my vulva- it just feels more raw/ delicate. I will not know if it is helping until I have sex and I see if it gave me tiny tears/ cuts. I am not sure when I can do that because I do not want to undo the progress. \n\nI will give it a few more weeks then! I read from other members that Thymosin Alpha 1 completely healed it", "Can I masturbate with LS or does that make it worse? I am frustrated and really feel the need of an orgasm. Be careful and not rough, should that be ok? Or can it cause bigger white spots and thinner skin on glans than I already have. I am male btw.  I am female, but to speak for myself, I use water lube with no glycerin and shower after. There is still a bit of irritation but it does help settle it down. Use a barrier cream before as well, like desitin. Just be gentle and avoid anything that causes pain. Lube will probably help, too Thanks. I cant live a life without no form for orgasm 134 years without a cure for this shit. Going into my 20s with LS. I just want to cut of my penis and do a reconstruction surgery. This kills me mentally, I cant sleep at nights as well\ud83d\ude16 Like others have said, be gentle and use lube! Give yourself a day or two between sessions to see how it impacts you. (Prostate orgasms can also be an option if you find the traditional way is too irritating.) This. Go browse some sex toys and find a prostate massager. Blow your, uh, mind. Should not cause thinner skin or change the color. Just learn to go slow and work in a way that does not hurt or pull too hard. Dunno if you are circumcised - might change how that works for you. \n\nThere is more than one way to orgasm. You are young yet, so you have not had time to try them all. You will find methods that do not hurt most of the time. Maybe only chill on masturbation if you are actively flared and the skin is bad - and go to town when it is happier. \n\nAnd like saxamaphone said, get yourself a prostate massager. It is not for everyone, but it is the way to orgasm when the typical way isnt working. Orgasms are definitely not off the table. I understand. I tried to take a shower early. Yep, just a good old shower, and I used some shampoo that irritated my vulva and now I have a tear half an inch long. Neosporin and cotton granny panties for the next week... I am going into my 20s too, had it since I was 11. It does get better, but I assure you there is still bumps on the way. Some days I can get a goddamn gang bang ran on me if I wanted then other days I cannot even wipe without tears and uncomfort. \n\nI would really recommend the lube slippery stuff. It can be found on amazon, fuck water is another good lube (but I am allergic to glycerin so it can irritate me in a flare up) Also: you mentioned not being able to sleep at night. Not sure if it is from physical irritation or  mental, but nevertheless here is some advice for both. \n\nIf itching and irritation is really bad, take an antihistamine and try to take a bath (if you have a tub, if not try to sitz bath) in epsom salt or borax. 1/4 cup borax in a huge tub should do the trick. I have heard 1 teaspoon in a sitzbath. \n\nI noticed lots of my itching on the white spots came from my laundry detergent. Switched to all free and clear, gives lots of us success. No scented soaps or perfumes that could touch the genitals in any way, do not use any of it on your hands either (like lotion or hand soap, cause it can irritate when touched later,) I recommend dove unscented for washing legs/stomach/anything where the water will run down to the genitals. As for mental, distract yourself. That is legitimately the only way I can sleep at night. Find a good tv show, call a friend. LS constantly lingers on my mind, but at least you are multitasking as well and there is some temporary relief. Also, talk to your doctor if you have one atm about steroid creams and some sort of anxiety med. It is the only things that have helped (besides the ya know, horrible 12 hour self care routine I have to do at home to make sure my vagina does not have a nervous breakdown) .. I appreciate the help from all of you\ud83d\ude4f Thank you", "How can I \u2018loosen\u2019 clitoral hood? While I am using a tacrolimus (?) ointment right now and it is helping my skin around my vagina and anus heal, my clitoral hood is still fusing (?) and slowly getting tighter and tighter to the point where I cannot pull it back and expose my clit without pain! Is there anything I can do to loosen it/stretch it so it will not get tighter/fuse? Does massaging it to keep movement there so it does not tighten more help? I do not want it to fuse!! I looked your ointment up and it says for eczema. \nDiscuss with your doctor using betamethasone or clobetasol which are usually used for LS.\nThe Betamethasone has helped losen my foreskin and unstuck adhesions that have been fused for years.\nGood luck ! I am not sure but someone on the fb group said to pull the clit hood back every day and to apply the steroid under it with a cotton bud", "Question for the ladies I have had LS for the last 4 or more years now. I used to use tampons but started using a cup 5 months ago and it is been a life saver. The tampon string used to rub me raw and make my LS worse and uncomfortable. But with cups, they do sometimes leak. (But the same happens with tampons so cant fault the cup) I am wondering if anyone here uses a cup and/or reusable cloth pads. If you use the cloth pads, do they rub you raw? Is it more comfortable than regular pantyliners? What material is yours made of (cotton, bamboo, microfiber, etc) I just need the cloth pads for possible leaks and I am not sure what brand to buy. Thanks! :) I just switched to a cup too! I have been able to use normal pads without issue, but I was also able to use tampons without rubbing anyway. \n\nEveryone has different needs in this category. It is great that the cup is helping. I suggest the Put A Cup In It Facebook group for ideas! Thank you I will check it out! \n\nI wanted to use the reusable pads since it seems environmentally friendly- which is part of the reason I am using the cup. Kind Of defeats the purpose if I use a panty liner every day lol. I like how light pantyliners are though and just worry the reusable pad will cause me to sweat since it is extra material. Yeah the group probably has some threads you can search for to get some info on that. \n\nYes, exactly - I am lucky enough to only leak on super heavy days and just have not had the time to properly research reusable pads. I have seen that there are cute ones from Etsy though! Yeah amazon has some for a good price and they are also cute. But they come in lots of different materials so worried what kind to get. Not sure what bamboo would feel like lol I had the same thought but personally the cloth pads and liners did not work for me. They were thicker than the disposable and made me sweat down there and that caused more discomfort and irritation than the little bit from a thin liner. That is what I was worried about, thanks for sharing your experience. I might not get them I love the idea of them and I wished they did work but after struggling with LS for almost 8 years I will do anything to find some comfort! Lol I am sure you agree!", "Advice for glans treatment after lichen sclerosus (UK) I was diagnosed with lichen sclerosis at 18 after suffering from a tight foreskin since puberty. I was prescribed with various creams incl. steriod treatment that did nothing to improve things and so had a circumsicion operation at 19.\n\nI am now 24 and whilst I believe I do not technically have active LS anymore, the glans of my penis are still quite damaged - with discolouration, cracked skin, and a tiny blood mark on the head. The skin in general feels so *dead* and is unpleasant to look at. \n\nThere was no real guidance given to me after my circumsicion operation about what would happen next. I was young at the time and I felt many aspects of the condition and the operation were not properly explained to me.\n\nLast year I arranged an appointment to see a private urologist to see if there was anything that could be done to even slightly improve the condition of the glans. They said there was (they compared the skin of the penis to the skin of the mouth, able to change with the right treatment), and I was prescribed with clobetesol, some different kinds of soap, and epaderm. None of these did anything to fundamentally improve the condition. They also suggested vaseline as an alternative to epaderm, which ironically does a much better job in my opinion of making things look better (at least temporarily). They then suggested a biopsy to try and see if I was having an allergic reaction to something - I did not arrange a follow-up appointment, they did not really seem like they had a strong idea what to do.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions what to do in my situation? If there is any specific recommendations for dermatologists / urologists in London, the UK, or even worldwide with video consultation, I would greatly appreciate it if you direct messaged me.\n\nFrom some things I have read it sounds like there is nothing to be done to improve the condition. I partly arranged to see the urologist for them to say this and get closure. However I still have not had a medical professional say this to me, and I feel like I owe it to my future self to explore every avenue :). I also find it hard to believe that someone my age cannot do anything to even slightly improve things - and I am also nervous of it getting worse as I get older. \n\nFundamentally I would really love to be connected with a medical professional who is truly familiar with  my condition, and get advice from people who have been in a similar situation.\n\nThanks! Professor Bunker, get an apt with him", "Stopping Clobetasol Hi everyone! I have been on Clob for the past 4 years and a few weeks ago I noticed my labia minora was getting smaller and smaller over the years so I went to see my doctor and she told me to stop using clob because my skin looked good compared to when I first went 4 years ago. I applied Clobetasol once every 2 weeks but I have not applied it for the past few weeks and my skin feels DRYYYY. Is it possible for my skin to go back to being the way it was 4 years ago( very dry, white/grey skin color, itchy..) It is super important to taper off clob or you can have topical steroid withdrawals. My doctor had me taper off over months. I went from twice a day to once a day for a few weeks, then once every other day for a few weeks, then twice a week for a couple of weeks, and then off completely. \n\nBecause clob is so strong it can cause extreme thinning and fusing. \n\nYou might want to add an emollient to your routine. Something like emu oil or a product I really like is called Emily's Skin Soother ( Yes, it CAN go back... it probably will, if you have LS, and you run into a \"flare\".\n\nFor me, I use clobetasol only when I feel things going wrong.  Most of the time I am fine, but sometimes my skin decides it hates life again and then I need to catch it with the clobetasol for a couple days and reverse course.  If I miss it - because other life crap has me so distracted I do not notice or remember to apply clob until it is bad - it sucks.\n\nI do not use clob on a regular schedule.  I use it a few times a year as needed.  Trick is to catch it sooner rather than later.\n\nI cannot be sure this is the RIGHT way to manage it.  Nobody seems to know for sure.  This is working well enough for me, diagnosed at 30, 42 now.  For all I know, there is quiet damage being done I cannot see - I do not think so, but maybe.  But there seems to be a risk in overuse of steroids too.  So, I try to use it when I need it, and avoid it when I do not.\n\nI would not get rid of it.  I do not think \"dry\" is a reason to use a steroid - dry is not the same as itchy, white, thin, tearing.  Unless that is how it starts for you.  \n\nPerhaps you could wean more slowly off the clob?  Instead of going from regular use to none, maybe taper a bit?\n\nMaybe an emollient of some kind would help with the sensation of dry, if it is not necessarily LS causing that feeling?  Definitely a doc question there.\n\nGood luck. I will ask her about only using it when I feel the need to! Thank you. Yes, she told me to stop using it because she said the Clob might be the reason my labia minora was getting smaller throughout the years. Thank you, I will try the product you linked! Am I the only one that is on Estrace and clobetasol year round? Not using them for one week puts me in pain. May i ask, during the 4 years, you were fine with no symptoms? Yes, my skin was fine, I just noticed my labia minora getting smaller I used it once every 2 weeks echoing this! i have not touched my clob in a couple months :) i will just put a bit on when i am starting to feel a bit itchy and it goes right away.\n\nalso, my derm prescribed me a non-steroid cream that i can use just on days that my vulvar area is feeling dry- maybe ask about that! I also just use Clob now on a as needed basis when I feel itchy. I started using this vaginal moisturizer  for those of you who live in Canada. Thank you! I will ask my doctor about that My dermatologist prescribed betamethasone cream, which is also a steroid but may be weaker than clobetasol.  Has anyone asked about using a weaker steroid ?\nI use twice a week, male and not circumcised so it says under the foreskin just about all week, it is visible and noticable to the touch for 2 or 3 days. \nNote this is the newer augmented cream.\nThe skin is thinned and I get sticking and bleeding if it gets non greasy and do not apply a cream or vaseline.\nHope this help. I did not know there was anything weaker than Clobetasol, I will ask my doctor about it. Thank you! Yes, my skin was fine. The only thing is I noticed my labia minora was getting smaller so when I told my doctor about it she said to stop using clob because my skin looked fine and it could be the reason my labia was getting smaller I spoke to my urologist yesterday and she confirmed that betamethasone is weaker than clobetasol. She is pleased with progress I have made, white scar type skin is reduced and color returning to underside of glans, and continuing to see improvement in adhesions. So no reason for me to change! \nGood luck and let us know how you are doing. It is been about a month and a half without me using clob and my skin still just feels dry. If I get any other symptoms I am going back and asking her about betamethasone! Thank you :) My first betamethasone was replaced by an \"augmented \" version, same make etc.\nIt is thicker and stays around longer. If you do try it ask for augmented version. \n\nI am not sure it is a good idea to stop completely.  I have one small white mark on my glans that goes after 2 days but is back at day 3 or 4 when I put cream on next.\n\nThere are many posts on here from women recommending lubricating oils. To prevent my foreskin sticking to glans I have been told to use vaseline but sparingly!  Otherwise it pulls a piece skin out and bleeds profusely. I know this doesnt directly relate but you could use the information. My gynecologist told me to just use lube when I am dry, I am scared to go against her and keep using clob but I will definitely go back if my skin gets worse and ask for your recommendation! Yes I was originally told to use KY, but for some reason it made things worse, I suspect because its water based. I will probably be going back to my gynecologist soon. Thank you for telling me about betamethasone :)", "Thinning labia Hi all. I have noticed my labia minora have lost volume. They are still perfectly pink and \"normal\" looking, except for the reddish patches where the LS is at the crease, but they have less plumpness than they used to and they are quite slim. My GP is checking me for low estrogen on the 12th and I am wondering if this could be connected. Did anyone else have this issue, and if so, did you have to treat with an estrogen cream as well as the steroid? My doctor told me that this is a symptom when I was diagnosed. I have been given the steroid cream but have not followed up on treatment, so I do not know about the estrogen. I do not personally have this because my case progressed where my Labia minora have reabsorbed into the Labia majora. However, many people I have spoken to with LS experienced thinning and atrophy of the Labia. In almost all cases, tropical estrogen was prescribed to help plump up the tissue and most were happy with the results. Thanks, this is what I figured. I will either ask the GP, or bring it up with the specialist when I see her.", "Protopic Has any one used protopic? If so, how long did it take to start feeling a difference - mainly itching?", "OPINIONS NEEDED - NSFW - I have been suffering from thinning skin, redness and severe itching for years now. Both my parents have lichens but different doctors are not sure. Still on a massive waiting list for biopsy and I just want some opinions/ ideas. Please! I am really struggling :(  No idea, but in the meantime, applying Vaseline might help bring you some relief if it is LS. Good luck! From my research and personal experience, if \"scratching the itch\" makes it worse, that is a sign of LS. If you do as the other commenter suggests and use a moisturizer, I have heard coconut oil is a good one, and it helps then it could also point toward LS. \n\nBest of luck getting off the waiting list, that must be so frustrating!", "Results Hi everyone I am 31 year year old female. I got my results from my biopsy and it confirmed my diagnoses of over 10 years ago when I was 19 that i do indeed have lichen sclerosis and eczema they took 3 biopsy from both sides. So Im glad it was not cancer. That flair was from a allgeric reaction from a insertable probiotic that another doctor told me to try. I am still healing it stings sometimes but it is better. Once you know then you get the right treatment going forwards.\nI am glad that it is not the C word. That is reason we need to keep looking at ourselves to be able to see it and if any changes happen.\nI am thinking of getting my minera coil taken out as the LC happened soon after it was inserted. Due to the hormone change I am thinking that my body thinks it menopausal? \nHas anyone else had this happen to them after getting the coil? My started at 19 when I was diagnosed with vaganismus and I cannot take estrogen anymore so I am progesterone only arm implant. Goodness you are young to have to go through all that uncertainty.\nI am glad that you are on the best medication to help you heal. \nTake Care Hey! I am 30 and just got my biopsy results yesterday too! Was sweating it out all week, so was very relieved to hear it was not cancer. Here is to hoping the road ahead is not too difficult! I am so glad good luck I found out at 28! It is crazy because when you google it says mainly older women but I am glad we are learning earlier.", "Specialists in the NYC area?  Hey all,\n\nI have seen three different dermatologists in the last 3-4 years, and I havent felt like any of them were very familiar with LS (i couldnt even convince the first dermatologist of the diagnosis while i had obvious and acute symptoms), or very interested. I had a female derm, and she always talked about risk factors for female LS, and did not seem to realize the disease for men is somewhat different. I also felt like she was uncomfortable looking at my junk.\n\nI am at the point where I would like to find someone who can actually properly monitor me and reassure me (I have health anxiety, so having someone explain things is really important).\n\nAnyone have a recommendation/know of a dermatologist/urologist in the NYC area who specializes in or frequently treats LS in men? I have also heard there are genital dermatologists. Any recs on those?\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations/feedback/letting me vent. Unfortunately I have no clue about specialists in NYC \n\nCan you describe your symptoms in detail over the past 4years maybe someone here might help shed some reassurance I think Female dermatologist are most likely to be able to recognize and treat LS because they have more Female patients. \nYes there is the problem of exam. Mine has me handle myself, retract foreskin and rotate it on demand! My urologist is also female and I suggested this approach rather than laying on my back and not being able to see and give questions and comments. This seemed to me to work well, she didnt even put she gloves on that she had at the ready. As for difference in disease between sexes remember it is different in every patient. I have also had someone who was obviously uncomfortable looking at my vulva. She barely glanced at it, while I was standing up, and then insisted on a biopsy. When I mentioned that it might be diagnosable from the appearance (which many sources recommend doing when possible), she chided me for \"reading things on the internet\" and said that \"in medicine we have to test everything.\" Well she did not biopsy my ear when I asked her about possible psoriasis in there. She just immediately said \"yes that is psoriasis, I will write you a gel for it.\" So really, she needed to biopsy it *because she was not experienced enough* to diagnose it by sight, but she should have just admitted that instead of belittling me.\n\nI went to someone else for my follow-up, who had me lay back on the examining table, took a proper look, and immediately said it was LS without doubt. \n\nI do not know why the first derm even took my appointment if she did not want to look at my crotch. She was clearly not knowledgeable about vulvar anatomy either. When I asked if I should put the ointment on my clitoris (pointing to a picture on my phone because she had me get dressed too quickly to ask any specific questions), she told me my clitoris was my urethra and not to get any ointment in there. I was like uh no I definitely do not pee out of there...", "20F with some questions about LS life Hey guys, I am 20F that just got a biopsy back as Lichen sclerosus and or Lichen Planus. I am having a follow up soon to discuss this more but there does not really seem to be much of an LP community so here I am. \n\nI have read a lot of posts on here but I have a few things that I have not got a clear answer on sorry this is long but I am young and worried! I will be going over these things with my doctor next appointment anyways but it is a few weeks away. \n\nCan you go swimming? I am thinking of joining a gym that has a salt water pool but im not sure if swimming is irritating or bad for the steroid creams? I am only using hydrocortisone 2.5 right now because clobetasol was irritating and so was Halbatosol. \n\nDoes exercise or weight loss make your symtoms better or worse? I have lost 60 pounds right before being diagnosed and I want to lose another ~ 30ish but I am scared that will make me have a bad flare. \n\nSex, I am a virgin so I do not know if it will be painful for me or not but exams are very painful for me. My doctor said I would be able to have sex because I have not fused over and that my length and width are normal but she did not mention anything about pain. Do you use dialators? Where did you get them, how long have you used them and when did you see improvement? What lube and condoms do you use and does the steroid affect your partner? \n\nFor those of you who have lost your labia minora, do partners care? I still have some of mine left but they are discolored and small. I basically have nothing near my vaginal opening only around my clit area. \n\nPubic hair. Do you find that having hair irritates the skin? I have always been a bush woman and have never shaved but recently I have been trimming pretty short and I think there is been less irritation. I am thinking of getting an electric razor but not sure if that would be good for LS skin. \n\nToilet paper and underwear, best brands? Right now I am using MD and Jockey but curious about what other people use. \n\n Does anyone here smoke weed? Does it help your symtoms at all? I am curious if anyone sees improvement with thc or cbd. And from what I have heard alcohol is bad? \n\nThanks! Sorry if formating is bad im on mobile Hey! I am 20F too and was diagnosed with LS this year but suspect it is what I have been dealing with since early summer 2020.\n\nTo be honest it was quite a daunting thing to be diagnosed with given the lack of knowledge and lack of solid answers I would got from doctors so this community is super helpful!\n\nSo to answer your questions to the best of my knowledge (others will likely be more helpful/have more experience, ive been dealing with my symptoms for almost a year now):\n\n- swimming I am not too sure of as I was diagnosed whilst my area (UK) has been in lockdown, so I have not had any opportunities to go swimming really but I am also invested in this question because I do want to when I have the chance to go on holiday again etc \n\n- I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and weightlift, do not do much cardio (sometimes do HIIT) but do get very sweaty and so far it has not affected anything but I have started wearing looser track bottoms rather than leggings because I saw things recommending doing that. Not too sure about changes in weight because I have been around the same weight throughout my experience with LS so far \n\n- sex: tbh this was the most affected thing in my life with LS, it made it excruciating and used to be something I really enjoyed. Exams too - my skin would tear open during them. After I started using steroids it definitely got better, I also started doing perineal massage every day which I really recommend (I will do it in the shower and also use hydromol emollient as a soap substitute in the shower), that and the steroids helped things heal and now sex is the same as it used to be. Do not use condoms as I am in a long term relationship and I take birth control (milinette 20/75) and we do not usually need lube because we do a lot of foreplay but if it is needed I will use sylk natural lube (it is got a leaf on the logo, you can get it at Boots and on Amazon  As for the steroids affecting my partner, I will wash them off before any penetration (or if I know we are going to do that kind of stuff I typically shower before anyways so I will just wash it off in the shower and not re-apply) to prevent it being pushed in me/getting on him. \n\n\n- I am not too sure still what exactly is meant by losing the labia, I am not too sure if it is happened to me or if I just did not really know what it looked like before I got LS as it is not really an area I would look at often, I do have changes in appearance there since my symptoms started like the typical white patches and he is seen everything before/after my LS and does not care. He is also been super helpful and reassuring when I have got upset about it so it is all good, there certainly are people out there who will be completely fine with it and provide reassurance and if they are not fine with it then they are likely just shallow.\n\n- my doctor recommended not shaving when I first got my symptoms so from what I have spoke to them about it not shaving tends to be better. (I am the opposite haha I would shave every shower but not doing so now has shown me it is not something I needed to do that often and now I will only do it from time to time, either way hair has not made anything worse for me but shaving has not either, when I have flares I will not shave because I imagine it would cause irritation) everyone is different though so if it does cause less irritation for you then an electric razor could be good!\n\n- the best underwear I have found so far are these on Amazon  before LS I would wear Victoria\u2019s Secret stuff but not so much these days, and toilet paper I am not too sure because I live in shared housing so we will just buy stuff from aldi but for bowel movements I bought a peri bottle/mini bidet kind of thing I use instead of toilet paper because it is too irritating for me sometimes \nI will also use fabric reusable pads during periods because the plastic kind are too irritating for me \n\n\nSorry this is super long, I wish I could be more helpful! I hope all your queries are answered and that it helps you have a bit more peace of mind Thanks for the info! Nice to know there are other 20 year olds with this. No worries! And yeah it is definitely reassuring, makes me feel less alone in this Deer had good answers! I have likely had it since my 20s but in my 40s now. Diagnosed at 30. \n\nSwimming: I have not noticed any problems. Do be sure to dry off or change - no hanging around in wet suits - but that is for yeast, which extra sucks if the skin is irritated already. If you have an active open tear it might sting, but it will not make it worse. \n\nI have been ALL THE WEIGHTS and it has not affected LS at all. \n\nSex is fine unless it is flared up and angry. It should be discussed with a partner because you should start off slow and make sure you are in good shape before going to pound town. Also, he needs to stop on a dime if you do suddenly and unexpectedly tear. (Switching to oral takes the sting out of that. Personally, I feel the rip and a little bit of pain but it is not bad in the moment. It will be bad later, but in the moment, switching to oral and snatching victory from the jaws of defeat is my go to). \n\nPartners that care can fuck RIGHT off. Anybody that is not thrilled as can be to be naked with you is an ass and you should not fuck them. That said, you are young, so you might be getting intimate with young men who have limited experience. Congrats, you get to introduce them to variety. Some of them may be surprised. Some of them may be dicks about it. Most of them will look back and kick themselves for that when they are older, but ... young men. Eugh. You never know. I find it most likely they will not even notice. Women vary anyway. But since you will have already let them know you have a skin condition, if they DO notice, you can explain that in tread LS causes some scarring that changes the appearance. Sucks, but life goes on. \n\nI am old and nobody gives a fuck about the state of my pubic hair, so GO TEAM BUSH. I have tried it every which way and removing hair just leaves room for things to get irritated. Hair is an awesome cushion!!  Your dudes are going to be more weird about that than the length of your lips. If you want to trim, I find an electric trimmer that shorterns hair, but does not shave it entirely off, is the best way. Especially in summer, if you are in a humid climate. Just do not remove ALL the cushion unless you are in full remission. \n\nUndies, cotton is gold. Sleep with none of you can! I would avoid thongs mostly for general health reasons, not so much for LS. \n\nTP, avoid lotions and fragrances. A gentle bidet is awesome in every way. \n\nI do not smoke but I use tinctures (legal state) and it does not seem to affect LS. CBD seems to have a decent affect on general inflammation which might help a little, but if so, it is damn subtle. THC, I do not see anything. That is all sublingual tinctures that do not even really have a psychoactive affect much, so YMMV. I seriously doubt it would hurt as long as your general health is good. Alcohol, same deal. \n\nWhat DOES affect LS is general health. Life is good, you are good, gut is healthy, not getting abused, etc? LS tends to be chill. Life is awful, work is hell, partner is scary, kids are too hard, you are all alone and hanging on by a thread? LS is going to kick your ass while you are already down. Because fuck LS.  Those are just general tendencies and not at all set in stone. But take care of your health, seriously. \n\nGood for you getting a diagnosis. I hope you find a treatment method that works for you and have a good time with the dudes once you are ready. Good luck! Thank you so much! Hi! \n\nI am not diagnosed with LS yet but I have been struggling with very similar symptoms for almost a year and feeling desperate for some kind of diagnosis. I am just wondering what your symptoms started out as? I am mainly getting multiple tiny cuts that go away then come back again and a lot of irritation but no white patches (yet). I am very new to LS and just been reading what everyone on here has to say and now I am kind of worried about it. I am 25 female so feeling stressed about it. Which then makes it worse ughhhh. Thanks!! Mine started as having weird discharge and some itching so I assumed it was a yeast infection and went to my primary for a swab. It was not yeast but they kept treating it like it was and it took several doctors to get diagnosed. I never really looked at my vulva so I was probably asymptomatic for awhile because I had some atrophy and redness I had no idea about. Lately I have been having the tiny cuts in my anal area that come and go. I have 2 white ish areas but it is pretty minimal I suffer more with redness so I might have LP but the biopsy was not clear between LP and LS but they are pretty similar and same treatment. If you have similar inflmation of the vulva I would definitely see a vulva expert for a biospy. Most doctors have no idea about LS or LP. I had a few that said I was too young to have it but the biospy has proven them wrong lol. If you do have it Clobetasol or Halobetasol works for most people no problem and does not thin LS or LP skin. But unfortunately for me my skin reacted badly so I am on a low hydrocortisone but I am actually getting a little better! Ugh yeah that sounds really similar. I had a flare up last summer with little cuts and itching but it seemed to go away and then the last few months it is been non stop. I think mine seems to be worse when I am stressed/tired and lately it is been all the time haha. I have also been told it is a yeast infection so been treated for that but now two weeks later it is back so defo not a yeast infection. Yeah I mentioned i suspected LS to my doctor and she had no idea what it was, it is so frustrating. \nThanks so much for the reply!! No problem! Just keep pushing. if I had listened to the first few I would have never gotten my diagnosis. I found a vulva specialist on my own and got a referral and she knew what it was immediately. Biopsy is the only way and it is not as bad as I thought it would be. You sound like you have LP if so that is going to be even harder to get diagnosed. Best of luck! Thanks so much and you too! I am in my late 20s and was diagnosed a few years ago. Everyone is different, but here is a few tips from my experience:\n\n-I have never had problems with swimming or exercise\n\n-sex is painful but only during initial penetration, so try to to relax and see if it feels better after a minute. Starting with a finger and using lube helps\n\n- I am losing my labia minora. Freaks me out a lot to think of, but my partner is completely understanding. The loss has not impacted our second life. \n\n-I do not shave during flare ups. Otherwise I am fine with shaving or waxing. \n\n-\u201cwater wipes\u201d brand wipes for using the bathroom \n\n-you can still find some VS underwear that is ok for LS! Just check that it is 100% cotton. I still buy all my underwear there, so you will find stuff if you take some time look for it", "Having my biopsy tomorrow. Please send my vulva some positive vibes. I am nervous, but from reading threads in this subreddit and asking some of you questions I have a better idea of what to expect of the actual event and the following recovery.\n\nThanks for being here, you all. I will post some thoughts in an update when I am on the other side of this thing. Hey! I got mine last week. Make sure to keep an eye on the site because mine did start to get infected. I am on an antibiotic right now and it will be fine, just something to watch out for! Will do! Thanks for the tip. I had mine last week! Make sure you ask for information on how to keep it clean. Mine got massively infected and I had to spend Friday night in emerg. On antibiotics now which are causing problems as well, had to get some flucazole. So many eyerolls. Might have to go to a clinic on Friday to get the site drained.\n\nI hope you fair better than I did! Good luck! Good luck! Sending prayers your way! \ud83d\ude4f Mine did too. Luckily I got it early so I just got on the antibiotic and the gyno cleaned it out with saline and water which hurt. Best of luck!!! Oh man. I could not even walk at its worst. It looks like its getting infected again though after 3 days of not so bad. The emerg doc told me to go back to one of three hospitals in my city that has the meds to put me to sleep to do it. He knew there was no way they were going to be able to drain mine while I was awake. \n\nI am really hoping it looks better by tomorrow so I do not have to have it drained. Ugh I am so sorry. Hoping for a speedy recovery. Thank you! Me too! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb How did it go today? Hope okay! Hey, thanks for checking in! It went alright. I was really nervous, but the nurse practitioner helped me relax by asking me about the tattoo on my leg, which helped distract me from my worries. The actual shot was painful, but it did not hurt very long. I could not feel what was happening at all.\n\nI am home now and at the moment I cannot feel anything. I took some ibuprofen earlier so maybe that is helping or perhaps the numbing agent just has not started to wear off yet. There were a few moments a couple hours ago where I thought I felt some burning from the area, but I do not feel that now.\n\nWe will see what happens in the coming days. Hoping for a normal recovery! That is great! I am glad. Mine did not really hurt just sitting around. It was only when I touched it or peed or if I moved in a weird way. I had mine on Monday! 2 years down the road and they finally want to make sure I was not misdiagnosed since no treatment has helped. I am worried it is getting infected, and my symptoms are flaring but I cannot treat with my mometasone cream because it burns on irritated skin. Cannot walk well/only wear my partner\u2019s boxers right now. Hope you get some pain relief in the next few days. Just had mine yesterday! I FREAKED OUT with the needle. Had an anxiety attack. It hurt so much when the numbing stuff wore off yesterday, and today it is better. I took 600 mg of Advil this morning and so far I have not needed it again. I was told not to wash with soap, and just rinse with water. I used the hairdryer on cool setting after the shower to dry it off. She took the biopsy high up on the vulva so the urine would not burn it. It just sucks because it is hot out and even with gym shorts everything is sweaty down there! How are you feeling? I am doing really well, thank you for asking! This morning I was feeling itchy/burny, but I washed off with a bit of water and then left the area alone and now I am feeling good again.\n\nI was so worried after reading so many horror stories about painful healing processes and biopsy sites getting infected, etc., but so far I am doing great. I wish everyone had an experience as positive as my own. Hopefully things stay on the up and up and I heal just fine. I am glad to hear your lucked out on a quick and speedy recovery! I am finally starting to feel 100 again! Though my time of month is now 5 days late from the meds, trauma, or stress - so lame! hi op! How has your recovery been? Hey there! Thanks for checking in with me. My recovery has been amazing. After reading so many horror stories I was certain something terrible would happen and that it would get infected or just hurt like hell. I have had none of that. No pain. Nothing. My follow-up appointment is set for Thursday and I am sure they will pleased with how it is healing.\n\nIn diagnosis news... It is not lichen sclerosus. It is chronic dermatitis. So a steroid cream/ointment should hopefully do the trick to treat it. I was really surprised it was not LS because my sister was diagnosed with it a month and a half ago and I know it has a genetic component.\n\nThanks again for checking in with me! Means a great deal.", "Second biopsy experience My (f 24) first biopsy from my dermatologist showed a fungal infection, was given medicine for that and no surprise did not fix it. When I came back for my 5 week check up she said she had the pathologist take another look and they saw what could possibly be inverse psoriasis. She gave me an option of either testing a treatment plan for it to see if it helps or to just redo the biopsy. I opted to redo the biopsy as i would rather have a confirmed diagnosis.\n\nSo my experience with my second biopsy: \n\nShe took the biopsy right outside of my labia minora where there is obvious irritation. The alcohol swab stung for a second on the raw part of my skin, numbing needle stung but nothing unbearable (had to get numbed twice), did not feel the biopsy being taken but felt a slight sharp pain when she was doing the stitches, but again nothing bad. Bled a bit, wore a pad for a couple hours then just small pieces of guaze the until the end of the day. A bit bruised now but no pain unless I am touching it. \n\nHope this helps anyone that may be scared of getting it. I put my first one off for around 7 months because of it.", "Problems coming off clob? My doctor told me to use Clob:\n- Everyday for 4 weeks\n- Every other day for 3 weeks\n- Every few days for 2 weeks\n- Once a week for a bit\n\nWhen I was using it every day, it was amazing! I have not felt that good in ages.\nHowever I am now one week into using it every other day, and I am soooo itchy and sore.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what I can do? Is there something else I can use in my non-Clob days? I use A&amp;D everyday that helps but if it seems like it is not getting better after month you should go back to the doctor something else might needed to be added. Thank you! :) I am waiting for an appointment with the dermatologist, hopefully it will not be long Your welcome have you ever thought of seeing an obgyn that specializes in Lichen sclerosis for a second opinion on treatment? I have been seeing a gynaecologist, and she is the one that is referred me over to the dermatologist. I hope they will be able to refer me to a specialist I had the same issue but it passed. I still used the cream when I felt itchy on the no-use days (I would wait to feel itchy before using it) and after two weeks or so I was able to have those days in between without itchiness. It happened again when I had to stagger it more, and I did the same thing, just used the cream if I felt itchy but was then able to not use it anymore.\n\nNow I go weeks without the cream :) Thank you!!!\nI am glad you can go so long without the cream, i cant wait for that! Is there a reason they weaned you off? I was told to just continue using it daily and check in for yearly check ups. \n\nThe only exception was when I was pregnant as it can cause fetal growth defects. I have not been told really, I think they just want me to be able to be off it except when really needed.\nBut I am now tempted to use it daily until my next appointment at least, as it is gottem really bad in just a week :/ every doctor i have been to says repeated use of it thins the skin. is that not the case? I am sorry to hear that. If it is bringing you relief, then maybe the daily use is necessary. Hopefully you are next appointment is soon. If not, usually you can call to talk to your doctor\u2019s nurse to get some clarification. Good luck! Thank you!!! :) Thank you.\n\nThis has prompted me to do some online research (trying to only reference actual MDs) and the concern over thinning of this skin has been the most common cause to wean from frequent use. \n\nI never questioned it before because I was just going by what my OBGYN recommended. That bring said, I am more inclined to start the search for a dermatologist who has experience in LS. i have heard, maybe from this sub, that someone is doctor said that only applies to normal skin and not so much the vulva/mucous membranes? who knows. i do not think there is enough research into this disease or the vulvar skin to know anything 100%. Thank you so much. And I totally agree, there is still a lot to learn. It did the same for me, I went twice from a 2x daily to 2x weekly and the weaning off was terrible each time, but then it gets better. Hang on in there and if it does not become better after a few weeks call your doctor. Sidenote, **not a doctor\u2019s advice**, I would put some 1% Hydrocortisone cream that I had in my pharmacy, and it helped :) That is great, thank you for replying! It helps knowing I am not the only one Happy to help :) I actually told my doctor (gynecologist) about it too, he said it was common and normal I have sime hydrocortisone in for my eczema, so I might give that a go! I have also got some coconut oil which is meant to help Yeah I have tried a bit, but the oil stained my leggings so I hate it haha, also I am not sure if it really works, because I feel like it makes my lips \u201cmore peely\u201d when I use it, compared to lipsticks (I live in a very cold climate) Ooh I will need to keep an eye out for stains \ud83d\ude48 I have not noticed any yet.\nOuch, definitely not worth it for you then! The leading dr on LS is Dr Andrew Goldstein. He asserts that because LS is a chronic autoimmune disease with no cure, and Clobetasol is the antidote, that it really should be used 2x/week for life, for maintenance. He said it is safe to do so and that LS skin is actually thickened skin - and benefits from the use of Clobetasol and that it should be used after soaking the skin in warm water or after a shower for best absorption. He also advises that you rub it in for 90 seconds (to help it penetrate the skin with LS) That is fantastic, thank you for this information! I tend to put it on before bed, but i definitely do not run it in for that long. I will start doing that! You are welcome!\nAnd yes, do... he also said that too many people become complacent after the itching (or whatever symptom) subsides, thinking they \"do not need\" to continue using the Clobetasol, and it is very unfortunate because a lot of things can happen when you are not looking, so to speak... scarring etc. And then when you finally realize your disease has progressed, it is too late or very difficult to reverse (things like scarring), he has said he can not emphasize enough the need to stay on Clobetasol weekly for maintenance. Compare it to, say, an asthmatic who needs to be on a maintenance inhaler... get complacent with that and it can be life or death! Not the best comparison, but you get the point. :) Best of luck!\n\nPS there is a video of Dr. Goldstein giving a presentation about LS, it is long and extremely in depth but invaluable to watch if you have LS. I will look for the link Here is the link! It is on Vimeo\n\nAgain it is long but fascinating and important, I watched the whole thing \n\nHe explains every aspect of this disease in great detail and he knows what he is talking about (he is the director of the Center for Vulvovaginal Disorders in Washington DC)\n\n That is fantastic, thank you so much!!!\nSince I cut down the usage, I have gotten to much worse again. I am back on daily use now, but it takes a long time to take effect.\n\nI did not realise how much better I was with it until I came off it, if that makes sense!", "Should I do the Carbon Dioxide surgery for LS/BXO if possible? In April 2018 I went to the doctor because I noticed a whitish patch on the penis gland at the tip. The doctor diagnosed it as BXO (Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans),and I took a cream for it for about 2 months. \n\nA year prior to that I had phimosis, but never went to the doctor for that, and just googled what it was and stretched my foreskin it until it got better. \n\nNow doing some more research apparently LS is the same as BXO, and there is a surgery for it. Right not it is not bad my condition, but a started to take the medication again (because I just found my prescription), but want a more permanent solution.\n\nI want to the do the carbon dioxide laser surgery\nbut I want to know if anyone here did it, the results/process/how it treated the disease and what the costs were. I am 26 yrs old male and I live in Canada Ontario.\n\nThank you! Hey mate\n\nYour condition sounds exactly like mine. Did you use steroid cream?\n\nwhen i first used them my white spots went away and then came back.\n\nI asked my specialist about co2 but he said its rubbish even though ive seen studies saying its good. I posted a link about studies for cures on this subreddit if u can find it. \n\nIve also heard about work in PRP for LS. But nothing else right now mate\n\nAlso heard about DSMO and tea tree oil being a success but that was a natural remedy \n\nHow do doctors in canada look at treating this?\n\n Hey sorry for replying back to you late. \n\n\nI am currently using a steroid cream called Hydroval .02% Steroid Ointment. \n\nMy regular doctor actually referred me to a specialist and the only time I saw was for literally 5 mins where he identified my condition as BXO and gave me my prescription and told me to use it until the refills run out. I did not talk to him about any other treatments such as co2 laser. I did not even know what was BXO and thought it was temporary, and her seriously downplayed what it was exactly. I had to do all my research after i was diagnosed. \n\nI just want to know is co2 is the closes thing to a permanent fix and find opinions of if it is worth it.  Damn. The steroid could work. In my case it didnt, was temp and then went back to bxo.\n\nVery little work being done within LS at the moment so there is no such cure unfortunately.  Although trials have been done with co2 laser, but the study i saw was from 13 years back and nothing of it since. Also something called PRP is one of the new researches happening but i think in females at the moment", "Does clobetasol prevent atrophy if you do not have any? Hi, i was diagnosed half a year ago. No signs of her than itch. I use clobe on itchy areas every other day now and my itch is minimal. Will this prevent atrophy? Do I have to put it on no itchybareas too? If anything clob makes the skin atrophy. When I was using it my doctors were strongly advising me to use a moisturizer. I have heard the opposite everywhere -- not using it causes it to atrophy and it is vital to use it routinely I am just repeating what the doctor that did my biopsy/nurse from my biopsy and my obgyn told me. Might want to call your pharmacist, I am sure they can answer this question. I thought steroids just caused thinning of the skin? And so does LS, plus atrophy, as it progresses. Treatment prevents progression, so it can prevent atrophy. \n\nI guess it is like if you have heartburn, and your heartburn pills have a risk of upsetting your stomach. They might hurt your stomach a little, but they help a lot more than they hurt because they do treat the heartburn. \n\nMoisturizing is a great idea. Also to prevent skin thinning from steroids, it is important to follow instructions exactly. If you are not sure where to put it, you should probably call your doctor and ask exactly where and how much you should apply. (The question might be above your pharmacist's expertise.) Only use a pea size amount when putting on. If you use to too much over time it will thin your skin out. Come and discuss at our group. Many there would love to have that conversation. \n\n I have heard the same: Yes it does; No, it does not. No one seems absolutely certain. I have been \"yelled\" at for allowing posts that say one way or the other. We are at  \n\n", "24M - Been dealing with phimosis my whole life. Recently made an effort to deal it, and now wondering if I have LS as there is a white shiny film on the head of my penis Just discovered what LS is today, and Wondering if I have it, going to doctors in a couple days.\n\nI have phimosis my whole life, meaning i can retract my foreskin\n\nRecently been putting in the effort and slowly pulling back my foreskin. Notice that there are white film like substance of my penis head that wont go away even with spraying it with water for about a week.\n\nIt looks similiar to what other men have posted with LS on their penis.\n\nWhat are the chances this is LS? I have not had any symptons other than phimosis (which i have had my whole life) and the white film like substance.\n\nIf it is LS, how serious is this condition?\n\nThank you for your time. It is quite difficult to say, I have not really heard of LS presenting with a film on the skin. Usually it is white patches, sometimes itchy and uncomfortable, but not typically painful.\n\nWithout a doubt going to see a doctor is the best course of action. Personally I would suggest using a very mild soap (no fragrance etc.) and gently rubbing at the white film when you wash to see if it makes any difference. Making sure to thoroughly rinse with water afterwards to avoid worsening symptoms. If it starts to come away then it does not sound anything like LS. See your doctor and get a steroid ointment  like betamethasone. It helped my adhesions and white scaring to point its gone now. Yes I had white film over my glans. It seems to have been made worse by using a water based lubricant.  Avoid creams and water based lubricant.  Keep it dry. Read the posts on here.\nGood luck. BYW I had phimosis caused by an infection that originated while on antibiotics.  The betamethasone cured this in a week ! The adhesions I have had since puberty take a lot longer. \nAlso LS is different for everyone yet some symptoms are same. I hope you do not mind asking but have you masturbated at all in your life? then it is mostly that you have not cleaned your penis and is the sperm that has gotten stuck underneath the foreskin. It should go away within a few washes of your penis I also have a white patch around my urethra but it does not itch, or hurt, it feels thinner that the rest of the skin though. going by your advise I am using betamethasone once everyday hopefully it gets better. Please remember this is different for every patient.\nAfter two years on betamethasone my dermatologist has changed me to tacrolimus which is an eczema immunosuppressive drug. See how you respond and see what your dermatologist or specialist recommends. \nGood luck. Im in a poor country and our dermatologists do not know anything about LS. OK. Well there medical articles referenced here. Also read other threads. Some posts have pictures that may help you. Good luck. In a few months I intend to post the result of the new medication.", "Best Body wash? I have not been using body wash on the spots but it still gets on it from washing other areas. Anyone have any suggestions for all natural or soothing body wash? I like Aquaphor baby wash, that is my favorite. It is very gentle. The other two I would recommend are Eucerin baby wash and the CeraVe hydrating cleansing bar. I actually use Whole Foods Good soaps. They are mostly coconut oil &amp; Shea butter. No mineral oil, sulfates, parabens, etc. I have super sensitive skin (in addition to LS) and this is the only thing that does not really dry my skin out or cause dry patches. I have tried the body washes mentioned and still have a reaction (but I have heard good things about them from others) I use dove baby. Aveeno for sensitive skin I use dove with moisturizing cream, in the bar. I also love love love The Honey Pot Company's Sensitive Foaming Cleanser, for the vulvar area. Cetaphil. I use the aveeno unscented body wash.", "Mona Lisa laser? Anyone have experience with this/ is it painful? At the end of my rope here and thinking of trying it", "Does circumcision cures LS in males even when the disease progressed to the glans? Hey, \nI am thinking of getting circumcised to cure my LS. But I think for me the triggers for LS are related to the Koebner Effect (physical pressure triggers my LS so I have all my problems after rough sex or Masturbation). So know I am afraid that because they will remove my foreskin there will be more pressure on my glans what will actually make the disease worse..\nIs here somebody who got actually cured by circumcision even when there already where white patches on the glans ? And did the patches went back to a normal Color ? Thanks a lot. This disease is really breaking me mentally but this subreddit helps me coping with it. Hi. Circumcision is viewed as curative for most cases of LS. Exceptions are where the penis remains \u201cburied\u201d in the fat pad/loose skin such that a pseudo foreskin continues to trap urine.  I understand that the white patches will fade but the skin will show signs of scarring which will typically settle over time. It may be necessary to continue with clobetasol post circumcision for a period of time. Are you currently being treated conservatively with clobetasol or similar? I chatted with two persons (affecting glans) here on reddit that both got circ and they said their la was gone afterwards. But you need to discuss with a dr u cant rely on ppl on the internet. Just to add, conservative treatment with clobetasol or similar is c60% or so effective. Circumcision is c.90% or more effective. Personally I would strongly prefer remaining natural and have pursued conservative treatment, successfully so far. there are circumcised guys on here who have gotten it.  if it is on a part of your penis that is not getting amputated, i would not trust the amputation to cure it. What does it mean the ls was gone ? So their Penises looked like they never even had the disease? Or just that it did not got any worse which for me are totally different things. Sorry for the questions but I thought this disease is uncureable and will get worse with time even with medication/circumcision and the meds are just for slowing the process of the disease. \n\nIt would be so awesome to stop the disease or even heal the damaged skin. This would give me hope. Thanks a lot for your response But I ask myself what happend to people who got the disease and then got circumcised. And if this cures the disease even if the glans is effected It faded to the point of barely visible and for 10years they had no recurrence Hi. I think you really need to have further discussion with your doctor.\n\n Circumcision is viewed as curative NOT because it removes the damaged tissue on the foreskin but because it removes the conditions ie. exposure to trapped urine under the foreskin which appears to trigger LS in sensitive individuals. Accordingly this treatment will work on LS on the glans as well. \n\nI would strongly recommend you discuss this properly with you doctor and explore non surgical solutions first before opting for surgery. \n\nI wish you all the best. I have exactly the same concern. Now that ls is on the glans, does the circumcision cures it? Circumcision could help the problem on your foreskin, but you would still have it on your glans, though I imagine it would be less severe. However, there are less invasive options to loosen your foreskin such as preputioplasty and stretching. With LS the stretching takes a lot longer than it does for a man without it, but that makes each little milestone a big deal. I was able to pull it back while flaccid regularly by 16, could get it just past the head while erect by 18, and I am continuing to stretch. If you are in the US, it can be hard to find a doctor who performs preputioplasty, but it is definitely something to look into if you want a less radical option. Of course, steroid cream is also very important. I use betamethasone 0.1% cream and it works wonders on the inflammation and I can sometimes go a week or longer without any white spots. My foreskin actually is pretty okay (only a very mild phimosis/ tightness). My biggest concern is the ugly white spot on my glans and I want it to go away. What exactly do you mean you can go for a week or longer without any white spots ? Do they disappear when you put the cortisol cream on ? Thank you very much Yes, and you would be prescribed betamethasone, which is something like 30 times stronger than cortisol cream. You might see them reappear if you irritate the skin or disrupt the microbiome by doing something like using soap under the foreskin, but your skin will generally look healthier and masturbation hurts less/feels better because the foreskin can actually roll back. There is indeed hope for doing much more than just slowing down or stoping the progress of the disease! \n\nI was personally able to reverse my pigment loss and heal all other damage caused by LS with the use of a simple home-made plant-based salve that I described in a detailed post here in the LS group last night. Are you saying that the common cause of male LS is urine remaining under the foreskin? I would love to learn more about it. I got it at 28 so seems rather strange That is amazing actually. I have had it for around 3 years or so and I have never noticed the itching or irritation. Just progressive white scarring. Is that uncommon? Is it possible that preventative measures could be taken to reverse it by pulling the foreskin back when urinating? Drying thoroughly and then washing it well each day? Mine is on the frenulum and few spots round the tip The preventative measures you describe are, according to my dermatologist, very important, along with using a barrier moisturiser inside and out,  to assist in recovery and reduces the chances of it reoccurring however you will also need steroid treatment to put the disease into remission as these measures are unlikely to do that on their own. The current mainstream view is that retained urine is the most likely cause in susceptible individuals. Susceptibility includes autoimmune diseases like arthritis, psoriasis, thyroid however not all men with LS display these disease so there are probably other factors at work. Fundamentally, the disease is not well understood", "Vulvar biopsy experience? i went and got a 4th opinion on lichen sclerosis. 2 docs have said they see symptoms, 1 said no. i have hsv and struggle differentiating prodromal symptoms vs lichen symptoms. When the 4th doc looked at it today, she said i look pretty normal aside from perennial fissures that I get from intercourse. She recommended the biopsy to give me a clear answer but i was not prepared for that today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan someone detail their experience with the vulvar biopsy?\n\nI have had cervical biopsies before and one of my doctors said the vulvar biopsy is a worse experience! I had this experience and I am not going to lie it was painful! But it was only for like 30 seconds and then it was over. I was a little sore for the rest of the day but it was not too bad. \n\nIt sucks to have to do, but it is worth it to have the answer. Just try not to build up the fear of the biopsy in your head too much! The biopsy is rough and five years later I still feel that the scar from the biopsy is a frequent site of lichen inflammation. As a physician, I would personally not undergo the biopsy again. If two docs see classic signs, I would go with that and try the treatments. If things do not get better, you can always pursue a biopsy later for a more definite diagnosis. I was diagnosed and had one done about 2 weeks ago and did it the same day they suggested I should do it. Honestly, it freaking hurt. I was not expecting that amount of pain from the \u201cit will just be a quick sting and pinch\u201d they told me it would be. Ask for topical numbing before they do the syringe numbing. The Vulva is so sensitive that the needle piercing the tissue down there is very painful. I wish I had time to prepare and ask for topical but I did not. I am just like you, I do not really have any symptoms besides getting small cuts and tears down there after sex, occasionally I will feel slightly irritated and itchy. I mentioned this during my annual Pap smear and somehow my doctor knew i had it and did a biopsy that same day. Also, I was very uncomfortable the rest of the day once the numbing wore off. Wear loose clothing and no panties to the appointment and for a few days after. Good luck! Do not be afraid to do it just ask for topical numbing first, I wish I had known that was an option! Same!!! just tears after sex and occasional irritation/itchiness which i figured might just be from HSV. \n\nthanks for the topical tip!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave you had sex since treatment? Did you still tear? the doc was concerned about going through with steroid treatment b.c it could be something other than LS. \n\nThe only section that looked suspicious enough to biopsy from is the perineum/vaginal opening... so that will fucking suck :( I had a punch biopsy and I will not lie, that shit hurt! I could not pee for days! It burned and it felt exactly like what it sounds like, someone took a hole out of my vulva area. The only way I could pee was to either sit in a tub of warm water or too spray myself with water and go at the same time. This lasted days! I have a 13 year old, vaginal delivery, and I had to do the same thing with him. I was not expecting that. However, I was having a really bad flare at the same time so I am not sure if that made it much worse? But she did not prepare me for what I experienced. I do not know if that is the same thing they are recommending for you. \n\nThe shitty thing was I had already been told I had LS years before. I had moved, needed a script so found a new doc. She did not seem to believe me that it was LS and said it is just not common at my age (bs, I felt she wanted to torture me). So she wanted to confirm the dx and she did the biopsy. Yea it was LS like I told her! \n\nGood luck! Just had mine monday, the shot hurt pretty badly for a few seconds and I needed to hold her hand, but the biopsy scrape itself was fine. My doc said I bled a little more than expected from the lidocaine shot instead of the biopsy...\n\nI was in a lot of pain monday but an icepack and aleve got me through. Was back to gymming yesterday but taking it easy the rest of the week.... They told me to keep applying vaseline/aquaphor to the area so that is what I am doing! Bit of pain when i use the bathroom still though, I will have to try the water bottle trick!!! I have been using a estradiol/testosterone cream my doctor gave me and have not had any tears since but I have also been a lot more paranoid and making sure to use lube every time. I find myself worrying about it a lot during sex since being diagnosed :/ hopefully that gets better for me cause it kind of kills the mood. I guess I should be grateful that my condition is mild and not as bad as some people have it. I got a biopsy on my labia minora, just to the side of the entrance, and one on my opposite inner thigh. This was late December.\nThe doctor and nurse performing the procedure were super nice and helped me to relax.\nWhat they did for me was go through all my details with me, confirming I knew what was going to happen.\nI lay down on the chair and my legs got put into the stirrup-y things, then they hiked the chair up so I was at sitting eye level or so.\nI got the local anaesthetic done and honestly that was the worst part. Real stingy and knuckle biting.\nIt worked quickly though which was nice.\nProcedure was painless. I felt a tugging sensation but it was not sore.\nGot stitched up, I got dissolvable ones. They felt weird cause I could feel the thread being pulled through but again no pain.\nI got brought back down and nurse took me to a little room so I could get changed back into my clothes.\n\nAnaesthetic wore off maybe three or so hours after I think? Pain was an achy/throbbing sensation.\nWas not allowed to shower or get it wet for 24 hours.\nI got little plasters put on the sites so I could pee, etc.\nAfter they came off peeing sucked, it was stingy unless I like, hunched over on the toilet.\n\nI had pain on the sites if they caught or were dragged across my clothing. But paracetamol did the trick for lessening the pain.\nI think my stitches took just over two weeks to come out.\nGot my results maybe six weeks or so after I want to say. Confirmed LS.\n\nScar wise you cannot tell on my labia. I joked with the doctor that any scar would just be a small fold/line amongst a jumble of other folds. Leg wise they biopsed a lump which was caused from itching. I have a small scar there but it is not noticeable unless you are right up in my business.\n\nHope this helps! I had one last year. It was not horrible. The only pain was the lidocaine injection and that lasted only a couple of seconds. It was a very sharp pinch. After that it was numb and I did not feel the biopsy punch--just a little pressure. \n\nIt stung for about a week after whenever I put the triple antibiotic ointment on but then got better rapidly. I cannot feel a scar or anything. \n\nHonestly the thought of an injection into my sensitive parts was the worst thing about it and probably made the actual lidocaine injection seem worse than it was. wait, you were positive for LS and they are treating you with estradiol instead of steroids?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe doc said it might not be LS and it might just be lacking estrogen- which could be causing the tears during sex. So she said i could try estradiol cream for now and see if that works Yes she prescribed me it the same day we did the biopsy, being I was diagnosed. She said to try it out to help me be more comfortable and it is helped a lot. I had a vulvar biopsy in July of 2018 and honestly it was pretty painful but still manageable. \n\nFirst they numbed the area with some lidocaine (I think) then they used a needle to give me a shot to numb it even further which was a little painful but no more than just any other shot. When they scraped for some skin samples I was so numb that I really did not feel anything other than some pressure. The entire process took maybe 10 minutes altogether. It was mostly pain-free. \n\nI think the most painful part was probably the healing process. I think you do bleed a bit during the biopsy but I did not feel it. My OBGYN used a black substance to stop the bleeding and she told me not to be scared if anything black came off when I went home. After I stopped feeling numb and sore, I could feel the pain from the wound which would hurt a little every time I peed. I would say it was just a small sting every now and then. Definitely try to wear comfortable underwear and pants because wearing denim shorts did not help me at all. It hurt for about 3-4 days which my OBGYN said was normal, but if the pain persist for like a week and there is mysterious discharge or an odor or anything I would get it checked out because it can get infected. Good luck and stay brave because it did hurt a bit but once I got through it I thought to myself \u201cwow men could NEVER do something like this!\u201d HAHA so you use that instead of steroids ? interesting, my doc made it seem that estradiol cream was to treat lack of estrogen and steroids is to treat LS, they are 2 different conditions Yes but it also has testosterone so I am not sure? It is worked for me so far, I have a follow up apt soon so I will see if she changes anything. Hi,I. was reading through this thread.im worried because I have problems in the same area,lower area of vaginal entrance. I may be getting a biopsy done. Did you go through it after all? I had a biopsy done a couple years ago because my doctors would not believe me. They numbed the area and took the biopsy... It was a little uncomfortable, but it honestly did not really hurt all that much. More like a pinch, and afterwards, I did not feel it much. I think because the area he took the biopsy from was so far gone, I had little feeling there anyway. no :/ maybe some day did they use topical lidocaine or via injection? They injected me. I had mine last year. Got the shot which was not fun, though I handle pain decently so I did not react too much. Was a double punch (one on each side). My Dr explained as he went along... I do remember sitting was uncomfortable once the meds wore off. Do not remember much else besides having an ice pack helped. I am sure peeing was a nuisance, but using a spray bottle helps (have used it when I scratched too much and broke skin - which is not difficult with lichen sclerosis to begin with). I had a biopsy and doc was checking for psoriasis. she mentioned doing it again and I am like already had it. Horrible. HORRIBLE. Sitting hurt. Peeing hurt. Overall not fun", "Tired of gynos 20f When your gyno will not do a biopsy because he states your too young to have LS. My girlfriend had the same issue, she was very young when they diagnosed her, but it took multiple doctors before one of them finally figured it out.\n\nThey kept sending her home saying yeast infections were the issue. Apparently it was so bad, when we moved away and I wanted her to setup a new doctor, she would drive four hours to see her old doctor because he was the only one she trusted.\n\nThe point I am trying to make, you are not alone, she is had LS since her early 20s and you should not give up. I hope this helps. Have you tried seeing a dermatologist? I do not understand why they would not biopsy just to rule it out even. My gyno suspected I had LS, and thankfully she sent me for a biopsy anyway because it turned out I do not even have it. Keep pushing! I am so sorry you are going through this, I really hope you can find someone who listens. \ud83d\udc95 My life too exact position Children have LS. Definitely worth a second opinion is that is his only reason Go to a derm! I have had mine since I was a teenager, that is bullshit. Also, I never go to male doctors. They never treat me well or respectfully as a 23f. Really I feel like females gyno are terrible they go way to rough and they expect my vagina to be normal I had to get a cyst drained and she put Novocain down there and as soon as she was done with the Novocain she was cutting she did not wait for it to even kick in, and another time I had bartholin cysts and she took her finger and fill force poked the glands(very tender) they expect my vagina to be exactly like theirs Right! Yeah I am trying to find someone else. I am a type one diabetic which is an auto immune disorders. They just do not know much about LS and think people who have menopause only get it Oh goodness, she sounds like a horrible doctor. I have had experiences with male doctors always dismissing my concerns, esp my LS as a yeast infection- it happened four times.\n\nI do rely on reviews from both my insurance provider's website as well as google when looking for a doctor, I hope you can find someone nicer and more gentle! Being 27, I think that is why I was undiagnosed for so long *screams into pillow*\n\nRegardless of whether or not it ends up being LS, I hope that you get the care that you need! Amen and Thank you so much", "Is anyone having a decent sex life? I am about two years into my diagnosis (40F). Very recently had stem cell and will report back the results after a few months. But in the meantime, I am starting to fear I am never going to want to have sex again. \n\nMy clitoris is buried, I feel almost nothing. I would love to have my clitoris back but I am not sure even that would solve the issue. My sex drive is non-existant. It is not super painful (yet) but I just have no desire. My husband is understanding but I can sense he is frustrated (who would not be). If it carries on like this, it will destroy my relationship. \n\nIs there anyone with LS who is having a decent sex life? If so, what is your secret? Mine\u2019s okay. I am about 7 years into my diagnosis (30 years old), married 7 years also. \n\nFirst, sending you a big hug. I am so sorry you are going through a difficult time. I understand totally if this is not what you want to hear, but accepting my diagnosis as part of my life\u2014 forever\u2014 completely changed my marriage. I was diagnosed around the same time as I was married but the problems did not start to get really bad until a few years in. I have to imagine that unfortunately they will probably continue to get worse as more years go by, but who is to say that it cannot also get better? Like your stem cell treatment!!! I hope that works! Anyway, no one knows, but accepting that it probably will not change was fundamental in healing my relationship.\n\nI also have really struggled with desire despite my husband being attractive and being attracted to him. Whether it is the mental block that comes with the memory of painful waves of flares or the simple hormonal square dance that is constantly happening in my body, I just rarely ever want it. We have had to work really hard and communicate a lot to find creative ways to keep things interesting. Most of the things that have helped me are mental shifts or habits for myself: being in touch with and appreciative of my body through solo movement, yoga, or exercise; understanding that my low desire is neither my fault nor a reflection of my love for my spouse and making sure he understands the same (therapy can help with this conversation if it is available to you); there is so much more to sex and pleasure than just the kinds that are painful for me; learning how to get more pleasure from my partner\u2019s pleasure; SCHEDULING SEXUAL ACTIVITY (!!!!) this advice made me cringe the first few times I heard it but actually setting a time and a place that recurs weekly can be really helpful and the simple act of holding that time as sacred and ENJOYING that time for whatever it is will hack your brain into wanting it). There is probably more I could say and things in my bedroom are not perfect, but we are happy. \n\nIn my own experience, my relationship did suffer when my husband and I did not communicate. I never felt like I got enough empathy from him, he always felt like he was doing something wrong because I always turned him down. I personally was also not making much of an effort to fix our sex life because I just did not effing feel good. And it made me mad that my husband seemed cold when I needed some dang support! It is rough. I totally get where you are coming from. We got brutally honest. He was brave enough to reflect and tell me what kinds of non-penetrative sex would be satisfying for him, and I thought hard about what non-penetrative sex I would be willing to engage in (knowing that I probably would not reach climax! Knowing that I probably would not feel like doing it!!!!) and I treated it like a chore, but a fun chore, like pouring yourself a nice drink after work. We slowly found things we could do in the bedroom that did not require me to do something painful. We have been trying new things! The conversations are always a little awkward but trying new things or things you think might be \u201cless\u201d enjoyable can actually turn out to be really fun and has increased our intimacy. Lower your expectations. Keep it light. Laugh!\n\nMost of all, just be honest with each other. You deserve that. There is no right or wrong way, just the way of hard work and communication to figure out what works for both of you. You can get through this and you are not alone. Sending you a lot of light. Pm me! I used something called Thymosin Alpha from a Bio Identical Hormone company. It cured my LS. My sex drive is also non existent and my boyfriend feels the same way as your husband. I also feel exactly the same :( How long did you use it for? 10days 20 units 2x day. Injected into stomach.", "No patches but scarring? I am here asking some questions before my doctors appointment as it is a little while away. I have a whole lot of scarring that kind of look like tree roots just in my clitoral hood, it started on one side but has now fully involved the skin around my clit. They look like veins or tree roots and are very itchy.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Lichen Sclerosis is really the only thing that has come up with all of my googling. Could it be varicose veins? I do not believe so they definitely feel like scars and are pure white. This is how mine started! I did not get patches of white skin except around my mouth I had two small areas which I thought was just dry skin and I would apply lotion to it. But yeah, my skin cracked really bad and caused those weird tree like looking scars. I use CeraVe hydrating cleanser on it and it is gone now. (My dermatologist said it is safe to use on your vag as a feminine wash even though it is a face wash) it went away pretty quick once I started treatment. Thank you so so much! Okay I am glad I am not going mad and thinking it is probably this then ok thank you. The steroid or whatever it is cream that the Dr prescribed helps with scarring - the issue with LS and why it can be connected to cancer, something with how our cells react to scarring, creates an overabundance of something that is similar to how cancer develops (obviously I am not a doctor, doctors have explained this to me and I have tried to simplify so I can make sense of it and not freak the f out). As much as websites say that LS can cause cancer - my doctors have assured me that it does not happen often unless the scarring and flare-ups go untreated for a long time. ANYWAYS the prescribed cream helps prevent this from occurring, during flare ups, use it daily, and when things are good - just once a week or so. They have also recommended that during regular days, use something like vaseline or coconut oil (one recommended a specific brand apparently made for vaginal PH - Cleo by Damiva) as a labial moisturizer to make sure the skin is healthy and less likely to tear.", "URGENT advice needed please! How to stop reabsorption? I have suspected I had lichen sclerosis for a few months. Doctor tested for STIs and everything which all came back negative, so she suggested I come back in if I start have symptoms again (initially cleared up). \n\nThe vulva skin near my entrance is lightening and I am experiencing itching as well. On the side where the itching and slight pain has been worse, it looks like my labia minora is shrinking :(. So almost definitely LS.\n\nI am out of state for the holidays and my doctor cannot even be reached until Monday. It is probably going to be difficult to speak to any doctor about this since it is not an emergency. I am freaking out. Is there anything I can do to keep the shrinking from getting worse? And is that part of my labia just gone now. \n\nWhat a Christmas present. I am really emotional right now and would just really appreciate any support or advice on what I can do to slow things down until I speak with my doctor.", "Freaking out about possible tumor (picture included) Hi, female, 24 years old, 5\u20197, 115 pounds? (51kg)\n\nI have been having random spasms on the left side of the vulva and found a mass on the vestibular area. It looks like a bag of clear fluid cells (in the picture at green)\n\nI have been looking at so many images online and I have seen so many scary stories and names of tumors and it looks like a soft part sarcoma of the vagina or a clear cell sarcoma or adenocarcinoma\n\nI do not know what to do. I can only be seen by a gynecologist in weeks and I am panicking. Is it too much to wait for?\n\nShould I rush to the hospital? I am freaking out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you really think it is a tumor i would personally find a hospital to go to as soon as possible. Even if it is just to put your mind at ease. I believe with tumors it is best to find it as soon as possible so you can start treatment. Hope it turns out to be something that is not bad \ud83d\udc9b Health anxiety is a real thing, if it will put your mind at ease, go to the ER. Also, can you please mark this NSFW?\n\nGood luck and I hope it is nothing serious! Thank you so much for your answer. I do not think this is just health anxiety. That would be the best diagnosis at this point. Does it look like a tumor to you? If it were you in this position, would you rush to the er? Again, thank you for your answer I vote for going to the ER right away as well. You might not get to see a gynaecologist, but at least someone with proper medical knowledge can put your mind at ease. Weeks of not knowing sounds terrible. We can offer endless tea and sympathy in this sub, but our combined medical knowledge does not amount to much. Good luck! I am not the person to comment on whether it looks like a tumor or not. I have no medical training or experience, so I am going to politely decline to answer you (do not take that in a doomsday kind of way, please!). \n\nPersonally, I would wait to see my gynecologist. In my area at least, the ER would just refer me back to my specialist anyway bc they are not going to do anything for suspected cancer, unless it is something like a giant lump pushing on a vital organ or choking out a vein, etc. BUT, if it would give you some peace of mind bc you took action, then go for it. I just do not know if you can expect any treatment for it at the ER. And because the ER is a triage situation, there is a likelihood you could be waiting for hours and hours and hours (depending upon where you live &amp; how busy they are). The ER simply exists for life or death emergencies. Around here, even with an obvious broken bone, they will not even cast you, they will give you some wonky soft cast and tell you see a specialist ASAP. So, keep that in mind- you may not get any answers, it may make you more anxious/nervous/frustrated, etc. You do not say where you are ?\nIf you are in the UK I would advise going to the ER because the time delay other wise. You do not say how long to wait for gyno ?\n\nIf elsewhere can you call around and get an earlier appointment.  Delay with cancer is not good. I would make an appointment to see my gyno right away. Make sure they know your concerns and try hard to get in within a week. Personally I would not go to the ER. \n\nYou could also try Planned Parenthood if you are in the US and your gyno cannot fit you in right away.\n\nTake some deep breaths. Whatever is going on, you cannot do anything about it right this second. And there are tons of things it could be besides cancer. &lt;3", "Going to tell my parents about my potential lichen sclerosus today I am going to tell my parents (prob my dad) about it today and ask that he book an appointment with a urologist. I want to make sure to catch it early since I heard that treating it early is the best way to deal with scaring. I also may have some fused glans/skin bridges. \nI am quite nervous about this so wish me luck haha!\n\nI am also open to suggestions on how to tell him about it.\n\nThank you so much.\nI owe this community so much so thank you again. It is your dad - if he cares about you, he cares about your penis. He might want to send you to a pediatrician first, or he might need to get a referral. \n\nI suggest approaching it as \u201cprofessionally\u201d as possible. Use medical words like urethra and urinate, rather than something like \u201cmy dick burns when I pee\u201d. It will be awkward for you. It will be awkward for him. But it makes it easier to be precise and soldier on through the awkwardness. Avoid euphemisms with parents or doctors. \n\nAnother thought - do not assume it is LS. LS is not common. You are going to get asked about sexual activity, embarrassing or not, because it is far more common for a teen (I am guessing?) to contract an STI than it is for them to develop an autoimmune disease. It is also common for young men to injure themselves in masturbation - the older men all know it because they used to be young men. For every one of them looking at you saying \u201care you SURE you did not do something like ,\u201d do not get mad. Just know that they are asking because they probably did it themselves, or they thought about it. Just respond with a yes or a no, because none of those questions are about you personally. \n\nSo, keep an open mind if your dad suggests a different doc first, or does not believe it is necessarily LS. Long as he is willing to hear your concerns and take appropriate steps to treat them, it is good. And a doc may go off in an entirely different direction than you expect, so do not go in telling them you read about this in the internet and you definitely have it. You might! But you might not. In fact, just by the odds? You probably do not.  Fingers crossed. \n\nBest of luck. Be proud of yourself for taking steps to care for your body. I hope you get the answers and treatment you need promptly! I am not sure what STI it could be as the symptoms I have are white, cleari-sh glans. It does not really itch and there is nothing white on my foreskin. I think I also have frenulum breve though. Thanks for the helpful advice! Maybe just say you have a rash or something that concerns you and get diagnosed bf talking about LS. When diagnosed I had a biopsy and was tested for HPV, herpes, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. All negative. LS is not contagious and not caused by sex. Best of luck xo Thanks for the advice! Update: Doctor said that my penis looked fine and did not have any discoloration (even though I still think it looks rly white). She pulled apart my skin bridges since they were not too tight yet. I hope she is not wrong about the diagnosis, but so far I do not have lichen sclerosis. Hey, that is the best news. Hope pulling them apart was not too painful. Doc has seen a bunch of penises and you have probably seen, uh, fewer - believe her when she says you are normal!\n\nGood for you getting that taken care of. That was really fast!! Thanks for all the kind words!\n\nP.S. are u assuming I have only seen my own penis..... jk Fewer than the doc, anyway\u2026 but it is the internet and a terrible place to make assumptions, I suppose. \n\nI have a teenage son, so I am now sticking my fingers in my ears and saying \u201cNYA NYA NYA NYA NYA CANNOT HEAR YOU\u201d. :-) 62 penises is my current record\n\nThis is an obvious joke for anyone that for some reason actually believes this. Yes I have only seen my own penis. Congratulations! Happy for you. Thank you!", "My wife is diagnosed with ls. Any recommendations on how she can enjoy sex ever again? Or are there methods or toys that would work for her? I cannot recommend the water based lube \u201cslippery stuff\u201d enough. Also, her using a barrier cream like desitin or aquaphor on her vulva/opening of vagina can help tearing. Also, avoid ANYTHING with latex or glycerin, it can be an even bigger problem for some people (might as well test it to rule it out and if it has no effect you can implant things like condoms and glycerin lubes back into sex)\n\nAgain, avoiding lube with glycerin was the most important step into me being able to have sex again. Ask her Dr about Thymosin Alpha. It cured mine. \n\nHi, OP. I think that is a question you should encourage your wife to ask here if she is interested. I would be more than happy to weigh in, and I know others would as well. But you are not going to know exactly what questions (or follow-up questions) to ask, since it is her mind/body. \n\nThere can be a huge mental component to sex with LS for many people, myself included. I will share my story, and maybe that will give you some insight. \n\nI was having pain during sex before my LS diagnosis came. At that point, I was just diagnosed with vaginismus/vulvodynia, which is often what they tell you you have when they cannot find any other reason for the pain. \n\nThe pain would usually get worse after I orgasmed, which meant I would cum and then it would start hurting pretty severely, but I felt bad stopping the sex because my partner had not cum yet, so I would suffer through it. This was exactly the wrong thing to do. (And I honestly kind of resent that my partner was okay with it, tbh.) All it did was reinforce in my brain that sex = pain. That causes subconscious tensing up of the muscles whenever sex is imminent, which causes even more pain. It is a vicious cycle. For me, the first step to overcoming this mental hurdle was to never, ever continue if it started hurting. I also talked to my partner and we agreed that I would be the only one to initiate sex. (His initiating triggered my worry about satisfying him/his expectations and caused me to tense up during sex. Then I would continue anyway, which would hurt more and further reinforce \u201csex = pain, and my partner needs sex,\u201d causing a vicious cycle.) That was years ago, and to this day, I am still the only one to initiate sex, and I suspect it will continue forever. I realize this may feel counterintuitive for the partner, but I asked my partner to trust that I would make sex a priority in our relationship, and we usually have sex about 3-4 times a month, which is a doable middle ground for us personally. \n\nThat is the mental aspect. But there is also very real physical issues that can still cause pain even if the mental issues are totally resolved. For me, solving the physical problems meant: 1) solving the immediate problem so we could start doing what I described above. For me, this meant using numbing ointments my doctor prescribed. My doctor helped me determine the specific spots on my body that were sensitive to pain (mine was one external spot and one internal spot). She then prescribed me two different lidocaine ointments/liquids to apply to those spots before having sex. This numbs the painful areas so you cannot feel them. Note: I often still bled (and later hurt) after sex even though I was not feeling that pain during sex. So you still have to be very gentle, especially since she cannot feel if you are damaging her. And 2) adequately treating my LS. I had to try lots of different protocols until I found what worked. This included different types of steroids and different frequencies. My doctor helped me with this. It took a couple of years, tbh. \n\nAll of these things have drastically helped. On top of that, we have recently begun using CBD lube/arousal oil, which I have found to be hugely effective at cutting out the last bit of lingering pain and helping my body relax. \n\nI wish you all the best, and I hope this gives you some insight. LS is really terrible, and having pain during sex is the fucking worst. I would strongly encourage you not to ask your wife to put up with any pain in order to get off. It just makes things worse. Ultimately it needs to be up to her to decide sex is important to her, because she is got to be the one holding the reins, ime. Please do feel free to show her my suggestions above, though. It is hard, but there is hope. She is more than welcome to direct message me if she is more comfortable with that and has any follow-up questions. Based on what?  I do not see any research at all regarding that treatment with ls. Based on the fact that I took it and it worked lol. First off, please take everything u/ionlyjoined4thecats said to heart.  The information I am providing I consider to be in addition to what u/ionlyjoined4thecats already said.  \n\n\n\nReducing the impact of LS over time *may* help.  One thing that helps me immensely is using a handheld sprayer in the toilet (like SonTiy available on Amazon, but there are cheaper ones that are made of plastic in the same style).  Urine exposure can exacerbate symptoms, so cleaning the vulva after urinating can go a long way to it not being so bad.  \n\n\n\nShe should be on Clobetisol, starting with daily application and then weaning down to twice per week for maintenance.  If she cannot use Clob, there are other treatments that can help.  She needs a doctor who can diagnose and prescribe treatment if she is not already being treated.  \n\n\n\n\nIn between Clob doses, she could use something like Aloe (as close to natural as possible, avoid additives) or coconut oil to further reduce discomfort.  \n\n\n\nTaking steps to reduce symptoms can help improve quality of sexual experience.  In addition, my husband often uses a lubricated condom, which feels better for me with LS than raw even with lube.  This varies among LS sufferers, so the two of you would have to experiment to find what, if anything, works for her.  A small vibrator designed just to touch the clitoris might help since it does not need to be rubbed on the skin to reach orgasm.  \n\n\n\nThere is no guarantee that your wife will enjoy sex again.  These things that we can try are not a guarantee.  I rarely enjoy sex anymore and it can be very painful to try.  It sucks.  It sucks for you and it sucks for your wife even more.  Some of these things may help, but you have to be ready for the possibility that they will not be enough because there is a pretty good chance that they will not. Firstly, in order to respond to somebody, you need to click \"reply\" under their comment.  Secondly, your doctor did not prescribe a treatment based on \"I took it and it worked\".  I am asking on what your doctor based his or her choice to give you that particular treatment. I go through a Hormone clinic online for other issues. It was provided to me for a reset. It happen to fully cure my LS. But when you do research on it It is for Auto Immune function so therefore it makes sense that it would work for LS as its an Auto Immine Disease. Hi, \n\nI am sorry your wife is dealing with LS, it can be really awful. I do not think your sex life is over, but it may need to pause. Give her time to heal and use her steroid ointment. Borax baths and estrogen cream can further help heal up the skin. After a couple months of all this, use a very good lube like coconut oil, CBD lube by foria, slippery stuff, uberlube, YES WB/OB, etc and go slow. If there is pain, stop and give her more time. With proper treatment she should be fine! \nI am currently using stem cell therapy and it has helped improve my sex life immensely. It is very expensive and cost 6300$ but it is worth it. I was able to have completely pain free sex without this therapy but boy does it help with everything else!!!! Good luck to you and your wife! I really promise it will get better &gt;I was able to have completely pain free sex without this therapy but boy does it help with everything else!!!! \n\nWhat do you mean by this? Also, our sex life will have been on 100% pause for 4 years this September. I had a stem cell lift by Dr Nathan Newman. It really really helped my LS, and I am not even fully recovered from it. I do not burn, My skin is full and healthy, I look like I never had LS. I have talked to many many women who had success and read his extensive reviews and it seemed like my best option. I am only 23 and did not want to be plagued by this for the rest of my 20s. There is also a procedure called a TULIP ($4000 USD) that has helped a lot of women.  I know it is extremely expensive but anything is worth being free from LS. \n\n(\n\n(", "I am not sure what I have.. (21F) 2 weeks ago my outer left labia had a small patch which was around 1 by 1cm.  It was quite itching for a few days but then not anymore.  \n\nI was so worried because the colour was lightpink and seemed kind of white not sure if this is because of the scaling. \n\nI called the doctor a week ago after waiting a week and she said it may be a fungal skin infection and told me to use miconazole. \n\nI have been using it for a week now and dont see much result of my skin turning normal. And called the doctor again told the same story and she said it can take a couple of weeks to see results. \n\nMy current state is that the skin is still light pink quite a few tones lighter than surrohnding skin and it itches one or two times a day for a few minutes then it goes away. Texture wise it looks dry but feels normal. \n\nI am so stressed because im not sure what is wrong. Any ideas.. Just to rule other possibilities out have you had checks for STIs? If it is lichen sclerosus there is a high chance it will not go away. I have had mine 5 years and it only seems to get worse even with medication. \n\nDid the doctor not ask you to go in so they could do a physical examination? I would be demanding one xx I will call next week and give it a extra week perhaps its fungal. \n\nI have not been sexually active so dont think its STI \n\nAtm really hating myself of being so stressed and worried Please try not to stress about it because stress can make it worse. Have you got psoriasis or any other auto immune conditions? X No i never had any skin conditions in my life or illnesses which makes me worried even more since I cant find a cause.  \n\nI did remove hair 3 weeks ago at the exact same spot where the patch is using a tweezer. Do you perhaps know if its possible its a fungal skin infection and it will take some time..\n\nI dont have much symptoms other then that it looks weird. \nThroughout the day I forget about it since it doesnt itch.", "tired possible tw this stupid disease has messed up my mental health more than it already was. i was already dealing with suicidal ideation daily and now that i experience physical pain that is chronic i just feel helpless. it is as if the universe wants me to kill myself. i cant catch a break anywhere. i cant even get a boyfriend or have sex because of this stupid disease. i hate it so much. i am only 19 and i feel like my life\u2019s over.", "Do you think it is LS?  Possibly.

What condition do you have?", "Also just diagnosed... so many questions Hi all - I have also just been diagnosed and started on a steroid cream.  Well my biopsies have been sent to the lab so the diagnosis isnt confirmed but the dermatologist seemed pretty sure.  \n\nThe thing is, I spent less than 15 minutes with him and was completely taken by surprise with this diagnosis so I could not even really ask questions.  I am also so exhausted and often have a low grade headache.  Is that related? If so, what helps?  I have the worst brain fog too.  I forget what I am doing in the middle of doing it! \n\nThanks in advance - I am so glad to have found this group!\n\nSusan I would go back to ask more questions. I have not heard of exhaustion or headache being part of it, though I am not a doctor. But it is too bad you could not ask more questions, I hope you get the chance to ask them.\n\nIf the steroid works for itching/pain then maybe that is a confirmation but it will be good to have the biopsy just to make sure. I think it is likely we will eventually link this more firmly to other autoimmune issues, but we are not there yet. \n\nI was having a big flare and had an eye doc appt in the middle. Eyes have always been fine but they suddenly quit tolerating contact lenses. Doc pulls back in surprise after looking at eyes and starts asking if I have any \u201cother\u201d autoimmune issues, are they flared. Uhhhh ... yes? ....\n\nBrain fog and fatigue and headaches, oh my. File that in with an inexplicably high c-reactive-protein on my bloodwork and no, I am not making it up, there is definitely a whole body inflammatory thing going on between the knees and my eyes, with LS in between. It comes. It goes. It waxes. It wanes. \n\nAll I know to do is eat well, rest, drink water, meditate, take magnesium and vitamin D, breathe deeply, get outside a lot, play with animals, and go for walks - those things help. Yeah, something is definitely not working for my body sometimes. Husband? Kids? Job? Climate? Old traumas? Diet? Allergies? Dunno. Dunno how to fix it either. Fighting it and trying harder to perfect it away does not work.  \n\nI do suspect it will fall under general autoimmune stuff, but until we better understand the mechanisms that trigger it, best thing you can probably do is take care of you in general, and take it easy through the flares. I have never heard or linked the connection if any, but I am diagnosed &amp; also suffer from fatigue and headaches. People with hypothyroidism are more likely to have LS, and hypothyroidism can have brain fog as a symptom, so you might get your thyroid checked if you have other thyroid symptoms, though likely it is unrelated and you are fine. Maybe make sure you are eating well and consider a multivitamin. Other issues can cause brain fog as well (for example, vitamin b12 deficiency). i was diagnosed recently after suffering for 2 years, im so exhausted most days i have to take a nap even after sleeping 10+ hours at night. i am at my wits end, i cannot keep living like this i am miserable. i had to quit my job because i have no energy", "What on earth is fusing, adhesions, and resorption? Hey Friends.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed over 3 and a half years ago, I was super confused by all the medical terminology out there. Sifting through medical papers in order to understand your disease can be super overwhelming, so I have started a terminology series on YouTube to help break down the terms of LS and what it entails. Today I uploaded a video on fusing and resorption. If you are interested in checking this out, you can watch the video here: ( Thanks for this Jaclyn :) My pleasure!  so so helpful! thank you! pleasure!", "Recurring yeast infections Hey! So a little over a month ago I was diagnosed with LS and prescribed mometasone cream to use and while it is been really helpful for my LS symptoms it gives me yeast infections. I never had any before starting the steroid treatment and now I am on my 3rd one. The doctor prescribed me diflucan which works, but a week or two later I get a new yeast infection. I know steroids increase your chance of getting yeast infections but is there anything I can do to make them less likely? I also started using the Cerave cleanser but I am starting to worry that it might be increasing my chances of yeast infection. Are you using the correct CeraVe cleanser? There are two kinds. One that is called hydrating cleanser and the other is foaming cleanser. They have different consistencies and one has alcohol in it. You want to be sure you are using the hydrating cleanser, kind of looks like semen if I am being honest. Second, are you using wet wipes? If so, stop. I noticed that wet wipes would give me yeast infections. (It can also spread the LS to your butthole- according to my dermatologist) and if you are having sex, make sure you did not give the YI to your partner bc he could just be passing it back to you. I am sorry you are having a YI on top of your LS. Sounds really painful Vaginal probiotics (oral dose) can have a big impact on bacteria and yeast infections. The strains matter. L. crispatus is being studied as particularly effective. It was a pretty noticeable improvement after a week of two daily then I went on maintenance of one a day. I have this problem and I seemed to solve it by making sure I do not use any soap down there, wash everyday with hot water, change my pants twice (if not three times) a day and when I wash my pants I wash them at 60. It has really helped me! Also do not wear tight trousers and make sure you do not keep re-wearing the trousers too much! Keep washing them as much as you can!!! Man I do not go near soap or anything! No cleanser! Only thing that touched me down there is sudocream and steroids! (And my boyfriend lololol) I am using the correct one but I do not really know if it is doing anything for me. I do not use wet wipes and I will get my partner checked. The YI triggers a flare up for me so trying to be careful. Okay I have heard of using probiotics before but I will look into it. Thank you Okay, I have found that if I do not shower every day I am more irritated down there. Thanks for the tip about washing trousers. I have just recently realized what a different wearing something loose or open makes especially when walking around a lot. I do love tight jeans but I cannot wear them for more than a few sedentary hours. Cotton panties are a really really important clothing choice. Do not wear synthetic underwear if you are having yeast/bacteria/uti issues.", "circumsision or not Well i noticed wierd white hard spots around my foreskin i waited a few months to see what it is i can confirm its lichen it formed a white ring around the foreskin making it tight and its getting worse my question is should i get circumsision to avoid future problems . Im afriad it will spread to the glans if i dont get it removed fast.   People that did get circumsision did your lichen dissapear. about the future in general or future for LS.  Yea its all right im just afraid of  no cure or grafts in the long terms and cancer. But its out of my control so i wont worry that much it is what it is. Going to get circumsision as soon as possible but i think if i stretch the skin on the glans and some under the forskin i can see LS but just not as active as this one. I think i had this tight part of the foreskin for a while and it was dry and allitle bit whiteish i guess now it just activated itself.", "Any Males here with Lichen Sclerosus? Iv got a story I want to share.\n\n35 male. I was diagnosed with Lichen Sclerosus on my genitals a few months back by my GP. \n\nI had 2 fairly large white spots that had been around my pee hole for over 18 months and more recently started having whitening on the inside of my forskin which would also sting and have small painful abrasion after sex. Basically it was slowly spreading\n\nAfter reading everything I could online I was pretty confident a cure for the male version was unlikely.\n\nMy wife finally convinced me to go to the GP where they told me what it was and prescribed some topical steroid cream. They also refer me to a urologist for further treatment options.\n\nI received a call from the urologist a few days later and after I said I didnt have private health care they said they said it would be a few $100 for a visit which I was happy to pay. They then said the specialist has seen my referral and that surgery (Circumcision) would be required and a paid for visit was a waste of money and that they should put me on the surgery waiting list asap. \n\nAt this point I said I am not going to even consider the idea of surgery (on my junk) without speaking to a doctor and having them explain to me why they thought this was necessary. I then hung up because I was really upset by the way they were treating me. (Although I had read that circumcision was often required)\n\nI stuck with the steroid ointment for a few weeks and found it cleared up the discomfort however the whiting had not changed at all. \n\nI was told not to keep using the steroid for more than 4 weeks so I stopped and noticed the lack of the moisture layer it provided felt like a step back.\n\nMy whole younger life I had been told to keep my penis dry and washed which I had always done however the penis head is technically a glad and so for years I had been removing the moisture layer from my penis.\n\nThe most gentle neutral moisture cream I know of is QV cream so I started lighting applying it to my penis after showers mainly inside the forskin and under the head. Also, not straight on, just the what is left after rubbing it into my hand so very lightly.  \n\nWithin 2 weeks all the white patches had vanished and penis has never felt in better shape (very sensitive and soft)\n\nI will keep using QV but fingers crossed im cured. Its been 4 weeks and no return of white spots.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to post my story on the odd chance it helps someone.", "Anyone with multiple immune conditions like LS? Hey there, just wonder if anyone else has more than one skin immune based disease? I was diagnosed with Lymphomatoid Papulosis last year, and think I may have LS as well. I am going to see my doctor ofc, but last time I went to my primary care she thought it was just folliculitis. I have been having redness on my skin down there and some white patches on the LS is too. At first I thought it was yeast or irritation from shaving, but it has not gone away. It seems like sometimes it is worse than others. I already have Clobetesol ointment for my other skin condition, so I am not sure if I can use the same one. I have eczema on my head, lichen planus in my mouth, and lichen sclerosis in my genitals. I also have chronic fatigue. It is not unusual for a person to develop multiple autoimmune conditions over time. I had thyroid cancer and also LS, and it is frequently said that autoimmune diseases travel in packs.

I do not think they are immune based though.", "What is the best topical steroid to use for vulval LS? Do you all use clobetasol or do you use something else?  What about Emuaid?  \n\n\n ( I use clotrimazole and betamethasone which is both an anti fungal and steroid in one cream. I like the fact that it has the anti fungal component since I am prone to yeast infections. Scrolling through and saw this a bit late, I have been using emuaid casually on really bad days and it is been great. I use clobatosol nightly and together they make it a lot easier to manage. I like that the Emuaid is not a steroid and after any irritation it can be a lifesaver. Scrolling through and just now saw this, but my experience my be of interest. \n\nFor about a year I was using clobetasol every night because if I skipped a day I would have a flare up. Well, I mentioned that at my gynecologist visit and she told me it is not meant to be used every night? So she switched me to an immunosuppressant called Pimecrolimus? Taking twice a week and working okay. It is apparently the next step that my dr tends to take when clobetasol does not seem to be as effective. It is a more extreme step apparently? Idk, I am kind of concerned overall that my LS is a little worse than it used to be and have been considering posting about it anyway.  \n\nI do not hear about this medicine much on here so I am not sure how common this is. my doctor said it is okay to use every dad but i do have doubts because i have experienced what you have, thanks for sharing", "PRP injections and Intima Laser treatment? Has anyone had this done? Did it make a difference? PRP is the future of LS treatment. It is considered experimental because a lot of research is yet to be published. Consider contacting Dr Francesco Casabona, and if you can, paying him a visit in Italy. He is the man who invented PRP for vaginal and penile LS, he is also very, very cheap compared to others, he wants to help, not profit. If I could afford the time off and travel I would! I have a doctor willing to do PRP and laser, it is about $2000 per treatment, only need 2. Just very nervous about cost effectiveness and healing! Thank you though, that is very reassuring!   I highly doubt 2 will be enough. It is my understanding that after a series of around 10+ to fully treat into remission, and once or twice every year or two for probably the rest of the patients life. Dr Casabona is 400EUR per treatment including taxes, and everything else, including consultation too, with no hidden fees. You could go for a two night trip, hotels there are about 60-70EUR per night. Good luck! I was suggested to start with 2, as I am only 24 years old and been symptomatic since I was 16.

I have used all of the usual steroid creams/ointments for long durations over the years and all of them have had positive results and caused the symptoms of the LS to go into remission, but upon stopping the application it comes back again - so no real help from the NHS dermatologists, and to be quite honest with you I do not think there ever will be.\n\nHaving suffered with LS since the age of 13 (I am 35 now) I decided to give other therapies a go. Besides the steroids I have tried all of the dietary changes that alternative practitioners like to go on and on about (no dairy, no gluten, so on and so forth), all this did was drive me absolutely mental. I cannot say that in my case my LS had any link to my diet. I was tested for gluten insensitivity once and it came back negative. I have taken probiotics for a time and then stopped, and then started again. \n\nThis last year I took the plunge and decided to have a p-shot therapy for my lichen sclerosus. The p-shot is a generic term for blood plasma injections. The treatment cost approximately \u00a3700 (I live in the UK) where I had the procedure done. I am not going to recommend the practitioner openly here but I can assure you that it was/is not based in Harley Street. The full p-shot therapy is about \u00a31200 but as I have a condition we agreed that I take essentially half the strength dose which is spot injected into the foreskin and glans of the penis. My practitioner had experience of treating LS using this therapy but mostly for women. It took me a while of asking around because there are clinics that offer this therapy but a lot of them are for vanity reasons. It is used to increase sensation and erection firmness in men and is used to treat other conditions like peyronie's disease very effectively. My practitioner said that although he did not have much experience treating men he had treated women who had gone on to experience remission of their vaginal LS and get them to the point where they could enjoy sexual intercourse. There was an example of a lady he had treated who could not orgasm and these blood plasma injections had allowed her to achieve orgasm (according to him). I was encouraged to say the least and to be honest I had no other options because I tried everything else and I was not convinced I should have a circumcision as the NHS has never offered my anything but steroid creams or ointments. \n\nThe treatment basically involves a walk in session (about one hour) - do not have any other plans for the day. You lie down on the table where your blood is taken and put through a centrifuge. Meanwhile the practitioner applies some numbing cream to the penis and you lay on the table for about 10-15minutes while the centrifuge separates the blood and the penis numbing cream takes time to work. The practitioner then came back into the room and started the injections, which is done using a small needle. That was it done. The following few hours and evening were not every pleasant as my penis swelled up a little and the injections hurt a little once the numbing cream wore off - it was difficult to sleep that night. The next day all of the pain subsided. The area was sensitive for a couple of days but I could wash the area straight away - I only use mild soaps so this was not a problem. As the weeks went on I started to notice increased sensitivity in the glans of the penis and reduction in the redness/inflammation on the foreskin caused from the LS. The condition continues to improve and I have started gently stretching the opening of the foreskin (phimotic ring) as I have phimosis which makes it difficult to retract the foreskin without pain. This is likely because of the LS. I have gotten to the point where, as of now, I can retract my foreskin comfortably during masturbation and best of all I have actually regained a lot of sensitivity that I had lost and thought I would never get back. Orgasms are noticeably better than they have been in years. \n\nI would say that it has been money well spent and I am considering going back again for a follow up therapy to see if I can make any further progress. I thought I would share this here", "Foreskin constricting and forming \"band\" Diagnosed with LS and starting to see what is best described as a constrictive band when I pull back my foreskin - it squeezes the middle of my penis such that it looks more like an hourglass than a cylinder.  Has anyone else experienced this and can it be treated with clobetasol in the usual way? I could only find one LS paper that mentions \"waisting\" as a symptom of LS, and what I find odd is that this is not the area that is clearly affected by LS - the skin appears otherwise healthy except for the constriction, which is only evident when it is pulled back. The waisting is caused by the tighter phimotic band at the tip of the foreskin being pulled back down the shaft and not stretching as normal. The condition is called phimosis but in this case with a pathological cause.\n\nI experienced the same and found that the Clobetasol was very helpful but not a complete return to my previous state, nonetheless everything is working fine. \n\nPhimosis is often treated with betamethasone and manual stretching however if your LS is active it would result in further micro tears and further scarring/tightening. Discuss this option with your dermatologist. \n\nThis is why urologists often advocate circumcision as high probability cure for LS - urine can no longer get trapped in the foreskin and sensitivity to urine is viewed as a likely cause of penile LS - but also deals with associated pathological phimosis which can make sexual activity very difficult. \n\nI personally view circumcision as a deeply unattractive option although my LS is currently in remission. I wish you all the best Great, thanks so much! Agree with you on the thoughts on circumcision. \n\nI have been treating with clobetasol pretty much up the entire portion of my foreskin that comes into contact with the glans when it is rolled up, but this skin is just outside of that (i.e. still exposed to air when foreskin is rolled up). It must be that the LS has spread to that skin &amp; is causing tightness, but is not yet at the point where the whiteness has become visible. I will expand the application of clobetasol - it seems like this is the very early stages on that patch of skin so hopefully there is a good chance this goes away. Thank you!  Great post dude. You made a really good point about the manual stretching/microtears..  makes sense how that could be counterproductive for LS patients. I never thought of it that way though.  I decided to skip manual stretching and just use topical treatments for my phimosis and that is worked well for me.  Glad to hear it worked well for you also!\n\nAs far as the whole urine thing, I would probably say its viewed as a likely contributong factor not a likely cause.. you get the idea though. My dermatologist put me on Betamethasone for this and I had good results. I also have LS which was undiagnosed at the time. So I was put back on Betamethasone about 18 months later for LS. I would only note that my dermatologist, the leading penile skin disease and LS doctor in the UK/Europe, is absolutely clear that urine is causal in susceptible men. This view is consistent with the vast majority of recent papers on penile LS. I know you are keen on the Borrelia theory, but nothing has been published on that in connection with LS for the last 10+ years and the 2016 paper exploring links with morphea and scleratrophic diseases cites very mixed findings. Anecdotally can say that this is true for me - probably could have delayed the onset, if not avoided the disease entirely, had I kept better hygiene. The biggest cause of urine exposure is not so much basic hygiene as ting leakages post urination where the urethra has not fully drained despite our best effort. I believe the doctors call it micro-incontinence.  Totally not trying to argue here, but the fact that urine exposure is \"causal in susceptible men\" implies that there is some other factor involved in addition to the urine thing which makes men susceptible to developing LS.  I hope I dont sound rude or arguementative.  You have made some great contributions to the discussions here.  Cheers! Ya exactly! That last lingering drip that always takes forever to come out after using the restroom..  \n\nDo you or your doctor(s) have any further insight into the cause of this phenomenon? Since realising recently that I probably have this condition I have realised how little I know about the male anatomy, including my own. I feel like I am 10 years old, my penis is some mysterious foreign land,  I took it granted before when it was working fine.\n\nWhen I have read about the 'band' symptom I am confused about the location. When I pull my foreskin back (which I can still do with relative ease although it is a bit tighter than it ever was)  the skin directly underneath the head is white, all the way around, Is this the 'band' that is referred to in the literature about LS? I have seen other references to a white circle around the tip of the foreskin, which I do not have. I am so bloody confused about all of this. Can definitely relate. My understanding is that it usually originates on the glans/foreskin immediately attached to the glans, and as it progresses it affects more and more foreskin further away from the glans. If it gets far enough down, then the white starts to become visible on the part of the foreskin that is at the tip of your penis when rolled up, which is also what leads to phimosis. This is the \"band\" that is most commonly referred to in the literature. \n\nMine was a bit unusual in that I had a patch midway down the shaft for several years before it showed up in the conventional spot, so it seems like having different symptoms would not necessary exclude LS (though yours does sound like the typical LS presentation).\n\nBy your use of \"probably\", it seems like you do not have a full diagnosis yet, so I would encourage you to get this diagnosed ASAP. If it is LS, it is not something that you want to let progress untreated for any period of time. &gt; the leading penile skin disease and LS doctor in the UK/Europe\n\nCould you share their name? Either publicly or via PM. I am in the UK so particularly interested.", "How do active AFABs deal I am 24 my LS was feeling presymptomatic I was doing so good with it recently, started seeing a new gyno back on clob ect. I started doing the things I love more frequently and now it is like I am always keeping a low level flare in check, which is still an improvement but I was wondering if there are tips and tricks to help me irritate it less when I am doing active things. I go on long hikes (15+miles) rock climb 3x a week, have frequent sex, and run &amp; bike when I have the time. I wear cotton panties bc the stride of my synthetic clothes will go up into my Gooch and cause problems if I go without.

Bc so active physically and securely it would be nice to feel a bit fresher down there sometimes Good for you being active with LS. Your point about always keeping a low level flare sounds normal to me and you are doing all the suggested things. Maybe try unscented wipes (water wipes). Lots of coconut oil helps, especially for sex. I just found this again and I wanted to tell you water wipes have changed my life. Thank you so much for the suggestion. I use them every day and everytime I take a restroom break on a long hike. They do such a wonderful job of keeping me clean and they are soothing for me aswell. Thanks again That is great to hear. I like to use those \u201cinstant ice packs\u201d when traveling by plane or car too.", "Steroid suddenly uncomfortable after 3.5 weeks Currently 3.5 weeks into a prescribed 3 month course of dermovate: 1x a day at the moment, then every other day for a month from Tuesday, then twice a week for a month. Using a pea sized amount. Saw the doc yesterday for a follow up examination 3.5 weeks in and she said everything was looking great and pretty healthy after the treatment thus far. The issue is, I am starting to feel more sensitive to the dermovate these last couple of days and it leaves me a bit inflamed and sore after application. Is it that putting on a strong steroid every day for a month has just been a lot for my skin to take? Did anyone else experience this? Thinking of starting to taper a few days early.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry to post so many questions. GP appointments hard to get and very brief! Glad to hear your doc thinks things are looking good. They sound awesome and I am glad they put you on the right protocol. That said, that protocol is a general guidelines; some need to be on the daily for longer or less time, depending on a number of factors such as the severity of the LS. Since you are almost at the 4 week mark, I think it is safe to taper down. When you say inflamed, can you elaborate on what that means for you. If by inflamed you mean red, that is usually a sign you need to taper down from the steroid. Dr. Gayle Fisher, leading LS dermatology researcher in Australia who has conducted the largest studies on LS to date has a saying: if it is red, step down, if it is white, step up. Thus, this may be your body saying your ready to step down  Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions. Oh, great \u2014 yes, this makes perfect sense! The irritated part looks redder than it did before the feeling of irritation, as opposed to paler, so I will taper to the every other day from now on. Thank you! Yup. Good plan. Hopefully you will feel some relief. Update on this in case anyone finds it useful: I slathered on some of the nappy cream Paladin last night and it is been amazing for taking the inflammation down! If you use clebetesol too regularly it thins your skin even more. My dr told me not more than 3 weeks. I do not use mine every day... steroids are not meant to be used forever. On and off helps.... not sure how bad yours is.\n\nMy friend recommended going on IG and I found a holistic Dr I will give you the link. \n\n\n\nShe does remote work and can get you set up. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nTopical steroids are only a short term solution in my opinion not a fix. Lichen sclerosis can be indicative of an auto immune disease. Stress can make it flare. \n\nImagine fixing the problem at the source instead of letting it persist with temporary fixes. I am talking long term solutions! Would not that be amazing!!!!\n\nKeep your head up &lt;3 An update on this in case you were curious, as you were so helpful before: it absolutely was the clobetasol! Dr examined me and said there was no longer any sign of active LS since I would been using it for a few weeks, and that in all likelihood it was proving too strong for what was now much healthier skin that was trying to heal. She gave me the much less intense mometasone for the tapering period so I could finish the course with something less harsh. So it all worked out, and your advice was sound! Thanks for this. I am in that first initial 3 month round of treatment, so I do not plan on overusing steroids in the long term. The Dr ended up switching me to a much milder steroid so I can taper off use. Am intrigued to look into more holistic methods to run parallel with occasional preventative steroid use in future. That Is a good idea! I am using mine still I have not been able to afford investing in this nautropath yet but she does a free consultation. I am in between jobs so in about a month I will be able to afford care. The stories from the people who have had remission is inspiring. It never truly goes away but subsides I read. \n\nHave you been to a rheumatologist to check your immunity? Amazing! Thank you for the update. I am glad she put you on Mometasone and you are tapering down.", "Tight Foreskin Had relatively mild LS, came in and did its thing, now has gone away through use of clobetasol/tacrolimus but has tightened the foreskin - not quite to the point where there is phimosis, but it is definitely less loose than it was before. Means that sex and masturbation feel a bit different. Has anyone experienced the sane situation, and any tips on loosening the tightened skin?", "Is this LS? Does not itch or anything, My urologist suggested might be a normal fungal infection and suggested me to check with my derm 10 days later.\n My derm is kind of unavailable right now hence I wanted to know from your experience. It has faded a little now with the cream my doctor gave but it is there.\n( This post has been removed for violating Rule 1 and Rule 2. I am so sorry, I missed the rules. I just searched the reddit if anyone had posted any images and links, found so thus posted my query.\nI have my derm appointment today so maybe I will find my answers there. Once again apologies.", "26F, how do you take care of LS? I got diagnosed after my daughter was born, when sex with my husband became so painful we went months without it. Almost broke us up actually, because he had insisted the pain was psychological. I am very bad about taking medications on a regular basis, even with phone reminders, so when i did the initial clobetasol once a day for 2 weeks, then every other day, to twice a week forever, i would always miss days. Do I need to start over? i feel like i NEVER get relief. Ive been doing twice a week ever since, but it literally never seems to help. I also do aquaphor on days where its especially bad but i dont know if that is making it worse or not. My private doctor doesnt seem to understand how to treat it either which doesnt seem to help. Im also pregnant again and i think the hormones are making it especially bad. The doctor who diagnosed me was a resident, so shes not around anymore. Besides getting a new doctor again, anything else i can do? I am due in december. You might want to go talk to your doctor. I was recently diagnosed and prescribed 2x a day for 2 weeks, 1x a day for another week, and 2x a week for a couple months until I go back for a checkup. Your doctor might have you \u201cstart over\u201d, and have you do more rigorous treatment but you should talk to your ONGYN. If the one you have now does not understand it find a new one. I took Thymosin Alpha. It is a peptide and it cleared .I have up. I do t have it anymore. Did you inject it at the site of it or does it work systemically? Injected into my stomach. I took 20units 2x day for 10 days. By day 4 I noticed it was healing. Crazy. Thank you for clarifying. Useful information. I have used peptides before and I believe in them. - If you are currently experiencing symptoms, 2x a week likely will not cut it. That is the maintenance dose used to prevent future flare ups and architectural changes once the initial symptoms have cleared. Definitely see a new doctor, but you may find it helpful to use the steroid twice a day until your symptoms mostly go away, then taper to once a day for awhile, then every other day, and then you can start using the 2x week to maintain your progress. I am not sure about pregnancy, so consult your doctor first. It may take many months before your symptoms go down, 2 weeks is not nearly enough time for your skin to heal. The first doctor I saw gave me similar instructions and it did not work at all. The specialist I saw said I should be on once a day for at least 3 months before even considering tapering. It is a huge difference. \n\n- After pregnancy, you could also ask your doctor about trying an estrogen cream topically. Many LS patients, young ones included, benefit from it since it improves skin quality, plumpness, and elasticity - all things LS reduces. \n\n- A lot of women also benefit from borax soaks. You can add 1/4 cup or more to the tub, and soak for at least 20 minutes prior to applying your steroid. If you do not have a tub, the cotton ball method (I can explain, just let me know) or a sitz bath can work as well. Borax has been used as an alternative treatment for LS for a long time, and it can help reduce itching/burning and even cause unfusing, if you have any. If you are not quite sure about trying it yet, a baking soda or Epsom salt soak can also be relieving. I have heard of pregnant women bathing in borax on the fb group, but I understand if you want to take caution. \n\n- Over the counter creams can also bring you lots of comfort between steroid applications. Some options that are popular are emuaid (blue or red, red is stronger), v magic, Egyptian magic, lisepten, Perrins cream, emu oil, terrasil 3x antibiotic/skin repair, aquaphor, Vaseline, olive oil, coconut oil, so as you can see lots of options! This may be the best place to start since these will not affect your pregnancy. \nIce is also a good comfort measure for burning, and taking an antihistamine can help if you have a lot of itching. \n\n- dietary changes such as going low or sugar free, gluten free, dairy free, and/or low oxalate diets have helped a lot of women with symptoms \n\n- supplementing magnesium and vitamin D may also be beneficial \n\n- for intercourse, using a lot of lubricant will prevent friction and reduce pain. I like uber lube, vitamin e suppositories, slippery stuffy,  and coconut oil \n\nBy implementing these changes, you should see some improvement in your condition. I know you stated having a hard time with applying medications, which I do emphasize with, but unfortunately treating LS requires a lot of consistency and dedication. I hope you begin to feel better soon and wish you the best with your pregnancy\ud83d\udc95 Sounds like you may need to find a dermatologist or Gynecologist that is more familiar with LS. Good luck! 100% recommend finding a gynecologist. They tend to be a lot more knowledgeable in this area. \nAs for \"upkeep\", when it starts to flare up, I was told to go back to using the clobetasol everyday for 2 weeks, then back down to twice a week. \nI am almost 32 and have been living with this for years. It can really suck. Use the medication... My gyno straight up told me I could more or less lose my vagina. That scared me into being more consistent with medication. When I start to slack, I notice more flare ups. Good luck!", "Any additional treatments for LS? Good Morning,\n\nMy soon to be engaged girlfriend has a confirmed diagnosis of LS; recently she had a biopsy done and they found Sqamous Cell Hyperplasia. \n\nI try my best to be supportive, and she has not had much success in recent years with steroid creams, so it kills me to see her hurting all the time. \n\nDies anyone in here have any suggestions for what we could do in addition to the steroid cream, something that might help with irritation and pain at least? A warm  bath with a few TBSP of baking soda is always really soothing for me. Hope it helps her too Thank you I have recently tried EmuaidMax. You can get it on Amazon. I find that it relieves itching and pain more than my prescriptions.", "Backpacking with LS? Hi all. 23F and although I have not been tested (might be soon), my gyno and dermatologist both believe I have LS. I am glad to know what is going on but I am having a difficult time accepting that I might have to deal with this forever.\n\nAnyway, I am into camping and backpacking. I went this past weekend and I am in the middle of a painful flare up. I think it could be due to not having access to a shower, being hot and sweaty, and not applying clobetasol because I could not properly wash my hands out there.\n\nMy question is, if any of you also like to camp/backpack, how do you manage this out there? I am thinking I could cut the fingers off rubber gloves and use them as a clobetasol \u201capplicator\u201d but that does not solve the no-showering issue. It seems like a wet wipe just rubs the area and makes it worse. Any tips? I have not been formerly diagnosed but have suspected it as well. I ended up having a flare up before my last backpacking trip. I bought a portable bidet to wash off with every morning, night, and after using the bathroom. You can find backpacking specific ones but I ended up just getting a cheap one from Amazon. Definitely my \"luxury\" item but I do not think I will ever go without it. The limiting factor will be water so I will probably limit myself to trails with plenty water or shorter trips where I can carry enough. I brought travel size Cetaphil wash to make sure I was clean down there. I also used that to wash my hands and brought a small tube of hand sanitizer to use on my hands before I applied my creams.  I had pretty bad itch scratch cycle at the time as well so I took a benadryl every night to try and prevent night time scratching. This all seemed to work out pretty well and kept me from being miserable the entire trip. It will take more effort and planning but it is definitely doable. \n\nI had constant symptoms for 2 or 3 years and honestly never thought the misery was going to end. I just got mine under control a couple of months ago and finally have been able to enjoy life again. I enjoy a lot of outdoor activities and had the same worries as you but know that there is hope! Thank you for the help!! We were thinking about getting a travel bidet anyway so I am glad to know it can help with this too. Did you apply the Cetaphil wash directly to the area, and do you regularly do that? I have had it constantly for at least 5 years, and now that I got it to go away for a couple weeks, it is harder to ignore now that it is back. Just got a sensitive skin body wash but I just use water down there. For me creams help so much! You can use a hydrating cream of some sort at night and in the morning wash it off and just stay hydrated! Might not work for you but That is what has always worked for me. You can also use reusable pads (the cotton ones) even when you are not in your period because it helps me. I hope this helps! Thanks so much for the tip!! What kind of hydrating cream do you use? I have a few for my face and body but wondering exactly what has been effective and safe for you. Hey so I struggle with lichen sclerosis and psoriasis in my labia minora so I will get flare ups of both of them. \ud83e\udd72 for me I will use a steroid cream that my dermatologist gave me for psoriasis but it also helps with my lichen sclerosis but for hydrating creams I use neosalus cream which is not too thick and it just adds some hydration to help with itching and what not. But I have used any kind of baby rash cream that is more water based. I have tried creams with menthol or zinc oxide and it feels really nice and cooling but the long term effects make it worse from my experience. I suggest neosalus! It is helped me and I always use it at night when I get flare ups! I am sorry to hear that you are dealing with both! Thank you so much for the advice, I will check it out :) \n\nThis helps a lot for me when you cannot shower.", "Pill/hormones and LS? Thrush cream actually helping? Itchthyosis? I am sad I first remember getting \u2018thrush\u2019 when I was 14 and first got my period. I returned to doctors for 10 years with reoccurring \u2018thrush\u2019 until i stopped taking the pill 1/2020 and started having monthly outbreaks, the whole inside of my inner labia was red raw and severely uncomfortable and then I got diagnosed with LS by two different derms. I have been using Clob for 6 weeks with little improvement although it had eased to just mild discomfort, dryness and itchiness all of the time before diagnosis. Has anyone else noticed a link between it and your period/hormones? \n\nWhat confuses me is in the past I always used thrush cream and my symptoms went away within a week. Can anyone explain this? My derm said maybe it is soothing but I tried it again while using clob and it worked again for about 5 days then it came back. \n\nI have always had itchythyosis as well (soz for spelling) and wonder if anyone else has both conditions and if they are linked. I pretty much hate my whole body and skin at this point and feel betrayed by it. \n\nI have had painful sex since I was about 18 and have developed such unhealthy feelings around sex which makes me so sad because I have always been a very sexual person. I feel like my sexual pleasure is so reduced. When I masturbated as a teenager I could climax so easily and now it is increasingly difficult. I almost always tear in sex and 1/3 of the time will swell and be so sore. My libido is low and I will not stay wet if I even get wet in the first place. \nCan anyone relate? Does this even sound like LS? How can I get wet again and not be in pain? I think my LS caused me to have more yeast infections. Im not sure if that is the same as thrush but I think so. It seems you are simply experiencing symptoms of both. Are you using clob cream, or ointment? What is your regimen of application? I would apply clob ointment first, then put the thrush cream on top. I have used canestan cream on top of clob ointment and the results were pretty fast and effective. Does the clob you are using relieve the LS symptoms temporarily?\n\nEdit: It is possible that you have tolerated LS symptoms for so long that you do not notice them as much, so you are leaving the LS mainly untreated until it makes the thrush come back. Have you been using the clob every day for six weeks? Or only when you notice symptoms?\n\nEdit2: I am sorry I did not answer about the correlation to my period/hormones but I have not really noticed if it is related for me. I did get diagnosed right after I had given birth though, so it is possible that the hormones from pregnancy made it flair up.. but I had honestly been dealing with the symptoms since being a teenager, I just was finally able to show a doctor about it because she was already down there\u2026 I would been too embarrassed to have it checked out before then. But I would have times where it was not so bad so it kind of came and went and it was kind of fortunate to have had it flaring up when being checked down there. Hey thanks for replying. \nThe few times I thought I had thrush and actually got a swab done nothing came up so that is what caused us to look into something different and I also noticed I never had the \u2018cottage cheese\u2019 discharge that is supposed to go with it.\nMy derm told me to use clob ointment twice weekly and if I use canestan cream then I will use clob at night and the cream in the morning. \nAdmittedly sex has been less painful since I started clob but the general irritation is still there. But the last few days I had to stop having sex because the pain was bad. \nHave you noticed anything else as a trigger? Hi! Yes, I pretty much always notice mild flare like symptoms when I am on my period. I figure it must have to do with hormonal fluctuations or maybe the already sensitive skin being constantly wet for a few days irritates things. \n\nI had LS since childhood and had frequent \u201cyeast infections\u201d in my teenage years. In my early 20s I had a really bad flare that led to getting a diagnosis, but prior to the dr appt I had been using thrush cream because it helped with the symptoms a lot even though I suspected I was not actually having a yeast infection at that point.", "lichen sclerosus or something else? KIND OF LONG\n\nSo some time in may i had a mild yeast infection. i decided not to treat it since those usually go away in a few days for me. I later discovered i had infection that caused my bartholin gland to swell and become painful. I thought it was a bartholin cyst so i treated it like one with home remedies (witch hazel, calamine lotion, tea tree oil mixed put on a gauze pad and placed on the area. called \u201cphoebe\u2019s cure\u201d) and ended up literally burning the skin down there before i went to a doctor who told me the swollen area was just an infection. \n\nThe burned skin peeled off after a few days of using coconut and black castor oil and i noticed the skin down there was looking raw and itched a bit but boiled it down to it literally being new skin. I used the topical antibiotic (Fucidin acidic cream 2%) for longer than prescribed because it felt like the cyst had not disappeared completely (later realized it had and what i was feeling was the scar form the incision the doctor made). The Fucidin cause the areas around my anus the bartholin gland to itch a lot and when i stopped using it, the anal itching stopped so i know the cream caused that. \n\nI also discovered the antibiotics caused me to have another yeast infection which i treated and completed treatment so now i have no itching and no pain at all, but there are white lines that run along the side of my vagina (from the vagina-inner thigh fold) and end at my perineum. It does not itch or hurt but it definitely does not look pleasant &amp; it is tearing quite a bit. I am assuming it is because of the combination of the terrible home remedies and overusing the antibiotic cream (very stupid decisions i know, you do not have to tell me) that is making the skin there very delicate. I will definitely see a doctor but do you think it is lichen sclerosus or thin skin due to damage? also, did yours start just like that or there was something that triggered it?\n\nTL;DR \nthere is the presence of white patches and tearing skin  but it could be due to my use of home remedies &amp; overuse of a topical antibiotic. did yours start just like that or there was something that triggered it? Considering I do not know when it actually started with me, it is hard to tell. But when a doctor who is examining you suspicious of LS, he/she will ask you have you had any physical trauma to the area (yours is chemical,  but I think that is also what they want to know). Now, I do not know whether they are asking because it is a possible to have trauma triggering LS or to cancel out other options. For sure - I would say this is something you should explain to the doctor once you have your appointment.", "Just diagnosed with LS and also LS and sex (35 M) So, I have had since 34 years of age, but did not get diagnosed with it until recently. It turns out that my mother has LS and was diagnosed at 33. \n\nI have been prescribed a clobetasol ointment that I have been using for a week and half because I am going through a flare up, but it does not seem to be doing much for me. The affected areas of my penis are the head, sides of it mainly and the bottom, including the skin as well as my scrotum.\n This leads to very painful erections as it feels like I am being flayed.\n\n My wife and I have always been very sexually active and now we hardly ever have sex because of the pain and discomfort that I experience. The sensation feels different, I know this may seem like too much information but I guess I am hoping for some guidance or just people who can relate to what I am going through. So, yes, the sensation does not feel right, it is almost like I am numb and I cannot tell when I enter anymore. I have to rely on her feedback. I feel like a lousy husband because I cannot effectively please my wife anymore it would seem. She tells me not to worry and that it was good, but I cannot do what I used to be able to do. So to ensure my wife is pleased I will stick to oral for extended periods. I tired an organic oil based lubricant but it did not seem to really help me any. It was pretty thin and watery. I have given some thought to coconut oil or some such. Does anyone have any tips or something that you have used with success? Coconut oil should be fine, give it a try.  I would guess you could probably do a few trial runs solo with some different lubricants, figure out which are the best for you, before taking them to bed?  After this flare, though.\n\nA+++++ for the oral. Communication is the biggest thing, though.  Could probably also have some fun with toys. No harm in shifting the balance to taking her some wild new places while your equipment is in the shop.  It should be back one of these days.\n\nGive the clobetasol a little more time.  Soooo sorry about that flayed raw feeling.  I thought urine was bad, but never thought about erections on the same skin.... ooooh. \n\nIt is a-ok to hold off on penetrative sex if your body is not able to at the moment.  Really hope the communication is there. It sucks, but this falls under \"you both against the problem\".  If what she absolutely needs is penetrative sex thrusting to orgasm, she might have to compromise on when and how often.  If what she absolutely needs is your body on hers, there is plenty of other ways to be intimate.\n\nIf what you need is to be the one to initiate when your skin is happy again, you can ask for that. If oral feels good to you while PIV does not, ask for oral. Do not step back from everyday intimate touch - hands on shoulders and hips or kisses or whatever - that stuff can happen when sex is strained, and it is a killer.  People get angry and disappointed and turn away.  Have to hang in there, show up to talk honestly about what everybody needs and wants, and reaffirm how awesome you both are.  \n\nYou are not a lousy husband - unless you would think she would be a lousy wife if she had the same issue and wanted less penetrative sex. Then, maybe. Or, if you are so pissed you cannot have easy PIV sex right now that you start yelling at her all the time.  Then, bad husband.   Otherwise, LS just sucks.  So does cancer. So do back injuries.  Life throws us shit after shit after shit.  In your thirties, you are getting more and more practice rolling with it.  It is not going to stop coming.   This is some bullshit.  Everybody's dealing with bullshit of one kind or another. It does not make you a bad partner.  Also, you are aging, and you will find both of your bodies will not do things as well as they used to.  Not just sex, but everything.  Also bullshit. But true.\n\n\nInsults or putdowns should be off the table.  Straight to therapy if you see that happening.  \n\nProbably are not the most fun conversations you will have as a couple, but ya got to have them. I hope you both feel loved and respected and cared for in the process.\n\n\nI do not have a penis so I cannot offer any other technical support beyond \"clobetasol is good stuff\".  But I hope you get some relief. LS is just such an asshole. We have been communicating freely about my LS, she is understanding, I think it is just my own insecurity because I used to be more able. Now I cannot. as far as toys go, well she has some and we have used them, but she does not pull them out often. Maybe she thinks it might bother me if she were to more often but that is not the truth. I should encourage it. so we could probably do with more communication. \n\nI make it a point to hold off on intercourse, though sometimes I guess I am the one that feels like I need to engage in intercourse. as far as my wife goes she can orgasm through both oral and intercourse. Though I do know she enjoys it more if it is because of intercourse, but she is more than happy with oral, so we are good there. \nYes, we need to discover a way to be on one or the other without engaging in intercourse. I think we can accomplish that. \n\nI have been working on increasing the daily touches, and kissing. I love it because I can tell it is making her happier, and she will smile more often. I will cuddle much more frequently now, and it is been really nice, I think it is bringing us closer together which is the only silver lining about this disease. \n\nI only feel lousy sometimes because I just wish that I could engage in more rough intercourse, as that is how she generally prefers it. Soft and slow she enjoys, but not always. That is about all I can do anymore. It is just my own insecurity. \n\nWhen I was diagnosed we had a long discussion and she knows what LS is because she is an RN and used to work in women's health, now she works on an IMU in a heart tower, which she did for me because I have a lot of heart problems. It definitely was not a fun conversation, even with the understanding behind it. \n\nI feel that in some ways our marriage is getting stronger in our day to day, but also feel like it is suffering in the bedroom. But I am going to work on changing that and talking to her about it, adding in toys more often, etc. \n\nI am hoping that I can minimize the flare ups and keep myself well moisturized always. other things suck too. I live in Texas and the hest has an effect, and I cannot go swimming because either. I hate this disease but I am going to make some lemonade. \n\nThank-you for the kind words and the advice. it is nice to talk with someone who has the same disease. I totally relate to this. I am in early stages of diagnosis and cannot seem to get a handle on the pain even with the steroids... I am hoping things will settle down at some point because it makes me feel like such a disappointment to me SO :(( sending you positive vibes \ud83d\udc95", "Ointment residue? ", "Home remedies? Hi I am a 19 year old female, I am not a virgin but I have never been pregnant. A few months ago I noticed a dry, white patch on my vulva. I did not think much of it until my boyfriend noticed it during sex, and even though he was understanding about it it made me extremely insecure. Like anyone would I took to google and I became so scared with the results that pop up from LS. I never experienced itching until about a week ago, and it is been off and on. I feel so alone in this, especially because I am not entirely sure if this is even what it is. I try my best to not use too many chemicals in that area. I read that applying coconut oil throughout the day could ease itching and retain moisture. I tried that and it is definitely eased the itch completely! Is there any other over the counter or home remedies I can try? 1/4 cup borax in a full bath once a week can help. Emu oil. Emuaid brand soaps and creams. Aloe Vera. Chlorella (mixed with water to make a paste, then bath it away after about 20 minutes or so.) try using no soaps at all. Take a vitamin E supplement and a probiotic. Cut out gluten, sugar, and dairy. Good luck!! \u2764\ufe0f Hi, I am new here and awaiting my biopsy results but I have been doing a lot of research seeing as LS is what is suspected. I would really urge you to see a doctor and get a proper diagnosis because over time if left untreated there is the possibility of the whole architecture of your vulva changing along work scarring. But to answer your question I have seen a lot of women recommending Emu oil to help with the itching, maybe that would help ease symptoms for you. \n\nHope it works out for you! Hi there. I just came across your comment. This is my first time hearing about EMU oil. Do you need to mix it with water, or can you directly apply it to the LS? Please go get a biopsy! Ls is not all that common but i had the smallest white patches, no itching, no burning. I was just a paranoid freak about STD\u2019s and it took me 4-5 doctors visits, then finally a gynaecologist visit and a biopsy diagnosed me with lichen sclerosis. Left untreated is very bad, I am sure you do not have it babe but ease your mind and ask for a biopsy Nope just put it on directly!  I take a q tip dip it in the bottle and rub it on the affected area! I would strongly recommend seeing a doctor about it. It could be something innocuous like dry skin, which would put your mind at ease, or it could be something very treatable which would be well worth finding out early. Until your appointment, yes moisturizing is a good idea (I have heard coconut oil is not a great idea if you have recurrent yeast infections or other problems, but some people are very happy with it) as well as gentle washing with your fingertips (not a washcloth) and gentle soap or no soap, plus cotton underwear only and avoiding tight pants, leggings, etc.\n\nIf the patch is rough or scaly, and moisturizing completely got rid of symptoms, my guess would be dry skin or something like psoriasis. If it is smooth, shiny, or wrinkly and it persists then I would be more inclined to think LS. But I am not a doctor and you should always seek qualified advice.\n\n(Edit- just noticed you said it started a few months ago so I deleted the part about seeing whether it lasts more than a week) Emu oil as needed for itching, coconut oil as needed for itching,  Epsom salt baths with warm water. I personally use Cerave healing ointment after putting on Emu oil to lock in the moisture. Please see a doctor, get a correct diagnosis and get it treated because LS can cause damage to the area. Okay great. Thank you! Can you use it on (open) vulva tears too? I would personally! (If you have tried it) does it particularly burn? Any tips on application/how to use/when to use?", "It sucks to be me (my, 23F, biopsy experience) Hey guys, I got my biopsy done about 30 min ago and I am in sooo much pain it is not even funny. I have read a lot about what the biopsy would feel like so that I was prepared but holy shit it was (and still is) way worse than what I imagined.\n\nI do have to say, I am notorious for having an extremely high tolerance to anesthetics and this time was not any different. The anesthesia (by far the worst part) did not do much for me so my dr applied again and I still felt pain during the process. \n\nNow I am here laying down hoping I will never feel the need to pee again (do not need any more pain mr universe, thank you very much) \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb i am so sorry you had such a painful experience!!! try to remember it does not last forever. ice pack and ibuprofen!!!! hope you can get some answers soon \u2764\ufe0f Thank you sooo much!! \ud83d\ude18 If they did not give you prescription painkillers, you can take Tylenol and Motrin together and it is very effective. One of my doctors told me it is safe, as long as you do not exceed recommended dosages. It really helps with severe pain.\n\nIce packs too, as the other commenter mentioned! I feel for you - the first day is the most painful. Thanks, I will give it a try!! \ud83d\ude18 I feel this in my bones!\n\nMy biopsy (one on inner thigh, one on inside of labia majora) SUCKED. Getting the anaesthetic injected was the worst part oh my days it hurt so bad, it actually took my breath away.\nI have a full sleeve and a half sleeve and the anaesthetic hurt more than getting my elbow ditch or armpit tattooed for reference! \n\nI will say it does get better, as others have said I strongly encourage taking painkillers.\nWhat helped me for peeing was sitting on the toilet and bending as far forwards as I could so my chest was resting on my knees. Both of my biopsy sites were between and to the back of my legs so this helped keep as much urine away from the wounds as possible.\nI then dabbed as much as I could with toilet paper, then rinsed/sprinkled with water then dried gently by pressing a towel between my legs.\n\nI had issues with my dissolvable stitches in that they... Just did not dissolve. I was told around 2 weeks and they have go, but after 3.5 weeks half of the stitches were still there, I ended up having to pull them out, which felt weird but was not particularly painful.\n\nHopefully some of this helps, if you want to hear any more just lmk! Get a squirt bottle. My doctor gave me one. Fill with warm water and squirt as you pee to rinse off.  Put some Neosporin in the site. It acts as a protective barrier. Just seen this, I had the exact same experience a few weeks ago!!!\nIf it happens again, whenever you need to pe, just do it in the shower \ud83d\ude48 it sounds horrible, but honestly was the only way I could go without screaming in pain. I held the shower head down there as I pee'd. Still burnt, but not half as much as if I went \"normally\"", "Female, 32 diagnosed in December 2020 Hey! Sorry if my English is not that good, I am from Germany :) do you have any advice for the itchiness during the nights? Tried different oils etc but is there any other helpful trick? I can hardly sleep sometimes.... Are you using a steroid ? It is the only thing that works for me. And when you apply it, you need to massage it in for at least 90 seconds I use Triamcinolone (a medium strength steriod) and estradiol every night. Helped tremendously. I use testosterone 2% a couple times a week 2. When super bad I used an ice pack, sometimes it is help Some people like to have an ice pack ready by the bed for when the itchiness wakes them up. Oral antihistamines might help too for the worst times. \n\nAre you getting the condition itself treated? Thank you so much for your help! I have to use cortison. 3 times a week for 4 weeks and before daily... Hey there fellow German! You could try Tannolact Sitzb\u00e4der (available at any pharmacy), twice a week for 10 to 15 minutes. Not only can they help with itchiness but you can use the time to mentally unwind as we know stress can trigger LS flare ups.\n\nMaybe talk to your doctor about your steroid again. Which one have you been prescribed? Not every cortisone cream is equally effective. Maybe the application frequency needs to be adjusted if the itching continues. Thanks!!!!! Will collect all the infos here and then go to pharmacy. R u from Germany as well? Yep, Bavarian, born and raised!\n\nIf you have not been yet, visiting a \"Dysplasiesprechstunde\" in your area might be worth a try. They are often more knowledgeable on LS and with the increased cancer risk, it cannot hurt to have them check out if everything looks fine anyways.\n\nI can also recommend the ( They provide great resources in German. Ich bin aus Freiburg. Ja dort war ich schon. Aber eben dieser Juckreiz nachts als macht mich krank...wie lange hast du schon LS? Ich mein so mega arg beeintr\u00e4chtigt mich das nicht aber es ist halt einfach nervig. Hey I am also from Germany and my doctors said to use Deumavan Schutzsalbe daily. I use the unscented (they call it neutral) version. It is just vaseline with additional vitamin e. Used this a while last year because I ride a lot with my bike. But not really helped against the itchiness just against dry skin I hope you find something that helps!", "People with vulvas, what is your experience with hair removal? Straight to the point \u2014 I have shaved my pubic hair for, pretty much, forever. I go through short periods of time where I do not do anything to it but it always ends up bothering me so I end up shaving most of it and, occasionally, all of it. I have been thinking more and more about sugaring/waxing lately because, though it sounds painful, I love the thought of my hair eventually growing back slower.\n\nSo far, when my stubble comes in, it does not seem to irritate my LS. I actually get more irritated when my hair gets too long + sweat. However, I am a bit afraid that waxing/sugaring will be too harsh. I do not have any LS on my labia (anymore) but I do have some towards the tippy top of my clitoral hood, so of course, this is the area I am most worried about. (But maybe I could avoid this area w/ sugaring/waxing? Idk!) \n\nAnyway, I was wondering (and I ask all of these questions specifically in reference to LS because we all, of course, have our general preferences): What are your experiences with hair removal? Do you do it or not? Why? Do you stick to shaving? Any positive/negative experiences with waxing/sugaring?\n\nThanks!! i usually only trim it so it is like 5mm long minimum or i get super itchy but do not let it get too long between trims. that is been the perfect middle ground for me with my LS. I have also been thinking of laser hair removal for about a year purely for the convenience and the chance it will be less itchy but have yet to commit to it. \nin regard to sugaring, i have also always wanted to try it so i am curious to how you go if you decide to start doing it!! i have heard really good things about it for people who have sensitive skin so it seems like a much better way for people with LS and a sensitive area down there I had everything waxed once. It turned out not to be relevant to LS. The areas where hair grows do not overlap LS-affected skin for me. \n\nIt was an interesting experience but I have left it alone since. I need the cushion. I tried that but I my OBGYN did not want to anymore. The hair is to keep bacteria away Thanks! I used to trim all the time so I think I will be going back to that. I will let you know if I end up trying sugaring &amp; how it is! I get waxed pretty much every 4-6 weeks and have been for many years. It is never an issue. I probably would wait if I had a big flare up but I have been lucky last few years. I have waxed since my teens; my waxing lady would mention the LS (\u201cit is white there, did you know?\u201d) but because waxing is so quick; it does not bother me much. The REAL bother is when it starts growing back, it gets itchier so I tend to scratch more. I would say stick with shaving for now unless you can prevent the excessive scratching, then waxing should be fine This is really good to know - thank you!!", "Lube recommendations? Sorry for getting pretty personal here, but I mean, this is a very intimate disease.\nSo, I was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus at 5 years old (I know, crazy and very rare, but yeah, I was 5,) and I am now 21. I am cis-female. Because of my LS, overall sensitive skin, and frequent/chronic yeast infections, I am VERY sensitive down there. I am on birth control and antidepressants (lexapro) so I am dealing with some dryness. I have not been able to find a lubricant for sex that does not BURN. Anyone have any lube recommendations? \u00a0Penchant Store\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars\u00a0\u00a07,332Reviews\n\nIntimate Lubricants for Sensitive Skin by Penchant Premium - Silicone Based, Discreet Label - Best Personal Lube for Women and Men \u2013 Lubrication Gel Without Parabens or Glycerin 4oz\n\n******* they do have a water based one, but dries too fast for my liking. My doctor gave me a gel that includes/main ingredient is hyaluronic acid. Have not used it yet but maybe worth a shot if you have not tried it yet! Water based is key I use Astroglide. Coconut oil works great for me Water based from YESYESYES is brilliant and prescribed by the NHS in the U.K. \n\n I am also very sensitive/am susceptible to yeast infections - my doctor recommended Sylk natural lubricant (there is a leaf on the bottle which is white with a grey cap)\n\nI am in the UK so am unsure if you can get it elsewhere but I have been using for awhile and have had no problems! Highly recommended it. coconut oil does not work with condoms but otherwise i second this !!! I wish I liked it but it irritates me :( Second this Water based lubricant made a huge white patch  and has not returned since discontinued. I recommend a silicone based lubricant. Slippery stuff is the ONLY lube that has NEVER caused me irritation. F*ckwater was also okay. But, I also avoid glycerin and latex because those cause me to flare up very, very badly. Thank you! Gel or liquid? I am not sure about glycerine but silicone and latex definitely irritate me. ( is what I used. The gel was also used on me at the gynecologist, like the 32oz huge bottle and that was alright! Anything by them really. Silicone irritates me as well. Be careful I would avoid glycerin as well honestly. It is in baby wipes, Aquaphor, lots of stuff or I would maybe use a product with glycerin (ex again baby wipes) and see if they irritate you. It is a large irritant even in people without LS.  Thank you everyone! I really appreciate it! Thanks so much! I will definitely take your advice on the glycerin. I have super sensitive skin even besides my LS Of course! Amazon sells slippery stuff in smaller bottles so you do not have to buy the larger ones just in case you do not like it/it causes irritation. I have never been able to find it in a store anywhere, but f*ckwater I found in an adult store but that causes some irritation honestly. \n\nI also recommend putting on something like A&amp;D ointment/Desitin onto your vulva/wherever you get tears 20 minutes before sexual activity or whatever makes you tear (I know even riding a bike makes me tear) and it really does help! Ok great call! I have been trying to get pregnant for so long I forgot about that \ud83d\udc4d", "Do you usually sleep enough ?

What do you guys think of the result ?  \nFor you, was there a link in the beggining ? Here we are with the results :)  \nDiscussion below. I figured there would be! I wonder if it is just that most people do not get enough sleep? Or if it is actually causation not correlation? You mean correlation and not causation, I guess? It is obviously impossible to know based on this, but I know that for me there is a link. The thing is, I probably stopped sleeping enough for a reason, and that reason could be the actual cause. Anyhow I really feel like it is less \"sclerosed\" when I get enough sleep. I cannot tell if getting enough sleep for long periods of time will make it disappear because I still sleep less than I should most of the time.", "Knowledgeable Dr. in Dc/Md/Va? Hi, I am looking for a doctor who knows their stuff/the latest research on LS.\n\nI need a dr that takes insurance.\n\nI am in Northern Virginia, but willing to travel a bit.\n\nThank you! Dr Kapf They do not take any insurance there. $1600 out of pocket. \u2639\ufe0f Some of the Facebook groups have lists of providers that people in the group have seen. \n\nAlso, the Center for Vulvovaginal Disorders has a location in DC, but I do not know anyone who has been to any of their locations so I cannot recommend or disrecommend them- \n\n(\n\nBut I see that they have sub-pages on PGAD and Zoon's vulvitis, which is a bit encouraging that they at least mention such under-recognized conditions. Zoon's is EXTREMELY rare. I have a family member who has it and got misdiagnosed with LS for a few years because Zoon's was not on her doctors' radar because it is so rare. So I guess the fact that they are even thinking of this one is a good sign. Yes, I would like to go to this Center, but they do not take insurance and it is very expensive. It depends on your insurance, right? They do not take it directly, but that does not mean your insurance will not reimburse you. Can you save for it and have your insurance reimburse you later? I really do not know. I have not had much luck navigating insurance stuff, and I cannot risk having to pay out of pocket.\n\nAnother specialist I spoke to said that insurance companies tend not to cover their appointments/tests.\n\nIf anyone has experience with a situation like this and getting out of network visits covered, I would love to hear. I have been thinking about going to a pelvic rehabilitation place like that is \"out of network\" everywhere. They told me how much the visit would cost, and my insurance has 20% coinsurance for that visit type, so I know how much it would be. But I did not think about labs, etc. And yeah, the \"file the receipt with your insurance yourself\" could be an issue if your insurance tries to get out of paying and you are stuck with the bill. \n\nSome insurance companies have a provider finder tool; you could see if they can help you find someone in their network with the right specialty. Thank you!", "Getting an IUD? Hi guys\nI have been on birth control now for almost 2 years (first was femodene then switched to milinette after my LS symptoms started)\n\nLong story short I think it is quite drastically affected my mental health. \n\nAnyone with LS here got a copper IUD? If so how is it and has it made anything better/worse for you?\n\nEvery day I am very anxious, can cry over nothing sometimes, overthink etc. My periods have also become very painful and before I started taking birth control/not until recently things mentally on my period were okay but now i feel awful, I change and cannot see anything positively, cry a lot, cannot get out of bed and do not have the motivation to eat/do things to keep me alive etc. It is seemed to have gotten worse over the last few months as this month it was the most painful one of my life and the worst my mental health has been for ages. I really did not want to live with how I felt (did not have suicidal thoughts or anything but more that feeling of just not wanting to exist yk?)\n\nHowever, I have no problems physically other than my period really, no sexual problems caused by it etc. I do not want to lose that because my struggle with LS the past year has done that for me, I have finally got it under control so I know if sex became painful again I would lose it.\n\nI did also wonder if stopping the combined pill could make my LS improve but when I spoke with my doctor she said it does not make a difference, what have you guys heard or experienced about that? \n\nSo a few questions for you guys:\n\n1) did you need to make any special arrangements for IUD insertion? (eg smaller speculum, extra lube etc)\n\n2) how has the IUD affected your LS?\n\n3) does the IUD cause painful sex eg if your cervix is hit is it extra painful etc?\n\n4) would you recommend the pill or a copper iud more? So I have a hormonal IUD (Liletta) rather than copper.  Most hormones stay in the uterus, so in general you should expect not to see systemic or mental health effects from it, although the science is still a bit shaky on that. When I was diagnosed with LS my doctor wanted me to quit the pill (which I had been on for a decade before). His reasoning was that the pill can increase levels of sex hormone binding globulin, resulting in less sex hormone getting to the skin of my vulva and thereby worsening the LS. I cannot have sex right now because the LS is so bad, so I went entirely without birth control for ~3 months, however that is not sustainable for me because without it I bleed constantly. \n\nI got the IUD to manage the bleeding, and it has worked well for that, I have stopped having periods entirely, which is a huge blessing because every period product seemed to irritate the LS. At no point (zero birth control or IUD) did my LS symptoms improve or change at all. \n\nFor insertion, I was given mifepristone and a prescription NSAID, I also had nitrous oxide for insertion. I would recommend all of those if they are offered to you. The experience was frankly pretty awful, I think that my pelvic floor dysfunction was a big factor in that, I cramped up like a vice. However, I was back to normal within about 48h. \n\nStill cannot have sex, but I will say that when I use vaginal dilators I am aware of the IUD and get cramping when they touch my cervix. I am not sure if that is normal or not, and I am going to ask for it at a checkup soon. \n\nOverall I would say that since you are clearly unhappy with the pill, the IUD is probably worth a shot. Keep your expectations reasonable and ask the doctor how they can best make the insertion manageable for you. Hi! \nSo I have LS, but when I was in the process of getting diagnosed, doctors had no clue what was wrong with me and switching up my birth control was one of the first things we tried. I was on the combination pill, and when I stopped it, my LS symptoms improved by 70% in 24 hours, it was a miracle! So much so, that we figured the pill was the problem! It was not, the pain came back, but it was a nice when it lasted. When I went off the pill, I switched to the copper IUD and have had it for 6 or 7 months now. I have had LS for about 10 months. \n1. Did not need any special arrangements, did not even know I had LS when I got it in\n2. No affect on LS to my knowledge.\n3. When I first got it, I would say I got occasional discomfort with sex from it, and it was worse when I had period cramps and had sex. Now, I have no issues whatsoever. Occasionally causes more intense menstrual cramps. It did not make my periods heavier or anything either. I 100% recommend the copper IUD! I forget it is there and it works \ud83d\ude0f I do not know a lot about IUDs, but I take the minipill (0.35 mg norethindrone) because it makes my periods milder and less frequent. I had pretty bad periods and they worsened my depression a lot, so the minipill has helped my mental health a lot. Some birth control has been associated with LS (if it has anti-androgenic progestins) but supposedly ones like the minipill I am on are actually protective against LS. Hello, I was actually diagnosed when my doctor saw my vulva, when getting the copper iud put in. I would think you might need a smaller speculum and a little more lube. \nI do not think the coil would affect LS due to it being in the cervix and you should not feel the coil in sex - your strings but be a bit stiff but they should soften up quickly. If you need more info -birthcontrol is a very good subreddit :)", "Flushable wipes: The silent killer Hi all, some time ago I posted to this group and a few others regarding my concern about the vulvar irritation and cuts I would been experiencing relentlessly, thinking I possibly had LS. I went to vulvar specialists, dermatologists, gynecologists, you name it - and they all laughed me out of the room. I felt hopeless, like I had an STD, gaslit, etc. But I think I finally discovered the culprit once and for all: flushable restroom wipes.\n\nYou know, the ones you use when toilet paper just will not do\u2026 it sounds crazy but think about this. The vulvar specialist was convinced it was just irritation and of course this infuriated me. I cut out all soap, all underwear that was not cotton, any potential irritants EXCEPT those because I thought they were harmless. WRONG! I stopped using them and I have not had another cut since - it is been a few weeks since I stopped. \n\nIt all makes sense because when I was away at college, I lived in the dorms so I did not have anything extra in the restroom that I did not need. I noticed the changes when I moved back home and had fancier bathroom products. I really think the wipes had some type of alcohol or other ingredient that was drying my skin out like crazy. So if you are experiencing vaginal cuts and tears, dryness or irritation and your biopsy was negative for LS or you are skeptical otherwise, I encourage you to consider all potential irritants - even the ones you think are harmless - and experiment with cutting them out of your life. Because I was absolutely convinced I had LS or herpes.

This is supposed to be a safe space and not an open invitation for dick. I have reported the public comment for sexual harassment. Just hoping you other girls out here do not get the same irritating comments. I understand your point but this is a public website and it is probably not wise to post photos of your genitals. No one can diagnose you with LS from a photo. The only person who needs to see kitty for a diagnosis is your doctor.

I feel lost and alone. I got diagnosed with LS at 17, and I am now 21. I have never had sex, and I have never used a tampon. I struggle to get \u201cwet\u201d down there, even when my mind is aroused. I was told by my doctor to not attempt sexual intercourse, as it could cause permanent damage. I was also told not to use tampons, as they could get stuck because my vaginal opening is \u201cabnormally\u201d small. I have been with my bf for three years and I do not want to lose a relationship because I cannot have sex. It definitely puts a strain on our relationship. I want to, it is not just for him but for me too. I want to know what it is like, and I want to make him happy..\n\nSo I guess I need advice. Should I invest in dilators, would they help? Nothing fits in my opening, I would say a pinky finger (sorry, TMI) and that is even painful once inside. Can LS prevent sex forever? Will I be able to have my own children? \n\nI am lost and alone and need some advice. Thanks in advanced.  Hi. So sorry to read your post. I am quite a bit older than you and I was diagnosed with LS about 6 years ago. Because every case is different I cannot comment on how sex would be for you but I can tell how things are for me now that I have LS. It is definitely an adjustment. Certain times penetration can be quite painful. My husband and I tend  to do other stuff to remain sexual. Sometimes my whole vulva seems on fire. (The bad fire, not the good fire! \ud83d\ude09) that can be hard even in non sexual situations. Wearing underwear and peeing come to mind.   It really can be hard at times but if I use my clobatesol in a regular basis, even when everything is good, I tend to have an easier time of sex. \n\nTampons and pads are awful for me. I use to get so irritated  by using them. I now use a menstrual cup and that is much better. No irritation at all. I have also found that applying  some zinc based cream helps  keep thinks cool during flare ups. Clobatesol overnight and zinc during the day. \n\nI had my children before my LS. \n\nAgain, I am so sorry you are going through this at such a young age, I wish you the best of luck.  Obviously I do not know your full details and I am not an expert but I would suggest you look for a second opinion. LS is a skin condition and the mention of your opening being small and uncomfortable for a finger makes me wonder if you have something else going on. \nPerhaps you should seek out a doctor who specialises in sexual health - I believe there are physiotherapists who specialise in the area also. \nI was diagnosed at 21 and am now 30, it is constant balance of cream and keeping on top of flare ups. Best of luck.  I agree with the comment about getting a second opinion. If treated with the right creams etc sex can become more than bearable (enjoyable even!) in my experience but I am not a medical professional and it just sounds unusual that your doctor said no sex at all. I found a great dermatologist who specializes in vulval conditions and would recommend looking into finding someone similar - your gp should be able to refer you  A 3 year bf at your age is a long time \ud83d\ude42 does he know? Could he help you look for an expert in LS? It took me a while to find an expert. OBGYN or dermatologist, you must see someone who has experience and expertise! I have seen my share of idiot doctors! \n\nYour ability to get wet is not a symptom of LS that I have heard of. That sounds to me like fear...which many women have-ands that is why there is lube.  It is scary. I rip every time, so I have a lot of negative self talk going through my head.  BUT I do not need penetration to orgasm. Trust your partner , work together , learn what works for you. \n\nBabies. Yes you can. There is lots of ways to get pregnant and you can pick the birthday a have a c-section. \n\nDo not give up hope.

If you have not seen a gynecologist, you should. You should also call in advance to make sure that your gynecologist understands and knows how to treat LS. \n\nYou might also post this on r/AskDocs.  In your case, surgery is necessary. There is a blog with someone who had a similar state of LS but it is only in German. She had surgery twice but had to switch doctors to get them. I highly recommend you look for an experienced doctor, even if it means travelling further. Hi, I am so sorry to hear about your situation. LS can wreak havoc on your body and make you feel like sex is impossible.  I was diagnosed about a year ago at 30, and before that, I thought sex was just going to be painful at the start and after the finish. My brilliant gyn prescribed Clobetasol, which has really change my life. It is a topical cream that I massage into my labia and around my clitoris and perineum. It took several weeks to start feeling relief, but eventually all my sticking point became more or less unstuck and I was able to truly enjoy sex without pain. For years gynecologists told me all sorts of reasons why I was having pain, but none of them were right. Fire your gyn and get a different one. Lately, my LS has been flaring more, and I had a minor tear. This weekend I am going to start Protopic to make a more serious dent in my condition. I want you to know that with treatment, and the right partner, sex can be lovely. Hang in there, and go find a gyn that will listen, help you, and not say that sex is not an option.  How much clobetasol do you use each time?  Sometimes I am told to use very little and other times to cover my fingertip. Hi, only like a pea sized amount once every night. Then I massage it in thoroughly but gently, making sure that all the areas that tend to become glued do not get that way again. At first it hurt to do that, but after awhile it started to feel so much better.", "M,22. Doctor could not identify 100%. Does this look like lichen sclerosus?  Doctor suspected psoriasis initially. I am a brown guy so this might look slightly different. It was extremely sensitive and just wearing anything but a soft underwear would cause pain. Wearing pants for office was a nightmare. After some cortisteroid creams and moisturizers, and getting used to it, it has desensitized a bit\n\nInitially the spot was smaller and grew/spread out more Usually LS looks quite scaly and hardened. This more looks like the skin pigment colour has changed.\n\nDefs not an expert, dermatologist is the next point of call. Been to a dermatologist and depigmentation was what he mentioned/suspected as well. The sensitivity part is what is the worst. Probably time to see a urologist then, they will be able to rule out UTI's or things of that nature. Sorry to hear you are in pain, it is a bad part of the body to be tender Yeah, I think that would be the next step. Thank you for your comments. I think it could be. It might need a biopsy to be sure, unfortunately.\n\nHow strong was the corticosteroid they gave you? If it was for psoriasis and not LS, it might not have been strong enough, and a stronger one might work better (clobetasol at 0.05% is the favorite for LS.) In a fraction of people, clob does not work well, and then they can try tacrolimus or pimecrolimus. Not entirely sure how strong. They would given, elomet, elidel and cloderm. They kept prescribing elidel afterwards but I stopped applying after a couple months. So (as I learned today) Elidel is a brand name of pimecrolimus. Cloderm is a medium-strength steroid and Elomet is stronger, but Clobetasol Propionate is much stronger than either of them. Yea it does not look like it to me. LS is more like a scar tissue. You will want to see a urologist and wear loose fitting, breathable cotton undies until you get a result. If you could get someone to check you over for depigmentation elsewhere on your body it would help, just to be sure incase it is something else. Hope you feel better soon dude", "32m, shiny white spot at tip of my urethra, could this be LS? More info in comments.  It could be. I recommend seeing a dermatologist or urologist", "I do not know what to do I was just diagnosed with LS in January. I noticed it forming way before then, but that is the soonest I could see a doctor about it. It is so painful it is ridiculous. I have tons of tears in my labia, the entrance to my vagina is covered in tears and makes sex hurt so much, the affected skin (the vaginal and anal areas) is so itchy and it is peeling now, I get tears whenever I sit on the toilet, and it is just really annoying and painful to deal with. And now I have discovered that my clit is affected by it. I feel no pleasure from touching it now. It is really frustrating and makes me feel so horrible about myself. I just do not know what to do. I am tired of dealing with this. All they did was prescribe a steroid cream for me, but it does not really help. Does anybody have tips or suggestions on dealing with this? How long have you been on the clobetasol? What country are you in? You may want to check out stem cell therapy. It can be difficult to get it covered by insurance or the national health service (depending on where you live) but a lot of people have great results from it. I had my first treatment about a month ago, and am waiting for the full course to post about the experience and results. It sucks! Painful and depressing. Steroid ointment is what is prescribed. I have had it only 10 months and find lots of moisturizing helps (coconut oil, emu oil, aquaphor, vmagic, vaseline). I also soak in the tub w borax to soothe everything. Google Dr. Jill Krapf w CVVD for more ideas. She is on insta. Also nva.org/providers/ to find someone in your area for treatment. xo If you are not on topical Clobetasol ointment already, you need to get on that.  The typical regimen is along the lines of every day for six weeks, every other day for another six week, then twice weekly as maintenance.  You can use aloe or coconut oil in between Clobetasol treatments, as well, if the Clobetasol is not enough.\n\n\n\nAlso, get a sprayer like the SonTiy for your toilet.  That one is metal, there are cheaper ones like it that are plastic if that specific brand is too expensive.  It is super easy to install.  Use it every single time you pee to rinse your entire vulva and perineum.  Urine exacerbates the symptoms of LS and wiping is not good enough.  You might even consider keeping some gentle soap at your toilet and giving yourself a bit of a wash after urinating with soap and the sprayer.  I started using soap and the sprayer, but I have since just been using the sprayer every time I use the bathroom and the pain is mostly under control now.  Before, I described my pain as somebody taking a belt sander to my undercarriage.  Since using the sprayer, I get occasional discomfort. Fast. 5 days four times a year.  3 days monthly for the other 8.  Eat the Terry Wahls multiple sclerosis AIP diet.  Do not drink booze.  Your immune system is attacking yourself.  Treating the spot will not get it done.  You need to reduce inflammation systemically, start reading about the immune system, gut immune connections, and inflammation.  I just started rapamycin and thymosin alpha - these are self experiments.  No doctor will try anything but topical steroids which I still use btw.  I have found no really helpful OBs or derms, if you can afford a good functional medicine MD try it.  I cannot afford one. If steroids do not help, then the next medicine my doctor tried was pimecrolimus, it is often used for exzema because it helps stop autoimmune symptoms from happening, whereas the steroids just make it feel better after the symptoms start. \n\nYou also have some other suggestions, I hope something here is helpful for you! I just had my second treatment! I had my first 3 months ago, and I cannot even imagine not having done it now. It is just wow. It took 3 months to work so hang in there, but it improved my tissues so much, and I am hoping to be in remission or at least close to after this one! Wishing you the best, it is an awesome treatment option\ud83d\udc95 How did you get the thymosin alpha? I am interested, but have never heard of any provider offering this I am sorry. I was diagnosed at 22 and it is so awful! Awful is even an understatement. I hope you find relief soon. Did they give you the steroid ointment (not cream, it is less effective and more irritating)? Using that daily should help, but only use a small pea sized amount so you do not further thin your skin. Also ask for estrogen cream, it will help a lot with tearing by improving the skins elasticity and plumpness. Soaking will also help you, especially if you have fusing. Epsom salts can be soothing, but the real game changer is borax! It helps so much with LS symptoms it is crazy. If you join the sharing is caring lichen sclerosus group on Facebook you can learn all about it! You can find borax in the laundry aisle of target if you are in the US. If you are in the UK- I can get you a link for online. Start with a couple table spoons and build up in the tub (I use 1-2 cups). If you do not have a tub, you can saturate a jar of water and use cotton balls or purchase a sitz, it can be soothing. For products that may help give you some comfort, I personally recommend V Magic cream from Amazon, Emuaid Blue, and Carlson Key E Vitamin E Suppositories (for sex \ud83d\ude09). Speaking of sex, I know how scary it can be to feel like you are losing your ability to have it, but it sounds like you do need to take a break for now. Your skin is very fragile (hence tearing) and the more it tears the more scar tissue you will develop, which is not as flexible as regular skin, which can lead to more tearing and discomfort - not a good cycle. If your skins tearing and your vulva is burning/hurting, it is telling you to give it more time to heal. I do not mean to come off as condescending, it just took me a year to learn that and I really regret it! It made me associate pain with sex, and I still tense up even now that I am doing better. It takes time to see results, and you have to be diligent with the treatment, but you should start to feel better. I wish you the absolute best! We are all here to support you along the way \ud83d\udc96 A gal on this sub recommended an online MD that offers it but it was pricey so I immediately ordered it from peptide science. Ohh I see! So you just inject yourself at home? Have you noticed any improvement or side effects? I cannot agree with this more! Ointment is SO MUCH BETTER than cream. Also more effective, and not alcoholic so it does not burn those little tears. I recommend no sex till you heal, dilators to gently stretch the skin once you feel ready for them, and also coconut for lube as this person mentioned! I vouch for it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc \nSoak before application of the ointment, studies show that is the correct way to apply because the clobetasol penetrates the skin effectively. \n\nFor bathroom use, get yourself a peri bottle! I do not wipe my vulva anymore. Just use a peri bottle and pay dry. \n\nI recommend Dr. Jill Krapf on Instagram &amp; also  on Instagram. SO MUCH GOOD STUFF THERE! I cannot express this enough. \n\nLS sucks ass but life does not have to be miserable. Take a deep breath, and know you are not alone! So many women on IG have really dope tips. &gt; I recommend Dr. Jill Krapf on Instagram\n\n\n\nThere are too many Dr. Krapfs to sort through on IG, what is her   Thank you!"]
