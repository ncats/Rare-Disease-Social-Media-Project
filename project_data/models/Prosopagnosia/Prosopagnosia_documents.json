["They say it is hereditary... \ud83d\ude02 I have been talking to my family about my proso problems since I realised it was a thing (about 10 years ago) and none of them seemed to get what I was talking about. So, tonight I loaded the famous faces test on mum's computer and... She completely failed it! \ud83d\ude02 She said \"but, they had no hair, I could not tell who they were!\"... That is the point mum! \ud83d\ude02\nAnd just to show it was not a silly test, my sister had a go (she was not around when mum did it) and she got 100% correct. What is this test?  Thanks! Yes! I sent my mother my original results when I was accepted into one of the university studies. She was fascinated because apparently my father is on par with me with facial recognition. She said \"I always thought he was just selectively stupid.\" My mom and my sister both have issues remembering faces. Well then. I scored a 1, and that is only because Trump\u2019s face is freaking everywhere. To be fair, though, I do not keep up with pop culture much, and I am Canadian so Thatcher and JFK are more familiar as names than as faces. Saved this for later. Just found out that not being able to recognize faces is an actual medical condition, I just thought I was a bit slow. Welcome to the club My mom and sister have it as well.\n\nI hope my kids do not but that is probably going to happen.", "Not showing a look of recognition may be hurting my relationship. I have acquired prosopagnosia, and I suspect my partner is struggling to feel that I like them because I no longer give them a look of recognition when I look at them. I became face blind about four years into our relationship and have been so for four years since then. \n\nHas anyone else run into interpersonal phenomena like this due to prosopagnosia? I cannot find any literature in this area. My partner wears the same shirt or hat when we meet after a time apart.  Some things we just have to deal with, and hope they understand.  It is more embarrassing to greet a complete stranger after mistaking them for your friend, so  I would rather be more reserved until I confirm their identity. Oh no... That sounds awful, and I am sorry that is happening. There have been some people I hit it off well with when I first met them, and they seemed disheartened when I seemed tentative upon seeing them again, even as soon after as the next day, and we did not talk again out of awkwardness or maybe hurt feelings. (Unfortunately, these instances were before I understood I have some level of face blindness, so I was not able to even say, \"Sorry, I sometimes have trouble recognizing people until I know them pretty well.\" I just thought I was awkward and stupid, and felt confused and disheartened myself.)\n\nFor your partner, do you suppose you could ask them to wear something notable? Depending on what they would be comfortable with, maybe some sort of unique bracelet, hair ornament (hair clip or hair tie), or noticeable earring(s)? A shirt pin? Maybe this is something you could talk with them about and have fun with. I hope things improve!", "Who is your Achilles' heel? That one person, no matter how much you study their face, hear them talk, see them move, confirm with non-faceblind people that different images of them are, in fact, the same person, that you will *never* recognize once they change a detail.\n\nMine? Oscar Isaac. \n\nEvery time I see a new photo/video of him I scream in frustration after being told \"You know that is Oscar Isaac, right?\" lol", "Did not he play Mysterio? Oh wait...  He looks exactly the same to me. Thank goodness for all the costumes right? They look like brothers to me. Their smiles have the same shape like } at the corners. I always notice Jyllenhall's thick eyebrows though. I just showed that pic to my wife and asked \u201cis this not the same person?\u201d She laughed at me and explained who they are. Story of my life.", "So I definitely do not recognize faces. Is there anything that can help me that are not things like \"say their name after you shake their hand?\"  I (unconsciously) make note of other features of someone is appearance like their body shape, hair cut and color, style of dress, bag they usually carry, place they usually sit (if in a classroom or office), and the context I usually see them. If someone knows me and briefly says hi but I do not recognize them, I usually bluff and pretend I do. If it is a sustained interaction and I cannot keep up the bluff, I will often say \u201cI cannot recognize faces so can you remind me who you are/how we know each other.\u201d", "At least there is only one of them per season... &amp;#x200B;\n\n Maybe this is why I am not attracted to \"conventionally attractive\" men. Because they all look the same! \"Okayden\" - snerk we all know he is just going to end up with the Girl version of that description I am exactly the same! \\ They could have these four switch amongst themselves from scene to scene and if I watched this show I would not know it There is not even one with blue eyes or something! Or a mole! Anything! Hahaha I know right. Can other people really tell all these men apart? I mean, the joke is that they are some of the most similar-looking people out there, but I am given to understand that it can be done...? From a non-faceblind person, the one on the left has a full beard which is probably the easiest to tell apart, the one second-to-left has a different expression, is clean shaven, and eyes closer together, the second-to-right one has a weird kind of half-beard, and the one on the right has a shorter face. Plus they all just kind of have different facial structure, idk how to describe it The last guy looks different. Beards are not faces; we can see beards. Ngl for me hair and facial hair is one of the easiest ways to tell someone apart but there is also other stuff like facial structure, nose, eye placement, stuff like that", "Some questions \n\nSo I am super curious, I understand all faces look the same to people suffering from face blindness so I have some questions. can you see flaws like acne, moles etc etc. can you see features like noses and mouths and eyes that just look the same on everyone and if so can you see different eye colors? Or are there just no features?  And can anyone draw me what a face looks like to you and send it to me? my proso is what i would call moderate, so while i can see that yes, what i am looking at is indeed a face, i cannot remember it at all. for example, i did not recognize my friend after they got their haircut, i do not recognize myself in old photos, etc. \ni can see things like acne and scars, and often use them to identify people (one of my friend has a scar on her forehead, which is how i know it is her for sure). i am able to see facial features, but i can visualize them in my head. i can see eye colour, and as far as i know most people with proso can. \nhope that helps! Can you see noses and if so do they all look the same yes and yes. i can see all facial features, and they all look the same. That is so strange I have a weird proposition for you ask some of your friends to find your two friends with the most drastically different noses and then feel them and see how different the real shape is to your reception. Also is the face that every human shares attractive? with covid i do not feel comfortable doing that, sorry. \n\nwith every face being the same, i do not really perceive physical attractiveness. Oh yeah right COVID skipped my mind, it was more for your sake so no need to apologize that is the kind of stuff I would do with a condition like that \n\nThat is a bummer are you attracted to bodies When people ask me this, I tell them that my eyes still work. I can still see acne, I still register eyes and nose and mouth and such. But it is like if I scribbled on some paper and showed you, then a minute later had ten other papers with scribbles and asked which one I showed you the first time. You might get lucky and say \"hey I remember that bit right there,\" but you are still probably not completely confident that you are right. It is just so strange to me that things that are different look the same. This phenomenon actually happens with none face blind people to a lesser degree and it is also intriguing. East Asians all look very similar to each other in Europeans eyes and Europeans look very similar to each other in East Asians eyes. not really, i am asexual anyway (no clue if there is a connection), so any attraction would be solely personality based. again that probably varies among people with proso, i doubt there is a correlation between this condition and sexuality. Oh well that is probably due to the asexuality then I wonder what people who experience sexual desire feel I definitely have mild to moderate facial blindness and i think a better way to explain it has to do with how you recognize faces in general. The human mind is trained to see eyes mouth nose kind of thing, my issue is that i cant tell the difference between nose shapes, subtle features, i guess? I see eye color, hair color, skin tone, style, body shape, and the way you hold yourself. How you move and your general shape are a lot of how i recognize people. I dont remember a face the moment i look away, i can remember traits as facts but i cant picture them in my mind. I cant picture any faces in my mind, actually. So i can tell when i see a face, when im looking at one i can list out facts about it but i probably cant describe shape details well, but i cant tell you what that face looked like after i look away. Anyone can be attractive to me facial wise if i love their personality That is so bizarre to me and interesting thanks a lot I do! I can answer this for me :) id say personality plays a huge factor to me (probably unrelated to facial blindness) and i find it a perk that i see the personality more than the face. If i love you im going to think youre beautiful no matter what you look like, and vice versa. I do body preferences, i guess? But im pretty flexible. I pay attention to how people decorate themselves for sure. Can i ask what they look like to you? I dont know what it like to remember faces They have slightly tan skin almost bronze freckles black hair a chiseled very defined nose a almost defined jaw rounded chin middle thickness lips light pink brown eyes very large long eyelashes Thanks Faces look the same to me as they do to everyone else. It is just that I cannot recognize them. \n\nImagine if you never saw the same person twice, or if someone is face changed every time you looked at them. It is just like that. Yes, actually all those particular things like scarfs help me to try to recognise people. \nMost of the time are things that I can not mention because the other person will think I am discriminating him/her because of that, like the guy with an asimetric eye or the girl with the weird ear. But it is not that at all, they are my only resources to recognise people. And also are things that do not usually change, like what could happen with a hair cut. Think about animals... Could you distinguish different individual birds from the same specie if they do not have any special particularity? Probably, you cannot. But they are actually different The same thing happens to me, I can not picture a face in my mind at all. Actually, I just realized there was something wrong with me when I was a young adult. Before that I used to think the rest of the people were just like me and when I used to watch a cryme movie/series where somebody was recognizing a face I used to think that was bullsh** since that was imposible to me. Lol i relate to that. At work i get asked if i recognize someone often and that is not a fun game... That sounds like a book. I can imagine freckles, a skin tone, the and large eyes and eyelashes separately. Im not sure how to combine it in my mind. I could attempt to draw this, that could be something fun to try, since im an artist and faceblind. (Which i have noticed few of us are) Absolutely I can see the features of the face. It is not a problem of seeing, but a problem of recognition. Non-faceblind people have special brain circuitry for face recognition, which faceblind people lack. Imagine you suddenly need to recognize all your friends and family by their hands only. Of course you can see their fingers and nails. But unless you remember that they are wearing a particular ring, or have a scar on their hand or something, you will find that hard to do. Have you ever walked around a room looking for your car keys only to find them forever later in a spot you had already looked a million times? It is like that but with faces. \nI can see the face. The correct information just does not register as important to me in order to always put a name with that face. \nI use conditions a lot to recognize people. I see work people at work and friends in the same towns I have always seen them in. I do not do too bad if I expect to see someone within their context, but when I see someone from work at the store or run into someone at a get together for another area of my life I normally do not know who that person is. I see just fine, it is not like there is a censorship pixelation over the face of anyone I look at.\n\nBut the part of my that registers the geometry/layout of their face and ties it to that identity does not work so well.\n\nIt seems to be worse in person than looking at images as well, there might be a stereoscopic sight vs flat image aspect to that as well. It is not like every human \u201dshares a face\u201d for us. We just struggle with remembering and recalling and recognizing faces. We still see. You know how some people are able to speed read by recognizing the shapes of words and sentences and do not need to scrutinize the individual letters?  That is how normal people are with faces.  With Prosopagnosia of course it varies for everyone, but recognizing faces is like having to say \"that is an \"r\" followed by \"e\", \"a\" \"d\" what does that spell?  \"read!\"  Now is that present or past tense (is this a work friend or a school friend)? It is more memory and not actual blindness. I can SEE people. I just cannot remember what they look like to find them again. \n\nIt is like plants. You can see plants. You see the branches, leaves, and petals. For the sake of what you are saying, trees have knots, squirrel nests, and other things specific to them.  Let us say people are trees. There are several outside my house that I see daily. And several more outside my office that I see daily. But if two trees magically switched places, or if I had to pick a tree out of a lineup of similar trees, would you be able to? The trees are familiar to me, but I would not recognize them out of context. I could do that but I also have a weirdly specific memory we are I remember everything I see not photographic I just remember weird details Best explanation so far thank you I met someone who said all faces look identical like the only thing that varied was eye color hair color skin color and blemishes like acne and scats I can do the speed reading thing so this really helped me understand Great explanation Flaws make someone EASIER to identify. Think of if you were in a room full of people named Kevin and Karen: the one couple named Bob and Sharon would stand out to you, right?\n\nI see faces, they just all appear the same-ish. When you look at a foreign language script, you still SEE things on a page, you just cannot pick out immediately which characters are subtly different. \n\nAnd then when I try to recall faces to mind, I recall hats, facial hair, moles, clothing etc, but faces are kind of generic like this \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\n\nIt is \"a\" face. It is not a blank blur or a ( or something alien, it is just **a** face. \n\nLike, when you look at a den of cute bunnies on a natural program, you do not go, \"oh there is Sheila and that one is flower and that one is King Pingu\", you go \"that is a rabbit and that is a rabbit and that is a rabbit\". Trained professionals can tell their animals apart. You still see rabbit, you just do not see which one is King Pingu. When reading this description I can mentally picture generic google-image search results type outlines of each of those things, but I cannot \"place\" them onto a real human face and definitely not together. :\\ I cannot mentally imagine my own face having freckles for example. For me, it is less that all faces look the same and more that one person can have multiple 'faces' depending on how their makeup is done, how they wear their hair, or even what expression they are making.  The longer I know someone, the more of their 'faces' I learn and the better I am at recognizing them.  I still cannot picture their face in my head though.  I have never failed to recognize my mom, but I cannot 'see' her face unless I am actually looking at it. Face blindness is not like a problem with your eyes. It is really more of a problem with processing faces and facial features. So you can see the differences in some faces but it is hard to compare them? \n\nFor me at least, (I would say I am only somewhat faceblind) even if I know someone and can recognize them I cannot describe their face. \n\n(I am terrified I will witness a crime or something because I would not be able to help the sketch artist make a composite of the perp.)\n\nI also really struggle with translating features to a different angle, so if you show me images of someone from different angles I might not be able to  determine if they are all of the same person. \n\nIt took me a long time to figure out I was mildly faceblind because many of the online tests use one image of each person so I can just memorize the details and not the actual faces. Huh me too. No idea if there is a connection but you are not alone It is not quite that faces look the same. They are distinct when I am looking at them, just as soon as I look away it is fallen straight out of my mind. By the time I have looked back they might as well have swapped places with someone sort of similar for all I would notice. \nI can tell what features someone has, could even remember some of them later but the click of recognition just is not there. \nI can tell you that my friend Dawn is about 5'3 with brown eyes, hair, olive skin and an eyebrow piercing but if you stuck her in with half a dozen other brunettes with piercings I would not be sure which one she was.\nWell except she would be the one waving cause she knows I am useless :P \n\nI worked for a charity and did not realise my two fellow staff members were actually 4 fellow staff members until it was someone is birthday and we all gathered in the same room because they were all brunette white women. \n\nI try to learn specific features to help me recognise people but of course hair makeup and outfit changes all the time. Walk style works but only from a distance! \n\nGenerally speaking in any given group of people it is the ones who are most distinctive that I recognise first. For example in a social club I go to after about 3 years I can usually find the group by spotting either the 6'2 black guy with the shitty beard, the girl with awful teeth, or the girl with all the piercings. \nThis only works if I am expecting to see that group and I am looking around the meeting place for them though. If I ran into any of them anywhere else I would have no idea who they were. \nI failed to recognise my own Nan until 15 mins into a conversation because I saw her at the shopping centre rather than in my neighborhood.\n\nIt puts a big cramp in my social life because even if I meet someone and get on great and we chat for two hours, when I see them next week (or after one of us goes to the bathroom lol) I will not know who they are unless they introduce themselves by name... Which usually only happens once! \nInternet friendships are useful because everyone comes with name labels :P i thought i was the only one who was terrified of being called to do police sketches, so happy to hear somebody else thinks the same way", "If you cant laugh at yourself. Some post are upvoted with the watermark image.  ugh, another one of these karma farming bot posts", "I had to ask my son if this was true... ", "Anyone try Revere or another tool/app to help remember people? I recently heard about ( (thanks to a newsletter) and I am mixed between \"oh this seems like a crazy way to compensate for my issues organizing details about people's lives\" and... \"this is genius.\" Basically, it lets you jot down reminders about the people in your life, i.e. how you met, basic details, and an option for reminders to wish them luck with an interview or to call them back. \n\nFor folks who, in addition to difficulty recognizing people, also struggle with keeping details about a person's life.... have you tried an app or note-taking method or any other kind of \"rolodex\" to supplement that difficulty with recall? ugh... that app seems cool. i would honestly download it in a heartbeat, but i am a bit privy when it comes to privacy, lol.\n\ni believe a lot of what makes it hard (for me, at least) about remembering details of people is that i lack the physical reference to associate that information with them. \n\nwhat i did back in my university days was keeping a moleskine journal with a page or two dedicated to people i would met relatively frequently and divided the journal by setting: classes, extracurriculars, work, the coffee shops...\n\nthen i got a bit more abstract and assigned each one a very specific colour based on how i felt around them, and then marked their pages with that same very specific colour (from my designer sister\u2019s infinite copic marker stash) and that gave me the more sensory side of remembering people i was missing.\n\ni do not keep a journal anymore, but i still do the colour thing in my mind, and it kind of works well most of the time. This sounds so useful! I would feel slightly creepy using it and it would be awkward if people found out I guess. Pity that it is not available for android, would have loved to try it I do this anyways under the contacts in my phone, there is a place for notes. I also like to add their picture to their contact info.", "Cant remember faces unless I interacted with the person for a short amount of time I have this problem where I cant remember faces even if if see the person everyday but from afar but if I spent 10 minutes interacting with the person ,then I can remember their face and name on spot or in my head.\n\nI am not sure if its prosopagnosia or not.\n\nI can remember faces in my head or real life but only after my brain \"stored\" the information in the first place.\nI have this issue since teenage years, I used to work as a waiter but quit because it was difficult, also I had to pass jobs because I couldnt asociate names with new people or orders That is really quite normal. Not storing what is not important is normal. Just seeing someone is not really important, but having a meaningful conversation is important to you. I dont think its normal, I mixed orders quite often and  have trouble remembering new faces ,from my own observation this doesnt happen to alot of people at least to this extent. True, like most things, facial recognition is a spectrum. You are definitely below average in this regard. Depends how you recognize them. From specific features or just automatically? Unless the person stands out a little , they almost look the same , it sucks I had to drop job oportunities because I would either mix people up or orders. Ah, yeah. Then that is prosopagnosia.", "Weddings are pure hell with face blindness I am not diagnosed with anything, all I know is that I am really bad with faces.\n\nI had a wedding to attend yesterday, which is always a source of dread. (On the other hand, Halloween parties are great! Nobody is expected to recognize anyone in costume, and costumes are way easier to remember) I spent a half hour on Facebook feverishly looking up extended family members to try to embed their face in my mind and was doing okay surreptitiously referencing the name tags for the table numbers. \n\nThen out of nowhere this older man came up to me and, seeing the blank look on my face, said rather aggressively \u201cYOU KNOW WHO I AM, RIGHT?\u201d \n\nOh god. \n\nI replied \u201cSorry, I am really bad with faces\u201d so he told me his name, which I immediately forgot in my panic.\n\nI thought that would be the end of it but he must have sensed my panic and smelled blood because a few moments later he said \u201cSO, what is my name then?\u201d \n\n\u201c....I, uh, cannot remember...\u201d (killme)\n\nSo he proceeded to quiz me! \u201cYou are friends with my son\u201d (ohgodwhatson) \u201cwhat is HIS name?\u201d \n\nOut of pure luck I picked one of my male cousin\u2019s names and got it right. Jack. \n\nHe explained that his name was also Jack, that I have met him several times, and that he remembers *me* very well. Awesome. I said some niceties and slunk away to die in a corner. \n\nWeddings are torture. Is it possible to get an actual diagnosis so I can explain to people that I really cannot help it?! Not really. You do not need a diagnosis to say you have face blindness, and whether or not you have a diagnosis most people like that guy will probably not care. He sounds like a meanie anyway I ran into a woman at the store the other day. She recognized me and said, \"You do not know who I am, do you.\"\n\nI explained, without embarrassment, that I am faceblind and told a funny story about not recognizing my husband in some situations. We laughed, she told me she was, we moved on.\n\nBut I agree, weddings are pure hell. I agree on every point. Wow, what a rude asshole. How important does he think he IS in your life?? This sounds like a better way to go about it! I will just try being up front next time :) Well as u/itsdeliberate said, probably nothing would have worked with this guy. I have trouble recognising my husband and family in older photos if I have not seen those photos before. :/ \n\nIt is okay you should not have to feel bad. he sounds mean. I found the solution to this, at least for my own wedding. My table name plaques were also badges! Every badge had who they were and their relationship to my wife and I.\n\nIt took some effort to laser cut and engrave them all, but was well worth it. It turns out even normal people have name issues in a wedding. They just cover it better. \ud83d\ude05 Ha totally understand this.\n\nI actually just had a company wide event where I work where about 500 people flew in that I have only seen over video conferencing.\n\nThat is always an exercise in embarrassment every year. He sounds like an ass.  Forgetting him seems like a good plan.\n\nI know what you are talking about with weddings...except I am really an idiot.  For awhile I worked as a wedding coordinator.  At least the bride and groom are easy, but bridesmaids...(shudder.)\n\nI think very few people have an official diagnosis for this.  It is a spectrum, so although you probably cannot tell if your percentile is technically low enough without a test, you can clearly self-diagnosis if it is a problem.  Most people around here seem to self-identify as face blind or rely on an online test instead of an official diagnosis.  I do not think it is like saying that you have other things without an official diagnosis, because it is so uncommon. Cousins once removed", "Can you identify bits of faces? For instance, this old puzzle book challenged *Star Trek* fans to identify characters by just their nose, lips, eyes, etc. I find this utterly impossible (and am honestly intimidated by the very youthful handwriting of the child who apparently got them all!). I assume this is because I have prosopagnosia--but it occurs to me that some prosopagnosics use fixating on individual features as a coping strategy, and might find this really easy. Which are you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n( No, no I cannot.  The only one I am even remotely confident of was Spock's mouth, and if it did not say Star Trek everywhere, I would have had zero idea. Context clues! Got To love  them. Well, here I was, thinking \"heck yeah, I use facial features to tell people I know well apart, and I have seen Star Trek,  so I got this!\" I do not. I do not got this. Even reading the filled in names I do not know.\n\nEdit: I meant to say specific facial features, like a nose, eye color, etc. Family not celebrities As a lifelong Star Trek TOS fan, I have to say that Spock's mouth is easy, the others... impossible. I would find this very stressful, to think that I would be expected to know a two-inch sliver of someone is face. I have stared at them enough that I can recognize a lot of them. \n\nNoses, no hope, but I can recognize with absolute certainty Nimoy's eyes (funnily enough, I once recognized his *ear*, the human one, when he first appeared in Fringe). \n\nI also was fairly sure about Chekov and Nimoy's mouths, and Kirk's eyes. But they all get a *lot* of close zooms during the show. I was sure I would be able to ID Star Trek characters but only Spock apparently. Nope, by looking at those pictures i did not get a single one right and I have watched an absurd about of trek in my life. I recognize Spock's slight frown, but that is more related to \"how the character carries himself\" than a physical feature. If you did not tell me this was Trek related I would not have recognized it as Spock. Context is key. \n\nI could not make heads or tails with any of the other pictures. In fact, I cannot even mentally place those features against a memory of a real human face. 10 and 11 together in that place looks a bit like Elvis Presley? You can easily convince me these are all the same person with different expressions and make up. Spock is really obvious, and I think 12 is the doctor dude, but I though 12 was Captain Kirk at first, so IDK According to whoever filled it out, 12 is \"checkoff\" which I assume is Chekov. But I have absolutely no way of telling whether they were right :/ Follow-up question: can \\*anyone\\* do this? Not even a little bit.  And I agree with the other commentor - surely this is not a thing that most people can do, right?  As I understand it, the human brain does not identify individual pieces, but the whole face as a collective? good point. I have not watched a lot of Star Trek (my mom is a big fan) so I only know a few characters. Spock's face is simply so uniquely built that it is a lot easier to pick out than most faces I have seen. Until I read that this was all Star trek actors, I was going to guess that bottom-right is Cary Grant... I think you are right, so I tested it.  I made my husband look at them.  He has good facial recognition and loves Star Trek.\n\n1. Until he knew it was Star Trek, he did not know any of them.  He recognizes faces out of context in general.\n\n2. He recognized the Spock one everyone did right away.  \n\n3. He then started imagining the faces in his head and matching them to the pictures, but it was slow and took him a little time. \n Some he was not sure about due to it being black and white and the quality of the photo.\n\nI have not watched enough Star Trek to be able to do it, but in general I have found if part of the face is visible I will be better or worse than others.  It depends if that is a part I use.\n\nExample: I am a teacher and I see my kid's whole faces (and can recognize them) over Zoom, but in person they are wearing masks, so I only see eyes.  Some kids have distinct eyes (and other visible features,) so they are easy to recognize just with that.  I use the chin/mouth of one of my students to recognize her I think, and never know who she is in person.  (We only see them briefly for supply pick up.  I am sure I would learn another way if we were in person.)", "r/prosopagnosia is up and running again!

The sub is small enough that any relevant content would be welcome imo.", "I was so proud of myself-oops! This happened 50 years ago, old doll here!  I started going to a new school, I mean a school new to me (high school).  We were told to learn names and faces, there was going to be a test, just for fun (obviously I am paraphrasing here, do not remember the details!).  So I really really worked at learning the names of the seven other girls in my class.  We all trooped into the assembly room, a bunch of girls walked up to the front and stood in a line, either pointed at or prearranged, I have no idea, we had to write down their names.  That was when I realised they had meant us to learn EVERYBODY'S name and face (it was a small school!).  I had learned the seven names in alphabetical order by surname, and know the list to this day! Congratulations! (I envy you.)", "I never realised how much I relied on little things like eye colour  THOSE ARE 2 DIFFERENT PEOPLE. YOU CANNOT CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE Maybe my colorblindness *is* related to my inability to recognize people. \n\nInteresting. Oh its worse than I thought. I didnt recognise her at all. Who is it? Pretty sure it is Zooey Deschanel. WHAT OH MY GOD AKSNKDJD I DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS AT ALL The main character in new girl. the easiest thing for me to \"recall\" about a person has always been their eyes or just the color of their eyes. Sometimes though, I cannot remember at all what their eyes look like, cause I recently developed a tendency to avoid eye contact. \n\nIf someone puts on contacts or changes their hair (does not matter if it is the actual haircut or just how they style it) or puts makeup on, then I am guaranteed to have a very difficult time recognising them at first. People literally look like a whole another person if they change their \"key features\" cause I do not notice face features that well Emily Deschanel sister? She looks like Mary Elizabeth Winstead", "Clark Kent and Superman I am sure we have all heard the jokes about Clark Kent just putting on glasses and suddenly no one recognizes him as Superman. \n\nMy whole life, even before I knew about prosopagnosia, I thought to myself, \u201cYeah, I probably would not even recognize him without his glasses.\u201d Hahaha neither would i The joke is mostly from Clark and Kal being drawn near-identically in comics, both because artists are ~~lazy~~ economic and so that readers could easily make the connection between the characters.\n\nIn-universe, there tend to be excuses like \"he carries himself differently; he uses different muscle tension on his face; the glasses have some kind of psuedo-hypnotic thing going on; he has 'super-acting' powers, etc\". There was even mention in one story, I think, of Clark Kent as a TV newsreader having a direct dissolve to Superman's face as he was being interviewed, and *still* no-one picked it up.\n\nSo, yeah, if we lived in a DC universe, we probably would not figure it out - but then again, almost no-one would.", "Pronouns and facial blindness I am an instructor in a medium sized college. I just met our new group of students and almost all of them introduced themselves with pronouns. \nHow on earth am I to remember pronouns when I cannot remember their faces or names? I know they are our students because they are here in our facilities. I will work closely with about 5 students this semester and will slowly start to recognize them. The other students... well they are perpetual strangers to me.\nI have walked past friends, neighbors and family before and I cannot follow tv shows or movies. It is always been a bit of an awkward problem that has never offended before. As the teacher you have the authority to have them make name tags/signs that they will keep on their desks during class, and you can tell them to write their pronouns on them too. We made name signs on one of my courses and it was really fun. We only did names but I wish we had done pronouns too. Do like I do.\n\n\u201cMorning, fuckers. How is everyone doing?\u201d Do not waste your time ... the pronoun kids will eventually die off due to gluten, dairy or other dangers they may face. If it is a college, you are dealing with (probably young) adults. So have a conversation. Be honest.\n\n\"I have prosopagnosia. Face blindness. It will take a while for me to remember your names. Might not happen. That also means that I will have a hard time remembering your pronouns. If I make a mistake with your name or pronouns, I am apologise. It is not intentional. If I do make a mistake, feel free to correct me. Or do not if you are not comfortable doing so.\"\n\nOr however you feel like wording it. I have zero experience as a teacher, so take this with a grain of salt... but does your job have a PR or disability office that teachers can talk to? I would give them a heads up about your prosopagnosia in case a student gets deeply offended and tries to get you in trouble.\n\nI also agree with what u/meoka said. I have noticed a lot of people who openly ID as non-binary or trans also include a lot of conditions like ADHD, autism, bipolar, etc on their profiles. Many of these folks might be more curious and patient with your proso if educated on it before you accidentally misgender them. Good luck! Everyone has pronouns. Just be open, tell them if you make a mistake feel free to correct you, and if they have any questions, if you feel comfortable, let them ask you. That way it can be a two way street. I say set some time aside so that introductions can be done with time to spare. Also if there is any people that would feel bad correcting you have them drop you a discrete note after class with their name and pronoun and make a list you can see on your desk in a discrete place till you learn. It is harder for you if you keep quite and say nothing. The thing is, I am just a small cog in a large program. I will only have the entire group for like 10% of their time in our program. I will never see them as a whole group, so I would have to do my spiel like 30x.\n\nI have had a number of trans students before, they were no big deal, they just used the pronouns of their new gender.\n\nThe problem with the students today is that almost all had different mixed pronouns. It was mind boggling. She/them, she/his, they/he, sir/they and everything in between. \n\nAt most I might remember a few names to faces by the end of the semester, but this is like requiring me to know way too much about each individual. I would literally have to walk around with a sheet of pictures, names and pronouns. My co workers know all about my face blindness. I have walked past them and not recognized them when they were not in their usual areas! I will tell my boss though, just in case! My mother suggested a similar approach! Great! Having multiple co workers who know and have experienced your proso will be of significant help if a student tries to get you in trouble. Maybe send them an email, or if it is in person print it off to hand them with whatever else you give them.\n\nAs for the mixed ones, I doubt there was actually any that were \"she/his\" as changing it based on sentence would be odd. Maybe \"her/him\" or \"she/he\"  \nEither way, if there is multiple, so long as you can remember one of them, you should be good.\n\nSo if someone says that their pronouns are she/him and you just use female pronouns, you should be fine. Or if you just use male pronouns, should also be fine.  \nSo of the list a person gives you, pick one that is easiest for you to remember and just go with that. You should get close enough for there not to be any issue. Not only that, but every*thing* has pronouns.\n\n&gt;That is a rock. It is big.\n\nThe word \"it\" is the rock's pronoun.\n\n&gt;That is The Rock. He is big.\n\nThe word \"he\" is The Rock's pronoun. I have to tell faculty and staff that I am faceblind.     Recently, I have had several people that I have disclosed to tell me about their own prosopagnosia, and how that is impacted their lives and teaching. It is been really good for me to see that it is possible to have a career while having a facial perception disorder. Not only that but it is possible to hold down a job that requires you to interact with people while remembering who they are. My high school English teacher was really strict about seating charts, and prosopagnosia was why. I knew of someone who was really bad, he printed out names, ID photos, and faces of everyone he interacted with. He then put the finished poster on his office wall. \n\nI am trans lol, this would not hurt me. Using neutral language is common for young people and using they/them pronouns when you do not know is never a bad choice. Assuming you have a list of names, jot down their pronouns on that list.  Then once you figure out who they are, you can refer back to it.  Honestly, when teaching you really do not use pronouns of individual students a lot and you can almost always use a workaround to avoid it.  Not knowing names is typically harder. Honestly, my solution in situations like this is to just try to avoid using pronouns altogether until I comfortably recognize a person (and by then it is a lot easier to associate the right pronouns with them if I know them). It is not usually that hard to avoid since you use pronouns when you are talking *about* someone, but in most cases in their presence I imagine you are talking *to* them directly and do not need to use pronouns at all since you would not be using third person. Names are a lot more likely to be necessary than pronouns.\n\nAlso, in my experience most people are not going to immediately get angry or offended if you use the wrong pronouns by accident, and will just correct you nicely. That gives you an opening to apologize and explain if you want to. I do not think the average person expects anyone to instantly memorize the pronouns (or even the names) of everyone they have just met. :) Coming from a twenty something she/they I would recommend using they as a baseline if your not sure what the right pronouns are. Even if it is not a pronoun they usually use, most will not be offended by it. Just use neutral they/them or direct you/your for speaking directly to them, and you are unlikely to have a problem, especially if you respond to questions about that, with the fact that you have prosopagnosia, or if you are able, maybe even send out an email to your students explaining the situation? (I have also suggested to students or those who are sensitive about incorrect pronoun usage that they wear a pronoun pin when they feel comfortable doing so) I highly reccomend name tags. I kept them and either put them out before class or let them pick them up. Helped me keep track of attendance too as I did not want to let on that I was face blind so students did not try and fool me over attendance. I also addressed everyone by name and used they/them most of the time to be safe. Agree with this, 1 gazillion percent. Were I in your place I would also say it is a neurological (or medical \u2014 your choice) condition, as that would help emphasize there really is not anything you can do about it.\n\nThe only problem admitting to being faceblind that *might* happen (and I am bringing this up *only* because I can think like a real a*hole)\u2026..a less-than-honest student might use that to their advantage. The first thought that comes to mind is paying someone to take exams for them (NOTE: Please know if things have changed with so much being computer-based and virtual that this is unlikely\u2026.it is because I took my last college exam in the \u201880s, well before I had my first email address.) I had that thought as well, but then it is really the student's problem.\n\nIt means they will be unprepared for whatever comes next (class or job) and fail at it.  Go by body type, hair, etc. I understand it is tricky to remember a ton of people, I struggle with it daily. Try and associate key information (name, pronouns) with something about their appearance that is not likely to change daily, but is not there face. Hair, body type, body language, and voice is how I identify people. I have still called people the wrong name, just apologize and move on in the case of a wrong name or pronoun. I did name tags too! When I started the semester, I explained the disability accommodations policy to students, then told them this was my accommodation. \"By the way, I have this weird condition called prosopagnosia, so if you see me outside of this classroom and I do not acknowledge you, it is because I do not recognize you. I would appreciate it if you could fill out these name tags for when you are in this classroom so that I can get to know you all.\"\n\nIt was great; it opened the door for students to approach me about their own accommodations.", "To All The Boys I ever Loved is very hard to watch The male leads look exactly the same THIS! I was thinking how hard it was to tell apart the main guy from the guy friend but I thought it was just me The movie PS I love you was difficult for me to watch because the two male leads look the same.   Ah yes they did! It was so confusing.  A boo that is on my watch list. I have been confused watching the same actress play twins so I will definitely be confused with this show.  Orphan Black is a show that is pleasantly EASY to watch. It had one girl and one guy playing the majority of the characters. They change hairstyles and mannerisms and it took me three episodes to realize there was just the one actress.", "I just ended up on this sub and was looking for references to Blood-Drenched Beard, but was surprised I did not find any! (just to clarify, I do not have prosopagnosia) \nBlood-Drenched Beard is a really great book (one of my personal all-time favorites) about this one guy who lives in Brazil and has prosopagnosia, and goes to a coastal town looking for what happened to his grandfather, a local mistery.\n\nI could have sworn that this book would be all over this sub, but to my surprise, nothing at all! idk if this sub is recent, if the book is only famous in Brazil or something, but anyway I thought I would leave the suggestion here. Really recommend it This sub has been around for a while, but I have never heard of the book before.\n\nCould be a regional thing. The sub is 99% English-language. It is probably not surprising that a non-English-language author is not that well-known. Particularly since only one of his books has apparently been translated into English and that was seven years ago.", "My story I never knew about prosopagnosia or thought I might have it until my mid-40s. Life has been a bit of an adventure in that regard...\n\nIn the third year of my second degree, someone came up and greeted me and said she had been in many of my classes and acted like we would interacted before. I had no idea who she was.\n\nThe first few days on a new job were always a nightmare: being introduced to a dozen people and forgetting what each of them looked like. If you have ever seen the 1994 movie Clean Slate where an amnesiac character has to pretend he knows his coworkers and is brought in during a birthday celebration, you will know the feeling.\n\nNot being able to remember someone is face if I only met them once, or even twice. Knowing that I would not be able to pick them out of a crowd and would have to rely on them coming up to me.\n\nBeing thrown off by someone shaving or growing facial hair. Learning to rely on the way someone moves or microexpressions to recognize them.\n\nMy relationship with my ex had many moments of hilarity:\n\nWalking past him on a busy street, wearing some of his clothes, and not recognizing him even as he looked at me.\n\nWatching a movie where I knew famous actor X would be in it, and asking when they would show up, and having my ex point to the screen and say \"That is them right there.\"\n\nAnd many, many faux pas over the years:\n\nShowing up to a blind date twice in one year with the same guy, and having him be extremely angry that I did not remember him from the first time.\n\nTalking to a short, dark-haired nurse about my mother's care, then turning away for a minute to make a call, going to find her to continue the conversation, and realizing I would started talking to another short, dark-haired nurse who had no idea what I was asking about.\n\nI have learned to compensate. I still struggle with two areas: Not being able to see myself properly in a mirror, and forgetting what people looked like when I no longer see them (my ex, people from past jobs).", "Is this considered Prospagnosia? I think I have it but I am not 100% sure because if I see the same person (in a classroom setting/ office setting) for a period of time (ranging from 1 week to 1 month onwards), I would be able to recognise them either by name, face or their job position.\n\nI do struggle with identifying landmarks &amp; rely heavily on Google Maps for a while especially for new locations I am unfamiliar with. Still get lost even with Google Maps though lol.\n\nHowever, I do have issues with shows (especially Chinese shows) where there is clans so there is a huge amount of actors dressed similarly. I would have issues differentiating them, especially if the main character is part of the clan unless the camera focuses only on the main character.\n\nFor people I just met/ meet only once (customers in customer service maybe), I would not remember them because I do not see them daily. So the most I will remember is the gender &amp; attitude (so if they are really nice or an absolute asshole). I have a hard time remembering pretty much anything about them.\n\nDoes this mean I have it or not? Not looking for an official diagnosis but some opinions. TIA Remember facial recognition is a spectrum.  You have super recognizers on one end who would remember a customer they met once years later and people who cannot recognize their own spouse ever on the other end.\n\nI can learn to recognize people.  Depending on how many people I have to learn and how distinct they are it can be with just a couple of times meeting them or can take almost a year.  One thing though is I am definitely recognizing them by feature identification not by their face as a whole.\n\nI do not have any issues with locations.  (That is a separate condition - topographic agnosia, I think??? that is correlated with prosopagnosia.)\n\nIf I had to guess from your post, I would say yes, by the way. Thank you! I have been constantly told I am just not trying hard enough &amp; that there is a zillion ways on the Internet to solve this issue so it made me scared I was just being abnormal.\n\nI see! Did not know about the locations one! Thanks for mentioning the term. I do still get to my destination, albeit taking forever, so I guess it is not too huge an issue.\n\nIs there any ways to improve on it? Like, well, writing down people's characteristics/ have people's photos etc? It sounds creepy but I guess it will be a starting point, personally did not find this method helpful though. Totally get that.  \n\nAt my first \"real\" job, I realized that I did not know my co-workers names and I was past the point where it was okay to ask.  I am socially aware enough to know that that is not normal, so I tried harder.  I have a pretty good verbal memory, so by focusing completely on what they were saying I A.) Recognized them even less, and B.) Remembered just about everything they said...if I could figure out who said it.  Like your daughter's friend's wedding is March 2nd level of stuff.  So then I was trying to pretend I did not know stuff, because it is creepy to remember that much stuff about people.  And I felt like I was being a complete, uncaring jerk.  It was a relief to figure out what was going on.\n\nSo - from experience - trying harder does not do anything.  Who is telling you to try harder, by the way?  If it is someone from work, I would consider getting an official diagnosis.  If it is friends/family, I would consider whacking them on the head, interrogating them on what the internet solutions are (which will be for recall of names - I could learn them names that go with 25 desks by lunch when I was a sub, so that is not the issue...no one asks you to know names of desks,) and lecturing them on face blindness.  I think there is like a 60 minutes episode or something like that you could probably find on YouTube to make them watch.\n\nAs far as improving there is no real \"cure\" although there are various things people are trying out.  I find photos are a no-go for me; I cannot reliably recognize people from photos in the first place, although they can help me match a name with a demographic.  But there are a lot of coping mechanisms that make life easier that I kind of think of in two categories:\n\n1. Stuff to help you recognize people better.  Basically what helps me the most is concentrating on features that make the person distinct.  These can be facial feature, the way they move, their voice, or whatever.  Also, contextual clues, like where you see them and how they react to seeing you.\n\n2. Stuff to help you deal with not recognizing people.  You can try to control your environment (like showing up an hour early if you are meeting someone for coffee and bringing a book.)  You can also lead the conversation in different ways to try to guess the identity of someone while being vague (like \"What are you doing this weekend?\" may help you figure out they have kids, which can narrow it down.)  Pretending you are preoccupied (that book in the coffee shop) or being smiling and saying hi to strangers can help you with \"ignoring\" people that you are supposed to know.  Finally, you can just tell people...but some of them will be weird about it, because it is not well known.\n\nGood luck! At my first job, I at least knew my supervisor's name (still remember the name, bad experience, face memory gone though). At my second, improvement because I knew the names of 5 people. Having a verbal memory is good for some stuff too! I have pretty horrible verbal memory, cannot hold information in my head for long. I went ahead to memorise people (in office setting) by their seats/ position. So this dude is my boss, that dude is my team's supervisor etc (screw names, I end up with \"EXCUSE ME\"; rude, I know). Well, if someone talked about their personal stuff to a detailed level, I honestly do not find it surprising for someone to have remembered it. If you did not want anyone knowing, the person probably should not have even mentioned it. And if you did remember it, you can always use it as a conversation starter like \"Oh, you mentioned before xxx happened, so how was it?\" and normally, people will get shocked like \"How did you know?\" and then continue the conversation.  \n\n\nI guess, my workplace was more of a \"mind your own business\" kind &amp; nobody expected anyone to know everyone in the office. It was my father who told me that there is always a solution out there by someone who is already went through these issues &amp; it is that I never put in enough effort or time to find them, implement them &amp; improve on my own situation so I am just blindly complaining about it to him without trying to solve it myself. I sincerely hated orientation camps with a passion because of this issue, especially games that require you to use names in a consecutive chain. I do not happen to have photographic memory &amp; probably only caught like, 2 people's name at the end of the day because I only interacted with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDamn! You are good with names of desks. I cannot even. I could remember 1 name &amp; forget in the next 5 minutes of doing other things after the introduction. I will try with a video sometime. I tried verbal explanations &amp; all I got was a \"It is not normal to not recognise, like for example, your ex-boss, in public.\" Point being \"EX\" so the moment I got out of the job, most information I obtained from there just flies out of the window.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realised photos did not work too well for me too. I could look at graduation albums &amp; instead rely on the names to identify someone or I would not recognise them irl because changes (it is like common to dye hair here in whatever colours so it just gets more confusing). Thank you for taking the time to share your suggestions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I suck at observations but I will try to concentrate on features at the next opportunity I get! I have never told others except this one friend who, thankfully, just nodded in acknowledgment but afterwards whenever we met, he will wave so I can recognise him with whatever changes. Controlling the environment seems like an interesting method. So far, I have mostly only hung out with people I know for a while so it is a date through message where I already identified the person's name so I go early &amp; the person would find me instead &amp; sit down at my table (scheming haha). I have tried to just smile &amp; say hi if I do not know the person who knows me but shit always shows on my face &amp; most people would find out I do not know them lol. I spent nearly 50 years thinking that I wasnt trying hard enough, until I discovered I had prosopagnosia. It sounds like you have it too, but there are varying degrees of it, also some add-ons such as your problem with location and direction. Im ok with location and maps but I cannot tell cars apart. \n\nI too had difficulties in the workplace and seemed to have a death wish for picking jobs where I had to recognise people. After I discovered prosopagnosia I struggled for a couple of years, determined to overcome it by learning new techniques, but really nothing made a difference (although I appreciate that is not the case for everyone). Some people are really good at explaining their prosopagnosia to work colleagues and friends and creating a support system that works for them. I tried but gave up after I would heard too much of  \"but I am bad with faces too\". The only one who took me seriously was an acquaintance who has Aspergers. Eventually I decided to embrace my shortcomings. I changed jobs and now make no effort at all to recognise people, so it is a bonus if I do. My family are supportive, which really helps.  It also helps that I am not  sociable and avoid gatherings. The bottom line is that I will never be the same as everyone else so I might as well enjoy being me. Thank you for sharing your experience! To be fair, I have never found my ways with a legit map, not sure how to read it properly nor identify my current location. Google Maps felt more helpful but I still walk extra because I am really stupid with it. I cannot tell cars apart by brands because I do not know much about them. I guess I differentiate them by colours &amp; plate number or maybe if it is something like a car vs a super long ass limo (length). I would be crap useless if I ended up in police interrogations because of my goldfish memory, in addition to face recognition issues because I would not recognise a murderer standing in my face.\n\nI guess, you will have to recognise people to a certain extent no matter the job. (Screw customer service) I am still constantly picking up random techniques to \"try\" &amp; my dad be like (while angry about me bringing up the problem yet not trying to \"solve\" it), \"Let us go see the doctor\", to which I actually turned down because like hell a doctor is going to help me, do what? Take meds to recognise faces? Utter bullshit.\n\nI learnt to cope with smiling through everything. Only managed to screw up once in a decent while because I do not even leave my house much. I cannot say my family is supportive whatsoever but I know they love me, just that my dad does not believe in this kind of mental issue bs. I do recognise people who I interact with at a workplace but outside my department, I would not even know their names/ position. But yes, I agree I will not be the same as everyone. I have never been \"normal\" like anyone else. In some countries a doctor can give you a disability diagnosis that helps with your employment. This might be worth a doctor's appointment.\n\nI was interested in your comments about vehicles. I used to think my problem was due to not knowing anything about them but then I tried to learn and still could not do it. I am not exactly sure what part of it does not compute - I look at cars but something that is supposed to happen just does not. I think this sometimes extends to other objects. As an example I saw my daughter's dog in the garden and for a second it looked like some sort of horrible misshapen moving shape. Then the shape made sense and I recognised it was a dog. A bit alarming but it does not happen too often. I do not think mine has...but I will check it out! Thank you for the information. I suspect my country would probably look down on disability diagnosis in employment to be honest. Considering how incentives are required for people to want to hire those with disabilities most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have not tried learning about them to a large extent but what about looking at logos? So if you know their logos, maybe you know it is x brand. I am not sure if I have memory issues or identification issues because I would not recognise a car I sat in after it got parked in a parking lot &amp; I walked away from it to deal with other things then had to go back to the car. I do not automatically remember plate numbers nor its colour. And people would be shocked I could not recall the way back to the car (but it is their car, not mine; they remember, I do not lol).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat sounds scary;; I do not think I have issues with animals to that extent. Mostly objects so far &amp; humans. Though if two similar looking dogs with different names were in my face, I will likely not recognise which is which unless there is some distinctive feature (maybe mole/ colour of collar etc). Applies to twins &amp; other objects too. Not to belittle your condition but if you know your daughter has a dog, I think it should not alarm you too much because you already \"know\" it exists &amp; can predict it to be the dog. I will be damned if it is a wild animal though. Mine is not that bad but I have real problems following tv shows, of course actors are usually trying to hide their real identity which makes it even worse. In some ways it can be a benefit because I am watching the acting rather than the actor, as long as the plot is not too complicated and they do not keep changing clothes. I see! Thanks for sharing your experience! Assuming there is not two lookalikes in a show, I am ok with realising that they are different people, just cannot identify who (I do not know nor can I remember famous actors/ other famous people, so I will be useless seeing one on a street lol).\n\nAppreciating the acting is good in its own way. I am not very observant &amp; my attention is mostly on subs &amp; action, I am not sure why I cannot hear &amp; process some English even though I am native so I rely heavily on subs &amp; miss out on a shitload of stuff. So I miss out on \"good acting\". I hate people who keep changing clothes, for fuck's sake. If I can, I will have to rewind the video numerous times to identify this one person so I understand the plot My wife is resigned to me constantly asking who such and such is.\n\nSome people have faces that I get straight away, others fit into a set, so I know it is one of a few people but no idea which one, this is the same with some friends if I have not seen them in a while, I just have to have a generic conversation until I can work out which one of half a dozen people they are. \n\nI am pretty good at recognising voiceovers.\n\nStrangely I am at least as good at identifying twins as anyone else seems to be. My mum is resigned to me asking lol while my dad is just frustrated.\n\nI will take a while but sometimes my mind decides to volunteer the answer &amp; I suddenly know the name of the face. If it is in a particular setting (office), I will kind of know their faces but likely will not recognise them outside the setting.\n\nI suck with voiceovers unfortunately. Unfortunately I am also terrible at remembering people names even if I know who they are. It depends on how friendly someone is with me/ time. So if I talk to you often, high chance I will know your name. If we are classmates for a year, I will know your name too after a while. But if my classmates keep changing, I will be a mess with names :') I am much better at womens names, and faces if they are there in person. I solve the car ID problem by retaining a distinctive number plate ie it moves from one car to another. The weird animal thing isnt a worry, more of a curiosity as I cannot rationalise why it happens. I write science fiction so its int7f from that point of view, like I have discovered an alien There is some general visual agnosia that might be worth looking into further.  I have always wondered if I had trouble recognizing cars too, because it seems to be related.  I never know what kind of car people drive and do not know what models look like.  But I do not care about cars either.  (I am very interested in people.)  I can find MY car in a parking lot even if I forgot where I parked and I can recognize cars that are like my husband's on the road by the house, so I suspect I do not have an issue there. I love my job, but sometimes I fantasize about not having to recognize anyone at work ever.\n\nIt is a shame prosopagnosia (and there are probably thousands of other problems that are less common that the same is true) is not better known, because I feel like for many people knowing what is going on makes everything sooo much better. I have thought of that as being an advantage too.  Assuming what your viewing has characters with distinct personalities/appearances, so you can follow the plot easily, it is easy to pretend they are real.  My husband is always thinking who the actors are and what else they are in, which I think makes it harder to let go of reality for the time.", "A mom and 3 adult daughters? I cannot follow this damn movie Currently watching The Haunting of Hill House. There is a family with 3 daughters and a mom , and at least one of those women is in every scene. Every scene I am asking my gf who is who. Ugh. I swear they all look SOOO similar, they casted well lol. I thought I could tell them apart by hair, but nope not reliable when they have the same styles....\n\nUgh lol. I am sooo used to this, but damn is it annoying.  Look for specific features.  The mole on the one woman's face helped me. Thanks! Which woman\u2019s face tho? It also does not help that the plot skips around over three time periods, so the same characters are played by different people depending on how old they are in a given scene. I had so much trouble with this one too. Thank you!!!! Haha did not expect to get a break down  Yes.  I was just telling my wife about the trouble I have had following that show (she is not face blind, but does not enjoy that type of show - Normally I can get her to help me out!!). There was a post on here a few weeks ago about watching shows with  subtitles/close captioning turned on.  I think someone recommended using Descriptive Video for this show.\n\n( Ohhh yesss I live for subtitles. They are definitely extremely helpful for this when they have the names indicating who is speaking  I had the same problem! After 4-5 episodes I mostly figured out who was who but had to use mnemonics - Theo's face reminds me of someone I know who also happens to be an irresponsible lesbian in the psychology field, Shirley's reminds me of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who is... older? Nell is easy for me because of her delicate features. And the mom and kids... Well, I still rely on context and get confused sometimes. Haha that is smart!! Lemme see if I can make some associations. I was hoping Theo would look a bit dykey grown up so I was very confused and disappointed when she turned out to look just like everyone else lolol \n\nBut yea I will try that  Yep!   That was me.   Could not make heads or tails of the plot (at least where the Crain women were concerned), until I switched the audio channel to \"English - audio description.\"  Made all the difference, having a narrator tell me which sister that is waiting on the apartment, or whose ghost that was...   I had a lot of trouble with this one. I really enjoyed it, but it was hard to follow! I think I watched this one before I would really 'diagnosed' myself; I always thought that either I had a bad memory (I think I do, but that is another story!) or that everyone else would be having as much trouble as I was. Haha tHanks for your comment. \n\nYea same. I have a trash memory as well. It was very clear to me that I am the only one with these issues cuz I am the only one ever asking every scene who somebody is aha. I think memory also makes it harder for me to follow shows/movies. \n\nDo you think memory is related? Cuz this is a neuro issue right? I do not think that it is memory related. I wonder if my memory issues are more down to being extremely  disorganised and down to different things interesting me than most people; I do not have trouble remembering the things that interest me. Makes sense See, this is why I like This Is Us. Basically everyone has something about them that makes it easy to identify them.  I had trouble with this one too. My fianc\u00e9 decided it was too scary to finish about three episodes in and I begged him to finish it with me because I could not tell the women apart. Four beautiful brunettes. But I liked the series so much I rewatched it all and I did not struggle the second time. By then I had learned the voices Oooooh I probably should take a second look", "Does anybody else find that the online tests do not really capture the essence of the disorder? I believe I have somewhat mild prosopagnosia (cannot follow movies, cannot recognize friends, etc.). I have taken a couple of the online tests, and they generally seem to have you memorize a face and then pick it out of a line up. Now, when I have 20 seconds to stare at a still face, I am able to memorize each of the key components individually (first eyebrow shape, then face width, sometimes if their eyes are sunken in). And then in a lineup I am able to choose the one that matches the two or three characteristics I have chosen to memorize. \n\nBut in real life, as I am sure you are all aware, we do not get a chance to stare at someone standing still for a few minutes before picking them out of a group. Rather, you run into someone, and if you are lucky, they are someone who you have remembered the walking style, hair, or something else of. Nobody looks exactly the same as they did at another point in time. Their hair will be different, when they are talking you cannot really analyze mouth shape or face width.\n\nI do not know... I do not find these tests too accurate for this reason... Does anyone else share my view?", "I just about ruined a child birthday surprise. I help run a franchised hobby shop, and one day a dad came in and ordered an RC car that just got announced for his son's birthday who had been very excited about the car since its unvailing. We special express ordered it just for him, too; and made extra sure we got the red edition.\n\nLater that week he came in from a movie at the theater near by with his kids, son in question en tow, and the son asked if we were getting the \"TRX-4: Sport\" (that is the car we ordered two days prior), and so I said, \"yeah, we can order them. We ordered one for a dad yesterday, it was red.\" I absolutely, in no way recognized the man, but fortunately my manager did, and he ran out, leaned in and went \"Shut. THE FUCK. Up.\" So I kind of quietly went to crunch some numbers.\n\nAfter they left, he came back and went \"You actually are face blind, arent you?\" And then it clicked. I profusely apologised to the gentleman when he came back to pick it up, and he laughed and laughed. He thought it was so funny. \n\nNormally I am okay, recognizing people by their stature, voices, demeanor, or hair; all tricks I am sure we all know at this point, but if I had to have any mental disconnect, I am glad it is this goofy ass disorder as opposed to something like color blindness. Just wanted to share a funny story. Thanks for sharing, that is a funny story. Glad the gentlemen was able to laugh about it. Not everyone would have been so understanding. \n\nOn another note, I am both color blind and have prosopagnosia. I guess it would depend on the severity of either disorder, but for me, proso is by far the worse of the two in terms of awkward/embarrassing situations.  I guess I have learned to embrace it. All of my friends and I joke about my prosopagnosia, and whenever it becomes a problem in social situations I imediately notify the person its affecting and they always end up being incredibly understanding which is nice. Havent had anybody ask me if I am making it up yet, which is nice.", "Hey! I am a Student Doctor and I have a health education channel on YouTube. I made this video on Prosopagnosia to help inform more people about the condition and raise overall awareness!  Please refrain from ever broadcasting physical or mental illness with imagery that looks like it is from a horror film ;-;\n\nI know you mean well, and prospagnosia is not as (clearly) stigmatized as other illnesses, but visuals like this still evoke and encourage those around us, and us included, to view our community with an otherness that we already struggle with enough. Hey! I am sorry for any offence I may have caused (that really was not my intention).\n\nWhat I was trying to do with this thumbnail design is visualise a broken bathroom mirror (as in someone looking at their reflection in the mirror and not being able to recognise their own face)..\n\nAs someone who struggled with mental health myself, it was definitely not my intention to stigmatise those who have it.\n\nAgain, I am sorry and I hope this helps clarify why I chose to go with this design. I understand the visual choices, as someone who has prosopagnosia. However, I hope you understand how it looks, as broken glass over a human face is both a sensationalized, and likely to garner visceral reaction. I know you mean well, but it is a especially important in another aspect, as this is the first video you have done on a neurological illness (not necessarily counting the dopamine video.) It sets a poor precedent, journeying into territory that is massively misunderstood, and misrepresented.\n\nThe video otherwise had good explanations of prosopagnosia, in a way I think would help others better understand it, and I really appreciate the candidness. My only note is, had you talked to anyone on their experiences with having prosopagnosia, and the way others treat them because of it, the issue could have been approached with slightly more sensitivity, in the matter of imagery representing it. Again, I apologise.\n\nI am glad you enjoyed the video though and I will try to do better with my thumbnail choices next time :)\n\nAnd obv thank you for the feedback! Feedback is what I need at this stage! A jigsaw analogy might be a more acceptable and accurate representation than the broken mirror analogy. I do not see myself as broken or as 'suffering' a mental disorder. Very decent editing, factual information. I actually was not aware of the apperceptive and associative variants of prosopagnosia, just the congenital versus acquired forms. The metaphor with the apple and trees is very well done. I agree with the other commenter the thumbnail comes across in poor taste, I would think of maybe choosing another. The cracked glass could work, but I would chose a different color palette so it comes across less horror-ish. I do have two small criticisms: you may want to add a background music to make the video a bit more engaging. Additionally, I am sure your courses have covered person-first language. Generally prosopagnosia is viewed as a disorder/problem, so \u201cprosopagnosiacs\u201d is not appropriate language to use. Last as more a general recommendation, you may want to put a short form your citations on screen as you talk about them, or recommend resources for further reading. Your video is a good intro the disorder, and we appreciate your interest in the condition and wanting to teach others. Hey! Thank you for taking the time to give me such detailed feedback. I am glad you enjoyed the video and I will definitely try and do better with the thumbnails next time..\n\nI actually did have background music but I think it I turned it a little too low so no one could actually hear it so that will need fixing next time too. I do include citations at the end of the description if you would like to check them out but it is a pretty good idea to have them on screen too.. Hey. I am sorry again. My intention was not to make people with Prosopagnosia appear broken or suffering \u2014 hence, I appear smiling in the picture..\n\nThe broken mirror was used mainly as a failure to recognise oneself.\n\nHowever, your concerns are obv valid and I will try and do better with my thumbnails next time and thank you for all the feedback.", "How do you explain facial blindness when the person is something a illiterate karen or antivax relative? i mean how do explain the situation why you did not recognize them and you know they dont belive in science or even a random person you see daily\n\n( I do not explain.  I make up excuses (poor eyesight would be an example,) and do things to avoid them knowing I did not recognize them (smiling and then being preoccupied with my child, which works for a stranger or someone you know.) I would explain it and maybe send some articles or videos about it. If they do not believe me it is on them. But anyone who is known me long enough will eventually see that my recognition abilities are not normal at all and then they might believe. This.  I do not owe anyone an explanation.\n\nI have found if I do not make it a big deal, most people do not give a crap, either.  The more I make excuses, etc., the more uncomfortable the situation becomes for everyone.\n\nThe thing is most people are so preoccupied with themselves they rarely notice what is going on around them.  Including how you do or do not react to them. Yeah, I only make up an excuse if it is REALLY obvious.  Like I asked one of the parents in my class at a recent supply pick-up what class her kid was in.  With my student in the front seat.  Fortunately, she had siblings, so I just said I meant them and I thought they were students too.  (One was too old and one was too young, but only by a year both ways, so it was reasonable.)\n\nBut usually I run and grab supplies for kids, so someone else is going up to a car, unless I recognize someone.  And I usually just say, \"Hi!\" and hope they tell me. I just say I have a really bad memory with faces. I do not talk to relatives who are like that. Makes my life so my less stressful.\n\nI do not feel a need to explain anything to people who will not believe. It is, quite frankly, their problem, not mine. If you feel the need to explain, I have found comparing it to color blindness is something people can understand.  Your vision is fine, you can see their face, it just does not register properly.\n\nThat said, I do not tell people about it unless it will clearly be an issue.  No point complicating things. I try to explain it as best as I can, but \"normal\" people just do not get it. They ether think I cannot see faces like at all, like everything is just blurred out or I am just forgetful and cannot remember anything ;-; As someone who is colourblind, most people dont understand that either. No... I suppose they would not, not truly,  but at least they have probably been tested a time or two for color-blindness (I know when I was in elementary school, they performed basic vision and hearing tests once a year on all students).\n\nThey have  been exposed to its existence.  They have seen the number/circle tests (I  assume they still use those?) and can imagine what the image would look like if the dots were all the same color.  Heck they do not even have to imagine, because there is always at least one picture with no number.\n\nWith face-blindness, lots of people have never even heard of it.  Arrested Development created some awareness, but a lot of people think it was a fake problem invented by the show creators.  Add to that the fact that the character in question is half-faceblind, half utter moron (seriously... if you only have one guest in your home, and you know it is a blonde woman... you are not going to forget that and panic at her presence just because she leaves the room for a minute).\n\nIn short, it is an uphill battle to explain, and I have personally had a lot of success generating lightbulb moments by using the colorblind analogy. It is not perfect, but it helps. &gt; I suppose they would not, not truly, \n&gt; \n&gt; They have been exposed to its existence. \n\nYes, you are correct in that regard - most people know it exists.\n\nBut the number of people who think it means we see in monochrome, or that if they wear green they become invisible to us is disturbingly high.\n\nAnd do not get me started on the near-universal \"what colour is this.. and this.. and this\" while pointing at random objects, then accusing you of lying about your colourblindness when you identify grass as green is frustrating.\n\n/rant (sorry) Damn, that would be annoying as hell.  I do not blame you for ranting!\n\nPeople who do not believe others about their own lived experience/bodies are the worst.  Those are the same assholes who sneak allergens into food to \"prove someone is faking.\"\n\nI can understand being curious and asking questions, even stupid questions , but accusations of lying?  Why would someone lie about being colorblind or faceblind?  What earthly benefit would there be to such a lie? \u201cPart of my brain did not form right when I was a baby. It makes it very hard for me to remember what people look like. I apologize I did not recognize you, I hope you can understand.\u201d I usually say \"I am really bad with faces\".\n\nIf I am going to get into explaining face blindness I compare it to recognizing a chair. If you saw a chair and then later saw a chair in a different room, would you be able to tell for sure it was the same chair? If it is really distinctive or if it is your favorite chair that you spend so much time with then you might be able to. But even then if you see it in a different setting than you are used to, you would probably not be perfect at recognizing it. My brain sees all faces like they are a chair, it is nothing against you personally. \u201cWho u\u201d", "Why re people here so negative?  Very confusing post. I do not really feel like any of your points here apply to me or like I want to use any of your suggestions, but good for you I guess. \n\nLike plenty of people already told you in your last post, I do not feel like this sub is a negative place. People here are very supportive of each other and I think this sub can help people learn to not take themselves too seriously, to not hold themselves up to standards they just cannot reach and to laugh at their mistakes. This sub also shows how well we have learned to navigate through life with faceblindness, and I think that is pretty inspiring and cool.", "Wow amazing truth meme  I really like long books...and have no Facebook account. Does anyone else find Facebook to be an extremely useful took for dealing with prosopagnosia?  Whenever I am heading to a social event, I go through Facebook to see who is going to be there and cram like it is a test, trying to familiarize myself with as many facial details as I can so that I have a hope of recognizing friends and acquaintances. Since I found out I have prosopagnosia I have become increasingly lazy about trying to recognise people. If I am in that situation I rely on my husband to tell me who people are or, much easier, I just dont go!", "Reply to test and share it, thanks for your help!   We are a group of students of Apple Foundation Program  @ unisob and we  are doing a research to invent a prototype app  that can help people  affected by Prosopagnosia's disturb trying to better understand  problematic.

At the moment,  We try to understand what is the prosopagnosia throught the affected people's experiences.  We need to understand through your survey responses, if we could prototype an app and improve your social interactions.

So I am pretty sure I was born with moderate prosopagnosia.  I thought for the longest time I was really self-centered, because I could not remember people.  I started paying more attention to people when they were talking (which made it harder to remember what they looked like) and made an effort to remember what they said.  I did very well...and then realized that I was coming across as creepy, because I remembered way too much...when I was able to figure out who they were.  I was relieved when I figured out what was going on.\n\nI am a teacher.  I would been at a new school at my first job for five months.  I stopped by the office to drop something off on my way to lunch in the staff room.  The office manager asked if I minded giving a note to someone that she saw go in there a minute ago.  Reasonable request right?  The problem was this person looked exactly like two other people that had lunch at the same time to me.  Same age, same hair style, same clothing style.  I could only tell them apart if they were standing next to each other.\n\nSo I took the note and detoured by my box to grab a bunch of papers.  I even grabbed a ream of copy paper for no reason, so I had a big stack.  I went into the staff room, located two of the three potential people (one was not in there) and proceeded to \"accidentally\" drop everything I was carrying in a part of the room away from them.  I am clumsy, so not far fetched.\n\nIt worked perfectly!  The two closest people jumped up to help me pick things up.  I made sure to start picking things up farthest away from the note, so when somebody grabbed it, I could say, \"Oh, that is for so-and-so,\" while keeping my eyes on the other papers.  I figured if they were there, the person would hand it to them.  If they were not there, they would probably say they headed back to their room or something, and I could say that the office manager saw them here.  (She was in the room.)\n\nSo the thing is I did not realize until several years later that that was not a normal thing to do. Defenetly level master coping.  ~~Master~~  God-level coping, without a doubt. I am quite impressed. \n\nActually, I am kind of amazed that you are a school teacher; dealing with all those new, homogenous young faces must be absolute Hell. Oh, the things I had to do to cope in high school... I guess it has always been my norm.  Like I remember passing back papers in elementary school and hating it, because I did not know the kids in my class.  (I want to the same school since K.  Apparently people learn the classmates.)\n\nKids are actually great.  There are only 20-30 of them you have to learn each year.  And until you learn them, you can make them sit in the same seats all day!  Wear name tags!  Say their name every time they answer a question!  They actually look pretty different as far as styles of dress (think families from all walks of life) and tell you until you are sick of hearing it about.\n\nParents scare me. definitely level master ! \ud83d\ude04\n\nnow I do not  need coping strategies, I decided not to hide I am proso, so as I meet someone for the first time I say them right then that I will not recognize them.\nsome people might not believe me, but now I do not care, and anyways they finally believe it because everybody around me knows and knows it is real.\neven though everywhere I go, I am the weird girl I do not have problem to talk about it.\n\nmy only coping strategie is I use my children asking them if I know the person(s) around me...\nand if I cross someone I do not \"see\" they tell me I have to salute them !\nthey are kind of my guide-dog for proso \ud83d\ude01 Did you ever get the sense teachers would pick you to pass back papers to help you learn your classmates? Do teachers do that? I am a teacher and I do not do that, but I am hyper aware of kids who do not know other kids' names.  I once was subbing and told the teacher to talk to the student's parents about it (he was in fourth grade, same school always, could recognize two of the kids in his class) but I do not know if she took me seriously.\n\nI do not think teachers ever knew.  I was a really good kid and pretty capable.  I always wanted to do special jobs...except this one.  I think they picked me because they thought I would want to or they wanted someone to do it without messing around.  They usually picked me less often after I little while, because I was really slow.  I would stick the ones I did not know on the bottom of the stack, and then pass the bottom half to someone else to help with. I just found out about this subreddit community, and it is amazing to me to read of others trying to navigate around the world. I am a psychologist, so it is challenging that I do not know if the person coming up to me when I am taking a walk with my husband is a patient, a colleague, a friend or a stranger. I generally ask how things are going (appropriate for anyone) and rely on clues from that. I have an excellent verbal memory and remember things patients told me 10 years ago, so if I can figure out who it is, I can go from there. I do OK in sessions because I know who I am seeing, but if I go out to the waiting room and there is two people about the same age, gender, \u201clook\u201d,... well, you understand. If I am supposed to meet a colleague in a school office or somewhere, I just hope someone smiles. \nI do recognize people who are unique looking for me; I can usually recognize Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, for example. As long as they are not next to someone similar. \nI find explaining does not work that well. I have taken to explaining to new people that I meet that I will not recognize them, and they do not get it. They say they have trouble recognizing people out of context, or putting names with faces, or whatever. And there are people who were acquaintances (friends of friends) who do not speak to me because I did not recognize them and say hello. Argh. \n Your experience sounds similar to mine.  I think people do not have a frame of reference to understand.  If you had trouble with your vision, people generally understand reasons why and what accommodations you might need.  Autism is similar to an extent.\n\nI did not even realize I was using ridiculous coping methods until I was in my mid-20s.  I heard about prosopagnosia in college psych classes of course, but only extreme examples that I did not relate to.  Understanding what was going on helped me a lot, but with intentional strategies and with not feeling bad about myself.  I used to wonder why I was randomly inconsiderate (because only rude people ignore others like that, and I did not know that other people could RECOGNIZE acquaintances,) stupid (cannot follow the storyline of an action film,) or anxious (mild social anxiety related to situations where it is necessary to recognize people...but no social anxiety in any other situations, and I am fairly extroverted.)  It made a lot of things make sense. Hi, fellow therapist here.  Completely understand the moment of wondering \u201cis this a colleague or a client\u201d when someone says hello in public. Just wait for the cues. I too remember stories, conversations, their personal circumstances, but never ever remember a face...not even my partner of 11 years!  Do you feel this has had an impact on your social relationships, that this is a real obstacle to making friends? I have to meet someone and be able to follow up quickly in some way to connect and stay connected..  \nWas just at a neighborhood holiday party. Sigh. People walked up, called me by name, chatted briefly- no clue. It is hard for me to feel relaxed and just roll with it. Outside I smile and chat back and internally I am going \u201cwho?who??\u201d I am impressed that some people do not get anxious.\nIn general, parties/social gatherings are purgatory for me. Oh yes, very relatable feelings you are describing. I certainly do not meet DSM criteria for any anxiety disorders, but large social gatherings are indeed the worst. Lots of internal \u201cwho? Who?\u201d And external smiling, hoping to get a clue from the context of the conversation. \n\nYesterday someone gave me a big hug while in line at the grocery store and asked how my daughter is doing... I still have not figured out who that person was. \n\nI have gotten surprisingly good at discreet photo taking (set phone camera to no flash &amp; no sound), then I will text my husband the pic and ask him if he knows the person.   \nCreepy or resourceful coping??  Thanks- is there an abundance of therapists referencing DSM and anxiety disorders? I think pictures are good if you can get away with it. I am slow and my husband does not know most of these people. \nI find I am superficially nice to everyone looking for those cues of the other person knowing me. Ugh. This leads me to feeling somewhat isolated- like I am on the outside of a social network of people. I used to wonder why.  This is pretty genius level.\n\nI have done things to purposely make others identify the person I am looking for, but this ingenuity really impressed me. Nicely done!", "is it worth getting a diagnosis? i have trouble recognizing most people (including close friends and family members) if i am unable to rely on their hair or clothing to identify them by. i have also gotten into trouble dozens of times with classmates, family friends, etc. by meeting them in places i was not expecting (grocery stores, etc.) and not recognizing them. i have been diagnosed autistic. i just was wondering if it is worth getting a diagnosis or if it is just more work? thanks. It should not be that much more work. And it can always be useful to have a medical diagnosis under your belt if it becomes relevant months or years down the track. Get diagnosed  having that diagnosis will be freedom giving. Imagine living your life without getting your Autism diagnosis. You will be lacking so much support and understanding. It will also help your friends and family understand. thank you for the responses.", "Cut my bangs for my birthday I had a 90s themed birthday so I decided to fully commit and cut my bangs.

Due to circumstances I recently went to live with a family member I either have not seen in years or maybe never met before.

Luckily they were able to find me at the air port instantly, even with my mask on. I could never imagine doing that. It is hard enough trying to identify people without a mask.

Hi, i just discovered this sub and finally I have a chance to get an answer for this question, I have had wondered this for the longest time haha\n\nOhh, im not a prosopagnosiac(is that how u say it?) myself BTW, just someone very curious and honestly fascinated by this condition Not for me. I just do not find faces familiar and never recognize people unless they are someone I know well or see often. Hell, even then, it literally took me several years to tell some people apart at work who looked similar. I used to not understand facial expressions much, but I learned over time context clues and such... kind of how people here learn to remember others by their clothes, hair, voices.\nAnyways, now it really throws me off whenever people respond to things in unexpected ways, and I have to figure out how they feel about the thing. never had a problem with that. but i am also a cartoonist so I am hyper aware of things like facial expressions. people\u2019s faces just do not stick in my mind very well. \nmy prosopagnosia is mild/moderate also so it might be different who have it severely? not something i have ever had trouble with, personally. i can discern an emotion from a facial expression, just cannot recognize *who* a person is based on their face We can see facial expressions. We have difficulty remembering faces. Facial expressions actually help me recognize people because people do them completely differently from each other.  Oh, that guy has a wide-eyed angry face? Must be uncle Nick.\nEdit: as Prosopagnosia is comorbid with autism, I wonder if this is simply an autism thing and no so much a faceblindness thing? I do not know anything about mental illnesses and I am not trying to offend you, but I am pretty sure that sounds more like autism. I can tell people's emotions apart fairly well, I just cannot tell the faces apart. That is kind of what I suspected too. Thanks for chiming in! Lol\nIt might be hard living with both but it is fun. Sometimes. Not always but sometimes. The obvious faces are obvious but I often cannot catch little expressions that other people see, like when someone got offended and did not make the whole angry face but just got a little bit sadder? No difference for me, I will see them still happy. I am actually incredible at facial expressions. Even to a fault. I can see micro expressions that people do not even realize they are doing and it gets me in trouble because I assume it is aimed at me. In contrast, my prosopagnosia is severe enough that I cannot recognize myself or some of my family members including my dad. If you are color blind, you can still see shapes and depth and so on, right?  For me, it is sort of like that.  I see the face.  I know that it is a face and I can see/read the expression... I just may not know who I am looking at.", "Research Project Study Hi! I am currently undertaking a compulsory stage two subject in Australia and have decided to study differences in the brain with and without prosopagnosia. If you are over eighteen and have any form of prosopagnosia, could you please take a moment to complete the ( (I will reference the use of this study fully) and send me a message of either a description or a photo of your results? If you could also state whether you have developmental, acquired or no form of prosopagnosia, it would be greatly appreciated! \n*I will also be posting results anonymously and for non-commercial purposes!", "New member WOW I am so glad I found this community! I have mild prosopagnosia, just enough to constantly make me wonder if I am crazy.\n\nLive action movies always frustrated me a lot and I never knew why until today! So funny that you guys also hate Oceans 11. That movie is the worst! And superhero movies, or any movie full of short-haired men.\n\nI have a couple questions/observations for everyone here.\n\n1. One person in another post said, \"I do not like watching movies, especially alone.\"  I super relate to that. I do not think I have ever watched a movie or TV show alone. They just do not do anything for me. But if there is someone next to me having emotional reactions to the movie, laughing and making commentary, then I can emotionally connect to the story THROUGH that person. I was watching a movie with a friend the other day, and when he fell asleep, I immediately lost interest.\n\nDoes anyone else have that experience? \n\n2. What about porn?? I always felt like such a weirdo for not having any interest in porn. I like sex, but two random strangers on a screen does not turn me on. It just does not feel sexual.\n\n3. Speaking of attraction... Ive seen some people in this group say that they do not feel attraction to someone unless they have known them a long time.  Well personally... I can feel attraction to someone I have just met but I think it only happens if we are close to each other, so I have a better sense of how they smell and how they move. That is one reason why I love partner dancing. I can just close my eyes and FEEL the other person. \nDoes anyone else relate to this?\n\n4. Is it just me or are there a lot of girls in this group? That was unexpected. (I am female)\n\n5. Hmmm... Is this a prosopagnosia thing? Or does everyone do this? If I see someone in public who has the same general look as my boyfriend, or crush, then I will feel an immediate short-lived attraction for that stranger, lol. Kind of like my brain says \"That stranger has a beard that looks like my lover's beard, so he is obviously also sexy.\" Sometimes I accidentally smile at them before my brain realizes it is not really them! \n\n6. I told my mom about prosopagnosia, and she apparently has the same characteristics as me! She said she never understood the big deal with movie stars, cuz they are so hard to tell apart. She and I also are both super keen to textual detail; we are great copy-editors.\n\n7. Does anyone else not notice height? Whenever someone makes a comment or joke about how they are tall or short... That is when I find out that they are tall/short. Hi. Welcome! \n1. No, I still like movies on my own,  but I do think watching it with others enhances the experience. \n1.2 I also do not enjoy porn, but I attribute that to identifying as demisexual, so it just is not for me.\n2. No, cannot relate. \n3. Also a lady,  heyo. \n4. I do the same,  but I have heard this from others so I do not think it is a Prosopagnosia thing. \n5. My mom is the same!  I am thinking it is genetic for us. \n6. I def notice height.  It is one of the ways I identify people. My husband is also over 6 feet,  so it is an easy way to identify him in a crowd. I would imagine that being demisexual goes hand in hand with prosopagnosia. \n\nI was demisexual until my late 20s. I wonder... they did a survey awhile back because it sounds like a higher than expected number of people with proso are asexual, and demi falls on that spectrum. \nWe just need more research all around in my opinion! Tbh the term \"demisexual\" has always rubbed me the wrong way, because it just seems like a perfectly normal and common way to be. So it seems weird to have a word for it. But maybe I just think it is really common because i relate to it, and assume others do to \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f 1. It was me probably. I hate movies. Especially alone. \n2. I watch porn for fun but it does not make me horny. I look at it like at a comedy, I like the ones with long plot, so there is a lot of shit talk and weird excuses why they should or should not have sex. Oh, step brother, I am stuck in a washing machine that is 5 times bigger than my whole body and I could easily park a jeep inside but oh help. \n3. I hate dancing, it feels stupid to me. You stand and wave your knees and arms and head to different directions because????? And if someone turns of the music it is not considered pretty anymore? What? But I am a very cuddly person, I love hugs and kisses and holding hands idk\n4. idk\n5. Yes sometimes it happens and I feel guilty after. And I stare at a stranger like HMMMMMMMMMM for an awkwardly long time trying to guess if it is my boyfriend in a new hoodie or who the f is that. \n6. I do not know what to say, I do not know personally anyone with that issue. \n7. I do not give much attention to it until someone is REAAAALLLLYYY high or short. Average people, I would say 168cm-185cm? I can forget. Haha! People dance because it feels good. There is a feedback loop with emotional state. Emotions may make you feel like moving in a certain way, and the movements you do with your body actually *create* new emotions too. And other people like to watch it as well. I think that is because the person watching the dancing is kind of vicariously feeling good, thru the dancer. They enjoy seeing how much fun or emotiveness the dancer is having. \n\nBut I guess it does not do that for you haha. I am curious... Do you enjoy the physical sensation of playing any sports, running, etc? I like moving like waving hands (like people do in panic or when they are trying to scare off a bee or something, so random), standing straight but bending my knees and straightening them and bending and again and again. My favourite sport to play is icehockey I guess, also I like to shoot from a bow.", "Sigh. ", "Merry Christmas ya filthy animals  Is that Cr1TiKaL? Yes The expression is the only thing making these two separate pictures to me Facial hair density for me. I read it like a  Rorschach card. But maybe that my cat identification system at work lmao. Yes! I did it! :D See, having seen keanu for the last 30+ years, i have no problem. \n\nIt is those faces that you do not see regularly that I have trouble with. Glad somebody else guessed I thought it was Keanu Reeves Right one is obviously Cr1tikal", "New Year's Party I am going to a New Year's party tonight and I am frelling stressed about it.\n\nOn top of normal \"it is a party full of acquaintances and I will only recognize 10% of them\" stress, I have been told that someone  I have had a bad interaction with will be there, and I am worried I will not recognize her and will have another bad interaction. \n\nSo... any advice? I am not sure I will recognized her and only found out her name today. I still want to go to this party because of the 10% of folks there that I recognize and enjoy. My current plan is to be pleasant to everyone and not try to recognize her. If she calls me out on the previous interaction, explain that she should not assume everyone recognizes her.\n\nBackstory: The previous bad interaction was at a summer party. Alice and Betty were talking at the snack table about a hobby of mine  and I tried to join in the conversation. I did not realize Alice was trans and I did not realize that bra fitting would be a touchy topic for her.  How did it go? It went ok. I did not talk with Alice, but I did talk with Betty. She did not seem to realize we might not be on good terms, so I did not mention it. We talked about my new dog and her new (awesome) outfit. Do not reopen old wounds.\n\n&gt;If she calls me out on the previous interaction, explain that she should not assume everyone recognizes her.\n\nJust say \"I am sorry.\"  Trying to use your proso as an excuse/explanation is a mistake.  You will sound pathetic. Once I was at the party, it felt silly to bring it up since the original incident happened months ago. I was more worried if she or Betty said something to me.\n\nI am also starting to think that Betty often behaves in a way that I interpret as upset, but is not actually indicative of her feelings. I thought I offended her again last night because she made a joke at my expense and so I apologized and she said I had not done anything offensive. Maybe she and Alice were not even actually upset in the summer when they yelled at me. I do not know. \n\nSocial is hard, and I am not going to worry about last summer's interaction any more. I know this is too late but if you can, recruit someone close to you who knows about your prosopagnosia to walk around and hang out with you. I have had dear friends who are coached on how to discreetly inform me who we are talking to :) That is a good idea. I already have one friend who knows to pull me away if I start talking to her (ever-so-charming and emotionally abusive) ex.", "Google glass will not allow face recognition apps due to privacy protection ", "US Soldier and developed it So I am in the army and as a hobby I do drawings. I am working towards professional graphic design and etc. Well, on Saturday I was on a 24hr shift and I decided to draw. I was having some serious trouble drawing faces of characters I made up. They just would not look right. Today, I looked into the mirror and freak out because I did not recognize my own reflection. It was like looking into a window and someone was copying me.\nEvery 30-45 minutes I feel the floor tremble, similar to when an elevator stops and adjust before opening its doors.\n\nI am currently in Korea and the neurologist there asked if she and the nurses looked alike. I said yes. They walked away and 5 minutes later one of the nurses comes back and asks \u201cdo NON-asian people look alike?\u201d I was so embarrassed. They probably thought I was being some racist asshole of sorts. My sergeant was with me and laughed at me.\n\nAnyway, people\u2019s faces look alike, but I recognize that they are not. Like I can notice the details but when looking at them I cannot distinguish people apart.\n\nI am really concerned on how this may effect my career in the military. How it can effect my artistic hobby. I am also gay which is hard enough to find someone serious to date.\n\n\nI work on computer systems as my specialty in the army. Think of trouble tickets in the IT field. General maintenance and updates. There is a lot going through my head right now.  The fact it is coming on all of a sudden can indicate cerebral lesion, did you have a scan done?  Did you suffer some kind of head injury?  The military is probably one of the best places to have it.  I wish everyone walked around with a name tag on. I cannot imagine how scary it would be to acquire face blindness, especially in the military. I do wish you well figuring things out.\n\nThere are a lot of coping mechanisms that people learn to use, to make things easier. It is mostly a matter of figuring how what works for you.\n\nFor example, I have been know to take pictures of a new group of people that I am meeting and making an Anki flashcard deck. That way I have lots of opportunities to test and learn who a person is, what about them that I can identify.\n\nI have no talent personally for art, but there is a ( He claims that painting faces helps him remember them. It slowly developed over the month. I kept telling myself that it was all in my head. Woke up and freaked when I did not recognize myself at all. I did bump my head while riding the bus last week, but I do not think it was hard enough.\n\nAnyway, they did scan my head and did not find anything abnormal. So I have a follow up tomorrow with a neurologist  yeah, I had a scan. Nothing abnormal. Thing is, it was sudden, it kind of developed over the month of October but I guess I was in denial.  Maybe an MRI would help if that is a possibility for you. Either way you can live with it but if it is a lesion it might get worse do you know or heard of people getting better?\nI do not think I suffered any trauma recently, but I have been forgetful ever since August. Small things, like people telling me what state they were from or their hobby. \n\nI always made effort to remember these details because it can mean the world to a person. I mean, I learned that no matter what language you speak, if you can pronounce a person\u2019s name properly, it means the world to them. I figured that personal details about a person would be just as strong.\n\nI did not know this was a condition until today. My mind has been blown each hour throughout my day. I honestly do not know but I think it is good to know why something is wrong. I do not know how old you are but there are some illnesses that can cause brain lesions that can be treated. It is really because of how sudden it is that it feels like something is not right  I was born with Prosopagnosia, so I cannot totally relate to what you are going through, but it breaks my heart every time I hear about people who acquire it in the middle of their lives.\n\nI recognize people by their hairstyle, hair color, clothing, body shape, facial hair, and especially their voice (and context clues).\n\nI have actually only had one horror story in romance due to Prosopagnosia - my now wife (at the time she was still my gf) had a pretty drastic hair cut without telling me (length and color changed), and we were going to meet up at a public place. I recognized her coat, but I have made the mistake before of thinking women wearing long red leather coats before were her, so I did not wave or acknowledge her until she was right in front of me and started talking (at which point, I recognized her by voice).\n\nWhat you describe with the mirror is a common way people who develop face blindness in the middle of their live describe the sensation. They say it is even worse after a haircut, shave, or *getting out of the shower*, and I recall a story about a person freaking out for a second because they thought a stranger was in their home when their daughter got out of the shower and her hair was wet.\n\n&gt;Anyway, people\u2019s faces look alike, but I recognize that they are not. Like I can notice the details but when looking at them I cannot distinguish people apart. \n\nYeah, that sounds like Prosopagnosia to me.\n\nIf you need any help, let us know. Do you generally like to watch TV or Movies? Some shows and movies might be more difficult for you to follow now (because all white guys with short dark hair look alike). &gt;Do you know or heard of people getting better? \n\nProsopagnosia has not been very thoroughly studied, compared to other cognitive disorders and disabilities (like Alzheimer's or Asperger's). Last I looked into it, there were not any known cases of people who recovered. \n\n**But I am not a doctor.**\n\nIf your neurologist says something differently, then (obviously) listen to them.\n\nWe are here if you need to talk about anything. \\&gt; Every 30-45 minutes I feel the floor tremble, similar to when an elevator stops and adjust before opening its doors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBig disclaimer:  I am not a doctor.  I know that prosopagnosia (especially suddenly) will be emotionally scary, but please mention the phantom temble as symptom #1 to your doctors.  This may be easier for them to understand and allow them trace back to more well known conditions or traumas.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck.  I am sorry there are no good solutions.  If it is any consolation, my hobby is painting - mainly portraits.  This actually helped me unpack the complexity of faces.  I am so sorry, that must have been terrifying!\nI think it is easier when you are born with it and just accept that as the norm. But I am actually a fairly good artist, especially in portraiture. I just think about the eyes, nose, mouth, etc as separate entities. I think with a little time you will adapt.\n\nI tend to recognize people by aspects other than their faces, and yes Asian people do look more alike because of their hair, height, etc.  Hi there! I am sorry to hear that things have been so stressful for you lately. I hope that you are able to find some resources here and through your doctor that ease these new challenges.  \n\n\nI can say that I have prosopagnosia and it does not prevent me from pursuing art as a hobby. Although I do need a photo reference to do realistic portraits, I can do cartoon- or anime-style art without much trouble. A lot of elementary art training suggests looking for underlying shapes in scenes or objects, and I think that helps to deconstruct the mystery of a face into some circles, triangles, and the like. I am sure that if you keep at it you will be able to find a strategy that works for you. Hey, was curious, any new developments?   On December 5th I went to the doctor. They conducted an EEG on me and found that my brain activity was normal. However, they noticed that the blood flow in my brain was low. I was given medication that apparently promoted brain blood flow.\nI have not noticed anything different as of yet.  Oh wow.  Yeah, it might take a while for it to recover.  At least they found SOMETHING rather than just mystery brain thing.  Good luck, they have gotten a lot better at sorting out brain stuff the past decade or two.", "I started watching It is Always Sunny in Philadelphia, help Three of the characters are just average looking dark haired white dudes, two of them have beards but I cannot always see the beards This is why I watch cartoons... Wow, I just started Always Sunny the other day and I am going through the EXACT same thing. Lol, it is awful is not it?  I started the show a few months ago and had exactly the same reaction.\n\n I stuck with it (mostly because my boyfriend liked it, so we kept putting on an episode here and there), and by about the 3rd season, they diverged their styles and mannerisms enough that I can mostly tell them apart now, but yeah, I nearly gave up a few episodes in.\n\nIt gets a lot better after one of them becomes roommates with Danny Devito's character.  They have lots of scenes together, and their grungy weird roommate dynamic is pretty unmistakeable.\n\nThe other two guys have a lot of duo scenes, and they are harder to identify, but one goes more for a frat boy style of dress and behavior, while the other goes more \"overconfident in a goofy way\" like Joey from Friends, if Joey thought he was the Fonz. It gets better! Their personalities/mannerisms and voices get more distinct but I had the same problem too at first. I saw it exactly twice while it was airing. Had the exact same problem. Could not watch anymore.\n\nSame issue with *Veronica Mars* and *Flash*, honestly. Although, at least in *Veronica* there is only one blonde female, so that helped a bit. Their voices are all pretty distinct so that is what I used to tell them apart. One of them is small with a very high pitched voice - Charlie.\n\nOne of them has a sort of greaser/Italian enforcer stereotype look - Mac\n\nAnd one of them is thinner and beardless and kind of blond - Dennis\n\nAnd they all have very different personalities. I could tell dennis apart but not the other two for a while lol good luck I guess I do not suffer from this as badly as some of you all, cuz I have never had trouble distinguishing those guys. But I do remember when I watched The Departed, I finished it and had no idea what the plot was, because I thought two of the characters were the exact same person the whole time (and none of the others stood out enough for me to remember their part in the movie). I legit was confused why he had facial hair in some scenes and not others.\n\nAlso, I am convinced every single brunette in the Supernatural series is secretly the same woman.\n\nI have so much respect for a good costume designer, because making characters stand out with their clothing makes it a lot easier to follow plots. Charlie (the janitor) has a high pitched screechy voice like he is silently screaming every word. And his hair is almost always a short mess. Also he is shorter than the others (except for Frank who is also the widest and oldest of the bunch).\n\nDennis (Bird Leg's brother) is the tallest, also the lankiest.\n\nMatt has a tattoo on his right arm. Other than that idk. He often searches approval (not often from Charlie though). And I thought that I had it bad. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI mostly go by haircuts when I watch movies and series.Though I first did not recognize my friend I had known for 2.5 years when I saw him in a new place with his hair shaved.\n\nHad to search up \"Supernatural series female characters\", and I think you have got it wrong. There are TWO brown haired women. One has a shorter face you see? \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude05 I just finished watching a limited series murder mystery, and I did not realise their were actually two different chubby, bearded white men until the second last episode.

At the time, I would rather friends be able to continue on without being hampered by me, but over time, I have come to accept that others will need to grieve if I pass. \n\nMy friends, though, always tell me something very different. They tell me that the only thing they wish in death is to be remembered, to live on through others' memories of them.\n\nAnd the request scares me. I want to remember my friends, and I hope to carry their deeds with me to my final breath. But I know I will never be able to put a face to those memories. That I will never be able to remember them in full, the way they want. \n\nIt is terrifying to think about how fast I will not be able to recognize their faces in photos anymore, that you could ask me about their skin tone or hair color or eyes and I would not have an answer. That I played with my pet mouse daily for over 2 years and forgot what he looked like the day after he passed.\n\nI cannot remember my sister's face and I last saw her 3 hours ago, saw her most days of my life for 24 years. The day may come where she leaves my life and if photos did not exist, I would never have any idea what she had looked like. Regardless of the fact that you may not be able to recall their face, that is not how you recognize and remember them while they are still alive anyway. Too many times for me to count, I have stood next to someone I thought was a stranger and when they starting speaking to me, I recognize them and it is as if the person I know \u201csnaps into\u201d this stranger\u2019s body and I suddenly know who it is. Because I recognize people by their personalities and their history of choices, actions, mannerisms, foibles, talents and everything else that goes into making a person an individual.\nYou will still remember your friends in that way long after they are gone and is not that how you remember them now while they are still alive? Who cares if you cannot remember their face? We cannot remember anyone\u2019s face anyway. So what is the difference? You will still have them in your memories just as you do now. How do you remember them?  Their voice, their mannerisms, their hair?  How they made you feel, in-jokes, their laugh pattern?  Visual pictures of people is not the only way people are remembered. Besides the other excellent points people have made, you can also take pictures and videos of good times with friends and family.\n\nI am really concerned about you feeling suicidal. As someone who is also fighting depression, I hope you know you do not have to do it alone. Therapy, group therapy, medications, and a number of other options are available. Life is for the living I do not have trouble remembering loved ones who died.  Sure, I cannot imagine their face in my head really - but I could not before, so that is no change.  I recognize who they are in photos, because I remember the photos.  It sounds like taking pictures and really backing up some good ones with the name of the person saved may help you.  But when I remember people who have died, I guess I remember how I felt and who they were, not what they look like.  The face part is not really important to me, personally, although I can see it might be to some people.\n\nI hope you are getting help for those suicidal thoughts.  That sounds really hard to deal with, especially for such a long time.  Do you need help getting in touch with a resource?", "Any of you really good at recognizing gait or voices? I am *terrible* with faces, as I am sure the rest of you are. But I think because of that I have learned to recognize people by the way they walk or the way they talk. I am really good at recognizing actors that I have spent time watching, even if they are in costume or heavy make up. I just need to be able to see them move and hear them say something.\n\nBut when I am watching a new show with people I am not familiar with i cannot keep track of whether I have met a character before or if it is a new person. I watched The Departed the entire way through not realizing that Matt Damon and Dicaprio were different characters. It was not a good movie lol I can totally relate. I did develop a lot of \"supplementary skills\" to learn to recognize people through other ways than their faces (like hairstyle, type of clothes etc...) but I did notice that I was quite good at recognizing voices. As a matter of fact, I can easily \"listen to\" someone is voice in my head accurately even if I obviously I cannot visualize their face. I can recognize voices fairly well, but no better than others, I think.  That said, I often recognize people by the sound of their voice just when they clear their throat.  I can recognize some people's gaits from a fair distance, even if I cannot see them clearly. I 100% do this. \nI have turned it into a party trick where I tell people what their most distinguishing feature is and how I recognize them. Yup,\nBut struggle with voices of related people sometimes. yes!! absolutely! I do theatre and I have some friends I can find no matter what they are wearing just from how they walk or stand. and then I have friends that are much more a struggle that way hahha It is the reason why I did not realize I had a facial recognition issue for much of my life, because I have become so good at using voice and gait to recognize people. Hmhmmm makes me think about my weird glitch. My husband and I have been together since we were young teens. We are in our late thirties now. Anyway, he has the opposite of Prosopagnosia and I mean on like fbi computer level. He remembers every person he is ever seen and where he saw them when/if he sees them again. I cannot take him anywhere, he knows everyone. People do not even remember him a lot of the time! I cannot recognize my next door neighbor in a different place than standing next door. I wonder if his brain pulled that out of mine all for itself and has double the power now. I can picture the face of voice actors immediately! How is this possible? Yeah, I can definitely tell the difference between most people I know clearing their throat! See I do not really consciously know how I recognize people.  I guess I could probably say if I thought about it. Oh I do this as well, but only with close friends. I was telling a friend this past weekend his most distinguishing trait is the particular way he moves his hands, especially when he is talking. I noticed it the first time we hung out by the particular way he rolled his dice. I also have trouble with Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio \n\nI am good with gait but not voices I am not that good with voices but people's particular gait's are usually the only way I recognize people. Yeah, less so for voices, but recognizing someone is gait (or any other way they move their body) is almost as instantaneous as if I did not have a face recognition issue. Made identifying that I did have a problem that much more difficult. Yep - but better with voices than gaits.\n\nMakes it easy to \"recognise\" people at parties, even when they are not visible/ in a different room.\n\nHas exactly the same problem with The Departed! I once recognized someone by how they walked from 5 city blocks away. voices not so well unless they speak rather unusually. I am pretty good with voices, but I am not very good with gait.\n\nBut there are some actors that I can recognize by the way they are acting, but they are just a few. The other day I was watching a movie, and by the way the character was yelling and tought \"wait, it that Susan Sarandon?\" and it was. You all are my people, and I am so glad I found this sub lolll\n\nGood thing it is a virtual community, cause none of us would recognize each other in real life Same! I knew I was not great with faces, but I managed generally fine, so it was whatever. The fact that concept of criminal sketch artists in cop shows has always completely baffled me should have been a clue. Vindication!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I am quite good at voices! It is not so helpful in real life (people are already talking to me, expecting me to know who they are, so I do not have time to focus on their voice because I am trying to catch up with the conversation), but I am trying to use it more consciously in real life. But I definitely recognize actors by their voices all the time. (Maybe this is why I tend to like campy, over-acted TV and films--cult sci-fi, that kind of thing--where everyone is voice is VERY DISTINCTIVE and a major part of characterization.)\n\nA thing called the 'Glasgow Voice Memory Test' exists--I scored above average on it--but I do not think it is available online anymore. (The online implementation I took was Flash-powered.)\n\nI have always been able to 'hear' someone is voice in my mind easily. (The author of the book I am reading right now once said that she envisioned her main character as being played by Tom Baker, so I am using his voice in my mind while I read. Highly recommended!) I am one of those prosopagnosics who did not realize for years that \"recognizing faces\" was not just a metaphorical expression, so when I finally realized that other people could *actually picture* a face as a distinct entity, the only reference point I had was \"like I do with voices!\" Which was really helpful.\n\nI am also pretty good at distinguishing accents--although that does not mean I can imitate them.\n\nI listen to a lot of audio dramas, and when I try to get friends hooked on them, they sometimes complain that they cannot tell the characters apart. Rarely a problem for me! In fact, I rather enjoy the role reversal of ME having to explain to OTHER people who the different characters are, when it is the other way around if we watch TV or a movie. There should be a list of \"things undiagnosed prosopagnosics assume are just tropes, but are actually real things!\" For me it was wanted posters, like in the Old West. The illustrations on them are not just for decoration, apparently.\n\nThere is also this scene in an old episode of classic Doctor Who where one of the characters--the Doctor's best friend at the time!--has been turned into a cardboard cutout (they are in a sort of surrealist mindscape, it is from the 60s, do not question it) and the Doctor has to reconstruct his face from pieces of various photographs--eyes, nose, mouth, etc. He gets it completely wrong and the character is played by a different actor for a few episodes until they can fix it (the usual actor had chickenpox, there was a tight filming schedule in those days, and this was their workaround). When I watched this episode with a group, everyone made fun of how ridiculous it was that the Doctor would not be able to reconstruct his own best friend's face. Me, I was thinking, \"well I could not do that either!\"  \n\n\nNow, when I watch Doctor Who, I am keeping a mental list of \"faceblind things the Doctor does,\" and it is getting surprisingly long. Once he gets asked the dreaded question \"can you find me in this old group picture? It is from before I grew my moustache!\" and, just like any prosopagnosic, cannot even guess. Yeah, if there were ever an r/Prosopagnosia convention, it would be ALL NAMETAGS ALL THE TIME. With the nametag POINTING OUTWARDS SO PEOPLE CAN READ IT. (Pet peeve of mine. I hate lanyards.) For me, it clicked that my prosopagnosia was a real thing (not just \u201ca bad memory\u201d or \u201cnot paying attention\u201d) when I finally understood that neurotypical people could picture a face as easily as I could \u201chear\u201d a voice. (I think it is pretty normal to be able to \u201chear\u201d a voice, but it seems to be more important to prosopagnosics because for many of us it is the ONLY detail about someone that we can consistently \u201ccall up\u201d in our minds.) That is really interesting! I am certain it is not intentional on the part of the writers, but it is interesting. It makes complete sense that a member of an alien species that can completely change their appearance throughout their lives would not have a fusiform gyrus like that of a neurotypical human, so it is a wonderful piece of accidental worldbuilding! Me too!  I honestly thought wanted posters were just a storytelling convention and did not actually work in real life. It is kind of crazy the sort of things you can explain away because you assume you are \"normal\".\n\nTo address your main point.  I am not particularly attuned to gait/motor style, but I am excellent at voices. I recognize actors by hearing their voice sometimes more than recognizing their face, especially if it is when they are younger or a different hair style. I have mild face blindness. I can recognize people I see many times but any changes totally throw me off.", "Random Wish + English Class I sometimes joke that I wish everyone around me had prosopagnosia because then I could change my hair and nobody would connect me to pre-transition me. Deadnaming would be gone because nobody would know my deadname.\n\nRight now I run into people who who were in my classes last year but not this year and it is awkward to know that they probably think of me as the gender + name I was last year but with a haircut and new glasses. It is kind of, if only they had no idea who I was, y\u2019know? Then I would not have to bother to correct people, at least name-wise.\n\nOn an unrelated note, it seems like almost every member of my English class is a girl with long, straight hair, moderate eyeshadow, and slightly tanned skin. It makes class discussions difficult because I rarely know who is talking about who is point. I wish you luck on your journey! Finding your true identity (and then living it out) can be such a trying process, and I hope that it brings you a great deal of satisfaction. \n\nYour last paragraph is so relatable lmao. Up until I learned how to identify people by their voices, class discussions were absolute hell. They still are sometimes, but it is getting better, especially because I go to a relatively small university, and as time goes on I am able to recognize more people's voices and hairstyles.", "ProsopAnonymous - A web series describing Face Blindness and what it is like to live with it ", "Prosopagnosia/Faceblindness Starter Pack ", "Tinted Glasses I read here and a few other places that using coloured lenses may help. Is there anything special about them, or can I just buy a handful of different colours off Amazon and give them a go. I specifically read about green, but there was a mention of yellow and various others that may help with a variety of conditions.\n\nI could live with green, being my favourite colour, blue would be fine, some round blue ones - John Lennon was from just down the road. I think It would have to be a major improvement if it had to be pink or purple :p\n\nDo they (for long term use) need to have UV protection, or would it not matter if they were not 'dark'?\n\nI wonder if you would get funny looks wearing 'sunglasses' on winter days, you would have to have some sort of 'explanation' ready. Just tell them you are impersonating Bono (he has them to help with glaucoma) or say you are secretly Iron Man  Wait, how would tinted glasses help facial recognition? I have not heard of this.  How does this work? I have only used tinted glasses to prevent migraine  I have no idea, and it is not a widespread 'cure' but a bit of internet searching and you see a few results about it helping some people with it and helping several other conditions.\n\n( No idea, it may be to do with preventing a sort of overload in your facicial recognition areas of your brain. Maybe with less colours it is less information for your brain to process. I did not realise his served a purpose. This sounds similar to the coping strategies used to support dyslexia and visual impairment - using coloured screens/sheets over a white page etc. \n\nI am very light sensitive and often have to wear sunglasses, even on cloudy days - not sure if this is due to previous eye surgery or if I have just become more aware of the condition since. \n\nHowever I used to wear tinted lenses, in blue, purple and pink. I have **always** had real problems with my prosopagnosia.\n\nJust my anecdotal to add to the mix. I would be interested to hear any other experiences.  Did the lenses make any diference with the prosopagnosia, or maybe you did not give it any thought? Trust me, this was when I moved away from home for college and everyone was a stranger. Colored lenses did not make a difference to me; if only helping me become more recognisable to others.  Lol, you were the crazy person in the pink glasses nobody could forget you! ;) &gt;you were the crazy person in the pink glasses\n\nWorryingly close to the truth.  I struggle with black and white movies more than coloured ones weirdly so I guess maybe polarising skin tone helps? I do not know.  Oh, that is odd. It is possible that a particular colour would help and that black/grey/white just hinders you more than natural colours. It was green tinted glassed that I initially read about, so I think that would be my first experiment. Maybe what I need to do is get a handful of classic black and white films and watch each one with different colours.", "Cartoons vs Real Actors I just found this sub, and I am very excited to connect with other people like me!  I am wondering if anyone else enjoyed cartoons more than real life actors on TV when they were kids, (and even now tbh) because it is easier to know who is whom. \n\nHas anyone else struggled with following a plot line because someone came back after a while gone, and you do not recognize them? How have you all coped? Has anyone found out a trick to watch these shows and keep up with all the characters? Have not found a trick yet... That may be one of the reasons why I keep sticking with animation Yes, I prefer cartoons immensely for this exact reason (even better when they all have different hair colours ect)\n\nIn shows, I read a recap after each episode to make sure I understood who everyone was. Not quite the same as experiencing the show as someone who can see faces properly, but works for me :) I also prefer cartoons to real actors. I have to make a real effort to distinguish them unless their clothing or hair is distinctive! Yes, but if I have to watch something with real actors. I prefer series intead of movies, cause they give  me 'more time' to find some accesory stuf to recognize the people. Cartoons are deliberately designed so the characters can be told apart purely from silhouette, let alone head shape, facial features, hair color/style, iconic clothing in solid colors, etc.\n\nLive actors are all \"Here are five white cleanshaven dudes with dark hair and square jaws, wearing business attire or a uniform.\" I think it depends on how long you had been watching movies starring real actors and the coping mechanisms/compensation skills you have developed. I usually pick out 3-4 features of an actor/actress, including height, estimated skin tone, eye colour + any other prominent feature that they have. \n\nIt immensely helps when said actor/actress has a certain look e.g. Chris Hemsworth with his scruff or just full-on beard, Scarlett Johansson and her prominent nose and blonde hair. Of course, this process is not flawless and not always fruitful- that is why I also use contextual clues, elimination, possible candidates, etc. to recognize them in movies and different scenes.\n\nIRL recognition, however, might not work as efficiently as the abovementioned methods; lighting, distance, accessories or lack thereof, voice, time of exposure, and the overall environment, can all highly impact one's ability to recognize people. \n\nFor me, it is just a bunch of things I have attached to this specific person that amplify the chance of  recognizing them in the future. If you are watching a show on Amazon Prime Video, at any time you can get an \"x-ray\" screen that shows information about what is on the screen. Among this information is the name of each actor on the screen. Some shows also have the character names. my trick has been watching series with other people who stand having me asking \u201cwho is that\u201d or \u201cis that x\u201d every couple of minutes. but same, i still watch a lot more cartoons and anime than live action because of this. Usually, but my kids made fun of me when we watched Polar Express because I could not tell everybody was Tom Hanks. Cartoon charaters are usually distinctly different from each other, I do not think actual acted characters are usually thought of like this. If anything, they try to make them look the same (I am looking at you, hill house people). And if I can get their faces straight after a few watches, I still have to try and remember their names... Yep I have got a lifelong obsession with animation. Recently I have found the audio description feature on Netflix originals useful for following the plot (it is meant for blind and vision impaired, but the voice over says the names of characters as they come on screen) \n\nCartoons are processed in a different part of the brain than faces. What is weird is that cars are processed in the part of the brain that is meant for faces. I also cannot recognize cars. I cannot recognize cars either. Crazy. Yep, I lose my car in parking lots regularly. I have not gotten all the dents and scratches fixed because it makes my car easier to identify.", "I am so happy this sub exists. Long story short, when I was younger I was really good with faces. Now, I cannot see them. At all. It is really fucking weird and scary. My doctor says it sounds like I have this, and from what I have read so far... damn it feels good to have people who understand. Glad I found you guys. :)\n\nEDIT: For those who are curious, I am bipolar, and my ability to see faces did not become impaired until I had to start experimenting with medications. He thinks that may have something to do with it.", "Vice reached out to us, they want to do a piece on how prosopagnosia affects intimacy and relationships. Please be 18+ details below!

Ik this can sound unrelated to the sub, but bare with me. I have heard that isolation can effect ones ability to regonnize faces. Ofcorse face blindness can also lead to isolation but im interested in how much if at all isolation at very young age has an effect on ones ability to regonnize faces.\n\n( My parents worked opposite shifts, so no daycare. My cousins were my only friends. \n\nBut we were in church weekly and my mom would sit me in the corner of fhe nursery and tell the workers to leave me alone. They did not listen, and of course I would cry and she would miss the service to care for me. \n\nI really wonder now if that was because the nursery worked as a rotating staff and they were all strangers to me. I am sorry to hear that. I was isolated for a period in my teens. It hurts a lot. I wish parents were more informed about the damage things like that can cause.\n\nI hope you are doing better now! I used to go to a class once a week, every week. Never made a friend, and hated it, a new partner every week. Three years later I advanced to the next age group, which met twice a week, still no friends. Finally, we got a new girl moving up and she ran towards me and hugged me telling me how much she missed me... Apparently we were \"partners all the time\"... \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I do not know how to answer this. Growing up as a kid I had no parental love and often left alone. I was an accident my dad questioned and my mom could not be bothered with a mistake she could not abort.then as school started or girl scouts I rarely approached kids because I did not recognize the ones I knew. Mixing people up became a huge anxiety for me, especially with the try harder line. Ironically the only place that did not give me such a horrible time was when I spent two grades in a Christian school. Public schools where horrible. I became the weird new kid who did not socialize so they bullied me; easy target. To be honest if adults would have stopped the try harder thing and helped me I think everything could have been different. If I could have found people I would have been more social. I could see that happening.  Lack of experience with faces of different races makes it hard for people to recognize people of other races.  Lack of exposure to language at critical age makes it hard or impossible for language skills to develop.  It would definitely follow that a person who was given extremely limited experience with faces may develop issues with facial recognition, because their brain did not get practice learning people's faces when it was supposed to.\n\nThat was not the case with me.  I had pretty typical social experiences growing up.  Interestingly enough, I spent a lot of time looking at faces as a baby (compared to other babies; all babies do this) and very little time looking at my hands.  I was also very friendly with everyone.  I wonder if I was just trying to figure out who people were and thought I knew everyone or maybe I just liked people.  I have terrible eye-hand coordination, so maybe I should have looked at my hands more, since the looking at faces did not seem to help me!\n\nAnyway, on your poll question, although I have always had friends or at least people I was friendly enough with that it would not be awkward for me to eat lunch with them, I have sometimes felt like I was a little isolated in a group.  I never feel like this if I can recognize everyone in a situation - whether I like them or not - so I am pretty sure it is a face blindness thing.  I know many people are lonely in a crowd for various reasons, but for me it feels like making a connection with other people is a big obstacle.  And to be fair, it is for me and in a lot of settings everyone knows each other and I do not.  They just THINK I know who they are.", "Curious about the condition Hi!\n\nI do not have it myself or know anybody who does, but I have known about the condition for a while but could not put a name to it. I just found out the name after watching ( short movie.\n\nI wanted to ask, how did you find out you had the condition? What is your prefered feature to recognize people by? \n\nAnd I realize this might be hard, but if possible, could you explain to me how you percieve faces? Do you see them any differently, or simply cannot remember the features? Are you able to distinguish faces when looking at both at the same time?\n\nAlso, if you watched the short I would love to hear your opinions about it!\n\nI am sorry if this post is not in the spirit of the sub, either... I would remove it if it does not fit, just let me know. I always just thought I had a bad memory, or that I did not pay attention. I saw about prosopagnosia in a few television programs, but they always depict it as an 'extreme' condition, so it never occurred to me that that is what I may have. But after someone on a podcast mentioned that they had a 'mild' case of it, I realised that it is something that I might have. \n\nI see faces as faces. I just would have trouble describing them later on. And have often mixed people up; is that my neighbour? I imagine I have 'blanked' a few people over the years without even knowing that I knew them.\n\nSome people I can distinguish, whereas others I cannot. I have not noticed a pattern to those that are obvious and those that are not. I have sometimes spotted an actor in something and remembered seeing them years ago in something else (without knowing that they were going to be in what I was watching), whereas I have been oblivious to someone sitting at the next table over in Caffe Nero that lives down the road and that I see several times a week.\n\nHow do I recognise people? Generally by their 'look'. \"They have got thick glasses, messy hair and an ugly jumper\" - it is Anthony! If they are somewhere I would expect them, I would probably get it right. If they were somewhere unexpected then I would probably not realise it was them. Great film, thanks for sharing. \n\nIt is a little fancyful about the condition, most of us will have learned coping behaviours. I know who to expect in the office so do not get caught out unless they are very generic looking people. Hair is the biggest clue. I could not have got that the two women in the film were the same. What did ring true was spitting the car. I have a bizarrely good memory for car number plates.\n\nWhere it is really obvious is with actors. I will watch an actor I know REALLY  well like Theon from game of thrones (I have seen all 66 episodes more than once) and not have a clue. First clue that was so.ething wrong? Meeting my mother on a train and not recognising her with enough confidence to approach her. Took a good 20 years after that to work out what was going on.\n\nHeres's a similar thing to the film I wrote:\n\n\n\nIve read a similar book too. Guess it is a pretty obvious idea for a story once you have heard.about the condition! Voice is my primary recognizing characteristic. I listen to movies/tv more than watch. When I am watching movies my older boys will help me by telling me who the characters are as I have trouble distinguishing between them if they are similar in any way (men with short dark hair) I once read a study that prosopagnosic people tend to look at different parts of the face than other people. Like nose vs. eyes I think it was. So I am seeing the same face but looking at different parts and noticing different details. Do non-faceblind people look at noses or eyes? I would guess eyes, but tbh I notoriously ignore noses completely without meaning to. I never notice what other people would call weird or ugly noses, and I remember the first time in my life that I got the idea to look in the mirror to actually see what kind of nose I have. I was like 9. I am really annoyed because I cannot remember which was which! I am non-prosopagnosia dating a guy with it. I have realized that since we started dating, I have really changed how I recognize people. Before it was sort of a \u201cwhole picture\u201d thing, like looking at a painting. Now I look for specific characteristics, whatever stands out- big nose, bright blue eyes, big lips, smooth skin, etc. to remember people by, comparable to learning an artists painting by their colors or brush stroke patterns.\n\nSo thanks to everyone in this sub for answering my questions and giving him a break from my curiosity! I am not sure when exactly I first noticed it because I have always been pretty antisocial.  \n\nI try to look for something distinctive such as tattoos, height, color, hair length and color, weight but if I see a coworker outside of work for instance I would have no idea who they are; the other week I went to the grocery store with my wife and did not recognize her while looking right at her because she wore a shirt with sleeves so her tattoos were covered.\nI cannot tell you how often I get people confused; there are 4 people in my office I can never tell apart because they have similar builds in the same age brackets with no facial hair.\nIt is like I forget someone is face as soon as I am no longer looking at them. I recognize people from their hair, voice, build, they way they walk, and the context. (E.g. I am not likely to see my mom who lives in Maryland at the grocery store in Georgia, so that lady I just saw picking up avocados probably is not her.) \n\nI always had difficulty remembering people, and I was always surprised when classmates, whom I did not know, knew my name. I thought I was just stupid or not paying enough attention, which was something that happened frequently in my life because I also had ADHD that was not diagnosed until adulthood.\n\nIf you are not faceblind, there is a part of your brain dedicated solely to recognizing faces, and a separate part for other objects.  You are faster at recognizing faces, and more accurate at perceiving differences. Two pictures of the same person with eyes 4mm higher would seem completely different to you, right? People with face blindness do not see the physical features of a face any differently than any other object. So imagine two posters, one with text 4mm higher than the other. Could you spot the differences side by side? Sure. Pass that poster every day on the way to the bus stop? Yeah, you would recognize the bus stop poster. But could you spot the right poster on a wall of posters? Some have similar text, others have similiar colors, some look nearly the same except for text that is 4 mm higher. Now could you do it with only an oblique view of the poster? What if the colors were slightly off? Could you still be sure it was the right one? You only have a few seconds to decide. Remember, every single \u201cposter\u201d is a person who has feelings, recognized you straightaway, and now thinks you are an asshole because you cannot figure it out fast enough. \n\nAgain, we are not aliens, we do not see faces as something bizarre and unrecognizable, we are just using the object recognition part of our brains to do a job it is not really designed to do well. The film was actually based on a book if I am not mistaken, so maybe it is that book!\n\nBy the way, fun fact about the film - the detective was played by multiple, very similar-looling actors, so until finding out I just thought I could not remember his face properly, I guess that was meant to try and show people what it is like? Made me feel strange lol What do you think of the example in the movie?\n\n\"Imagine you are in a room full of Chinese people. They all look the same to you, even though they look different - your brain just is not trained to see the different features between them\" Wait, so you can remember facial hair? Is it just certain parts of the face you cannot recognize? I mean, that feels low key problematic to me. Plus I do not know why my brain would be not trained but others would. And I do not think I could train my brain to be normal. \u201cTrain\u201d makes it sound like I just need to exert more effort and I could get over it. \n\nMy preferred analogy would be: you are in a room with ten identical twins who style their hair slight differently and are wearing slightly different clothes, but they can tell each other apart completely fine and you have to just guess every time. I see. Thanks for the insight! I cannot remember any features once I look away; the way I think of it is I use a mental notebook to store the names of people with a list of features such as \"40ish, white, black hair and short black beard, heavy set, friendly\" then store each profile under a list of locations I may encounter them.  Unless someone is amazingly unique then I will not recognize them outside of the location I associate them with. &gt;Like nose vs. eyes I think it was.\n\nSo people with proso might favour one over the other? e.g. the shape of the nose over some feature of the eyes? I mean it depends on what you mean by the 'eyes'\u2014eye colour, eye spacing, eyelids, eyelashes, or eyebrows? I have discovered that the eye area can be contain a lot of information. Okay, um\u2014wow! For a non-Proso to learn some of the tactics used by Proso folk instead of holistic processing\u2014or \"whole\" processing\u2014is very intriguing.\n\n But, like, do you still recognize people wholly? As in you, you see a face and instantly go \"oh that is Daniel!\"? &gt;\"Imagine you are in a room full of Chinese people. They all look the same to you, even though they look different - your brain just is not trained to see the different features between them\"\n\nIt is widely believed in the science community that race plays a huge part in facial recognition i.e you are probably more used to people within your race, so it is easier to recognize them. As /u/stopeats has said, more effort does not necessarily indicate that your condition 'lessens'; it is still *there*, but maybe more efficiently managed more or less so. The way I memorize\u2014or rather verbalize\u2014facial hair for me to easily remember is by \"blackness\" e.g. this person has more \"black\" or has a more \"shaded\" area around, let us say if someone is rocking a goatee, then the \"black\" or \"shaded\" area would be more around their mouth and chin (I am aware that goatees have different styles but this is a more generalized example) &gt;Two pictures of the same person with eyes 4mm higher would seem completely different to you, right? People with face blindness do not see the physical features of a face any differently than any other object\n\nSo, like, Proso cannot discriminate between a *face* and another object? Is not this more prevalent in more severe and probably the acquired type of this condition. \n\nUnrelated: I looked up 'Prosopagnosia and eyes' and ( and my brain got jumbled up i.e I was not able to differentiate that if they were the same person or not, but after closely examining the hairlines, I think some of them are different.\n\n&gt;we are just using the object recognition part of our brains to do a job it is not really designed to do well.\n\nCan you cite any possible research, etc. that people with Proso use the object recognition part to discriminate faces? Also, is the part responsible for discriminating faces entirely *damaged*, *deficient*, or *underdeveloped*? Or does it perhaps depend on the brain formation of a person? I wonder if the spectrum correlates to the possibility of potentially using the facial recognition part *normally* as non-Proso people do, or that even in Proso it is still there but maybe not working properly? Pardon my neuronerdness :x For friends and people in real life, I still mostly go wholistic view because people rarely change too much from day to day. But for actors, I have started using specific features much more. I used to be pretty bad at recognizing someone in a movie or a guest star on TV because they often look really different from role to role. Tom Hardy is someone for me that I just could never recognize. But now I have noticed he has really distinct lips, and that is how I know it is him. I recently saw Charlie Hunnam in something and only knew it was him because of his voice and cadence of talking.\n\nSo I guess it just depends on the situation? I do not know how you got that from what I said. We are perfectly able to identify faces *as* faces, just as we are able to identify objects as objects. We just do not have any special ability to distinguish between Face A and Face B better than we can distinguish between Object A and Object B. The example of a pair of faces with a 4mm, nearly half a cm, difference, should be easily noticeable for non-faceblind people, but that half-cm difference, on most other objects, would not be as immediately obvious. &gt;I do not know how you got that from what I said\n\nSorry. I was just confirming that it was, in fact, *not* what you said.\n\n&gt;The example of a pair of faces with a 4mm, nearly half a cm, difference, should be easily noticeable for non-faceblind people, but that half-cm difference, on most other objects, would not be as immediately obvious.\n\nHow does this work, usually? How does motion factor in facial recognition and noticing that there *is* a difference between both of the faces in the example above. So, like, as someone with the condition, can I still recognize that there is something *different* with the faces while they are not in motion, or would it be *impossible* to tell the difference? &gt;Tom Hardy is someone for me that I just could never recognize.\n\nOh, wait: he is not Shia LaBeouf? Weird.\n\n&gt;So I guess it just depends on the situation?\n\nYes. I have got it. Thank you so much for sharing your experience! It is not about what you remember it is literally where you are looking. I think face blind people tend to look someone in the eye and super recognizers look at the center of the face. This is determined by eye movement tracking studies, not asking people to recall features. You would *maybe* be able to spot the differences in side-by-side comparison, given enough time, given they were different *enough*; there is loads of posts on this subreddit with side-by-side images of similar-looking actors and actresses, wherein no matter how long we look at it, we cannot tell who is who. They are just too similar. I never noticed that before, but I totally see the similarities!!\n\nThank you (and all of you on this sub) for sharing your experiences! It certainly helps me understand my bf as his struggles, and also saves him from having to answer my questions constantly &gt;super recognizers look at the center of the face\n\nI have read that, too; super recognizers usually look at the center of the face not because they memorize their nose more, but I guess the center of the face encompasses more features, and thus builds up a more detailed picture of a face. \n\n&gt;I think face blind people tend to look someone in the eye\n\nYes. And the keyword here is *tend to*. Are face blind people more likely to scan a person's face for more unique features to remember them by? Ah, okay! Thank you for your input. You are totally welcome to ask any more questions that you would like to know on here.", "On watching a film... My next act is usually to look up who was in it that I did not recognise. This evening I watched The Gentleman. Did not recognise Hugh Grant which I am guessing most people would have. Michelle Docherty is  prominent in A Sense of an Ending which I have seen three times Inc last week. Nope. \n\nIt is inconsequential but amusing and helps me calibrate where I am on the face blindness spectrum. Anyone else play this game? Ha. Yes. I feel like Benedict Cumberpatch should be an easy one, but no. Did not recognize Dr Strange in 1917 at all\n\nActually I try to look them up before sometimes. if im watching stuff on amazon prime, i cast it via my phone and then on my phone it shows who is currently on screen. very handy to keep track I pretty much never know who any actors are.  I found I can recognize actors often but not always if I watch at least eight seasons of a show they are in.  So I never even know actors names.  I never thought that was something I could learn. I look up what else the actors have been in during the beginning of movies or it bothers me that they seem familiar but I cannot figure out who they are. Drives my husband crazy. I gave up on trying to recognize and remember actors I generally recognize actors / actresses I know by their voice. He looks completely different there from Sherlock! Youd think he had quite a distinctive faca but nope That works if they do not do a different voice but if they are acting a different role it does get very hard! In The Gentleman, Hue Grant is not doing his bumbly posh thing and Jackson Teller from Sons of Anarchy is Irish... Neat trick! In those cases I either let my husband point out actors we know or just do not worry about it. :) He was in Sherlock ? Missed him in that too \ud83e\udd23 Yeah he plays Sherlock himself! I did have to Google that though, I was questioning myself lmao", "Intranasal inhalation of oxytocin improves face processing in developmental prosopagnosia.  Oxytocin nasal spray is sold OTC. I want to try it, then watch a movie where everyone looks the same and see if I can follow the plot. \n\nI have not found any discussion about it on this sub, but some of the folks over at /r/aspergers have had some success using it. \n\nHas anyone here heard of this before or tried it? This is REALLY interesting. Let me know how it works out. I will report back when I try it. Right now I need to find a good place to buy nasal oxytocin, I am not sure which one is good quality. That is fascinating.  I have lots of questions.\n\nHOW does it work?  I have wondered if people with autism have difficulty with facial recognition because they sometimes do not look at people and I hear that oxytocin helps with that...so does it work for people without autism but with prosopagnosia?\n\nAre some people with face blindness deficient in oxytocin?  And if so, how many and why?\n\nDo natural ways to increase oxytocin help?  For example, I am breastfeeding, but weaning now.  Has my facial recognition been better (I am trying to decide; it MAY have...but I still did that study several people have commented on and scored in the bottom 10% for all three tests) and is going to get worse?  Could I have a facial recognition dog to bring around and pet to raise my oxytocin levels?\n\nDoes prosopagnosia correlate with anxiety?  Reducing anxiety allows the brain to function better in other areas, and I do not know about the rest of you, but not recognizing people when I know I am supposed to causes social anxiety, which could be making the problem worse.\n\nHow much is needed to make it work and how long is it effective as a nasal spray?  It looks like you have to have a pretty large dose to be effective for other things.  What would be the effects of using enough to be practical? Those are some really good questions. \n\nWhat I do know is that there is a correlation between autism and prosopagnosia (but not everyone with one has the other). There is also correlations between prosopagnosia, bad sense of direction, and right-left confusion. So there is something linking all of this together. Perhaps it all has to do with oxytocin receptors, like in the article? \n\nI wish I knew more, but there is not enough research on this yet.

It is a spy show, so costumes are pretty regular and i am used to resorting to hair &amp; voice to identify people.  Two people together - it is probably the main characters\" I think.   \n\nAs the camera comes closer to their faces, I start to pick out that their hair styles are similar to the main character's but that is not enough to go on just yet.\n\nCloser still i am looking at eyebrows and hair style, but it is hard because they are hunched over wearing stocking caps and big poofy jackets so hair is a bit distorted and body type is not discernable...\n\nA car pulls up and they talk to the driver.  Ok. It is them.  I do not recognize the driver and he takes off before i can really process anything.  \n\nFour similarly dressed people walk out of the woods and wordlessly join the main characters as the music starts and they silently start trekking through the woods.\n\n\"fuck.\"\n\nIt showed their faces, but how long is it going to be before i can process all these new mystery people in frumpy coats and hats walking through the woods like a bunch of sasquatch.\n\n*sigh* Yup.  \nI have started almost exclusively watching movies/shows with diverse characters.  The Expanse is just about the most perfect TV show for me because I can follow 90% of the plot on the first watching since most of them are racially diverse. It is amazing. (Also, it is a darn good show.)  \n\n\nThe Good Place was another one like that.  Huzzah!  \n\n\nWhenever I am watching a trailer, if they do not have at least 3 distinct characters in the trailer, I do not even bother to watch the movie anymore. Super hero movies are the worst though because when they are out of their costumes we are still expect to know who they are. Drives me bonkers.  \n\n\n Although I am very interested in watching Once Upon A Night In Miami. Waiting until I have time to sit down and watch it twice in a row though. Game of Thrones was almost impossible with this. yeah this one gets confusing often - The Americans.  too many costumes.  Thankfully they do not tend to change voices for their disguise characters so that helps, but if other spies are involved then I am completely lost. oh and I love the good place and the expanse!  they should make a list of proso friendly movies / shows and sticky that! thankfully I watched that before the accident! funnily enough movies &amp; Series are the thing where i have little problems\n\n* it can only be a person of a limited cast\n* they stick to a behaviour and costum\n* the importent people are \"highlighted\"\n\nbut woe to me if i meet a family member while grocery shopping\n\nhave you tried the Audio description (telling what we see, and using names, it is actually made for blind people) it can usually be selected as a language, not just for DVD-movies but also for satellite channels etc. The only show I watch that is not SFF (*All Creatures Great and Small*) I watch with my mom, and I am constantly going \"is that the man with the cow? Is that the woman who brought in the dog?\" (No, that is the woman whose kid found the rabbit.) \"Oh! Is her husband the man with the cow?\" (They all have cows in this show.) haha you have a patient mother!  I always feel too embarassed to ask until the end. She is gotten used to it over the years! :-)", "Felt Like An Idiot Today I went to check in for a doctor appointment this afternoon and the woman said \"Hi /kjtstl, can you remind me of your last name?\" I told her and then I asked her how she knew my first name. That is when she told me that she is the my stepkids' other stepmother. I have seen her on and at various functions over the past seven years. I apologized and told her that I was really bad with faces, I feel like an idiot.  Sigh for some reason this reminded me of when I approached someone at an event during the summer and was all like \u201ddid we use to go to school together???? wow so weird, how is life these days???????\u201d, but he did not seem at all surprised to see me. Turns out we had gone to school together the previous school year. Like three months ago. Fuck. Me.\n\nSo yeah, I feel you. Brains are weird. Ha! That actually made me feel better. I am glad that I am not the only person who deals with this. Ha. Happens all the time. I am sorry you had that experience and that it embarrassed you.\n\nNot too long ago, I had a video conference call with two people: Someone I had not previously met (but had been emailing), and a co-worker who is also a friend. While we all work from home so I do not see him daily, I see this co-worker OFTEN, both for work and for fun.\n\nWell, at the start of the call, a man comes on and I do not recognize him or the background behind him.\n\nI say, \"Hey, it is so nice to meet you finally. How is the weather up there?\"\n\nHe does not answer at first. He is clearly uncomfortable and a little baffled.\n\nI realize my mistake.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nIt is my co-worker. He just happens to be sitting in a different location than usual.\n\nBefore I can explain, the other person comes on. This person is a client, so we are both on our best behavior and I do not have a chance to explain until some time later.\n\nHe was very nice about it, anyway, but yeah... all the time. Thanks for sharing! It really does make me feel better.  Hi there had the same problem offered my ,I think drink buddy, a beer ask him all questions and he reacted kind of strange and my sista tells me he is the other drink buddy whata mix up or I start greeting people on the street that I do not know or someone is waving in my direction and I am all looking around like who are you waving at. So embarrassing   so I have decided to stop saying hello to people but i always have the need to analyze everybody around me to see if I know anybody and look at people too intensively and feel like a freak sometimes  You are not alone, my friend. I know that feeling of scanning people in an attempt to determine whether or not I know them.", "Nothing has changed but I am still having problems coming to terms For the last few years I have thought I was face blind.  I joked about it with my colleagues ('Haha, that strange woman was talking to me again, no idea who she is lol', 'Did I ever tell you about the time I walked past my boyfriend without realising') and all that... but I guess maybe deep down I just assumed that it was because I was not looking at people properly, that I just did not care enough to remember what people looked like, all that sort of stuff.\n\nOne of the UK universities is doing a research project and was inviting people to take their tests.  Yeah, I took them, and I think subconsciously I was expecting them to come back and say that yeah, I am just bad with faces. But no, I am ' considered to be within the criteria for \"face blindness\" '.  So why am I having such problems now it is been said?  I was bad with faces before, I am still bad with faces now (except it is 'official'), it just keeps popping up in my mind every few hours and it is doing my head in :-/  I am not sure if I need to talk to someone to come to terms with it, what do you think? If you want to talk about it, then you definitely should! Your journey will look different from somebody elses and that is the whole point. Talk about it to friends, family, a therapist, any pet, or your reflection in the mirror. Does not matter, make yourself comfortable. Realizing that you have a condition which makes you different than the vast majority of the population can be difficult to come to terms with, and it sounds like you are still trying to process the fact that it is an actual condition and not just some fleeting struggle.\n\nIt is okay if you need time to process it, but eventually you may accept or even embrace it.  It is not a bad thing, it does not make you less human, it just means that you see the world differently.  That said, talking is a great option, as it is likely to help you come to terms with it.  \n\nYou are not alone in your \"face blindness.\"  Welcome to the club! It keeps popping in my head and is bugging me is exactly the reason to go talk to someone.  It sounds like it would just be a short term think to help your process.  Yeah, you would probably get their on your own eventually, but why make it harder than it needs to be? Im no expert but my suggestion is to try to build a friend group based on it, even online.  See if you can meet and befriend other prosos and turn it into a positive thing. I had suspicions for a long time and used to joke that I must be autistic because of my quirks and sensitivities. As it happened, my therapist thought that I was, also.\n\nShe got me all set up with the testing facility, and when my results came back to say that I am on the spectrum, it felt strange to process the reality of my \"condition\".\n\nI also felt the need to officially \"come out\" as an aspie to my friends and family. Of course when I did, everyone was supportive and essentially told me that they already knew.\n\nI think that finally knowing something for certain about yourself, that perhaps you have always suspected, brings a new kind of clarity to your self image. I believe this may be the case since you are able to see yourself from an outsider's point of view (because now you are identifying with something new).\n\nI am not sure if this is helpful, but I related to your situation. I should add that I completely agree with the others that talking with someone could be beneficial.", "Facebook Friends Anyone else struggle when it comes to people on Facebook trying to add you?  I have had so many people try to add me who have mutual friends in common but I just have no idea who they are!  My proso is more on the mild side and if I am around someone long enough I will eventually start to recognize them, but sometimes that takes quite a while.  My husband and I host a few parties a year and while they are mostly fairly small and filled with people we mostly know well, there are always a few people that are more acquaintances or come with people we know well.  The struggle is real!  Lol My solution: No social media. Two solutions:  \n1) Do not allow anyone to add you;  \n2) Allow everyone and their dog to add you for no reason at all, and do not do anything based on whether someone is a 'friend' or not. I only add people in person", "Maybe more people are face blind than I thought lol  80\u2019s and 90\u2019s films are so hard for me to watch. One woman and one token non white male, everyone else was the same person. My boyfriend had to talk me through how it is is the same person in each photo and I am still not convinced. If you asked me if these were all the same person or all different people I would have no idea. Please do not take offense to this, but I am great with faces and this man *always* trips me up! Hubby calls me his walking breathing IMDB but this dude is tricky! So do not feel bad!! Why am I in this sub if I am great with faces?! Good and fair question! Hubby has always said he is got trouble with recognizing faces, I just happened to stumble upon this sub, annnnnd the rest as the say, is three hours of my life I will never get back!

I thank all who share in here so that others like myself can learn!", "Anyone else mostly watch cartoons? Cartoons are the best. They mostly wear the same clothes and the same hair styles. I am 31 years old but find it easier to watch cartoons because of my Prosopagnosia.\n\nMy parents will ask me if I remember this movies or show they had me watch and if I remember this actor who was in this show that is the same as the other.... I do not remember I will never remember so it is cartoons for me.\n\nAlso audiobooks are the bomb I can imagine the characters personality without having to put a face on it. Also also I do not see faces in my dreams.\nI dream about people and I will see there body but I do not see a face I can sense there personality. Star Trek is also good, because they have uniforms and face prosthetics. I have a problem to remember names so sometimes when im watching movies there is plot holes for me but cartoons have straighter story and less characters usually so i understand story completely! I loved next generation! Even if the clothes change it is almost always the same hair, absolute lifesaver. It is also nice when most characters have unique color schemes - this applies to comics too. \n\nI have been mostly into video games lately, but the logic still holds, outside of major plot upheavals. If the main character(s) change appearance I am probably the one who did it. And other characters probably will not be altered at all because it is not worth the budget! What games are you into? I have been playing old school Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Just wondering the forests picking plants and making potions. Also what cartoons do you like?\nI have been watching Owl House as it comes out I am loving how progressive Disney is finally becoming.\nMy son is Autistic and he is hyper fixated on We Bare Bears so we watch that together every day and I totally do not mind because it is a great show. I do not really watch any shows anymore but I agree that cartoons are a lot easier to watch. It is also nice to see characters from cartoons I saw years ago and still being able to recognize them. Something that is impossible for me with actors I am all over the place on games. I am not great at platforming or fighting games, but other than that:\n\nAction:\n\nMetal Gear Solid (yes, it stars a bunch of clones and there is a bunch of uniforms, but the major enemies all look blessedly distinct)\n\nleaving out NieR because there is a lot of white hair and multiple sets of twins, lol\n\nJRPGs: \n\nFinal Fantasy (V, X, XII, XV and Tactics are my favorites and offer a range of gameplay\u2026 I have a bad habit of not getting past disc one so I have not finished the popular faves)\n\nTales of (would recommend every game I have played so far, though a couple have battle camera issues particularly for Players 2+)\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\nHades (roguelike)\n\nCrypt of the Necrodancer (rhythm roguelike, but can be merciful about the rhythm; you will likely forget which character you are playing and mess up at some point but that is also muscle memory)\n\nDisco Elysium (point and click/interactive fiction mayhem)\n\nJourney (words fail me? it is pretty. other stuff by thatgamecompany is similarly pretty/hard to describe)\n\nKatamari (item\u2026collection? it is fun)\n\nDream Daddy (dad dating dads! very heartwarming)\n\nAs for herbs and potions, off the top of my head:\n\nStardew Valley (farming/community/dating sim?)\n\nSpiritfarer (psychopomp crafting/platforming game)\n\nLittlewood (I have hastily sought crafting recommendations from my wife)\n\nForager (also has combat, she says)\n\nLegend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (action RPG but with lots of gathering - I have belatedly noticed you have a kid and I do not; heed all ratings) Have not had the attention span to keep up with shows lately, it is been more of a lifelong trend. Both Avatar shows and what I saw of Steven Universe and My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic were pretty good, for example. And I do keep up with RWBY. More recently, I really enjoyed the DuckTales reboot, which I think is funny enough to stand on its own even if you do not have a childhood repository of reference-getting lurking in your brain like I apparently do.\n\nI also like a few anime and highly recommend Mob Psycho 100 (hoping for season 3 soon!) and Princess Tutu, though they might get a bit scary for younger kids. Actually I have just realized I misread your name as 1989, so my estimate for your son\u2019s age is out the window. \n\nI watched Sailor Moon a bunch growing up, and Cowboy Bebop is a classic, if you have not seen it yet. I like Serial Experiments Lain too, but there will be no help from hair colors here. It is ok I play a bunch of my games and shows that are not kid appropriate after 8pm when he goes to bed.\n\nI have been playing point and click games since I was a kid. The Monkey island series is a nostalgic favorite of mine.\n\nI love super scary games like Resident Evil. The newest one \"R.E. Village\" is just an adrenaline pumping gorefest. \ud83d\ude02 I have seen all of those besides the My Little Pony, Mob Psycho, or RWBY and I have heard of all those just have not gotten to them yet.\n\nI adored Steven Universe! You should eventually swatch it all and The Movie and Steven Universe Future! (Soooo good \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nI recently binged the new DuckTales reboot. I had watched the old shows as a kid and was hesitant on wanting to watch the new one but it was really good!\n\nMy son's 6. He watches the stuff he wants during the day and If I want to watch something that is not his age appropriate I will put on some Bluetooth headphones and watch it on my phone. I wait till he is asleep to watch any of my own shows on the TV or play any games. Oh, good god.  Is *this* why I watch almost nothing but cartoons?!  I knew that was the case, but I would never considered the cause... Tell me what cartoons you have been enjoying! You are with like minded people! \u263a\ufe0f Eh, the usual.  Futurama, Archer, Rick &amp; Morty. I have been rewatching Futurama!\n\nNeed to watch Archer...\n\nRick and Morty is fantastic!!!\n\nIf you have never seen it you should look up \n\n\"House of Cosbys\"\n\n On youtube it is a series Justin Roiland made in 2005 way before Rick and Morty and well worth a watch! I never got into cartoons but I watch a lot of sci-fi where characters are in various forms of alien makeup. In the main cast of *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine*, every single main character is unique in some way along the axes of gender, age, race of the actor, and alien makeup.\n\nLately I have been watching a lot of classic *Doctor Who*, which is not quite as good for prosopagnosics, but at least the petite dark-haired young white women are not usually on the show at the same time. (Nyssa and Tegan, looking at you. But neither of them changes their clothes for weeks and weeks so that helps.) Also there is a considerable amount of evidence that the main character is prosopagnosic!\n\n(Happy to expound, but as this is not actually a *Doctor Who* forum I will shut up unless asked.)\n\nI also listen to a lot of audio dramas. (Again, *Who*...) (The fact that I am still stuck with the username I picked when writer Una McCormack did an AMA does make my post about liking *Star Trek* and *Doctor Who* rather unsurprising...) never thought about it like this. I have heard of other prosopagnoisa people who watch cartoons for this reason. I mostly watch cartoons and only with live action movies. I have no idea of my  prosopagnoisa has any reason to do with my love with cartoons, specifically anime, but i will watch other cartoons.

So I love to write stories and draw the characters, and I like to make Pinterest boards of photos that look like how I imagine characters.

And honestly it is a mess.\n\nI have two completely unrelated characters with photos that look more similar than the ones in their own boards. Another character has some photos of people with button noses and some with very wide noses. Another\u2019s photos are half Asian and half white somehow? And the character is mixed, but I legitimately believed the photos were similar.\n\nLike I clearly remembered seeing these images and thinking they looked very similar to the other ones I would picked.

I would not see any resemblance seeing them in public.\n\nSo looks like I am worse at remembering faces than I thought before.\n\n(Sorry if this is the wrong flair, I am new here and also half asleep.

I have a terrible time remembering people's faces. I work in a field where I interact with other people in the same field (but from different companies/organizations) and attend conferences. A lot of times I will run into people who recognize me and I am not sure who they are. When I know someone well and have seen them enough, I do not have trouble remembering who is who. But other times, I get totally tripped up by people who have similar hairstyles. I did not think my problem was that severe, just occasional trouble with people I had not seen often, but then this happened yesterday:\n\nI have been at my current job for about 6 months, and I just learned yesterday that a co-worker that I thought was one person is actually 2 separate people. They are both women with short blonde hair. One of them, let us call her Kelly, works in a different department and I rarely see her. Another, let us call her Mary, works a similar role as me, but part-time in the evening. All this time I thought both of them were \"Kelly\" and I wondered why I sometimes saw her during the day as well as coming in for occasional evenings. I kept wondering why it seemed like she was working more than a full-time job, and with such different duties.\n\nI realized my mistake yesterday, toward the end of my shift, someone asked me if Mary had come in yet. I was confused, because that is usually the time I remembered seeing \"Kelly.\" I had heard that there was a Mary who worked here too but did not think I had met her. I did not say anything to show I was confused, but I checked the shift schedule, and sure enough it said Mary. I double-checked the schedule from previous days when I remembered seeing \"Kelly\" and of course it said Mary. So I made a point to be around when Mary came in for her shift, and made more of a note of her appearance. And when I saw her, I thought \"how could I have made such a mistake?\" because they clearly do not look anything alike other than hair color. One of them has a pixie cut and the other has hair in sort of a Kate Gosselin style but not quite as spiky in front.\n\nYikes! I did not think my problem with faces was that bad, but I feel like an idiot about this. Well, Prosopagnosia might have different severity for different people who have it. The truth is, Prosopagnosia is not a very thoroughly studied neurological issue (not that I mind. I feel like there are plenty of more important things that need to be properly understood first).\n\nWhat you are describing sounds like normal/standard Prosopagnosia to me.\n\nNo reason for you to feel like an idiot about anything. This kind of thing happens. We are here if you ever want to talk about it more, or hear any of our embarrassing stories.  I would definitely consider mine slight.  Certain faces to me are much harder to recognize than others.  Also it is much worse when seeing them in 2D (TV screen, etc) rather than in person. Yes, in my initial research when I realized I did not process/remember individuals in the same was as many other people, several sources compared it to Aspergers in the context that there is a wide spectrum. Extreme cases result in never recognizing your own children/immediate family. Most cases are not that far down on the spectrum, and are very much as you describe.\n\nI teach some test prep, and recently had a case of a class of 11 and I simply could not distinguish between two friends who both had long blond hair. I never said their names while making eye contact. I just would call their name while writing on the board.  I am only \"self diagnosed\" with it and I would say that my experience is not nearly as total/bad as others.  \n\n\nI \"see\"  faces.. I just have such a hard time identifying them as I key in on hair/clothes etc.. you have to have a very \"memorable\" face for me to really pick up on it.  \n\n\nI cannot even pick out a pciture of my own mom if it was from before I was born... (like her old high school pics or pics of her when she used to teach dance etc.. No idea which one she is in those....)  I could never mis-identify her today / presently... I find I do eventually get folks faces but only if I deal with the person a LOT...  \n\n\nYet I think that is mild compared to some folks experieces.. perhaps I do not actually \"have it\" but I sure as heck can relate to it (I am diagnosed as on the ASD spectrum so it is possible that my face blindness is more a side effect of that than a truly distinct thing.. not sure really)  \n\n\nBut no you are not an idiot - your brain is just wired in a way that faces are hard for you... that is how I think of it for me.  \n &gt;I just would call their name while writing on the board.\n\nPro Life Tip: Prosopagnosia edition. There seems to be a spectrum of the disorder. If you do some searching you will find more dramatic stories of family members who were supposed to meet for lunch but did not recognize each other because they were each wearing new clothing or sporting a new haircut. The worst thing about any problem recognition situation is finding out you are wrong and feeling like an idiot about it. Maybe Mary and Kelly were not aware of your confusion? \n\nWhat kept me from realizing prosopagnosia is real for me is I do contract work and no one expects me to know most of the rest of the employees. I have had some difficult moments like when I was surprised that the guy in the office was the same guy who is name was on its door. When I have to apologize I often hear that others have the same problem to varying degrees or they know someone who gets face blinded like I do. \n\nKeep apologizing if you have to and then forgive yourself.  Exactly the opposite for me!  2D (TV, movies) I do much better than in person!  I will still mix up certain actors all the time, (especially the 'Hollywood handsome' types, who all look the same), and do sometimes think it is a new character when the actor from earlier puts on a hat... But real life is so much harder!   So interesting how proso can vary from person to person! I have similar - I can remember people \"contextually\". Let us say I see person on the stairway and it clicks in my head - \"neighbour\".\nLet us say I see same person near our apartment block, \"maybe neighbour\" so I say HI just in case.\nI see this person 2 blocks away- well. I do not know this guy.\n\nI cannot count how many times I get strange looks when ppl see I do not recognise them.\n\nOnce at my previous jobs, there was \"this guy\". He came to my office quite often but as he was production worker, it was strange to me that he came for morning and evening shift same day. \nAnd then, they came both :) They were \"lightly\" similar looking (production uniform made them more same) but then I understood that something is wrong in my head ;) Yes, I believe there are degrees. I also have a mild form. I can recognize my close family and some friends anywhere... even if they passed me on a street in a strange city. But, anyone without 100s of interactions will not pass that \"strange city\" test. I had the same situation several times: I thought that 2 people were actually one...and they usually think that I am crazy.", "Is It Bad to Change Appearance? I know the troubles of identifying or recognizing a person when they change their appearance in any way whether it be small or huge. So I am wondering if any of you think it is bad to change your appearance?   \n\n\nI think I would change my appearance whether I was told not to or not, but I do feel bad for anyone who may know me but then cannot recognize me. I am pretty sure people without prosopagnosia will not recognize me in the future due to appearing more male and if I can go on T. But still, I am curious on your thoughts! I do not think it is bad for people to change their appearance. I would rather my friends feel comfortable in their own bodies, even if that means I have difficulty recognizing them. To be fair, I would have difficulty recognizing them anyways.\n\nNot sure if that answers your question, but that is how I feel about the subject. No, who cares if they do not recognize you? Remind them who you are and move on. A slightly awkward social situation is not the end of the world. Your sensitivity and concern is very considerate, but most of us have grown accustomed to our recognition issues.   Good luck with your transition! I think what is going on here is that you are questioning your decision and looking for reasons not to follow through.\n\nYou should probably look deeper into yourself directly rather than indirectly through others. Thank you! Not at all. I said how I would still go for any appearance I desire even if people said no. I wanted to know what others thought considering I hear stories about people talking about how they could not recognize or identify someone (whether in their field of work or someone close) because they changed something in appearance (small or big). So it is kind of like thinking of others perspective for if you changed- what if there is people who cannot recognize you now? Personally, I think you should still change appearance as long as it is what you want, do not let anyone stop you. But on the other hand, I feel kind of bad because I get the struggle. It is fine to change appearance! It would be nice to let any friends with face blindness know beforehand, or if you want to surprise them with a haircut or something tell them who you are. Good luck with your transition my friend! I wish you all the best . Thank you! Hey, I probably would not recognize you if you DID NOT change your appearance anyway.\n\nI hate it when my friends get new hair styles.  (I literally have the same hair cut I had when I was five.  Never occurred to me to change it.)  That being said, I certainly do not expect them not to!  \n\nIf you have people in your life with facial recognition abilities, just tell them who you are or say something that makes it obvious who you are (\"It was great having you to our house on Friday,\") when you see them for awhile and they will be super grateful.  People without facial recognition issues would probably appreciate it at least the first time they see you too.\n\nBut again - might not recognize you even if you did not do anything.  I have a very good friend who has the same hair cut, same style of clothing, same everything for the last ten years.  Met her for coffee last month, and I was not sure if it was her or a stranger.  It was uncomfortable.  But it was also over in a moment!\n\nGood luck with your transition. Thank you! We are used to it so do not even worry about it, change your appearance as you like :) It would be absurd for me to go around telling people they cannot get a haircut lol Huh.  I never thought about this. But I have pretty much had the same haircut and same clothing style.  Interesting, I have to think on this.", "What is your best way of explaining prosopagnosia to the people in your life? It is a hard thing to explain to people who do not have it. \nI like to tell people to close their eyes and imagine a book. Open the book to some page in the middle, now read it. Notice how you can kind of see the words, like you know that they are there, but you cannot actually read them? That is what it is like with faces. \nDo you have any good analogies you like to use or ways of explaining it? I have always felt that explaining anything like this is tough because we all live in our own heads. I for instance cant understand why my wife cant spatially orient herself  such as with a map.  People will write off prosopagnosia as \"just being bad with names and faces\", or \"laziness\" simply because they cannot comprehend of something so far out of their personal experience. We are all probably guilty of this, just a symptom of being human. \n To answer your question however, I saw a great way to do it on this sub which i now use. Zebras all have unique patterns of stripes. Yet you still cant recognize an individual zebra unless it is very distinctive.  ( I have no problem with people with very distinctive faces like clint howard, ron perlman, or pre nose job jennifer gray) I can see and interpret faces, I just cannot at all remember anything about them, and that even goes for my own. I have stared at my wife's face, closed my eyes, and tried to hold on to the memory of what her face looked like, but it was gone after about three seconds or so. On the upside, every time I see her, I am reminded as if it was totally new, about just how pretty she is.  A lot of times I use the metaphor that it is like seeing words written in a language I do not know. I can see all the shapes but there is no meaning that instantly pops into my mind.  this is my stock explanation/metaphor:\n\nHuman faces are all pretty similar! Roughly roundish, with usually two eyes at about the same general spot, and a nose more or less in the middle, and a house under that. Most people think human faces look very very different from one another, but that is because the human brain has a special, dedicated part of it that JUST works to categorize faces and do nothing else at all.  A person with prosopagnosia, that part of the brain does not work, so the faces ARE NOT very distinct!\n\nImagine going into a gravel parking lot and picking up six rocks at random. All those rocks are going to be roughly the same -- they are kind of roundsh, they are various shades of grey. But really, if you REALLY REALLY examine them, are not they all unique and individual? THIS rock has one pointy edge, THIS rock is vaguely heart-shaped, they are all slightly DIFFERENT shades of grey -- just like how human faces are roughly similar but if you look at them carefully you can see they have different colors and different shaped noses. Following me so far?\n\nWell, okay, now to feel like what a person with face-blindness feels like -- take another look at those six rocks. Those six rocks are now your family and friends. Look at them until you know what they look like. Get really familiar with them and memorize them. Since every rock is distinct, this should totally be possible, right?\n\nAnd once you have memorized them, throw them back into the gravel field at random, and then try to go find them again in the crowd!\n\nThat is what it is like. I have also used this one before. It actually feels a lot like that.  The gravel is a really good comparison. I like that it really hits at how difficult it can be in day-to-day life.  Damn that is good. When we were dating, my husband said something like this (I am paraphrasing a little):\n\n\"It is like trying to identify models of toasters. How much do you really know about toasters? You know whether they are the toaster oven type or the type with slots. They can have two slots or four slots. They come in a few different colors: chrome, black, maybe red. But could you really tell whether you have seen a particular model of toaster before? Not unless you go home every night and study toasters. You do not know whether the dial on this toaster in front of you is a little larger than the one you have seen before, or if the handles are shaped a little differently.\n\n\"Maybe you work really hard at it, and you learn some of the models. But it is not like you have time to study each one you come across and decide which kind it is. No, toasters are whizzing by you on the sidewalk, and you have to call out, 'Black and Decker, 1982!'\"\n\n...So, the thing about this analogy is, it comes off a little harsh. He is comparing people to toasters, and that is jarring. You might not be able to use this explanation on everyone.\n\nBut for me, it worked. I knew what prosopagnosia was before I met my husband. I got the concept that there is a part of the brain that is \"just faces,\" and it does not work in some people even though their vision and memory are otherwise normal. But until the toaster analogy, I do not think I had any idea, as a person who has a pretty good memory for faces, just how difficult it is for my husband. Oh, that is a really good one. I like that it explains how things can look through same even if they are all different.  I have used the explanation that my brain takes a poloroid and then throws it away right after. ", "Prosopagnosia after ECT? Hi there. I am very curious to know if anyone has acquired prosopagnosia after receiving ECT treatment (electroconvulsive therapy)? Would be very interested to hear about it. That sounds like brain damage. I checked google scholar using the terms \"prosopagnosia + ECT\" and there has been a bit a research on this.", "Masks make it easier Anyone actually have an easier time recognizing people now that face masks are mandated almost everywhere? I find I am not as confused. And the mask gives me an excuse to stare a little longer too if I need to! Absolutely. I feel like it is partially because everyone is brought to my level, and I have practice recognizing people other ways I was wondering about this. No mask mandates here. Maybe 1/4 of people wear masks. But for those people who do wear masks, it is almost like I have the advantage recognizing them. My only mask story is the high school classmate who recognized me despite not seeing each other in like *twenty years*\u2014and I did not wear glasses back then! \n\nAlthough to be fair, not many other people in our school were under 5\u2019 tall. \ud83d\ude06 My only mask story is that I recognised an acquaintance who approached me wearing a full-on V for Vendetta mask. I wondered later if he thought it was odd that I recognised him from his voice alone! This was pre-pandemic so the mask was quite out there for a shop at Tesco Sometimes.  There is this ones student in my class that I had a lot of trouble recognizing with a mask on after seeing her on Zoom.  I am not sure why, but I think her chin may be what distinguishes her from other similar kids? I find it gives me an easy excuse. \"sorry, I did not recognize you until I heard your voice - the mask, y'know\" Everyone says \"dont worry, no one can tell who each other are with these masks!\" and Im like, yes, that is it.  That is why.  That is my new excuse and I am sticking to it", "Link to Football Brain Damage? I believe I have a mild form of Prosopagnosia. Yesterday I did not recognize my own employee at a social event because she was wearing an Oktoberfest dress with her hair up. I have spent all day with somebody before and then been unable to recognize them / remember their name in a different context in public. I always just pretended I recognized people and said I was 'terrible with names.' I just did an online test for this and scored well, but I noticed I was mostly using hairstyle, clothes, and specific features, blemishes, makeup, etc to recognize people. \n\nAll this has led me here. I know this can be associated with brain damage, and I played football as an offensive lineman and middle linebacker all throughout my teen years before people really worried about concussions. We used to run pass protection drills where one guy got a helmet and another guy did not. \n\nIt is got me wondering, could there a link between the two? Could years of calling mild concussions, 'just getting your bell rung,' have contributed to this condition?\n\nAre there other former football players here?\n\nI am really curious. Not a football player but it sounds like a lot of what they call \u201csubconcussive blows\u201d over time could have done that. I think it absolutely could happen, but I do not know if that is what is going on with you or not.  People who were born with face blindness are not aware that most people can easily recognize faces until someone tells them.  Coping mechanisms are typically natural.  This is their only way of experiencing the world.  Someone who has a head injury causing face blindness will know something is wrong and has changed, because they will likely have memories of recognizing people.  Do you feel like this is a change for you or just something you have lately become more aware of? There are medically recognized causes for proso: 1)Congenital includes all people who are born with it.  A specific part of their brain is not normal   2) Brain Injury.  This is most commonly caused by a stroke, but it also happens with degenerate brain disorders like Alzheimer's.   And it is certainly possible that Prosopagnosia could be a symptom of TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury).\n\nIt is also possible that you have congenital proso and that that was aggravated by TBI.\n\nThat said 49.99% of people have worse than average facial recognition skills, and if you are in the bottom ~10% you might be tempted to say that you have 'mild proso'.  By the commonly accepted scientific definition, only the bottom 2% have proso.  The bottom 2% are the people that research scientists bother to study. Could it run in your family? It was only once I was diagnosed that my mum realised she had it, and she believes her mother must have had it too. Six months after you made this post, I just found this sub. Not a football player, but I got a concussion in a car accident in 2014 and since then I have really struggled to recognize faces. I do fine with family and friends and people will interact with frequently. But new people-- it is not that I forget their name, it is that I will not remember I ever saw them before. Or if I do remember that I have seen them, I will have no idea where or who they are. I have spent hours in meetings with folks and then the next day will not realize we have met.\n\nIt is incredibly disconcerting. And awkward. I cannot tell you how many times I have had to explain that my facial recognition software was damaged.  I half want to have it printed on the back of my business cards. Conferences are a nightmare.\n\nThis began when I had the TBI. \n\nIt is not something I have discussed with a doctor. I have run into a lot of skepticism. And people who think I am bad with names. No, it is not that I forgot your name. It is that I do not recall your face in the least. \n\nBut I can and do still learn faces. I can, right now, picture the faces of my two new employees who started in October, for example. So ... Do I qualify? Yeah, a lot of that sounds familiar. I will a lot of times know by context that I should recognize somebody and do know them but I cannot for the life of me remember their name, and I do not want to say something because I am not 100% sure if they are who I think they are. \n\nI think like a lot of things, this probably exists on a spectrum. I know other people probably have it worse than I do. \n\nWhat I have been doing lately is telling people when I first meet them that, 'I am literally learning disabled with names so I might not remember it but I will try my best.' I say it with a smile, and I think half the time they think I am joking, but sometimes people will respond that they are the same way. Then I will try to write a note in my notes app, or my contacts of the name/context/how I know them. If it is not weird I will include a picture of their face in my contacts.\n\nWhen I was single and dating people through the apps, the first time I would meet them in person I would literally look up their photo and recite their name to myself in my car like 20 times to burn it into my short term memory. But trying to recognize a date with somebody you have never met in person before in a crowd and remember their name is insanely difficult for me. I would also use tricks like, if it was a concert or a bar I would hang out by the entrance to the venue so I could see people coming one by one rather than trying to pick the person out of a sea of other faces.\n\nAfter enough exposure, and reminding, I am able to recognize people and their names but it just clearly takes way more effort for me than most.", "I made a meme  Or take out their nose ring. Ran into my coworker in the wild. My coworker who I have sat next to every day for the last 7 years. \n\nDid not recognize her until I heard her voice.\n\nI guess she wears hats when not at work.", "Best stories? When I was in middle school, I went to a sleep away camp, for the whole week, not once could I tell my tent mates apart. Worst part is, looking back, each and every one of them had a different hairstyle and hair color... Some context: In secondary schools in the UK you generally have a form group that you will be with for the entire time you are there - early on you have every class with them and a few years in you get split up a bit for lessons but you will still see them morning and afternoon.\n\nI used to FEAR every form group meeting because I could not recognise a good amount of them! Whenever someone outside of my little social group talked to me I was praying they would not find out that I had no clue who they were. (Really helped with the old social anxiety, that one)\n\nBut the worst was this one girl. I went to primary school with her - we were in the same class! So I would known her for *10 years* by the end of it. Problem is, once she entered secondary school with me she befriended another girl with the same hair colour who wore her hair the same way, and for the life of me I could not tell them apart.\n\nWorst part is, one of them had a helpful mole by their mouth that should have distinguished them, but I lost track of which one had it really early on.\n\nAhh, school was stressful. I had started a new tech job and after a few weeks, had gotten to know everyone on my team fairly well. Then we had a business continuity drill at our contingency location. An office I would never been to before. \n\nI got off the train and was waiting for a bus. I am in a completely unfamiliar location, surroundings, etc., which is how my prosopagnosia presents itself in the worst way. I looked over and saw a woman waving at me. I thought she was just being pleasant, or maybe even a bit weird because I certainly did not recognize her. I think I quickly nodded at her and then looked away pretty much ignoring her.\n\nAnd then when I saw her back at the office, I played it off like I have always done so many times before throughout my life. I am kind of an expert at it now. \ud83d\ude00 I WORKED at a sleep-a-way camp for five summers.  We had a lot of return staff and a lot of return campers.  My first year, I could recognize about half of the thirty staff members by the end of the summer.  (We only got 24 hours off between sessions, so these were literally the only adults I hung out with all summer.)  It got easier though, because I knew some of the people from previous weeks.  I almost NEVER recognized my return campers, which sucked.  I did remember them once I could figure them out though.\n\nI remember getting assigned to pass out papers in class in elementary school.  I was definitely a teacher's pet kind of kid who wanted all the special jobs, but I hated that one.  By fifth grade I knew about a third of the kids in my class.  I went to the same school since kindergarten that had maybe 80-90 kids in my grade level and probably ten new kids the whole time.  \n\nI did not realize until my twenties that most people would know everyone in a group of 30 if they spent significant time with them. Oh god, working at the sleep away camp was a whole other challenge... god forbid there was a missing kid. So many awkward  interactions with my friends too. I asked my father, who has it worse than I do, and according to him, his best story is when my mom left for the bathroom during a date. 5 minutes later, my dad described a pretty stranger sitting in front of him.", "Vocabulary for face descriptions? I have noticed that not only I have problems remembering faces but I also lack the vocabulary for describing them. Unless the person is missing an eye, or has a scar, or something uncommon, I would just say that his face is normal, and that does not provide much information.\n\n\nI think that if learned a way of classifying facial features, I could compensate the poor visual memory by memorizing a description.\nHas someone tried something like that? ", "Are cats all that different from faces? I used to say that a great way to explain face blindness was to take pics of a bunch of kitties I know, and show them to someone. You can see each cat looks different, distinct patterns and shapes. Now wait an hour, mix the cards, and see if you can tell which tabby is which. That is kind of how it feels to be me. \n\nBut irony strikes again.... I recently started volunteering at a shelter, easily 50 cats split between the rooms. I can almost always name a cat after just a few visits. (I have a few exceptions for 2 out of 3 black siblings and a pair near-identical tabbies, but everyone needs a chip reader for them). I work with at least 6-8 other volunteers, but might recognize only 1 person if we met elsewhere.\n\nSo are cat markings sorted in a different part of the brain? What makes them easier to tell apart? I cannot blame cage location as they get moved around, and because we have a free roam room and also let several cats out of cages to interact, I cannot always say you see their personality in a group. \n\nI admit that when I got my 5 foster kittens, I looked for patterns before faces, but overall it falls into my belief that i can recognize them easily but not a human. Cats are far easier to recognize for me. Differentiating patterns is way easier than differentiating the topography of the face. Cats have far more variation than humans too when it comes to colors. Humans usually have a single skin tone (and makeup and changing blemishes, etc does not help)\n\nWhen it comes to topography and lighting, a slight change can make someone look completely different. With cats, not so much since their shape is a lot more simple than a face. I can recognize people just fine if it is the same lighting and perspective, distance and angles. The skin diffracts and scatters light weird too, unlike fur (( is a complicated process). It if you change these things up, I struggle.\n\n\nAlso the difference is for human faces we have a separate part of the brain. So recognizing a cat is completely different (for most people, at least). I think it is possible that we actually get better at pattern recognition and remembering details in order to compensate, although I am not sure if there is enough research to prove that yet. Oliver Sacks (face blind neuropsychologist) said that the part of the brain where facial recognition occurs is also connected/close to the place where we interpret directions, and differentiate between certain objects, such as cars. So it is common though not universal for face blind people to be bad at directions and bad at, say, finding their own car in a big parking lot. But I think the pattern on a cat is a different function.\n\nImagine trying to recognize all of the cats based solely on their face shapes--cats kind of have a similar amount of variation in their faces to humans, and it just seems impossible. I do not know the answer to your question, but I would not be surprised at all to learn that human and animal facial processing involve different brain regions. Cats are much easier than humans for me too! Once, my black and white tuxedo cat disappeared for a bunch of days. While looking after him, I also visited our animal shelter where cats and dogs that have been found are often handed in.   \n\n\nThere was a room with 10 to 20 stressed black and white cats. I was overwhelmed by the sight and had to leave the room after half a minute. Luckily, my cat was found by a neighbor the same day. If my cat was at the animal shelter, I probably would not have recognized him if he had not attract my attention by himself. :-/  \n\n\nSpeaking for me, I can recognize cats just as badly as I can recognize people. But analyzing each cat\u2019s or human\u2019s behavior, movements and voice helps in some way. An advantage of cats: They usually do not change their clothes very often. ;-)", "I learned last year I have facial blindness. Why did not I know? I only found out by chance after taking a test. I have a theory that my mind has adapted in ways such as focusing on voice or hairstyle, manner of walking, etc., individualizing traits. I used to work as a supervisor in casinos and would often have to check ID, and it explains why I had so much trouble. Do you think it makes sense that my brain might have found shortcuts?? Yes, your brain compinsates. If you are born with it you never had faces to go on so of course it is normal reality for us. Took a good chunk of my life before I was accidently diagnosed. I had herd of proso before my diagnosis but never thought I might have had it. I was 58 when a doctor told me why I was looking at her like a deer in the headlights. How would you know anything different even exists? My husband claims to \"never forget a face,\" and I cannot even grasp how that is possible. I was an adult when I learned I had face blindness. My boyfriend at the time happened to read an article in a magazine about it and recognized my issues. I had never heard of prosopagnosia and I doubt I would have figured it out on my own. It simply never occurred to me that everyone else was really good at recognizing faces and that I was so terrible at it. I was just winging it my whole life. After I learned more about it, I started paying more attention and realized I spent a lot more time looking for very specific differences like hair style, tattoos, distinctive moles or scars, voice, etc. To this day I still notice what my husband is wearing when he leaves the house so I can recognize him for fear I might lose him in a crowd. I also suspect my memory in general might be better than most because it is had so much training keeping track of all this stuff. I just did not realize my brain worked differently then other people's until I talked about it more. \n\nOh, the first couple weeks of school were not impossible for you because people changed clothes everyday? \nAs a cashier you actually recognize customers??\n\nI did not realize until I was around 24 even after learning about proso in school. I did not realize it was me because I had no other life experiences to compare it to. Thank you, that helps so much. I thought I was a little strange but hearing so many people say they did not know it is like a breath of fresh air. Yes, that makes perfect sense. I am surprised you were 58. I can remember some faces to a degree. Voices I can use as a fingerprint, though. I can recognize some faces in person, but it is not my strongest suit. I know my mother\u2019s and boyfriends but like in pictures and movies I am lost. Game of Thrones was a nightmare for me. That is pretty much what I do, too, are specific features. I do not worry about losing my boyfriend. I do not feel that my case is that severe; however, when I would have someone come into the casino, and I had to enter their card using their license, I had a lot of trouble recognizing their faces even with the photos. Yup, Game of Thrones was so hard. \nHandmaid's Tale is awful too because everyone wears the same outfits and hairstyles. I can remember the faces of some people but that is associated with voice as well. I can recognize, for instance, photos of my son, my father, and a couple of others, but when I try to \"picture\" those people, I actually hear their voice in my head. The weirdest part of that is the photo of my dad I can \"see\" is one of him taken while he was in Korea, when he was maybe 21 or 22 years old, and years before I was born. There are so many more iconic memories of him, but for me, memories have no face. I remember things he taught me, stuff we did together, and his voice. I feel when proso is talked about in documentaries and what not they always paste the worse case scenario. As far as I remember from documentaries on proso they never went over different levels of faceblindness. Because I was not the most severe case I just thought honestly I was bad at faces. And I was very withdrawn because I could never find the person I was looking for. I have two drawings I did: one I did from how I see faces, and one another person who has proso sees faces. Figured out I am worse then some others but still not as bad off as others. I had pretty much the exact experience.  Learned about it in college, but I only learned about an example of not recognizing your mother.  I recognize my mom...but I use other things besides her face.  I realized it when I was 23 and heard more examples.  I never had the experience of recognizing faces, so I did not know my experience was not typical. I was reading the police report in my local paper. Some drug dealer was assaulted, but said he could not identify the perpetrator because he had facial blindness. I laughed. Facial blindness, what a load of horseshit. \n\nBut for some reason I googled it to see what kind on nonsense disability psychologists came up with this time.\n\nAs I came to the part about how it manifests itself in children I was taken aback. Son of a bitch, if that are not me. Trouble following characters on TV/movies. Do not recognize their teacher outside of school. Do not recognize people after a haircut.\n\nI had literally no idea any such condition existed.\n\nLike you, I now realize I compensated by identifying people by voice, by gait, by general style of clothing, etc. I will say that before I knew about facial blindness that I did realize I was much better at identifying people from a distance than other people. I smugly thought I was smarter. Now I know that I simply use different cues to identify people.\n\nEdit: I was 45. Yes, shortcuts like that are *very* common for people with the condition. Context plays an important role, too; for instance, there is very little chance I will recognize a coworker on the street unless it is after work and they are still wearing the same outfit. I struggle hard with photos too. I think that is fairly common. I can pull up a google image search of some famous person, look through all the pictures, and struggle to accept that it is all the same person. It is the angle I think. Pictures and faces at different angles look like different people to me. That is very interesting and actually very familiar. I am amazed the more I talk to people the more I am feeling like I am in the right place. When your say you can hear their voice in your head sheesh That is true they do show the worst. It does  appear to work on a scale. I honestly never would have guessed either. Right literally one of those things that must happen to someone else. I was floored when I was taking the tests every face looked different to me. When I found out it exist I never thought I had it. Still feels strange tbh That makes a lot of sense. It is so amazing it can slip past you like that. It is almost insidious. I am going to have to do more research Right!! I used to read star magazine and I remember looking at those costumes or whatever and just being completely unable to recognize them and I was amazed at the fact that the paparazzi could identify them There are people who have prosopagnosia that so bad do not know what there parents look like or lover. Some have mild prosopagnosia.\n\nNo one knows how orderly people recognize faces.\n\nBut study came out may explain this.\n\n I did not know until my late 20s either. A lot of people with proso just do not realize they have it. I just assumed I was bad with names and would eventually learn to get better at it.", "Padm\u00e8 has Prosopagnosia ", "This benign and cute gag would not work with us ", "A brain tickler for people with prosopagnosia  I yeah people think I cannot see the differences in faces. I see individual differences just fine. I just cannot put it all together When viewing the posted video, I would see individual features that looked vaguely familiar, but nothing recognizable.  \n\nIf I were a graduate student studying proso, with access to an FMRI machine, I would be curious to look at what parts of brain 'light up' for people with proso, and for people with normal face recognition skills, while viewing the video. I do not see the point of this.   At all. this is a cool one too\n\n", "Anyone in this community with mild prosopagnosia? Hi! I just discovered this community because I think I deal with mild prosopagnosia. Not looking for a diagnosis, just want to pop in and check it out. \n\nI can recognize friends and loved ones, but I find acquaintances very difficult to remember. If I see a coworker or even a relative out of context, it either takes me an embarrassing minute of talking with them to figure out who they are, or I avoid saying hi because I am never100% sure if it is them. I used to teach mom and tot programs at my local library, and had to learn the importance of telling the moms at the start of each class \"sorry if you have been here before and I do not remember, I am bad with faces.\" I was constantly greeting the moms as if they were new, even though they had been there several weeks in a row. Weirdly, I could remember the babies but not the moms. \n\nI learned about prosopagnosia when I met a woman who had a severe case and told me about it. She said that people can be on the spectrum. This gave me some relief knowing that there were other people like me, because it is caused me a lot of embarrassment. My husband has a large family in a different city, and even though I have see them a few times a year for the past 7 years, I still struggle to remember individual people even though they all know who I am. It makes me feel like a horrible person. \n\nIs there anyone else here who deals with it somewhat mildly, and is it ok if I stick around and join the discussion? Do you have tips for coping besides remembering hair/clothing (which I seem to be just as bad at). Same here. I have an early memory of watching a movie as a kid (maybe 12?) and two of the main characters were blonde women. I was confused because I could not tell them apart and annoyed that the film cast two \"identical\" main characters. These days I love when people have distinctive hair or styling to help identify them.\n\nI used to work in hospitality and remember greeting a guest who had just arrived. We chatted a bit and he excused himself to freshen up from his flight. He returned not 10 minutes later in different clothes and I greeted him all over again because I had no idea it was the same person... plenty of examples of this. \n\nAnd my boyfriend's relatives? Out of context I do not think I would even recognize his parents and it is been 4 years! I feel you.\n\nBut I always 100% recognize my family, my longterm friends. I would recognize Tom Hanks or Keanu Reeves, for example, because they are established actors we have all watched for decades. \n\nI will absolutely not recognize someone I meet once or twice unless they are distinctive in some way(s). I need to know them awhile to learn their face.\n\nThose afflicted with the most extreme face blindness cannot recognize their own spouse.\n\nSo I consider what we have to be a subset of Prosopagnosia, or on the milder end of the spectrum.  \n\nProsopamnesia fits the bill - although it is very understudied. We can see faces, but we have difficulty establishing faces into long-term memory without extensive exposure. So it is not really face blindness, more like face amnesia:\n\n\n\nI try not to worry about it even though I have had plenty of embarrassing encounters. It is gotten to the point where I will just warn new people in advance if I expect to see them again, because I would not want to seem aloof. So it is basically just a novel fact about me that is good for a laugh. Desktop link: \n***\n ^^/r/HelperBot_ ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove. ^^Counter: ^^302097. ( Totally same for me. I am not extreme, like if I know you well I will recognize you, but it is very hard partly because I feel like I cannot claim a disability, since it is mild. I have a super hard time when I start a new job, and literally have to keep a notebook to commit people to memory in instances like that. One time I was working a conference booth for work, and I tried to register one of my coworkers. It was so embarrassing and I feel like it really holds me back professionally because I cannot remember people. Back in grade school, I was constantly mixing up kids who had the same haircut even if they looked nothing alike. I grew up being very reluctant to use people\u2019s names in conversation for fear of being wrong, and I think this is why. It is kind of hard when you are mild on the spectrum, like you second guess yourself a lot and wonder if it is your fault you are just inattentive/rude/stupid. I am right there with you.  Long time friends and family I can recognize but I struggle a lot with casual acquaintances, newer friends and some celebrities.  It takes me a long time to start to recognize someone and until I reach that point, it can take me a couple of minutes of talking before I figured out who they are.  Often, I feel very unsure about recognizing people unexpectedly when I am out and run into someone I know.  I may realize I know them but may not be sure of who, exactly, they are.  If I do not know someone well, changes to hair and look can completely throw off my recognition of them.  Some celebrities I recognize, but many I do not.  Sometimes I cannot easily differentiate similar looking characters in shows and movies.  It can be frustrating.\n\nFor me, I think a lot if the struggle is visualization of faces.  I cannot really visualize facial details well even for those I recognize easily and so it takes a lot more effort to imprint those faces into memory. I can recognize people if I have known them long enough to remember features other than the face. I recommend taking a face blindness test if you want to get a better idea. And try watching some celebrity deepfake videos and see if you can recognize faces when they are on a different body. \n\nI used to think I had a mild case, but it turns out I am just really good at coping and recognizing features other than the face. Wow thanks, this fits my symptoms much more closely I am the same way. I am not as extreme as not being able to recognize my own self in photographs, but I struggle with people out of context or in costume. Wow, I had not heard of prosopamnesia before, but that sounds exactly like what I have. My issue is not so much recognizing faces (I can distinguish celebrities and movie characters well) but committing new ones to memory so that when I see them a week from now, I would still know who they are. For example, it would be really hard for me to go back and identify what the salesperson in a clothing store who helped me 5 minutes ago looks like. And of course, seeing people out of context is a big one.  \n\n\nThanks for such a thoughtful reply! Omg yes! I used to work at a big library and had lots of coworkers. I was still putting names to faces after 2 years of working there, and if I saw one of them out of context today I would probably not approach them because I would not be able to remember who they were. \n\nThanks for helping me feel a little less alone! This is 100% me (except for the movie characters, I do not seem to struggle with that). Thank you for sharing your experience! I feel a lot less abnormal now. \n\nI find it ironic that I have so much trouble remembering faces, because I am actually fascinated by them from an artistic/aesthetic standpoint and tend to study them in more detail than the average person. I can pinpoint right away when someone has a slightly crooked jawline, or their eyebrows are different heights, how proportionate their features are, etc. And yet if I saw them again a week later, I would just as soon think I had never met them in my life. Thank you so much for your detailed reply! This is super helpful and I relate to most of it. Really appreciate you taking the time to welcome me and help me feel a little less alone :) It is strange, I have taken a few facial blindness tests and do not seem to struggle that badly. I get about 70% correct. I do not think it is an issue of blindness as much as it is committing faces to memory -- like I would not remember any of those faces in the test a week from now, even if I had met them in person. That is interesting, I wonder if that could be classified as a sub-type of proso? Like a short term vs long term memory thing? Man I wish there was more research on this condition. I agree! More research and studies would be amazing. I feel like a lot of people I have mentioned this to are like \"woah I am like that too\" but it is hard to know whether it is on the same level or not. Everyone I meet seems to think they also have some difficulty remembering faces but I do not think they have ever had it interfere with there life, whereas this has caused me a lot of embarrassment and self-consciousness over the years. I also dislike that they never have a \"I do not know\" option, so whenever I do not know I just have to guess, which is both much more stressful and just make the score artificially higher just by random chance.", "Is anyone doing the Bell experiment from Victoria University at Wellington? Does anyone know what is going on with these tests?  I find the upside-down faces very emotionally disturbing, like panic attack-inducing, and I am not a person who is prone to panic attacks.  The one where you are supposed to order faces according to how much they match a target face, with the ordering faces full on and the target face turned partly away is IMPOSSIBLE. I did! I do not remember it. I got a little write-up saying I am super terrible at recognizing people's faces and that they would contact me if they needed any future input, but I have not heard anything since then and do not really expect to. They said I was only slightly worse-than-average socially so probably not autistic, but I disagree with that. I am just good at tests that have obvious answers. no, but how can I get in on it? link? Try sending an email to ", "Do you tell people you have face blindness? How do they react? There is been so many times I have wanted to say \u201cI am sorry I did not recognise you, I have face blindness\u201d, but I have not. I am worried people will see it as an excuse, because so many people claim to be \u2018bad with faces\u2019. I do not think people will know what face blindness really means.\n\nDo you tell people? Are they understanding, or do you get the impression they do not take it seriously?  It is true that people dont know how to react to FB but so many of them go down the route of being insensitive and hurtful that I no longer try to tell people. When I first found about FB and realised I had it I went to ask my doctor for more information (this was about 15 years ago when there was a lot less information available). He told me that he had patients with real problems and not to waste his time. Considering it was the first time I would been to see him in ten years he might have taken two seconds to think about it. I have never forgiven him for that.\n\nHaving said that I have also had good experiences. One was a with an autistic man who did not say much at the time but from then on announced his name without fuss if he came near me, so he is on my wall of personal heroes.\n\nI think that your own approach and attitude will contribute to your experience of telling people about FB. On another site one or two of the members were super confident and went around wearing t shirts and badges with the message \"Do I Know You?\" Its a great idea if you can carry it off. Some people act like I am being some dramatic self-diagnosing hypochondriac until I tell them about the day I failed to recognize the man in my kitchen as my father. Then they are like 'dang you got issues.' I work in the service industry and I constantly have to explain. I tell people \"I am sorry, I have Prosopagnosia,which is face-blindness\" and then I move foward. Usually people are very interested and ask questions. Sometimes they will have already heard about it. \n\nI have brought it up hundreds of times with never a bad reaction. Just be honest and do not stress about it. People think it is cool. Hey, N8yN8, just a quick heads-up:  \n**foward** is actually spelled **forward**. You can remember it by **begins with for-**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:  \nYour spelling hints are really shitty because they are all essentially \"remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word\".\n\nAnd your fucking delete function does not work. You are useless.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\n( I try not to say anything unless they need to know, or it comes up for some reason. I worked with this guy for over a month before I realized he was the same person I had trained with before I started working. He did not seem to think it was weird when I reintroduced myself. But I explained it to him one day: \"wait, that was you? Oh my goodness, I am sorry if you thought I did not remember you, I just did not *recognize you*.\" I proceeded to explain the face blindness thing and he understood well enough and was really nice about it. I tell people when I know I will see them again and there is a risk they could think I am avoiding them.\n\nBut most people do not really react. I do not know whether they really understand. To me it seems that most people cannot understand the concept of face blindness. The \u201cdo I know you?\u201d Badge sounds like a great idea, although I would be worried about making it feel like a big part of my identity, if you know what I mean.\n\nI am so sorry to hear about that experience with your doctor. What a terrible thing to say to a patient, for one thing it could put them off coming in future for things that do not seem serious but are.\n\nThat sounds classic of autism - how brilliant! Yes! That first reaction is why I am worried about saying it to anyone. Thanks! Your way of using both terms is something I will steal. One, people have never heard of, the other does not sound like a real condition to people. So using both night fix my worries about that! That sounds perfect. I think ill-practiced at what to say in those situations will still feel awkward to me. But that emphasis on still \u2018knowing\u2019 them is a good one Telling people in advance would actually probably save me from a number of awkward situations I started doing it when I realized some people thought I was rude or hated them because I was not saying hi. \n\nIt also makes people aware of prosopagnosia and I think the more people know about it, the easier it will be for us. I would not wear a badge either but I put the website address of the UK Faceblind.org under my work email signature. One or two people asked about it, which was enough for me, as well as hoping that a few others might have visited the website to check it out. They usually immediately take it back when I share one of my more severe stories Good bot Thanks! I bring it up after it has been an issue and I need to unruffle some feathers. That is the thing.  First you have to explain it completely and clearly enough that they really get it, because they are probably not familiar, which takes time.  And at that point, you have made it such a thing, that it becomes The Thing that they know about you. I have not found a way to talk about it without getting \"oh, I have a hard time remembering names too!\" type reaction.  I actually work hard to learn names and recall them.  It still takes me a very, very long time to recognize people, but once I have recognized them I am pretty good at remembering their name.  I guess that would fall under the category of people who do not take it seriously. Yes when I tried online dating I would explain I have trouble recognizing new people so please come up if I cannot find you. I would also look at their photo on my phone then scan the room so I could have an idea of what they look like. If I meet someone a few times I eventually recall their style, walking, voice or other details. Though I have still walked past people I know when somewhere I do not expect them. They always flag me first. I usually just tell people that it is bad enough that I physically cannot watch most movies without someone there to tell me who everyone is. Then they just laugh it off like it is a joke and proceed to walk right up to me and expect me to know them besides me actually telling them not to \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Was scrolling through, saw this, and could not help but laugh. This is the same woman, right?  Yes, I get that having two different - yet almost identical - women for this ad would be dumb as hell, but there is always the off chance... That is two different women. A wavy haired blonde and a shorter, straighter, somewhat darker haired woman.\n\nIdentical? My butt.\n\nTwo clearly different people. Fuck dude. You are definitely asking the wrong group! Definitely two different people. One has their eyes open; the other's eyes are closed... Sorry man! I just thought it was really funny seeing this ad on this subreddit \ud83d\ude02 I cannot really tell because I cannot compare their usual human traits (eye shape/colour, hair length, height/build, voice), nor their clothing since they are wearing the exact same thing.\n\nThey are the easiest things I look for when trying to recognize someone, and having those key features missing makes it harder for me to confidently answer.  \n\nGlad your butt thinks they are different people, but mine struggles, my guy See, that is the thing! \n\nI do not know if the woman's blonde hair is just hiding behind her back in Picture 1 and she pushed it in front and closed her eyes for Picture 2, but the tops of their heads look really similar in colour and it gets lighter for both of them further down. I went back to try to figure this out, whether they are the same person. I got as far as trying to compare their finger length (honestly, this is a first for me) before I gave up and asked my wife, who is NT. \n\nThey are the same person. She said she is very confident about this. Aw dude, that is awesome, I am surprised you went that far, I did not mean for it to get this far!\n\nI am so sorry if it was because it was bothering you so much that you guys had to supersleuth it, but thank you and thank your wife for me!\n\nThat is what I thought, too, that the woman was the same person and that she was just photographed in different lights, angles, and distances(?)\n\nI have been going back and forth since I first saw these pictures and I honestly think she is the same person as well.\n\nAgain, I apologize for taking time out of the day for the both of you for this thing, but I seriously appreciate you guys!! Shit, sorry! \n\nI just read Rule #4 and it looks like I am two days too late for a post like this, so please keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle and ignore this post until this coming Friday.\n\nThank you and please forgive meeee. I think they are different cuz of the hair. Maybe also the lines around the mouth The lighting is also different; her hair is getting more light in the second picture and thus appears to be an actual lighter color (confirmed by her eyebrows), as well as making her face appear paler. In addition, it is coming from a different angle, making shadows appear on different parts of her face and different features more prominent.\n\nHer hair and the pillow act together to make her face seem narrower in the second picture, too.\n\nHowever, the deciding factor is that an ad company is unlikely to pay two people to sell a niche product when one will do. I did not even notice the hair! I just noticed one has a brighter red lipstick They are definitely  the same perosn Right, out of all the features I could see (face shape looking different in both pictures for the same reasons you said), I was going to go off of the hair, eyebrows, and the bit of creases she has on both sides of her face.\n\nAnd the thought of paying two separate people for a single ad (both dirty blonde, white, adult women with  similar features) did seem highly unlikely.\n\nThank you for your input! Right, they have got to be the same person - especially for all the most prominent and noticeable traits, they seem to match up pretty well.\n\nThank you for your time! The hair only looks different bc of the lighting. They are definitely the same person Yeah, the hair was definitely the trickiest part in terms of differentiating the two pictures, but I think she might be hiding the blonder parts behind her back in the first one, and moved it to the front for the second one.\n\nThe lines around the mouth have been pretty tricky for me as well, but ai think it might be because of the lighting, the angle, and that she is lying down.\n\nThank you for your response! In all honesty, I noticed the brighter shade of the lipstick, too, but it just made my head hurt thinking about it some more.\n\nI think I will chalk it to lip shape in general, seeing as they both have thin top lips, and thicker bottom lips.\n\nThank you for your response! Oops, sorry, forgot to reply, but the response below is the exact same thing I would apply to you comment.\n\nThank you for your time!", "Another one of those \"am I...?\" posts Wowee wow. \nI have always been awful at faces. People I see everyday, close friends, and immediate family I am usually fine with recognizing, but anytime I meet new people, well, not so much. So many times have I introduced myself to a friend's friend, or a friend of my girlfriend, only to find out that this is the third or fourth time I have \"met\" them. Once was literally the next day. Extended family that lives out of town? Forget it. I always play along, never use names, and just smile and have \"hey...youuuu\" as a regular part of my vocabulary.\n\nI only heard of prosopagnosia last year, when I met a friend who has it in a group. He apologized in advanced saying that he would probably have to meet everyone a few times untill he actually remembered what they looked like, and I guess up until that point I did not realize it was so out of the ordinary to be SO BAD at faces. \n\nI have ran into co-workers out of work (I work in a deli and everyone has their hair up and a hairnet on) and not recognized them at all. I mean, people who I have spent months working hours a day talking and working with them, but change their hair or their clothes and they may as well be a different person. \n\nI also think I see people I know everywhere, though? Like, I sort of have categories for people like \"stocky dude with glasses, beard, and hat\" or \"older blonde white lady\" and anyone who fits those traits might as well be copy and pasted. \n\nI constantly get confused with celebrities and mix them up, unless they are really distinctive and make jokes about the ones I think are basically identical, only to have people tell me that, no, they look completely different actually. I even tried one of those face identifying tests, and I was like, well yeah, I will get this, they are literally famous celebs, this will be no problem. But then the test had images of just the faces, with black and white, and all hair and everything else cropped out, and I was aghast at how every single face was just...the same? \n\nI dunno, I am also pretty sure I am autistic and am seeking a diagnosis for that, but I do not know if this is related or what. Welcome to the club :) Yeah honestly after actually typing it out and reading it I think it is pretty obvious that this is something that affects me to at least a certain degree lol.\n\nAlso, thanks :) Once you get past the idea that \"face blindness means faces appear blurred out\", it is amusing how similar our experiences are. Yeah, that was my big hang-up as silly as it is. I was like well no, I can see faces and I know that most people look different from each other but like, also they do not?\n\nI literally discovered this like, three days ago and it is absolutely blowing my mind I even meant \"our experiences\" collectively. Like, nothing you said in your post seems even a bit out of place compared to other intro posts I have seen at least a dozen times now. \n\nIt feels good to have that answered, you know? Glad you found it! Wife has it. She says she literally cannot picture a human face when she closes her eyes. She categorizes people the same way as you.  LITERALLY ME! And I did not even know until about a yearish ago. I totally get having the \"body type\" ID stock looks, that and gait are pretty much how I distinguish people. Put all my friends' hair up and in uniform and BAM! Who are you? Oh dear, *insert embarrassment here*! And yet somehow I did not realize this until way later in life!\n\nSo yeah, welcome to the club! We have...faceblindness lol:) (cookies on the way) Oh I can picture faces sort of. Faces of like, my close family and friends, but just, not quite. Like, I can picture my uncle for example in a general sense, and I know that is who I am thinking of, but if I try to actually like, remember specific details (that are not extremely standoutish) then it just sort of, distorts and I end up imagining like this grossly in accurate charicature of whatever feature it is. \n\nSo if I imagine a face, it is basically like, the most blank average collection of facial features, usually paired with the right hair and stuff. Unless it is a bald guy. Bald guys are basically like a smiley face drawn on an egg lol &gt; I always play along, never use names, and just smile and have \"hey...youuuu\" as a regular part of my vocabulary. \n\nLol this is so me\\~ The worst is when I need to introduce someone to someone else because I am always like ... \"This is my friend\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\" and just wait for them to say their names XD;;;; One time one of my friends straight asked me, \"What is her name?\" and I gave him this look of death and he immediately regretted it because I was like... \"Uh......\" Yeah... she was... not impressed and she never really got over it T.T I have since warned my friends to never put me on the spot under penalty of death XD;;;;;  \n\n\nAnyways, good luck and welcome to the club, as everyone says, haha\\~ And good luck with your autism diagnosis as well\\~ Knowing is so freeing and helps more easily explain yourself to others and prevent bad situations like mine from happening \\^.\\^ Yeah, I have been in awful situations like that. I mean, worst one lately was while I was at my great grandpa's 90th birthday celebration and some lady came up to me (and to be fair I was already super on edge because big social get together) and was being really nice and asking me all sorts of questions about how I was doing and how is work and all this stuff and I was just playing along like \"oh yeah things are pretty alright derp derp derp\"  and eventually managed to sneak away from the conversation. I snuck over to my mom and asked her who the heck that lady was cause she seemed kind of familiar but I just, could not quite...\n\nShe was my aunt. My own frickin aunt that I had known for years. I felt really bad but I was already stressed and all my little issues get about a million times worse when I am stressed.\n\nAlso, thanks for the luck, I am a 24 year old lady in the US with ~okay~ health insurance so an autism diagnosis seems....daunting but also exciting? Lol life is wierd and people are a nightmare Hey, Chaosotter23, just a quick heads-up:  \n**wierd** is actually spelled **weird**.

It was a relief to me to know. And now I tell people up front, so they do not have their feelings hurt  when they run into me next time and I greet them with a sort of blank look.", "Memories of Faces People with acquired prosopagnosia, can you still see the faces of your beloved ones in your mind through the recall of certain memories that were created before the event that caused your disorder? You have got it all wrong. Its not like faces are invisible to people with face blindness. They are just unable to recognize people's faces propertly. And is it even possible to acquire face blindness? I have been faceblind all my life, and I think that is the most common form of prosopagnosia. That said it is possible for it to be acquired than innate, often due to head trauma.\n\nI will try to answer your question anyway: basically when I try to think about the face of someone I know, there is just nothing there in my memory. It is just blank. If it is someone I know well I can often picture their eyes, nose, lips, etc. but I can only see individual features, never the whole. I was talking about their potential capacity to assemble a whole face in their mind and knowing to who it belongs. Thank you for sharing your insight and experience. If I may ask, do you have any techniques that help you recognize people or do you have a system that you developed for yourself over the course of your life? Like focusing on people's voices for example. I myself am a bit faceblind and I cannot really assemble a whole face in my mind. I can picture a general shape with their features like brown curly hair and dark eyes but imagining a whole face takes a lot of effort. \n\nBut I dont think it is even possible to picture an entire face in your mind. Would you be able to imagine the leaning tower of Pisa in your mind right now and count the actual amount of floors it has?  Fair point. So you would lean more towards the idea that faceblind people's memories of faces are very different than how they perceive faces in real life? Yeah you could say that. I just find faces very confusing when I try to picture them and i do not really know how to describe it. But that is the way it is with most thing i try to picture in my mind. Our mind is a very weird thing I tried one day to do an exercise, for \"fun\"..\n\nI took a paper and a pen, and tried to draw faces of people I know well (My parents, my wife, my brothers...).\n\nActually, I am not a good artist, so drawing was awful; but the point was that I almost cried at some point, just realizing I had NO CLUE how to draw my wife.  \nI drew some shape for the head and her hairs, and then, I have no idea. I simply cannot imagine my wife's face.\n\nEven so, I do not think I am one of the people really impacted in daily life by this. I can (most of the time) recognize people (mostly by speech and manners), even out of usual places. I cannot start to imagine what that must feel like. Maybe your mind does not retain facial information. I must say that you must be a way better observer than I am if you can recognize people by their manners. I do focus on voices, and any other details that I can use like gait, hairstyle, etc. Sometimes I do not recognize my friends if they change their hair! That is a good question. I interviewed a guy with acquired proso on my podcast. He says he can remember what his wife looked like before acquiring proso. But, not after. So, perhaps the face had moved into a long term storage area of the brain already prior to acquisition. So, this means that the only place that he can see what his wife's face looks like is through the memories created before the acquisition. I checked with my non-faceblind husband to verify: Yes, it is possible to picture a whole face in your mind.  (Well, not in MY mind.)  In fact when I asked him, I got, a \"yeah, duh\" kind of answer, because apparently it is very easy for him.\n\nApparently, right now he can visualize the face of a checker at a grocery store in his head.  He can imagine a person's changing facial expressions and see them in his head.  It is AMAZING to me.\n\nHe can visualize the leaning tower of Pisa, but not well enough to count the floors accurately.  (He was close, but wrong.  Apparently buildings are harder than faces.)  I cannot do any of those things.\n\nAlso, yes, it is possible to acquire face blindness.  That is actually how they found out about it to start with and did not learn about the more common developmental prosopagnosia until later.  It usually happens due to a brain injury, but things like drug use can cause it.\n\nI think OP's question is valid.  Would the person's mental \"record\" of the face stay in their memory when they lost their facial recognition skills?  Would they be able to retrieve it still?  It is really a question of where is the disconnect for people with prosopagnosia: the encoding, storage, or retrieval?\n\nBut I am still lost by the fact my husband can imagine his doctor's face in his head right now and see what he looks like.  That is crazy to me.", "Which one of us is this? ", "Do you have any people who \"reoccur\" in your life? Where they look exactly like a past person to you? The best way I can describe it is like NPC's in a game with the same skin. These people look identical to past people yet are completely different (obviously).

My prosopagnosia is moderate, so for example I did ok with Star Trek Voyager, but needed help with Firefly. I have got Breaking Bad down as a possibility, and a (non proso) friend suggested Russian Doll. Small diverse casts are best, obviously. Thoughts? Suggestions? I am open to any genre, but I am partial to sci-fi, fantasy, and dark comedy/drama. Community, Lucifer, Psych, the Good Place, Good Omens, Marvelous Mrs Maisel (except the 2 blond non-Jewish characters), Mandalorian, Stranger Things, and the Witcher are ones I thought were easy to follow. Limited number of main characters to follow, except maybe Stranger Things but the characters are divided into 3 age groups so that helped a lot. \n\nI have recently watched Downton Abbey and Haunting of Hill House and those had twice as many characters as I thought starting out because so many characters had the same hair. I was going to say all the iterations of Star Trek from TOS to Voyager Color coded uniforms and alien makeup definitely make things easier.", "Does anyone else have this problem? I have prospagnosia, and have known this for a solid few years. I was relieved to know there was a name for it, and it has helped a lot of my social life, because the first two things i tell people are that im legit faceblind (although i did have one young man think i mean i literally couldnt see faces. Like they were see through. I wish he was joking.) and hard of hearing, so if i dont greet you or reply, i either didnt hear you or dont know who the hell you are, so if you want to talk to me come up to me, say your name and where i know you from, and we can have a chat. The one thing that still upsets me though, is that i have cptsd, and because i dont use faces to identify people, i usually use things like hair color/cut, backpack, body shape/size, and that leads to a LOT of people looking like my abusive ex. I cant walk past these people or a teal l l bean backpack without wanting to turn around and go home, or run into a room and lock the door. I manage usually, but yesterday i had a double whammy: two people talking to eachother, one that my brain said was the abusive ex, and other other i thought was his dad. That dude must have thought i was so crazy, i just kept staring at him and trying to keep from backing away. I felt like a lion tamer that finds themself suddenly in the cage with the lion without any of their tools. I am still shook today, and i dont know what to do. I spent all day paranoid as hell, even though hes 16+ hours away and i logically know he cant be here on my campus. I took my panic meds and I went through all my social media making sure i was still fully locked down and there were no new accounts or anything. I just feel.......unsafe. I figured this was a good place to ask if anyone else has this issue, because my friends irl dont really understand what i mean when i explain it. I feel like im just being nutty, which i am i guess, but it is a visceral reaction for me. It feels very real and very....immediately threatening in the moment. I dont know. Ive been feeling kind of alone lately. I would like to start off by saying that I am sorry you are in this situation. Whilst being face blind would definitely make it harder, I do not think this is a prosopagnosia problem. You are still going through the trauma from being with your ex, and you need to give yourself the time, love and support that he stole from you. \n\nMy only comparison to something remotely like your situation was that, a few years ago, I was assaulted by a bloke. I was helped and I was not left very traumatised, but I have noted the fact that I cannot recognise that man. The only thing I know I would be able to recognise is his left hand, and what help is that? Not much. Otherwise, he looks like every other man with the same skin tone, hair type and height/weight. If I had been left traumatised by the experience, I imagine I would be suffering just as you are, seeing him everywhere and feeling in danger all over again. \n\nThe only things I can think of that may be able to help you is trying to get to a point where you are not looking over your shoulders for your ex and living in fear (very easy to say, very difficult to do, unfortunately), or trying to remember an identifying feature about him that is unique. I usually recognise people by their walks and their voices, so that may be a way to differentiate a stranger from your ex. Also, if you are with someone else, ask them and believe them if they say it is not your ex. \n\nYou are certainly not being nutty. Just as I sometimes get excited at seeing a friend (and later finding out it is a stranger), you are right to get anxious when you see your ex. Try to explain it to your friends like this - to you, everyone is wearing an elaborate disguise. To you, there are a bunch of people who seem to always be dressed up as your ex, until they take off their costume and surprise you with who they really are. Your friends should at the very least get the concept of a mistaken identity, and if you have trauma tied to your ex, \u2018seeing\u2019 him everywhere can give you a powerful, visceral reaction. It may not be your ex, but you are not to know that. \n\nThe best thing you can do for your self is just try and take back your life. It is not easy, but it will certainly be worth the work. I wish you luck. Surprisingly, I can relate. I was with a very abusive ex in my first year of University which culminated in a very bad night on my 19th birthday where I came out badly beaten and an intense fear of being trapped. I had ptsd from that relationship for years after, actually until this year when I finally sought out regular therapy and we worked through the trauma. Having prosopagnosia made anyone who \"resembled\" my ex be a trigger, although I am sure this is also an issue in others with ptsd because I have definitely had flashbacks/attacks from people who did not even resemble him. \n\nI would highly recommend you seek out treatment to deal with the underlying trauma so you do not have to live with this any longer. Thank you, im sorry that happened to you. I actually already am seeing a therapist, but we have been focusing more on current shit hitting the fan, and have not really covered this because it happened like 8 years ago now. I guess i need to bring it up more directly, because normally i can shake it off and be okay within like two minutes or so, but that really got to me. Thank you for talking to me. I do pretty good with not being freaked out when im just going about my life, but when i see someone like this it stops me in my tracks, literally. I can be having a good day so far, not really looking for anything in particular, and suddenly my brain locks onto someone and starts freaking out. Its really weird. Im thinking about taking up some form of martial art or something, because i think the part that alarms me truly is that im very short and not strong, so i  think that if i feel more like i could defend myself it will help. Thank you for talking to me. I highly recommend that. Feeling like you can defend yourself will make you feel safer \ud83d\udc95 I can sort of relate to this. I am a survivor of domestic abuse as well. But my problem is the inverse of yours. I thought my ex would stop drinking when I left him as he always blamed me for all his bad behavior. But he kept right on doing it and all that beer has made him gain about 100 lbs since I left him. We still co parent because our court system loves to give men the benefit of the doubt. \n\nMy problem is that I DO NOT recognize my ex because of the weight gain. His face looks so different to me and ya rarely speaks to me as the silent treatment was another abuse tactic. I have to meet him every week to do a custody exchange. Luckily I rarely run into him when not expecting it. But I look for his car. It is easier to spit than him.The exchange also happens on a day he works and I have not seen him out of his work uniform since the divorce. \n\nI really appreciated how good other people are at recognizing faces when my coworker said they saw my ex and commented on how fat he got. My coworker met my ex one time for a few seconds when he dropped my daughter off at work. Still recognized him a year and a half later.\n\nGood luck in your healing journey \ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf3b 100.0 lbs \u2248 45.4 kilograms ^(1 pound \u2248 0.45kg)\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot.

I constantly am vigilant, because i was stuck in a high school for four years with him.

Can you figure out/remember anything about your ex that would exclude people?  A mole, his height, hair color, a scar, voice? Honestly no unfortunately. In high school i didnt actually know faceblindness was a thing, so while now i pay more attention to things like that, all i really used to identify him was his backpack and the fact he was the only white guy that was 6'4\" in the entire school. But now, my school has.........a lot of guys that fit that description. I do know there is no possible way he could be on campus, because i am 16 hours away from my high school.", "Left/right confusion?  A while back I was looking at online surveys and research projects around face blindness. One of the screening questions was \"do you have trouble confusing left and right?\"   This kind of blew my mind,  because I have a very hard time with this \u2013 but had never thought about associating it with face blindness. \n\n It is embarrassing to be in my 40s and when someone says \"quick look left!\", I get it wrong half the time.  I have to stop and think about which direction is \"left\".  I do not have problems with up or down \u2013 just the sideways directions.   It does not make any sense, and it is actually hard to explain. \n\n On a related note, east and west are very confusing to me as well.  I have to mentally draw a compass rose in my head when looking at traffic sign saying east is a certain exit \u2013 and I need to figure out if that is what I want to do.  GPS has literally changed my life, And literally cut the time I spend driving by a third.  \n\n Is this common among us folks? \n\n This actually hits very close to home.  I really only know my left from my right because I had injured my left knee (required 2 surgeries), and it 'feels' different.  I know north and south easily, but I still have to go though the entire compass rose clockwise (N-E-S-W) in order to know east from west.  Possibly unrelated, but i have a TERRIBLE sense of direction.  I can easily get lost in the town I have spent the last 14 years in if I do not stick to a few well-known routes. All this is the same for me too! When I am driving or giving someone directions, it is always \"my way\" or \"your way\". I can get so lost as well if I do not keep to routes I know Holy cow! I just realised I do! Or at least did when I was younger for a very long time\u2026", "Face recognition glasses Every time I read an article about face recognition glasses, it is all doom&amp;gloom, look at this dystopian nightmare they are going to create, surveillance state, it will be like the movie minority report, etc. And I am just over here like \"Yeah that is creepy and whatever, but when are these going to be on the market?!\"\n\nI mean, I would not need it to be connected to a giant database of photos, it would only need to be capable of building a personal, local database and possibly syncing with social media contacts to speed the process along. \n\nIdeally you could prompt it to remember new people with discreet voice commands like \"what is your name?\" And maybe you would be able to sync it with a smart phone to later go in and add a little blurb of info about the person, to be displayed in the glasses next time you see them. For example, the next time you see Bob, the glasses would recognize him and show this info:\nBob Smith\nFirst met at \nWorks at  as \nMarried to  \n \n\nJust a little blurb of info to help remember who the person is. This is stuff that neurotypical can remember just from looking at someone is face, since memories of people are linked to the memories of their faces. \n\nHow long do you guys think it will be before something like this is available to us? I would lop off a finger for this This could be great for young people. I can see that. For me 60 years of prosopagnosia means I am used to it and have shaped my life around it. If I had smart specs homing in on every person within 10 yards and whispering their name and profile in my ear I would have to darn well say hello and  talk to them and where would that leave me? Exhausted, grumpy and late. I am joking a little bit but, really, these would be great for young people trying to cope with school and build careers. Not for me, though. Not whispering people's profiles, just displaying info about whoever is in front of the smart glasses. Perhaps only if the user gives a command to the glasses to snap a photo and then display the info. Idk, just an idea, not for everyone obviously. Personally I would not use them every day but for events where there are going to be a lot of people it would be really useful imo. Yes, I was being facetious about the whispering. I am genuinely happy to see any advances that make life more manageable for the younger generation of prosopagnosics. I have looked into these quite a bit because, like for you, they would be life-changing to have. There was one company selling a version of them but they were something like 10k USD and I am not sure they worked entirely like you would expect. Given that is out of my, and probably a lot of other people's, price range I looked into the Google Glass API (I am a software developer). But sadly, Google explicitly prohibits this type of application being built using their hardware / API. I was super sad to see this. Its seems the only time we are going to get this type of application is once people get used to facial recognition and tracking in their day to day lives. They would not need to be glasses. Actually that might be very limiting. What do you think would be the best way to do this discreetly, other than smart glasses? Hmm... Right now this would be possible with raspberry pi, so I will go with pi in pocket with something like a ( that has a small/pinhole camera. Putting a computer in glasses is just too bulky, and completely unneeded in this case.\n\nBluetooth headset probably, at least it would seem normal. I used to get texts autoread that way.\n\nBut something specifically made... could probably be a little smaller, it might be possible to make it pen sized n keep it in your shirt pocket. Jseus chirst please for the love of god develop this and let /r/Prosopagnosia/ know. The most promising tech I found so far is the vuzix smart glasses: \n\nThe face recognition ability looks like it is still in development and it looks like it is meant more for security purposes. Maybe I should contact them and make them aware that prosopahnosiacs could benefit from this kind of tech? The problem would be keeping the local databases free of the kind of systematic data snooping which happens with smartphones. Making it plug into a smartphone would instantly create a 24/7 global surveillance network. You would have to have it plug into a device which had absolutely no way of communicating electronically with the outside world - no wireless, no data ports. Even then it could be confiscated/stolen and used against you to find out who you knew and when you would seen them. yess, I was so hopeful for the whole Google Glasses thing. /r/lostredditors That is true, it would be impossible to keep it free of snooping. But I do not think it is that much creepier than what is already going on with location tracking and such. I hope not long. I have wanted something like this all my life. Me too, thus the voice command idea. You would activate it by saying \"what is your name?\" And it would record the name, maybe speech to text, or maybe record a short video that you can watch later to get the name. Making the problem worse is not really going to make the problem better. The core idea would be fantastic... if there was any way to safely implement it in today's world. Absolutely. I want it connected to my own database of people I really have met, and to a general public database that shows recent social media activity, too. We are going to have this, anyway. Not for a while, but eventually. We will need 24/7, real-time networking of all people and objects as cities go automated (driverless). What we see around us every minute will be fed into the network, so all moving automated vehicles can navigate. At the very least, we should get access to the parts of that network that will help us. No point in making it worse before it has to be, though. How is any of that \"worse\"? It is better for every part of society. Worsening privacy issues? People do not have privacy out in public. And since people have already largely sold their privacy for some free social platforms and maps, at the very least we should demand a collective benefit from all of the collected and stored data. Or take the privacy back and fix the expectation. There is no expectation of privacy in public. That is why it is called public. It is unreasonable to expect total privacy when we are in the public parts of our communities and societies. There is nothing wrong with that. It is not unreasonable to have a degree of privacy expectation in society. I would be horrified if every person in a crowd could be identified. My neighbors might know me on sight, but there is also an expectation that I can travel a short distance out of my home area and not be known.\n\n\"Public\" does not mean \"total lack of privacy\". It means \"accessible to all people\". Nothing about those people having their own anonymity breached against their will in that space. Sorry, but if you are in public, you have no expectation of privacy. Anyone can look at you, listen to you, identify you, and use the data you produce by being out and moving around and doing things. It is unrealistic and paranoid to expect that you can be out in public and have anonymity. So if I walked past you, you should expect to know who I was? Yeah, no thanks. Why not? If we are in public, if we are in the same train car or doctor's office, or I am considering taking a job at your company, or I meet you at a bar, why should not I be able to verify your real name and know your recent activities? Should not I be able to find out if you are lying about who you are, or if you have been posting violent content online? If I pass you on the street, and you are wanted by police, should not I be able to know that and report you? Taking a job at my company is an *entirely* different scenario from being in the same train or waiting area as me.\n\n&gt;If I pass you on the street, and you are wanted by police, should not I be able to know that and report you?\n\nNo, no you should not. It is not your business, it is that person's and the police's.\n\nYou sound like one of those grannies who has has nothing in their life except interfering in the lives of others. In public, I have the same right, reason, and authority to judge others who share the same public space. You sound like someone with something to hide...like maybe exactly the kind of social media or personal history other people would want to avoid... &gt; I have the same right, reason, and authority to judge others who share the same public space.\n\ni.e. none. You have no legal authority, no moral authority, and no social authority. Now you are projecting and going way outside anything said in this conversation. It is not unreasonable to know who we are sharing public space with. \n\nWant privacy? Stay in a private space. Want to live in the modern world in coming decades? Deal with the fact that your public information is public. &gt; It is not unreasonable to know who we are sharing public space with.\n\nIt is unreasonable to demand that such information be turned over to you, or that you should be able to obtain such information whenever you like just because you personally feel you have a right to it.", "I have no clue which one is which.

So I tried harder to LISTEN to what people were saying - which made me worse at recognizing them, but I remembered literally almost every word they said.  (I already have a significantly above average memory for that sort of thing.)  Then I was remembering too much, so that if I actually recognized the person, I was making them uncomfortable.  I was aware of that so was trying to remember everything, but not say too much...it was very confusing.  Glad I figured out what was going on and that I am not a complete jerk.

Can you picture yourself in your head?", "faceblindness and uncanny valley So I have been wondering for quite a while about why I never get that \"uncanny valley\" feeling. Today I was thinking maybe it has something to do with face blindness. I did a tiny bit of Googling and( which is interesting but there is not much info there.\n\nSo, do you have face blindness, do you get the uncanny valley feeling? If you do not know what it is, look it up. It is interesting. I am faceblind and have never fully understood the uncanny valley thing. I mean, I get the concept, I just do not experience it. I get it with some things, but there are others that bother most people and do not bother me (like the Jeff Bridges digitally altered appearance in Tron Legacy, did not strike me as creepy at all). I had to look it up.  I feel it a little when I realize the face is not quite right.  It is not very strong - but it does feel off.  Maybe I am just used to faces feeling off?  Sometimes I do not recognize that the face is not actually a person though. I get it but only occasionally. There are a lot of cases where I do not but everyone else does, like the Cats live action trailer or Final Fantasy Spirits Within I get it sometimes, yeah.  The face that they referenced in the link looks off to me if I look closely at it, but it does not make me uncomfortable or anything.  I just thought \u201cOh, that must be artificial.\u201d  \n\nI do get kind of weirded out by the eyes in Alita: Battle Angel, FWIW.  I know they are oversized on purpose, but they just look wrong. Yup, the uncanny valley just is not a thing for me. When people post pictures of dusty, dirty dolls like \"look how spoooooky\" I feel like they are making it up. Yes! Dolls never creep me out and I collect them. But so many people say they are creepy. HOW THO?! I find them creepy, but I am pretty sure it is just because of all the horror films I have seen featuring them. I would heard of the issue with Polar Express but have never come across the expression 'uncanny valley'. It is  interesting. I dont like dolls, especially clown dolls and ornamental dolls that people use for decor. An acquaintance collected a few and kept one on her sofa that looked just like her - it was horrid. The only thing I have seen recently that made me shudder was a video clip of a humanoid shape robot that can do backflips. Ugh. I have had some uncanny valley experiences and I am face blind.  \n\nSince people are aware that uncanny valley is a thing, I think they work hard to avoid creating images/animations that fall into it so it seems like over time I have encountered it less often.  I am work in software engineering, over the past few years I have encountered the uncanny valley a few times at work but always in the context of \"this is a place-holder that will be replaced with something not creepy before any kind of user testing is done\". I agree, dolls are creepy in their own right.  It is not an uncanny valley thing, it is more of a \"Free Candy\" Van thing. I get the uncanny valley when it comes to lighting and animation. I even get it with CGI anything. It is never about the face. I seem to be immune to uncanny valley, and I am on the other end of the spectrum of face recognition; in face recognition tests I consistently score above average. (I also use an opposite coping strategy than face blind people often use: I pretend to \\*not\\* notice anyone I recognize unless they notice me first; to avoid the awkwardness when I greet someone I have met once years ago and they have no idea who I am. While I hear face blind people usually politely greet anyone as if they are familiar just in case it is a friend.)  \n\nI found this post since I was wondering if the level face recognition was an important part of experiencing uncanny valley at least when it comes to artificial faces. \n\nMy hypothesis: Assuming the cause of that feeling (that I have never had) is caused by a face looking very close to normal human that you sometimes feel it is human but sometimes not; maybe most face blind and most super recognizers does not experience it as often. If your face recognition ability is low, most faces that are vaguely human might just seem perfectly acceptably human to you so there is almost never any feeling of it being wrong (unless you consciously think about it being simulated/a robot); and to a super recognizer any robot/simulated face will (at the current technological level) always look obviously non-human  and therefore never sometimes disturbingly human.\n\n\\--\n\nThough I am also probably autistic, so to me neurotypical humans often feel more unfamiliar and confusing to me than nerdy and autistic people feel; and deterministic things like robots and software is comfortably reliably predictable to me; so that may also be a reason. (In fact one of the  things that triggers feelings in me that is most similar to what people describe uncanny valley; is actual humans I do not know that behave overly extroverted and overly \"friendly\" to me; like salesmen in shops \u2013 those really creep me out.)", "Has anyone ever stopped being faceblind? Last night I went from not being able to recognise most people (not all) to being able know who people are at first glance. Is this normal? Irrelevant.\n\nWe use different cues to identify people. If everyone was dressed in the manner they always dress, you would have recognized those who you know well without even seeing their face.\n\nWatch a few seasons of GoT, or some teenage horror movie to see if you can keep track of characters. I would not use GoT as an example. They are easy to identify. What about them do you recognize? You can train your brain to recognize faces better in some cases. I have been trying to. I disagree,  I had a really hard time with a lot of the more minor characters. Not to undermine your struggle, but GoT has more than 550 listed cast members, tbh, even people without prosopagnosia would find it extremely difficult (pretty much impossible) to remember all those characters on a normal watch. Good point, it also did not help that they recast a few characters as well. They did? I did not notice anything like that. Lol Ask yourself if you are using faces or other aspects like hair, walk and dress sense. I often identify people by their hair. I could not tell the difference between Rob and Jon, and non of the gray haired white dudes especially once the show got past the books and I did not know who was in each scene. Globally or just in one instance?  Like you never could recognize people and now you could always recognize people?  Or last night you had an experience where you knew who people were easily?\n\nSignificant changes in facial recognition abilities are usual the result of something happening physically to the brain (head injury) or drug use, although that is usually it getting worse. I would love an update, op! Was it a one time thing or can you still recognize faces? I just watched mission impossible 3 and did not have a great time with that but for all I know it is just because they all look the same Interesting. Any big changes since then? Any happen right before it changed? I have gotten significantly better at knowing people I know (like in a TV show) but still SOL in movies I have a really hard time with movies too. Shows are easier (in my opinion) because they generally have the same cast and after understanding everyones role its easier based on context and other looks (speech, mannerisms, clothing) to figure out who they are suppised to be. Animated shows are the only ones i dont need a human cheat sheet for. Were you perhaps on any substances? I believe Dr. Oliver Sacks has a similar situation happen to him. Sober as a nun only two people   I can recognize anytime anywhere  out of context etc..  when i first met him ( then became a friend) my brain lit up  even so with his mom...", "Does this sound like face blindness, or is it not severe enough? I am 30 and this has only started to worry me recently as I work more and more with new people. When I was in school or at university, or in small workplaces, I never had issues recognizing people. And I never had issues recognizing people I know well, such as friends or family, or co workers who I see every day.\n\nHowever, when I have only seen someone a handful of times, that is usually not enough for me to recognize them again, unless I am particularly interested in them or they have some defining features. I often confuse people with similar features.\n\nI work on film sets which is particularly difficult. Every day, there are maybe 100 people running round and a significant chunk of them changes every day. It is pretty much compulsory to introduce yourself to those related to whatever you are doing, and you have to say hi to each one of them every day in the morning. Now this procedure is incredibly stressful to me, because I never quite know who is who. After a lot of time, I will start to remember them, but it takes far more time than what is normal. It makes me appear antisocial because I may have had a conversation with someone but the next day I do not even say hi to them. Or I may forget what they are doing, or what they told me yesterday because I cannot identify them. Or someone asks me to bring them something and suddenly I cannot figure out who it was and it is very weird for everyone. To avoid this, I try not to be at the center of attention and I try to solve my problems alone, but this means I often cannot figure things out and I just leave it at that.\n\nBut it is not like I cannot process faces. I am absolutely fine recognizing the regular people in my life. Just not the ones I have only seen a handful of times. But I do realize this is not normal, as literally everyone I have ever met remembers me and those around them. And since it is making my life difficult, it does seem like a disorder, and not just a \"I am really bad with names, haha\" type of thing. I did not realize it until I was about 25 or 30. I do not think it is black and white I think some people have more of it than others. I think if you are just used to remembering people by their hair or whatever you get kind of good at it And if you have never been another way You do not really have anything to compare it to. I do not know how much you have to have to be official but sounds like you are on the continuum somewhere. I am not sure if it is Prosopagnosia in your case. It *might* be, or it might just be general memory issues.\n\nI have been married for over three years, and I have known my wife for about ten years. If she were to suddenly get a haircut or change her hair color, and wear a new outfit, I would only recognize her through her voice (and context clues, of course. Like seeing a strange woman playing with our kid when the only car in the driveway is hers, I can assume it is my wife, regardless of what she looks like). I cannot picture her face. I know she is got brown eyes, no freckles, caucasian skin tone, and brown hair, but I cannot really picture what her face looks like. She is got a nose, but I could not really tell you anything about it. Same with the rest of her features.\n\nIt might be that you were born with Prosopagnosia, and are so used to recognizing context clues, that now you are struggling when there are no context clues other than \"You are 1 of 100+ people I work with\". In High School or college, you know \"Hey, that guy has perfect blonde and is smiling at me. That must be my buddy Steve Adam Adams. Also, he is in Steve's seat and sounds like a sportscaster, even though he is only ten years old. Of course it is Steve.\" That reminds me... Not long ago I had a good friend and classmate that I have known well for 1 year, and he had long hair and a beard. One day he got a haircut and a shave. He walked up to me and I had *no freaking clue* it was him until like 1 minute into the conversation. It was very strange. I had never had this happen before but it definitely caught me off-guard. So it does actually happen even to people I know well and I am probably relying heavily on things like hair, as you say. If that is the case, then yeah - it sounds like Prosopagnosia to me. Loads of us recognize people from a combination of:\n\n* Familiar Outfit\n* Hair Color/style and Facial Hair\n* Context Clues\n* Voice\n* Body Shape\n* Gait (how they walk)\n* And basically anything/everything besides \"face\".\n\nThose of us who are born with it do not have that difficult of a time getting by, but apparently it is really debilitating for people who acquire it later in life (like after a TBI), after being used to being able to recognize people on face alone. Yes that makes total sense. But while I can maybe get away with it most of the time, it is constantly stressful and exhausting nonetheless. Mostly, if not only, because I am supposed to keep it a *secret* in front of everyone.\n\nA blind person can just announce they are blind, and people will instantly understand and even help. But face blindness? \"Dude it is ME, do not you recognize me?? We had lunch together yesterday!\" there is no easy way to explain that. Unlike blindness, you cannot start explaining this to every acquaintance you meet because it is not common well understood. What is really exhausting is trying to constantly avoid situations where it would get awkward, and trying to find explanations to why you did not/could not just ask someone. It would be so much easier if there were one set of rules for dealing with face blindness. Unfortunately it does not work that way, but knowing about face blindness is definitely half the battle. After that it is a case of figuring out how you want to live with it, as it is a way of life. If you dont like telling people, dont tell them. If you dont like parties, dont go. If you worry about offending people, let it go. You are likely to have ignored them before and will ignore them again. If they care enough they will ask and will be more receptive to your explanation. It took me a long time to embrace my faceblindness but life became easier once I did. Sounds like it to me. It is definitely a spectrum. I am mild. Takes me 6-20 interactions to recognize someone. But, even then, after a long time or in an unexpected context all bets are off.\n\nCheck out my podcast, Faceblind. Will have a range of people on. Already getting good coping tips that will help you regardless of \u201cofficial\u201d diagnosis. \n\nFor example, one guest just suggested always saying, \u201cNice to see you\u201d rather than \u201cnice to meet you.\u201d  Huh! Wish I would thought of that 40 years ago! It is a spectrum. It sounds like you may have it. Your experience sounds similar to mine. I grew up in a small town and did not notice anything amiss until I went to college out of state. \n\nEven though it was a small college, I began to notice after a couple of weeks that everyone had made friends faster than me. It was because I had great interactions with people ... and then as far as I knew, I never saw them again! People I got along with great in class, I never said hello to when I saw them in the cafeteria. (There was one girl I had three classes with. We sat next to each other and chatted a lot in one -- I ignored her in the other two classes. Once we got that straightened out, we went on to be roommates!)\n\nI had an office job in my major's department, and I discovered later that people thought I was stand-offish because I was professionally polite, but they saw me so frequently (without me realizing) but I never \"warmed up.\" \n\nSo your situation sounds fairly similar. But it sounds like you are on track to developing coping mechanisms! I have it mildly, but the film set thing is making me think of something...actors are especially hard for me, because 1) They are super cookie-cutter \u2014 nearly all white, tall, thin, a certain look to them. They actually do all look alike, because the people who make it as actors are absolutely not a regular slice of the population; there is a really narrow range of people who are \u201cacceptable.\u201d And others in the film industry, even if they are not on camera, are going to largely fit this mold too \u2014 it is just industry culture. I used to do sound, and so many of the folks were just as hard as the actors. \n\nAlso, 2) Actors and other fashion industry folks drastically change their hair and makeup in a way that other folks do not. In an average office, you are not seeing people who come in one day, then the next day have completely different makeup (like, going for a totally different age and impression of health and so forth) and a $5000 wig. And again, the off-camera folks are not going to do this as drastically, but they still tend to be into the fashion scene and are going to be doing stuff like wigs on white people and full faces of makeup during the day. A friend of mine has it really severely. She explains it to people just like blindness. You know how it is good etiquette to greet blind people with \u201chey Joan, it is Sarah, just want to make sure you know our department is meeting at 12\u201d \u2014 you should do the same for her, because it is likely she does not know who the fuck you are by sight. When someone drastically changes their appearance, I am pretty sure even neurotypical people have trouble recognizing them. **There is no bright line between normal and abnormal facial recognition ability.**  People fall on a spectrum.  Some are very good, some are very bad, and in between there is a full range of abilities to be found.\n\nTo be classified as having prosopagnosia for the purpose of scientific research, you are suppose to be worse at facial recognition than 98% of people, but this is impossible to measure consistently with a simple test at any point in time.  If you take a proso test while they are doing a brain scan in an MRI machine, the test can be a bit more conclusive.\n\nThe impact of facial recognition problems/errors depends on real world situation and circumstances.  Simple tests can only look at testable things that correlate with real world difficulties.  It is enough to know that you have had problems in some situations.  Unless your difficulty is caused by a stroke or head injury, a more precise and accurate diagnosis has no value because there is no treatment or cure.  You can only adapt and learn tricks to minimize the impact on your quality of life. It sounds like you could be partially face blind. I recognize people easier if I have seen them dozens of times or if I have seen photos of them. It increases the odds of me recognizing them again. When I started a new improv group I would write down the names of people and things that stuck out. Thomas became \u201cTallmas\u201d and so on.", "Having Difficulty Guessing Age? Does anyone else with faceblindness have difficulty judging age from a face? Since people with faceblindness tend to interpret faces by parts instead of a holistic view, I would imagine this is the case. I probably have a mild form of faceblindness, but sometimes (many) people claim so-and-so has a babyface, and I just cannot see it. I guess I interpret the parts of the face instead of the whole.\n\nIn obvious cases, I can see it (ex. Thomas Sangster at age 13 looks anywhere from 2 to 7, and James Hamblin (in his 30's I think) without curly hair looks 12.) But even the changing of a hairstyle like I mentioned to a mature version throws that off. Little kids with adult hairstyles look like adults to me.\n\nIt even changes for the same picture of myself viewed on different days. I can guess that I look 12, 18, etc. on the same picture!\n\nA lot of times, when an adult is claimed to look like 12, I can see how people might view it that way, but because I view the parts instead the whole, I can also instantly tell that their individual facial features do not match a 12 year old exactly. Yeah it is really impossible for me. I just guess 28 or 45 for every adult lol. I can only determine age from other factors than the face, for example the height or obvious things like wrinkles. So ages from 20 to 40 are really hard to distinguish for me Yeah wrinkles are obvious for me. Pretty much I divide adults into 2 blocks: your generic adults and the aged (gray/white hair, aged skin, wrinkles, etc.) - no offense. Within those blocks, it is hard to tell heads from tails. Yes. I have mistaken someone for his father before (him: early 40s, his dad: 60-70s). I would met the dad previously, then misheard when I was introduced to his son and thought it was the dad again, so I did the whole \u2018Ah yes we have met\u2019 thing\u2026 for him to tell me no, we have not\u2026 \n\n(I recovered in that situation by saying he looked SO like his dad and he must get that mix-up all the time! Meanwhile I still could not tell you what either of them looked like haha.)\n\nI am not sure if it is that I cannot tell the difference in their ages, or because I rely so heavily on external clues (like being told who I am meeting, which in this case got muddled) that I  then subconsciously ignore any other distinguishing factors like age. Interesting though. It is not a prosopagnosia issue.\n\nOld people make an effort to look younger. Young people make an effort to look older. I agree that the issue is widespread, but proso can make it waaaay harder. OP already mentioned that they have compared their own ability to distinguish age to the people around them and they find it harder than them. I fully understand that you just wanted to add to the conversation but it is coming across as a little dismissive. Interesting. Now you sound dismissive of u/Smartypants234 perspective just because it does not agree with OP's.  \n\n\nI have prosopagnosia. I cannot even recognize my own son. And I have no problem with ages.  \n\n\nLike so many other things on this sub, it seems like somebody says, \"Hey! I have problems with X,Y, or Z too. Think they could be related?\" And then everybody else who has those issues says, \"Yeah. I have that problem too!\" And then they all get together and agree that it is related.  When, in fact, the thing that everybody wants to tie to proso is often just a thing that a wide variety of people experience.  But since this is a targeted sub, you do not see my friend with amazing facial recognition who has thought that I am in my 20's for the last ten years. (I am in my 40's.)   \n\n\nCorrelation does not equal causation and there are not nearly enough people on this sub to establish anything other than that there is an idea that might be worth exploring.   If you really want to find answers, you need to stop dismissing people who have experiences outside of whatever the flavor of the month is. Even better, find somebody who studies proso and try to work with them to get a wider sampling of people with actual tests rather than just subjectively assuming things.  \n\n\nIf you are interested:   \n\"Most developmental prosopagnosics do not report deficits of facial age or gender perception.\" \"just because it does not agree with OPs\" or because for many people questions like these are highly personal so when presenting an argument against it it is nice to include more information than \"no it is not\"?\nMaybe I was a bit unclear and should have included a template explaining how to include personal experience in a discussion of personal experience.\nMaybe it is true that there is a pattern of only accepting positive responses but you must excuse me if I fail to see how I am contributing to it by attempting to discuss the issue at hand with someone to understand where they are coming from. I am also not a big fan of short responses based on personal experience presented as facts, but I did not feel like anyone would gain anything from me writing an essay about it. Maybe I should have just so not a soul can misinterpret me.\nThank you for adding the article, I think it is a genuinely good contribution to this discussion. r/13or30 is a fun place Okay. If these questions are highly personal to you I am just going to drop it. I thought people here might be looking for answers rather than just telling highly personal stories.   \n\n\nHere are some more sentences to make you feel better about the length of my answer. Maybe I can include some sarcasm in order to try to be more personal like you. You must excuse me if I do not do things properly. Many of us with prosopagnosia do not do well with emotional processing because we cannot see emotion in people's faces. You want to call bullshit on that? Well, let me tell you that it is a highly personal experience so you are not allowed to disagree about whether it is related because we are just all so emotional here. Cannot tell you how many times I have told someone \u201cyeah, people our age\u2026..\u201d and the person says \u201chow old do you think I am? I am 52.\u201d And I am 28 lol.  It makes people feel great tho lol so I do not elaborate too much on it.\n \n\nI am also glad to not be a man with this problem bc I have had experiences where I thought teenage girls (15ish) were straight up college students. Granted they were pretty mature but still. I can tell I have made you feel unwelcome or uncomfortable, I am sorry. That was never my intention. I do not know how you interpreted my message but I see that I should have added \"/Gen\" when I thanked you for the article since my formatting disappeared. Actual research should always be the conclusion to any discussion, but how someone delivers said research or disagreement is important. You never know what is personal for someone. It is not apparent on a post if someone thought of it and then posted it, or if they went back and forward for a month before mustering the currage. I do not know what context you learned that feelings do not belong in a discussion but I sincerely hope that it was not through someone discrediting or invalidating your feelings. What do you think prosopagnosia is? I suspect you misunderstand.\n\nWe can see faces. We can see wrinkles, eye color, nose size, etc etc.\n\nWe cannot recall faces. I can look at you and make an age judgment that is in the same ballpark as everyone else would guess. The problem arises when I try to recall what you look like and make an age judgment from memory. In that case a ballpark guess would be lucky. I think proso is the thing my doctor told me i have, but yeah that is a good explanation YES. omg, ever since I was a kid I have always been confused at how people are able to tell how old someone is...whenever they ask me about it I cannot give an answer I cannot tell ages at all. People just sort of flow from young to teen to adult to old. (Sometimes I can identify people as young adults or middle aged, but not usually.)\n\nTo clarify an issue that is coming up in this thread.  Some people with prosopagnosia only have problems with 'face memory' and some people have problems with both 'face memory' and 'face perception'.  For instance, I have perception issues and often cannot tell if two pictures of faces right next to each other are of the same person or not.  \n\nThe Cambridge Face Memory Test is available online and I would guess most of us have taken it.  I had the opportunity to take the Cambridge Face Perception Test as part of study.  In this test, they show you a face and then have you arrange a series of faces below it in order from most to least similar to the example face.  (I scored better than the memory test, but still far below average.) So this is kind of weird for me.  I feel like I am not good at ages.  I can get what age group they are in vaguely (like 20 vs. 40, not 25 vs. 35.)  But I seem to be able to do it sometimes, so I am not sure why I cannot generally retrieve it.  \n\n* I am a teacher.  I can pretty reliably identify kids' ages, particularly in the age I work with.  Like more often than not, I know if a kid is 7 or 8.  Part of this is cheating - it is based on their behavior, not just their appearance.  And I have literally worked with thousands of kids that were 7 or 8, so I have a lot of practice.\n\n* I have said this here before and it is really weird, but I am ONLY attracted to men that are really close to my age.  By that I mean like 2 years older than me and a year younger than me.  I am in my 30s.  I have not been attracted to conventionally attractive actors that I have seen in films where they were younger or older, and then seen a movie where they were in that age span and been like, \"Oh, now I get it.\"  So somewhere in my brain, clearly I can recognize age pretty well, but my brain does not seem to be willing to tell me how old anyone is.\n\nSo I guess I can recognize ages functionally?", "A true and hilarious story on Twitter about a prosopagnosia-caused office mishap  I am in marketing, and whenever there are photos and captions to proof with a press release, my heart skips a beat, and I have to delicately explain to someone that nonononono, I am NOT the one who should do this.", "\"Full House of Mustaches\" My partner shared the video ( with me and it took me until the scene with the baby to figure out that &gt;!everyone has Ron Swanson's face!&lt;.\n\nPlus side, I saw that &gt;!everyone has a mustache!&lt; right off the bat.

I have heard that if you are a super-recognizer you can get hired by police to identify criminals in videos.

I just took some tests for fun. I score below average but not SUPER low. What struck me though was that all the tests included chin shape and some hair in the pictures. Many asked simply if I had seen an identical picture of a face before, at which point things like frame and lighting come into play. Are these actually legitimate tests?  Anyone else do okay on them? Do you have a link I would like to try one but if there is the same hair I can usually get it. ( I took that test. Seems bogus to me. Was well above their threshold for faceblindness.  \nThey had all kinds of warts, wacky hairstyles, and crazy eyes. Seems invalid to me. Glad I am not the only one who thought it was designed by someone who has no idea how prosopagnosia works Thanks for the link I did it and I did way much better on that test than I do in real life I did better than like 60% of people there were too many clues. Hair, acne, also I think it would be better to test us by having more time in between faces.

Got a 53\n\nIT was from teh AMA by the researcher in here a ffew weeks ago. A couple years back, I was searching for tests and the best one I could find edited out the hair, and I think even had the photos in black and white so it was isolated to only facial features. It is been a while, so I do not remember too well. My only issue with it was that there was not an \"I do not know\" button, so it was probable that I gained some points by being forced to guess answers. I *think* this is the test, but i apologize in advance if it is not:   Yeah, there are some tests, where once they get past the first intro section, that I am just completely guessing on every question.  And it is not like if there are four choices that you always score a 25% - you can guess lucky or unlucky.  If it is just the face and the faces have no distinct features (coloring, prominent features, unusual marks, different race or gender from others, etc.) I often have no idea, and cannot even eliminate one face.  If you give my one little clue, I do...well, still really bad, but significantly better. I took a test once that had no hair or clothing or anything. I actually referred to it outloud as having to look at faces with \"all the identifying features removed\" before it occurred to me that faces are supposed to be an identifying feature. Like... the main one maybe?\n\nThat test was *hard*. It seemed to be more of a memory test than a face blind test. The tests ( send you seem legit. They took 45-60 minutes, had like 6 sections, and it was people's face in black and white, with their hair cropped out. I was fucking lost. I scored in the bottom 10 percent (they only tell you which 10% you are in, not the exact number).   \n\n\nIn real life, I can eventually recognize faces, but it takes me frequent, lengthy, multiple exposures to someone new before I can recognize them. And that is with context and without hats/hair style changes. Yes. I can recognize those people making weird faces, the lighting and hair and skin. It was for the exposure one.

I have both face blindness and am uninterested in music, and I am wondering if anyone knows of any research linking these two conditions or if my brain is just double-damaged? Uninterest in music is considered a damage? What band geek declared this? Do not know if this is a thing. I love music and have absolutle pitch, though I am not a professional musician. Ditto, oddly enough. Prosopagnosia and absolute pitch. One more data point here for both of those. I do not mind many forms of music (as long as I am not trying to do something else at the same time), but I do not seek it out. Musicality is deffenetly comected to the brain. U found an article (in my native langauge) that says musicality is both innate and genetic. \n\nI cound't find any links to prosopagnosia, but that also could mean no one looked for a link yet. Though scientists love linking prosopagnosia with anything else that is atypical in the brain, I personaly think you just got unlucky. \n\nI would not call it 'double damage'. Just blame your parents for the bad genes \ud83d\ude01. (Jk) Naw music has always been my favourite hobby, I love playing and looking for new music! I do not think it is linked to prosopagnosia ;( I love music, even if I cannot recognize the artists by their faces. I am guessing there is no common link between the two. I have never seemed to have the same pleasure from music that others do. I enjoy it and have favorite bands, songs, genres, etc, but I have never been obsessed like my friends were. It was a struggle to care enough about a band to remember its name back in high school, and thought it was odd that people freaked out over the popular ones. I remember feeling ashamed once because a classmate of mine said something along the lines of 'you cannot be human if you do not love music'. I never did like that kid, though, so I guess it was not too bad. I was pretty self-conscious back then, though.\n\nThat said, I think the reason I am like this was because of the way I was raised, not having to do with proso. I was only allowed to listen to christian, Christmas, and 80's when my dad played it in the car. Jazz was banned because my mom did not like it. Rock was banned because it was satanic. Pretty much everything else either irritated my mom, which made it banned, or she unreasonably called it satanic. It was not until I moved out for college that I started to listen to music, and now I basically only use it for background noise when I remember to put it on. I still think it is funny that my all-time favorite song as a child was 'Get off of My Back' from the movie Spirit. I would rewind the vhs tape we had of it so I could listen to it on loop. My mom must have just been insane to think that song was a-ok while denying the same type of music it was. I still think that song is awesome. I was just curious about this myself and found a study that looked at the percentages of people with face blindness and tone deafness. The assumption is that both of these developmental disabilities may stem from a similar source. Here is the study if you are interested! \n\n\n Hi, new to this sub. I am a songwriter and musician with prosopagnosia, so I would not say there is necessarily a connection there. Though I would not say a disinterest in music makes you damaged. We all like different things.", "Is this the girl? I just realized (watching this for the third time) she is not Naomi Watts.

I would probably be rejected anyway (I am a lawyer - we tend not to be picked - and I was rejected the other two times I had it as well, even though those were both civil), but this was a criminal case so I told the judge that if I have to identify someone on surveillance footage or something like that, I cannot do that. That if someone tells me who the person is, that is fine, but I cannot be relied on to definitively ID anyone. I am worried she thinks I just came up with the most elaborate excuse ever, but in my mind that is someone you can bring in an expert for, like they do for fingerprints. To me, it is no different - it is an exercise in making sure certain points match. I really do not understand how anyone can ID someone at all.  Before I figured out that I had prosopagnosia, I had to check parent IDs at pick up.  I tried to avoid it as much as possible, because I always wondered how you could know?  I mean, the kids I worked with were older and would say \"Hi Mom!\" and I could see Mom was supposed to pick them up, so it was not as critical.  But still, it made me so nervous, and I thought other people did not really know either, but they just did not care. Interesting, I have not done jury duty before, but I really want to do it. Is having prosopagnosia something I should disclose to them before hand? or when they are selecting you, do they ask you questions like is there anything you can think of as to why you should not be in a jury? or is it dependent on the case and some cases might not need to be able to identify faces?  It will be dependent on the case, and the judge will ask a list of questions, including if there is a health reason you are not a good juror. Nothing will straight up kick you out, but you should tell them if you think it is relevant. Eg I did not bring it up in the two civil trials, just the criminal one (which was at a store so i figures might include surveillance video). another faceblind lawyer saying hello PLease, for the love of god do not feel bad about this. \nYou brought up a completely viable reason why you could not serve in this case that is none of your doing.\n\nBecause of you that person got a fair trail under the law.

I actually rely quite heavily on this\n* Distinctive features (facial hair, glasses, tattoos, etc)\n* Gender/Ethnicity\n* Body shape  \n\nI basically have a mental list of all of the people that I know, and filter the list using the above criteria, hopefully narrowing it down enough for me to figure out who this person is. recognizing the other person's recognition as quickly as possible\n\na lot of the time I am not sure if I know some at all or not, but I very keenly watch for any hint of recognition in their eyes. and after that, it is context clues on what they say, how they are acting, where we are, how they are behaving toward me. eventually I usually suss it out. sometimes I do not, and cannot hide it, and they are like \"you do not know who I am do you?\" and then I feel REALLY shitty. so yay for that.\n\nI have explained it to people in the past, it is like playing a game of Guess Who. Mentally going through everyone I know, and sliding down the people who do not fit as I narrow it down: location, gender, their type of greeting, how they are dressed, body type. \"Is your person wearing glasses?\" \"Is your person tall?\" lol.  oh man, THANK GOD for people who always wear the same clothing.

But it is not like I see someone and go \"oh I recognize that hair and body, that is Billy Bob Joe\". It is more like those things narrow it down, and then the situation usually can get me to like 3 people. From there I just try to only say things that apply to all 3 possibilities until they same something identifying. Like, if I see a tall guy at school, I know it is one of 4 classmates, and then when he asks me how I did on the test I know he is the one from English.  Lol I always end up giving really vague responses that apply to all of the remaining people, it gets really really hard when two people do everything together and have similar hair.  I have only a partial face blindness (associative prosopagnosia). I work in business to business sales, so I deal with hundreds of the same people on an ongoing basis.

One inside, I could not tell which lady was the mean lady anymore and not sure who to watch out for :(\n\nI am a visible minority and female, Hong Kongese in fact; not sure if this fact contributed to my experience today.\n\nI was waiting in the outdoor line at the DMV today with a friend who is not a visible minority. My friend's turn came and went inside. An older lady who is not even in line, who was waiting for her partner who is already inside, was behind me. She rudely said \"stand back, *dear*\" in a condescending tone and outstretched arms. Okay no biggie, maybe she is immunocompromised and really being careful, I can respect that.  But it was weird that she did not say anything my being more than 2m from her when my friend was still in line with me. I backed the heck up.\n\nMy friend came back outside to wait for the second part. The staff instructed everyone to line up further from the entrance, down the steps by the DMV sign. We are right next to it and the lady is now about 8m back further away, with 2 other people in between. The lady did not say anything to us. \n\nMy friend went inside again. The lady barked at me to stand further back, where she is, with the tape markers on the floor. I was more taken aback than anything by the mean tone and volume and demand that makes no sense, so I said \"excuse me?\" She scoffed and said \"do you understand?\", loudly and slowly, in a tone I had not heard in this country since the days I spoke 0 English, 2+ decades ago. I decided not to respond: she can assume I speak no English if she wants. She continued shouting for me to stand back, and the other people waiting between us could not take it anymore, and told her I am standing where the first marker is, and this is where the staff asked me to wait. She got in a huff and left the line to go sit in her car. \n\nLater, inside the DMV, I could not tell if any of the people inside were her and made my time near any older women (many) very tense until I can pick out bits of clothing or other features. :( **I wish I could remember what people look like so I know which ones to look out for.** Unfortunately I am certain your minority appearance had everything do to with that encounter. \n\nI cannot really give any advice except to send internet hugs your way\u2014what an awful experience. And not all older white women act like that. &gt; And not all older white women act like that.\n\noh for sure almost all people are great. Afterall, the other two who spoke up for me are both white as well :) just...surprised. It is been a long time since I have encountered that tone of being spoken to. Sorry you experienced that. This is certainly one of the many curses of prosopagnosia. If shared sympathy helps, I once had a middle aged man get snappy with me at a National Park, and I spent the rest of my vacation there avoiding ALL middle aged men like the plague. a :( at least it was a short experience for me. I am sorry that that happened to you.  I can definitely relate to the experience of wanting to avoid people, but not knowing who they are.  It makes the world a scary place.\n\nIf it helps, I find smiling at people a useful response in almost all situations.  If they were not the nasty old lady and you made eye contact for a brief second and smiled, it would be you just being a friendly stranger.  If they were the nasty old lady, brief eye contact and smiling would mess with her.  She would either shut down and avoid you (win,) or have an outburst (then you would know it was her...and everyone else would know it was her too.)  You have to do it with a lot of confidence though.  When I was younger, I would not have been able to pull it off right after someone yelled at me.  Another useful response is noticing what they are wearing, but I STILL have trouble zeroing in on that when in a stressful situation. This is definitely the worst part of prosopagnosia.  I seriously worry about what I will do if I am a victim of a violent crime.  If it is someone I know very, VERY well, I might manage, but if it is a stranger, all those normal \"identify the criminal\" procedures would be impossible.  Pick someone out of a lineup?  Describe them to a sketch artist?  Point to the guilty person in a courtroom?  Those are all a big \"nope.\"\n\nHeck, I worked at a job where this one particular woman was just awful every time she came in.

Around 50/50 for me. I honestly could not tell a difference, that is fucking scary I do not think I would have a problem with this, it is not really a face recognition problem as a matter of recognizing the lightning and texture. I could not really tell, other than the fact the cgi always had perfect lighting and never a person next to them that was cropped out.

There are moments where I can recognize him but lately I have been somewhat depressed about it. Any tips? I do not know what they would be but I just needed to get this off my chest to people who would understand, thank you in advance :) That sounds really tough! \n\nIt sounds a bit like you are (or were) relying on larger facial features, such as hairstyle to recognize your partner. That makes a lot of sense - your mind was problem solving very effectively... because you cannot recognize faces, you look for other distinguishing patterns or features and the larger they are (hair!) the better it works for you.\n\nNow that things have changed and are in constant flux, that strategy does not work. And if my guess is right - then it was also an unconscious strategy.\n\nTry coming up with a new strategy - finding features that do not change so much, if at all. Do this very consciously and spend some time to really get to know those new features that you want to use to be able to recognize him. Memorize them by writing down, sketching and repeating to yourself details about these features. Try treating it like learning a beautiful poem by heart - it is going to take effort, but is so worth it.\n\nSome suggestions:\n\nEyes: What color (is the color the same everywhere, or is there a gradient), are they big, small, very expressive and moving around, or calm... Does he hold your gaze a lot and for long or is there more shyness to them? How often does he blink.\n\nEyelashes: Are they long or short, thick or thin...?\n\nNose: Small or big, thin or thick, roundish or \n\nOverall face shape: Soft or hard - round or straight...\n\nLips, beauty-spots, ...\n\nBe a keen observer of all these details, and write them down and look for patterns and contrasts. Be a scientist and and enjoy yourself discovering these minute details that most people do not really look at - because they do not need to look so close. Make him wear a silly hat at all times /j You need a funnier looking boyfriend!  (I am joking.)  \n\nFor real, I would start by talking to him.  My husband and I have been together almost 20 years.  I still hate it when he cuts his hair, because all of a sudden he looks like a different man - although the same man who had short hair last time; he has not changed his hair style.  It is very unsettling still.  Maybe there is something simple he can do when seeing you such as wearing a certain thing, saying something, using a certain filter, or even sending you pictures in advance of new looks to get used to in advance.\n\nI would also focus on other ways to identify him.  I find voices, the way people move, and expressions more helpful than appearance.  Look for any distinct body part like his nose, chin, or ears and focus on that instead of his overall appearance.\n\nBest of luck! I have been there and it is rough. I find it helpful to try to memorize tiny pieces of my partner's face then jam them together like a puzzle in my head. it works for me most of the time and I hope it is helpful for you Ask him to send pictures often. It will be easier for you to handle seeing him in a video if you have seen him in a picture looking the same way frequently. Pictures give us time to really focus, notice things we can remember *logically* rather than visually like \"boyfriend shaved his head\". Seeing the pictures from different angles, different backgrounds, etc might make seeing him *feel* more familiar. Because that is the real problem, the unsettling feeling you get when your brain says \"this person is familiar\" but your eyes do not see that. Cognitive dissonance. Get him a necklace that you both think is cool and that he will wear.\n\nThen you can see the necklace and know it is him even if he changes his beard or hair. I think the idea of sending pictures so you can know what to expect is great! Even though you may not have a mental image of his face, you can adjust to the idea of \"my bf is a bald guy with a moustache\" or whatever it is he is trying.\n\nI also find voices super helpful. I cannot picture my loved ones' faces, but I can 'hear' their voices. (This is also how I recognize actors.) But voice recognition is also a spectrum, so everyone has to find what works for them!", "Warned to look out for dangerous person...HOW?! A neighbour in my small block of flats has a dangerous stalker. She recently broke a restraining order banning her from coming near the property and the Police have advised us to stay alert, in case she is lurking. I have looked up pictures of her...and there is very little chance I will be able to tell her from any other woman of roughly similar age. I know prosopamnesia (I think this is what I have, rather than prosopagnosia, but for this purpose there is little difference) causes social awkwardness, but did not think it could put one at more risk of danger than other people. I guess I will just have to be suspicious of any women I see near the house! If only she could wear a big name badge warning that she is a stalker, ha ha. Just be aware of any women hanging about -- especially if they do not have an obvious reason for being there, or are doing something odd. Floral deliveries come to mind, or sitting in a car watching. You can always walk up and ask them what they are doing. From a safe distance, of course -- or just tell them to move along. Thanks! This is a situation in which it would be so useful to be able to recognise people. Ah well, our brains just were not made that way. Before I knew this was a thing, I was always baffled at those people who could describe features enough to a\u2026cannot think of the name but artists who draw the person that was seen committing the crime, since I could not recall anything besides hair color. Now I do not feel so bad. I hope to never need to do that, but at least I would be able to tell them why I would be useless to interview. I know, but you do the best you can with what you have. I would not be any more likely to recognize a stranger than you are, so I do get it I get that often when there is missing people (which happens a lot around here).  \n\"Watch out for this person. They are missing\" and I am like \"well that sucks, I will not be able to help.\" I have always been worried about what would happen if I was victim of a crime, or a key witness. And then I *was* recently victim of an incident where there were four perpetrators, of similar age, skin colour and style. The policewoman taking my statement was very patient but do not think my very generic descriptions will have helped! Luckily it was all on CCTV. Phew!\n\nCan you imagine having to pick someone out of a line up? \u201cUh officer, all of these people look like who I saw. I am face blind!\u201d &gt;pen if I was victim of a crime, or a key witness. And then I   \n&gt;  \n&gt;was  \n&gt;  \n&gt; recently victim of an incident where there were four perpetrators, of similar age, skin colour and style. The policewoman taking my statement was very patient but do not think my very generic descriptions will have helped! Luckily it was all on CCTV.\n\ni hope you are all right and wish well There is actually a movie about exactly this! A person with Prosopagnosia trying to be on the look out for a dangerous person...\n\nIts called \"Faces in the crowd\" \"I am pretty sure they were human. And, uh, hatless.\" Holy cow! I do not usually watch movies (because the proso makes it a struggle) but I might have to check this one out. Tip!: watch it with someone close to you who does not have face blindness, and who wishes to understand it better.\n\nThe movie uses a few tricks to kind-of simulate Prosopagnosia for regular folks...having similar looking actors wear *identical* clothes etc. \n\nThe counter side to that is: its very hard to realise those tricks are happening if you have face blindness ;) because different people really do look the same - to regular people. Keep a photo of her on your phone or in your pocket ?", "How do I explain Hi everyone,\nI live in asia and everyone thinks that I am being racist when I cannot recognize them. Ive made the mistake of trying to say that people all look the same, they think im saying all asians look the same. Its really hard trying to explain without offending people. Its also not really a heard of or talked about condition here so im struggling to explain it. Honestly, sometimes I try to just use other excuses rather than explain. Examples: I am not wearing my glasses/have bad vision, I was distracted by your AMAZING (insert some awesome thing about their outfit here), you look just like someone else I know what a wild coincidence! I do the not wearing my glasses one sometimes haha And if you ARE wearing glasses, use I need a new prescription. \ud83d\ude06 Dude, I am Asian and I cannot tell other Asians apart too sometimes, just like I cannot tell other people of similar builds, complexions, hair styles, clothing styles apart from each other. \n\nWhen people complain, I tell them \u2018it is not because they are Asians, it is because they change their clothes every day!  I have the Same problem with white people and black people\nToo! How am I supposed to know who they are if they will not wear the same clothes every day! The least they could do is at least wear the same shoes or distinctive shirt every day or something!\u2019\n\nIt is important to Sound very frustrated and exasperated!\n\nAnother option is to just start telling people you are very near sighted, but I do not like to lie and the discrepancy can be spotted so I think it is better to just warn people you know you will meet frequently hating you are very face blind.\n\nI tell coworkers and fellow students because it had caused a lot of hurt feelings when people feel snubbed that I do not recognize them outside of our normal circumstances. I use geologi and stones as a mataphore for faceblindness. Like, there are a specifik part of the human brain which for recognize faces, and being faceblind means that, that part is not working as is should. When explaining i say it means that that  part of my brain is as good as recognize faces as recognizing different stones. A geologist can look at different stones and instantly know which type they are, but to a reculare person they all look like stones. For me its like everyone else is a geologist, but all i see is just stones, that is why it takes me extra time to be able to recognize people. I would rather use the example of a hand.\n\nCan u recognize people from their hands? No u cannot, although each hand is different. That is because ur brain is not programmed to recognize people from their hands, but from the faces. I do not havr the part of the brain thay recognize people from the face. Thus, for me, recognizing people from their face is as hars as recognizing people from their hands.\n\nBut i was never able to convince people using that argumant \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 but it seems logical in my head\n\n So a simpler thing is to say: people with dyslexie can recongnize letters but cannot read words. I have dyslexia for the face: i can c every feature, but i cannot recognize a face. Easy I have been there. \n\nPeople are going to think that and there is not much you can do. In my experience you cannot really \"explain\" conditions to people, be it proso, ADHD, being on the spectrum or whatever. You just have to try and earn a reputation for yourself as someone who others can attest is definitely NOT racist. \n\nBe nice to EVERYONE whether you remember them or not, recognize them or not. People will eventually clue in that you have a \"bad memory\" and that will be that. \u201cI have a neurological condition which makes it difficult to impossible to remember faces nd recognize people. Outside a few physical features, I cannot remember people.\u201d I would not say anything about people looking the same, keep it focused on the issue at hand. \u201cI have a condition called prosopagnosia. It means I cannot recognise or remember people\u2019s faces, even relatives or myself\u201d.\n\nI find that using a word like \u201ccondition\u201d makes people take it seriously. Telling people that I do not recognize my own face either usually get the point across \"No really, I have lost my boyfriend in the grocery store.... and he was standing next to me. I really cannot recognize people\".\n\nHumour mixed with honesty. But really, people take for granted their ability and cannot fathom not having it. Ditto! \"Sorry, I have seen so many people today!\" (Customer service) I say I have a condition called \"face blindness\" it means I can see faces, but when I close my eyes and try to imagine someone is face, I cannot remember what they look like. Their face is blurry or keeps changing. I have to recognize people by the way they walk, their voice, their style of clothes. So please do not take it personally if I see you in public and do not wave or I look at you confused. Once you say your name or start talking, I will know it is you. Its a good way to explain it but unfortunately I am not great at the language here and people would not understand me haha Haha good point but I am not very good at the language here so they probably will not understand me lol. thanks everyone, unfortunately its hard to explain as I do not really speak the language well enough so people cannot understand my explanation. I do not usually explain.  I fake it until I figure out who they are, or make up an excuse.  When I do explain, it helps to give a concrete example.  \"I sometimes have trouble recognizing my son when I pick him up at day care.\"  But then people think you are weird, so that is not my go to.  I think it sounds like you are making an excuse if you say that you have the same trouble with all races.  (You are not!  I am equally bad at recognizing people of all races too.) I use hands too.  I think they are personal and individual.  They have clues.  They are a perfect metaphor. I would think it makes us less likely to be racist. I have got Aphantasia as well and was surprised when my husband mentioned that our cleaning lady is black, I had not registered it and have no visual memory....\nRace has nothing to do with it, I recognize basically no one outside their normal context (and barely then). Sadly I have found that no matter how you explain it people tend to be offended that you do not remember them. What about just \"my brain does not work right. It cannot remember faces because of a medical problem?\" Could that be translated well enough? If you can figure out how to say \"face blindness\" in that language, I think those words alone are all you should need to say. If someone asks for clarity, just explain it as basically as possible. \"I cannot recognize faces,\" or even, \"I cannot *see* faces.\" While it is not a commonly discussed issue outside of these communities, a basic explanation should suffice. Maybe throw in the word \"disability\" if they are still confused.\n\nMost people will understand there is going to be a language barrier with foreigners, so they will likely cut you some slack and try to connect the dots from what you say. Just making an effort to say what you mean will go a long way in creating an understanding. You do not need a lot of words to get the point across.\n\nIf it is someone you communicate with on a regular basis, it may help to save a screenshot of the wikipedia page for this condition, in that language. So you can shoot them a text with it, or just whip your phone out and let them read it for a second if they truly do not understand. That should give them enough clarity to not take it the wrong way.\n\nI worked in a Chinese restaurant next to a hotel for years. We got people not just from Asia, but all over the world. Even though you may naturally speak different languages, simple words and descriptors can really help close the language gap and create a mutual understanding. Gesturing also helps. For example, saying \"I cannot see faces,\" would hit home even harder if you gesture at your own face while doing it (please do not gesture at other people's faces, though, that would be rude).\n\nHonestly, I try to avoid using the phrase \"I cannot tell people apart,\" just because people outside of my own race tend to take it the wrong way (although I honestly have the most trouble telling fellow white people apart--we do all look the same to me haha). Phrasing it in a more basic and broad way should help them understand that you do not mean *people like them*, but people in general. I think people have just been using the phrase \"I cannot tell _____ people apart,\" for so long that people will just automatically assume it as a race thing, even if you did not say it that way. So it is probably best to leave that phrase behind and try new phrasing to see which one resonates the most with others. i have to dissagree,\n\nfor me dyslexie does not work like that\n\nI have 2 people who I recognize by hand, so that can actually be easier... How does it work one of tham has no right hand, the other has hands the size of dinner plates No I mean how does dyslexia work i have no problem reading,\n\nafter i see a word spelled wrong i remember that wrong spelling as well and now both look normal, it takes ages to get rid of it\n\nworst are questions: is it written like this \"recognized\" or like this \"recogniced\"? YAY, thanks now i will write it wrong 50% of the time, be uncertain no metter how i have written it and i have to google it after writing for the next 5 years till i forget one version. Usually by not writing it for a couple of month and only seeing the correct written version. So actively trying to learn the spelling occasionally has a negativ impact because i see my own mistakes and now they look normal.\n\nsometimes i remember only a wrong spelling, so i do not google.\n\noften i do not read every letter in a word but look at the whole shape, that also has an effect that i cannot quite quantify", "I had difficulty recognising faces as a child, but no longer. Is this normal?  \"Normal\" is a strange word :) You do not really grow out of prosopagnosia. You get better skills with dealing with it. Or maybe you were not actually face blind, and there was something else at play. \n\nWhatever the situation, congratulations! I wish it would happen to me :) ", "Prosopagnosia and other conditions? I am wondering if there is some conditions that might happen more often in people with prosopagnosia.\n\nI used to think I mostly could not recognize people because I am shy of looking people in the face. It certainly does not help, but I think I still take way more time to recognize people that normal folk do- and forget them very quickly. Wondering how many people here are also terminally shy.\n\nNow two things I am more interested about: **Synesthesia**, that thing where you mix up two inputs and associate colors with music or such. I have letter-color synesthesia and it kind of makes things worse, because I just memorize the color of people's names, so I cannot even retrieve those from memory. (oh hi, you are... sort of aquamarine with red here and there, nice to see you again!)\n\nAlso **Aphantasia**, something I recently discovered, the inability to form pictures in your mind. It seems like it really should be related. I can picture things I have seen, but in brief flashes, not as a static image, or something I can imagine moving around, or measure the proportions of. \n\nI cannot, *at all* imagine something that has not been in my visual memory. So I can picture my mom's face, but I cannot picture her blowing a raspberry, because I have never seen her do it, or more simply, I cannot picture her with blonde hair, or picture her and my sister and try to see who has the bigger nose. Anyone else can see themeselves in this?\n\n\n(Oddly enough, I CAN picture imaginary things vaguely when in hypnagogic state, you know that moment where you are almost asleep and sometimes hear remixed music or people talking? Everyone gets this occasionally though you might not remember, it just so happens that then I can also design things in my mind. Experiencing that makes me even more aware that it is strange I cannot do it when awake.) My wife had synaesthesia and a photographic memory. Most of her memories involve \"the movies in her head\" whatever that is, and she has the opposite of prosopagnosia. She immediately recognizes actors in different movies so much that it ruins the effect for her because she cannot stop seeing them as that other character they played. My husband has ( which I would love to find has some connection to his prosopagnosia, but so far I have not found any evidence that the two things go together.\n\nHe also struggles socially in ways I still do not fully understand, and it is not clear to me whether they are connected to the face blindness. In some ways, he seems perfectly functional\u2014he had friends in his grad program, got voted best TA in the department one year, and seems to do OK with his coworkers. But like you, he struggles with eye contact\u2014not with me, but with a lot of people. And some social situations he will literally run away from, even ones where he does not know people and would not be expected to recognize anyone. **Absolute pitch**\n\nAbsolute pitch (AP), widely referred to as perfect pitch, is a rare auditory phenomenon characterized by the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given musical note without the benefit of a reference tone.\n\nAP can be demonstrated via linguistic labeling (\"naming\" a note), auditory imagery, or sensorimotor responses. For example, an AP possessor can accurately reproduce a heard tone on a musical instrument without \"hunting\" for the correct pitch. Researchers estimate the occurrence of AP to be 1 in 10,000 people.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 I have a light brushing of synesthesia, though mine is sound/feeling rather than color/words/letters.\n\nHowever, I have an excellent visual imagination and basically run movies in my head when daydreaming (or reading or writing).  Sometimes I come home from being around people and have a hole in my memory where their face should be.  I was embarrassed and thought I was rude and, due to shyness and social anxiety, thought I had just never looked at the person fully.  After learning of prosopagnosia I have made a point to look at people and try to imprint their faces into my mind.  Annnd... I still come home with this hole in my memory.  \n\nI think that some of my shyness and social anxiety comes from the proso.  I am always scared of not recognizing someone.  I think it also hurts my ability to read people well.   As a child, I had major music synesthesia. It was awesome, like watching a winamp visualizer in my mind. I still have a sense that different sounds have different shapes, l but the visual impact is less distracting.\n\nI have vivid dreams. I am undiagnosed, but likely autistic.\n\nI am also fairly shy in social situations. I have a wonderful boyfriend that I rely on a a spotter, since I am not even confident enough to pick out my former stalker at a party. This makes it hard to avoid them. It also bothers me that I know if a stranger does something awful I will be unable to pick them out of a lineup. &gt;  It also bothers me that I know if a stranger does something awful I will be unable to pick them out of a lineup.\n\nSo much this. I used to think \"lineups\" were a fictional thing in cop shows like magically enhancing cameras or giant fireballs during car chases. Now I just worry. I have color-letter synaesthesia. Also a host of sensory issues (my money's on Sensory Processing Disorder) and I stutter. I have questioned whether I am on the autistic spectrum but I do not think so. I do not really relate to what my autistic friends say about their experiences. I may have topagnosia though, which I gather a lot of us do. \n\nAnd I am trans (ftm, basically). That is not a disorder, but it is (kind of) a weird brain thing. Also trans \\(mtf\\). \n\nWhen I was starting to contemplate transition, I started looking at myself in the mirror. I identified the fact that \"my face does not even look familiar to me\" as a point of dysphoria.\n\nTurns out that is not the case; my face is as unfamiliar as always. I can see how one could mix up proso and dysphoria. I can recognize myself but I have other things where I am not sure if it is dysphoria or something else (trauma for instance). I have very, very mild synesthesia. I can see louder sounds as light. Not very noticeable unless in a dark room. I thought it was exploding head syndrome at first because I only noticed it at night, especially with louder sounds. But that the sounds you hear and the flash of light you experience with that are hallucinations. The sounds I see are actually real and I do not have to be almost asleep. I have severe difficult finding objects, especially when they are among others. It is like I cannot see them from the background half the time. Does not have to be incredibly difficult like Where is Waldo, it can be as simple as seeing my keys on a cluttered table.  Maybe not really what you are looking for, but I have a neurological  condition called : non\\-verbal learning disorder \\(NLD\\), and I have been told  that prosopagnosia happens more often in people that have NLD.    Yes, I agree. It is related to but not the same as Asperger\u2019s syndrome, and I have received both diagnoses during my life. Asperger\u2019s is considered to be on the mild end of the autism spectrum, and autism spectrum conditions are also linked to prosopagnosia. People who are autistic are more likely to have gender dysphoria and identify as being genderqueer or trans. Most of the trans people I know are also autistic. It would be interesting to see any correlation yeah. It is recently come to my attention that I should look into getting tested for ADHD, which *if* I have it (trying not to jump to conclusions) could have led to some of the \"Am I autistic\" confusion for me personally.  It would be possible to have ADHD and sensory processing issues - the combination of that might lead one to think they might be autistic. You are definitely not entirely neurotypical. Sensory issues are part of autism, but they are broader than that, and you can have sensory issues without being autistic.\n\nDid you struggle in school? If so, was it academically, socially, or both? It was both for me. I struggled with math and writing papers. Socially speaking, I was homeschooled except for 6th grade and I guess getting bullied would count as socially struggling? XP\n\nYeah that is true, a lot of things can be comorbid. It is always interesting to me to think about what (combination of) issues I may have. ", "Can you recognize animated characters? This may have been answered in a previous thread or it may well be a dumb question but can you recognize animated characters easier than actual people and how is it the same/different to actual people? Im honestly just very curious ! Yes. It is easier than people because animated characters usually always look the same whereas people change clothes, hairstyles, body shapes, etc. cartoons are SO much easier and I think that is why I love them so much. some non cartoon shows can be so good but also so exhausting and confusing to watch. Cartoons are so much easier! That is why I watch so many cartoons and anime. Take Steven Universe for example - every single character, even background ones, is completely different in shape, size and colour. And their faces are far more exaggerated. Therefore it is easier to recognise them than real people. Absolutely. usually it is p easy because of distinct character designs, altho sometimes it takes 12 episodes for me to figure out the distinctions. characters that wear multiple outfits are frustratingly confusing. \n\ntangibly related, I used to wear this specific striped blue shirt everywhere because I honest to God believed that no one would recognise me without it \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Cartoons are processed by a different part of the brain than faces. I have always watched more animation than live action because I can follow the plot. Yes, easily.  But apparently I like to make things hard, because I dislike animated characters and strongly prefer actual actors. I generally can because they tend to have other features like crazy costumes or hairstyles that do not change. Yes. I think like many others have said they tend to wear the same things all the time and they often have over-the-top features and sometimes distinct colours, too. Yes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of what others have said, they also tend to wear the same clothing every episode.", "Photo ID is not for the Face Blind Photo ID has always seemed odd to me, as I wonder things like, \"What if they dye their hair or get a hair cut or something?\"  I more recently discovered the concept of prosopagnosia and that I have it, and it just suddenly occurred to me that the typical process is supposed to go something like this:\n\nLook at the person in front of you.  Look at the photo id.  Use facial recognition functions to determine if the person in front of you has the same face as the person in the photo id.\n\nFor those with prosopagnosia, as we lack the facial recognition functions, the process goes something more like this:\n\nLook at the person in front of you.  Look at the photo id.  Try to determine if they have the same hair color and hair style and wonder how often they get hair cuts or dye their hair. Look at the person again.  Look at the photo id again.  Look for any other potential identifying features.  Try to determine the probability that the person in front of you is the same person in the photo id.  Look at the person again.  Look at the photo id again.  Realize that you have been holding their id for an awkwardly long time, hand the id back to them and assume that they must be the same person as the person in the id, hoping that if it was in fact a different person, they would have become more and more nervous the longer you looked at the id, and quietly apologize for taking so long. SAME.  And what if they lose/gain weight, wear contacts, wear *eye coloring contacts*, or do literally anything that affects their appearance?  At best, I am going to be able to recognize scars and the shapes of glasses. The reverse is also true.  Like, how could people think wearing a bandana or other mask that obscures half their face is somehow unrecognizable?  The whole rest of their body is visible!  You can see how they move, hear their voice.. \n\nI wonder if people who are not face blind find it more difficult to recognize people in places where there is widespread mask use due to COVID?  Maybe that is part of what drives people to be anti-maskers... the unnerving sense of not easily recognizing everybody around them?  That light dip in the pool of prosopognosia?\n\nDamn... I got to dig into this. Yeah that is exactly what I would do Selfishness drives people to be anti-maskers. Nothing but selfishness and ignorance. Do not give them any excuses. When I have to check ID to serve someone a drink, that second paragraph is all me. It is so frustrating, I have probably served several people with fake ids because it is just so much easier to look quick and not go through the whole back and forth thing my brain wants to do. Oh, I agree the primary cause of anti-mask feelings is recto-cranial inversion.\n\nAlso, now that I think about it, recognition issues might explain why someone did not like other people wearing masks, but it is not a reason not to wear one themself. I just ended up on urban dictionary because even though I know all of those words individually (recto cranial inversion), seeing them put together like that somehow made me unable to comprehend. But I think I love you now. I find it interesting when people mention a discomfort with not being able to recognize people easily - mask or other reason.  I think some people's sense of self/who other people are is more connected to their face than mine is. Photo ID terrifies me.  I work with kids.  Usually it is just routine.  The mom is supposed to be picking the kid up, the kid says, \"Hi, Mom!\" and there are no other moms in the kids life.  But when there are weird custody issues, it is scary.  I told my principal I am just not going to check IDs, because I cannot do it.  (It is not normally part of my job, but could be in some circumstances.)", "What do I do if I am accused of being \u201cracist\u201d? A couple times I have been accused of being \u201cracist\u201d because I could not tell people who were not white apart (even though I cannot tell white people apart either, and ironically people accusing me are usually white). The one time I specifically remember a friend was showing me a K pop group and I asked questions about who was who multiple times and I got accused of doing it deliberately to say that \u201call Asians look the same\u201d. I tried to explain prosopagnosia but they said I was making up an excuse as a \u201ccop out\u201d. What do I do in this situation? \"EVERYONE looks the same to people with faceblindness.  I learn who people are by their hair or their voice or their clothes.  It is easy to tell different genders or races or accents apart, those are big tells.  This group of people have things you can tell apart, but I cannot, because all the differences are facial features: things I cannot use.  I cannot tell apart ANY group of people who look this similar, no matter the race.  Groups of german brothers, or maori women, or Tibetan monks, or ANYONE who look similar: I cannot tell them apart.  I am not racist, I am fucking handicapped, born without being able to sense faces, and it is awful.  Like born blind or deaf, I do not have what you take for granted, and I get shamed for it regularly, though \"racist\" is a new one. Thanks for that.\" I am sorry you had to deal with this.\n\nHonestly, if someone refuses your explanation of prosopagnosia, they have already made their minds up. Explaining it better is not going to save the situation. My social advice would be just to let the conversation die and be extra careful to make sure you are considerate and sensitive in other ways (which we should all try to be, always!).\n\nBut in general, this is one reason I try to tell people about my faceblindness when I meet them--when it is a \"fun fact, this is why I may introduce myself again next time we meet\" thing rather than part of a highly charged emotional issue. This advice will not fix the situation with the person who is already refused to accept your explanation, but practicing explaining faceblindness early in a friendship might help forestall future situations like this.\n\n(For context, I am a white US American. I would welcome feedback from someone who is not.) Been there with 2 brothers who I did not realize were separate people until I saw them together for the first time. This was also when I did not know what face-blindness was. It sucked!  I usually say \"it is also called FACE BLINDNESS for a reason\" \"All EVERYONE looks the same.\" In college I started explaining prosopagnosia as soon as I would introduce myself to new people if I thought I would meet them again. Pretty soon my close friends were even explaining my \u2018neurological disorder\u2019 \nSo when I mistook another band for BTS, my friends simply laughed lightheartedly and pointed out a few differences to me, so maybe next time I will have better luck. \nFinding the right way to explain prosopagnosia before it actually becomes an \u2018issue\u2019 will prevent people seeing it as an excuse. And explaining it correctly and being well informed about our community, and up to date the research being done, will help prevent the \u201coh I have trouble recognizing people too, hahaha no need to exaggerate\u201d type comments Tell them they are being ableist. Honestly fuck them. They are the type of \u201cwoke people\u201d who get offended on the behalf of other people who they do not even represent. I was really glad I watched the new mulan with a friend who definitely understands how bad my face blindness works because I could not figure out how to tell all the soldiers with matching hair and outfits apart. This happens to me. I am white and I always find white men to be the hardest to tell apart so go figure. Usually I give some iteration of, \u201cno, I am equally opportunity face blind.\u201d \u201cIt is not my fault people change their clothes and their hair all the time. People will not even wear the same shoes every day, do you know how hard that makes it telling who is who?!?\u201d \u201cIt is not my fault you look like every other average weight tan person with long blonde hair\u201d~ or some variation Idiots will be idiots. The sheep will follow the herd, and moths will fly to the light. Just know that when people say that, they do not have any real understanding of the world around them. That there are other worlds within this one. My suggestion? Associate yourself with open-minded people, and in situations like the K pop one, just clarify beforehand that you have prosopagnosia. I myself do not have it, but, I can recall many times where I was harassed for something I could not control. what", "Family Events I went to a funeral the other day.  Now this is never a happy occasion, but this one was one where I knew most of the people there but did not see them regularly...and my seeing eye person (read: husband) was not able to come.  I spent half of the time feeling awkward.\n\nI was able to figure out most of the people there eventually, but there is someone who hugged me twice that I have no clue whom she is.  I had a 15 minute conversation with a rather boring lady before I finally figured out I would known her and her daughter since I was 8.  Turns out I actually had not met one person who was super friendly, but she just know of me through my sister.  (I knew a lot about her too.) \n\nI think there should be a rule.  People should not be ever allowed to change their hair or clothing style.  They should pick one thing (preferably distinctive) and stick with it for the rest of their life.  Oh, and if kids want to be recognized, there is no reason for them to grow up ever.\n\nThe good news is that I can now reliably tell all my cousins apart.  The two that were the hardest, have distinct hair now.  Not sure if I just finally learned their faces because I could tell them apart every time (I personally can eventually learn to recognize people reliably...it just takes a really long time, because I am doing it by feature) or if I am still using the hair. On another Faceblind group, someone said she was sure that her grandfather was Faceblind too as he used to call all the grandchildren George, even if they were girls. It sounds like a good plan to me! Sharpies and label stickers. Although maybe not appropriate for a funeral. I was a mortician. My anxiety was constantly at 10 because I could not recognize people from the time they came in to the funeral. It was debilitating, because I thought I was stupid. \n\nI learned to focus on jewelry, especially wedding rings, as a widow NEVER takes her ring off before the funeral. \n\nThe other people? Still sucked. And you feel like an idiot saying something to someone who is traumatized. Forget the stickers.  Just apply the sharpie directly to people's forehead...maybe that would not go over well. How stressful!  I worked for awhile as a wedding coordinator.  I appreciated trends where bridesmaids wore the same color but did not wear matching dresses.\n\nI know what you mean about the constant anxiety.  I did wonder if I was stupid at times, because I had trouble following plots in some movies, but I thought I was self-centered generally. Me too - I assumed I was not paying enough attention but whatever I did, I could not get what everyone else seemed to do with ease. Now I am Faceblind and dont pay attention but I feel I have the best excuse for it. do not get me started on movies! I always thought I was stupid, because plots eluded me. \n\nMy SO helps me now, I just ask him. It is made movies lots more fun! (Maybe not so much for him, but he is a sweetheart)", "Proso blues :/ Okay so, I am kind of sad right now. I only recently found out I have proso and since then a lot of things clicked but I am also more aware of it. Right now I am sad because I cannot remember the face of someone who means the world to me. I do not even want to remember him because I like him, I want to remember because I want to be able to remember. Because he is such a good friend and I should be able to remember him. We send snapchats a lot and repeated exposure helps so I do remember him better than I do others. But everytime I get a snap it is just... it is so much more real than my memory. And I get sad when I stare at a picture trying to take it all in but knowing I will forget as soon as I close it. What if I lose him? Will I forget him? Will I forget anyone who is important to me? I really really struggle with it today. Thanks for coming to my TED talk hehe Not being able to remember the image of your friend does not mean you will forget him. You will not lose him because your relationship is not related to your ability to remember how he looks like. You will not forget him because you can still remember the things you like him for, the things you did together etc. \nI cannot remember the face of my grandma but still remember she picked me up from school every tuesday and we ate ice cream together. You will not lose those memories just because you cannot picture someones face. \nHope that helps It is no fun, but it is also true that his face is not who he is. His face is not why you like him, is it? Think about his personality, his interests, his sense of humor... whatever it is that makes him a good friend. All of that is in your memory, and that is what is important!\n\nI also felt a lot better about not being able to remember faces when I realized I could \u201cpicture\u201d someone is voice\u2014I could \u201chear\u201d in my mind how they would say something. If you have a memory for voices, that might be worth dwelling on instead.\n\nYou could also think about ways to do something positive with it. You need to look at pictures to remember your friends\u2019 faces\u2014maybe you could make a scrapbook or collage, or just make a special thing out of saving your favorite pictures of people who are important to you in a folder on your phone. Whatever will give you a different way to think about it! Thank you, this does help :) I do remember voices! I remember his laugh mostly, so that is great! And a wall with pictures would be really nice :D thank you, it helps! This is how I remember people too.  They kind of have an essence.  That is not the right word, but it is as close as I can get.  It is made up for their personality and gait and so forth, but I feel the biggest representative part is their voice.  I think that is how faces are for a lot of people.  I seem to remember them like people remember faces - they fade with time, but you can still kind of see/hear them. I get that! For me, the moment I actually realized \u201cwow I actually am faceblind, this is not normal\u201d is when I realized that most people treated faces the way I treat voices.", "My husband does not appreciate my genius idea My toddler son is having a birthday party at a children's venue.  I had the great idea that we could ask the front desk staff to give them a button or sticker with a cute picture when they sign in.  (Or have my husband or my mom stand there to \"welcome\" them and do so.)  Then I know which kids are associated with the party (and their parents by watching who is paying attention to the kid) after they leave the cake area and go play...well unless they take it off.  Seems sensible right?  \n\nOh, and can I just start tattooing everyone in my town on the forehead when I meet them?  I could add a dot (and maybe a circle if it were a meaningful or long conversation) every time I talk to them, so I know how well I should know them.  That is cool with everyone, right?  (Just in case, internet, clearly that is a joke.) I actually think tattoo on the hands would be a good idea. It is a quick way to get \"stamped\" while making it an interestng experience at a kids birthday party.\n\nAs ( we often offer it as a form of fringe activity , while not so much as to identify the kids, but simply to warm the children up with a novel experience.   \n\n\nWe offer ( (which will take some talent), ( (girls love this), and ( (which is the quickest of them all). Hiring someone to do it for you might save a lot of hassle.   \n\n\nHope it helps! I can see by your post history that you are advertising your business by commenting on people's posts about children's birthday parties.  This is actually a subreddit for people with a neurological condition that makes it difficult for them to recognize faces.\n\nMy comment about a tattoo was a joke that I would literally tattoo your forehead permanently so I would know if we met before or not.  It is not that this is a party with 30 kids that I have to round up in a large venue.  I would have trouble recognizing the kids' parents if there were only three kids and I spent 30 minutes chatting with the parents.  \n\nThis was more a post that might be relatable to people who also have face blindness than a post looking for party advice.  (As a side note: I have done balloon animals and face painting for many children's events...for toddlers you need speed more than talent.  I am assuming the \"take some talent\" comment was so that I hired you instead of tried to do it myself, but it made me laugh.  I guess going fast is a talent, but toddler face painting is all about interpreting their request, getting it on their immediately, and being ready to clean it off if they decide they want it gone the minute you are done.)\n\nWhen you are doing your future advertising pretending to be comments, you might want to check the subreddit first for context and also to include less links.  For example, \"You know I actually work for a party planning company that does face painting and tattoos for kids.  Usually we do it for fun, but it might work as something that stays on to help you recognize kids.  If you are in the  PM me or look at  to see if we can set something up for you.\"  This way you come across more as a person who happens to have a related job (same as a teacher commenting on a post on a parenting subreddit) than a salesperson.  Also, it is important to include your location both prominently on your website and ideally in your comments, as otherwise you are going to waste time fielding replies from people on the other side of the world. Does your husband not approve of the first part or the second? I am on board with both obviously but the first sounds like a brilliant idea! Totally one I am going to use when my baby\u2019s bigger. Maybe your husband has a long held secret fear of needles, and is afraid that this fear would be exposed when it came time for you to tattoo him. So, rather than admit that he is afraid of needles, he down voted your idea \ud83d\ude0a Seriously, the stickers are a great idea! We had our daughter's birthday party at a place that gives color-coded stickers to everyone there for a birthday party (as in a different color for each party), so we knew all day who was there for our party. It was great especially since this is her first year at a new school. What about colored wrist bands? Haha, yeah everyone should just have cutie marks! It is okay.  I will not have to tattoo him.  I would only consider marrying a funny looking guy, so I could recognize him in a crowd. He just was not enthusiastic about the brilliance of the idea.  (Because he can recognize people.)  He did not say I could not do it.  (Obviously does not approve of tattooing people against their will.) Our partners might recognise faces, but let me tell you what happened to us shopping recently. My partner thought he could see his mother shopping and was going to go over and say hi. She was facing away and I told him that was absolutely not his mother. She had the wrong body, stance, and clothes. He would not believe me and thought I could not possibly know, so we stood and waited for her to turn around and discover I was right! Brilliant! I wish I would thought of that! \ud83d\ude1c\n\nLet him know that because he is funny looking, you do not need to tattoo him! I am sure he will come around to seeing the genius of your idea, and his secret fear of needles will remain hidden. (Except to all of us, of course.) \ud83d\udc4d Yeah, there are definitely some strengths I have developed to compensate that are useful sometimes.", "I do not know if this is the right place to vent But I feel so frustrated at the fact that I cannot picture my friend\u2019s face in my head. If he was to stand among crowds, I am pretty sure I can recognize him, but I just cannot remember every detail on his face. I remember he has almost sunken eyes, tiny lips and fluffy hair. But when I try to combine all those details to form a face, my visual imagination of him just turns blurry. What is even more frustrating is I spent quiet a long time with him just few days ago, so the memory of him should be fresh, but day by day I keep forgetting how he looks like.\n\nA considerable factor in which we have only met twice could be the cause of this issue. But then, I have only video called another friend of mine ONCE (never met in real life) and yet I can picture him perfectly. \n\nI am a  bit worried as I have anxiety and this could be worse for me in the future.", "Say what  (\n\n---\nThis mp4 version is 99.58% smaller than the gif (111.51 KB vs 25.98 MB).  \n\n\n---\n*Beep, I am a bot.* ( | ( | ( | v1.1.2 With the eyebrows further down, that is Daniel radcliffe, the other is Elijah wood.\n\nOr the other way around.

Is not this the company that does OCR for people with visual impairment? I tried the OCR version, it works well. They did not have the facial recognition model available when I tried it, but it was also incredibly expensive.  From what I read, they are trying to use the same technology they have for the OCR version (I think it is called ( to this new MyMe device that is made for sighted people as well.

She said she had to go, hung up, and I am looking at myself in the mirror in the hallway (checking my hair out). All the sudden this girl starts running up the stairs and I just stand there in shock wondering who the hell she was and how she got in my house. After she hugged me as I stood in shock, she said \u201chi baby\u201d to me and I was in so much confusion and embarrassment. I joked to her a couple days before this happen about having that condition where you do not recognize faces and now that this happen I am remembering so many other times my family members would surprise me at work and I would not recognize them unless they wore clothes I remembered they owned or they spoke (I recognize voices instantly but am horrible with faces).

True, and yeah it was like a moment of clarity when I sat down and thought of all the times I was affected by this. Exactly. Even as one of the people who does live near a uni and got assessed by researchers, the assessment is covered with disclaimers about it not being official for medical purposes and so forth.

I mean, if my family was in my dreams, or certain actors (by which I mean David Tennant and Matt Smith, because I watched so much Doctor Who when I was younger that their faces are burned into my brain), I would see their faces. But almost all my dreams exclusively involve nameless, faceless people. \u201ci mean, *everyone* is a little surprised by what they look like in the mirror, right? like who recognizes their own face, we barely ever see our own faces! ..right?\u201d I definitely did a lot of these, myself, here is a new one for ya:\n\"I cannot tell coworkers/acquaintances apart because I straight up do not care enough about them. I am just a cold person.\" Lmaoooo. While it is not the same, I am constantly playing the game of \u201cis it face blindness or body dysmorphia?\u201d because everyone mistakes me for my mother and says we look like clones, but I cannot see *any* resemblance when I look in the mirror. Mysteriously enough, however, I seem to heavily resemble my mother in pictures I take of my face. Which is so weird .. Strangely enough, I think they do lol. I deadass used to think I was just some degree of necrophile or something because in my imaginations/dreams, sfw or otherwise, there would be no face to work with. Just a bunch of \u201cliving mannequins\u201d. It is kind of creepy when think about it. \n\nSpeaking of tv shows, I remember a show I used to watch obsessively and had a favorite character that I made fanfic about for years afterwards, imagining him in scenarios. I rewatched the show later and holy fuck, my perception of his face was disastrously wrong . Was a cold shock lol My excuse was that I was just \"really bad with faces\". The difference is that it was seen as a disorder, but just \"how I am\" I am sorry, excuse me, I have a question...\n\nOther people see faces in their dreams!?!?!? Made it to my late 20s before I learned prospopagnosia existed.  I just thought I was \"bad with faces.\"  I did not make excuses, though.  I treated it as a source of humorous stories and assumed I could improve eventually if I just worked at it hard enough.\n\nIt was a huge relief to learn it was a real, documented issue and not a character flaw. You changed your clothes/hair/shoes!  \n\nApparently so ;A; I had no excuses. I just thought I was either stupid in this area or perhaps a tad sociopathic (despite the fact that I will get a throat lump during a Disney movie like most other humans). - I am just shit with names and faces, I never remember people I have met (always thought it was a memory issue)\n- I was probably drunk when first met you (I introduced myself to a new acquaintance the first like 8 times I met her at parties, and eventually she was like \"I know dude, we have had several conversation before, I wave at you when you get on the bus near my house...\")\n- This movies just hard to follow, how was I supposed to know that was the same person as before? she is in a different outfit and she is wearing a wig I want you to know I read your reply but I cannot think of anything to say except like \"yeah\" or something lol I always had to google pics my favourite characters when reading fanfiction so I could remember an idea of what they looked like and visualise it. I would have to keep looking back at it over and over but it still never dawned on me that maybe I was face blind. Tbh I just thought it was another side effect since I have brain damage so I figured it was just \u2018one of those things\u2019 which I do not really notice anymore. And omg yes I do like all of these lol Applied largely for jobs which were heavily phone-and-email-based, or dealing with customers/clients I would never see again or at least would not be expected to 'officially' recognize. Hardly ever applied for jobs which would involve seeing the same people repeatedly after weeks or months and being expected to know who they were. I thought everyone experienced the world the way I did (in this aspect,) but either people were more connected and hung out in other settings a lot to know each other or that I was a jerk and was being self-centered. I never had any hope of recognizing myself in photos or videos. I always assumed it was just because my face was reversed from what I see in the mirror. Once selfie photos became possible and easy (the image in selfies is reversed left-to-right), I realized how wrong I had been because I STILL could not recognize myself. \"I am sorry, I am just really bad with names and faces, I am super dumb!\"\n\nNow I just go \"I literally will not remember what any of you look like by tomorrow so, that is a you problem\" I would say \"I am really bad with names\", but realized that other people who claimed to be \"bad at names\" could list every actor in every show they watched, and could list every other show the actors were in. \n\nI have read that most people have dreams about people they know. When I read that, I thought that is odd, I wonder why I am different and dream almost exclusively about strangers whose faces I can never remember. \n\nI also used to think I do not remember anybody because I am cold and do not care about people enough. My experience is similar. Once I knew it was a thing, I was \\*eager\\* to accept that I had it, because it explained so much! But before I knew it existed, people always told me \"just pay more attention!\" so I tried to do that. I do not think I ever realized that it was possible \\*not\\* to struggle to recognize faces. I assumed it was the same for others as it was for me. I assumed they were just more socially adept. Yeah, I thought so too. I figured other people were just more extroverted than me. (Which is also true, but that is a separate thing!) See, my dreams involve individuals, but I could not tell you whether their faces look like they are supposed to. In the dream I just know who the person is, and they have \\*a\\* face, but whether it is \\*their\\* face? Could not say.  \n(With pretty much the same exceptions that you name, oddly: my family, my very close friends, and the faces burned into my brain from a certain long-running science fiction franchise.) I am fairly extraverted.  I have pretty good coping mechanisms, so I made it through college and to my first job, before I started wondering what was going on. Yeah, I get that \"I just know who it is\" thing. I do the same thing. I never made excuses, but I definitely said, \"I am sorry.\" a lot and did not really understand why. The second one is true though", "How to casually discuss this without seeming like a cringe kid? I am overall just stuck with bad genetics and have a lot of health and mental issues. I have been talking to a person I met on whisper (yeah, yeah, I know big bad) for a few weeks now and they have been wanting to meet up.\nSomeone came in today while I was at work, and went \"if I knew you had company, I would not have came in\" and bought a gift card. This freaked me out, I cannot tell if it was the person I was talking to or just a creepy customer. I know vaguely what to expect when this person does eventually meet me, but I am terrified that I just fucked up this chance of a relationship/friendship of any kind \ud83d\ude2d.\nI made the mistake of later making a whisper after I thought I changed my username about how I hate when people do not tell me when they show up because I cannot recognize them and he responded to it which caused yet another freakout. I am worried he thinks I am being one of those cringy kids who magically has every diagnosis possible. I know a lot of this is my anxiety talking, but I also know if I met someone like me I would automatically go \"yo get off of TikTok\" because of all of the issues going on. What was his response? \"why cannot you recognize people\"\nI explained why, he then goes \"huh, okay, *insert name here*\" and that was that. Nothing else, but he also has not talked to me since then. I am sure it is fine. Just tell him to remember to introduce himself when you meet :) I think you are overthinking it, I am afraid. Well, I have found it is best to explain medical issues using an umbrella term first, then explain comorbid disorders as a symptom of the umbrella. For example, I technically have ASD, OCD, SAD, MDD-IR, and BDD on top of prosopagnosia (all prof. diagnosed). That is too much information for people to understand, and sounds fake. So I introduce myself as having autism, and as issues arise I explain how it is related to my autism. For example, I explained today \u201cI have face blindness, it is one of the ways my autism is expressed\u201d. People respond well when it is one disorder with several symptoms, rather than when you go full alphabet soup with your medical history. Hmm......even if you do not have face blindness, it is fair to say \"I am very bad with faces\" and leave it at that. If you are using whisper that sounds like a young people thing, very young. Please take care of yourself and stay safe. I am sure you are smart enough only meet a strange at very public places.\n\nPersonally, I am hesitant to tell my close friends I have face blindeness for a similiar reason...There is...little doubt I have it, but they all heard of it because of a video game most of them played( the original 999) and I am worried they will just think I convinced myself I had something because of it. They do not need to know I can fake it well enough with recognizing voices. I think you are anxious and overthinking it--most people do not know what prosopagnosia is, even when you just say 'face blindness', and it is definitely not a trendy self-diagnosis. I would compare it more to aphantasia (inability to visualize images) than adhd or autism. Would you think somebody was dramatic for saying they had aphantasia? Please do not be so hard on yourself. I ended up discussing it with him, used the animal example for him to try and explain .\nHe seems a lot more understanding than I would have thought. He joked that now he is going to have to seduce me with his voice which I thought was hilarious.  \n\nAnd thank you for looking out for me! \nI only am willing to agree to very public places. My work is located in a store inside a Walmart that has lots of security and people, which is the only reason I have ever agreed to meet him there. I may have unconsciously developed a work around (as female interested in males). Before I met my husband, the shortest man that I dated was 6'1. My husband is 6'5. \n\nThe percentage of males above 6'3 (or 6'5) is very low. Identifying my partner in a group of people is a little easier because I can look for the tallest person.\n\nEven if everyone is sitting down, usually he is noticable to me (still by height).\n\nThe only time this failed me was in Costco. Luckily the other person had dog food in their cart...and we do not have a dog.", "A story this week on Radiolab feat. Prosopagnosia I believe it is the second story\u2014 the love story\u2014 in this past week's episode of the podcast Radiolab that features faceblindness. Recommended\u2014 hit a bit close to home, so I had to keep pausing it to ponder.\n\nThe episode:\n\n( Yeah, except he was a dick.  You choose to love your partner, actively, every day.  Love is a verb.", "How do you identify people? So I know a few people who are also faceblind like my mom and roommate and the first thing I wondered when we realized we have this in common is what method they learned to recognize people. I can recognize somebody from their walk from almost a block away which most people find hard to believe but I think it is because my brain over-compensates for not recognizing faces. Obviously this isnt helpful in many situations like in a classroom or if people are standing around talking like at a party. What do you guys use to recognize people? typically i go off of hair, glasses, piercings, personal style, or general build. Shape, size, and motion, mostly.\n\nSo, like you, I can recognise someone from as far away as I can make them out. Even without my glasses, the motion of them walking or even hand gestures can let me know who they are.\n\nHair is one that grabs my attention first, but since it is possible for hairstyles to change and multiple people to have the same style, I always double check with things like height and build before assuming that it is that person.\n\nWhen it is something where I expect to people people, it is a lot more relaxed. Like, meeting at a friend's place, the person who answers the door is probably going to be that friend so recognition can be relaxed and \"close enough\" becomes \"totally is\" pretty quick. From a distance, location and height. I wont expect to see my personal trainer at a Physics lecture, or my physics lecturer in the gym. \n\nThen its build, hair colour, and length, glasses, clothes.\n\nThen its things like jawline, eyebrows, and my favourite one,\n\n*voice.* \n\nVoice is a really funny one though because I saw someone I knew through the gym at the university, and I thought it was my sign language teacher, so I say hi in sign and go up and talk to her (in sign) and then she starts *talking* and im like 'what ur deaf' and then I released it was not my sign language teacher. My friends who do sign with me were like 'yeah wtf cornflakes that is definitely not our sign language teacher' and im like :( A personal Theme helps. A person's typical clothing style/feeling is often more distinctive than their faces. it also helps when you have to buy them something. The chance that 2 people at a party will have the same style is very slim. Then you can go by hair or height or something to tell them apart. In a group of twins, I do better than face seeing people. \nProblem is when people get new braids or haircuts and all is lost.\n\nSome mannerisms like walking but a certain way people sit or hold their coffee helps.\n\nLocation based locating is the best. Someone asked me how many employees we had and I counted up the offices (where they are likely to be) faster than people listing names of who had not quit or were newhires. Works better with classroom seating as most people(who are not me) stick to one chair all semester. \n\nI may have no idea who you are, but your in Jacob's seat so were going with that until I figure it out haha I live on \"close enough\" adrenaline \n\nlol Voice is my strongest way of identifying someone. Hair is helpful but people change it a lot. Body shape, hair, voice, and motion. All of the above plus my secret weapon - nicknames.\n\nGet yourself different nicknames for school/work/hobbies/friend groups/whatever.  That way you know where someone knows you from based on what name they use. Voices are the best way for me to recgonize people. Height, apparent gender, skin color, and hair all help combined. If nothing works, try shoes. This is how I remember who is the service person that comes to me an picks up my car for service so that I can talk to the same person if I need to and ask for status :) I love this idea! mostly motion and gestures", "Saying hi to large groups of people I am from France, and here as a woman you have to greet each person you meet with 2 kisses. I have a problem every time I encounter large groups of people (like at a party): by the time I have said hi to the second person, all the people have moved around a little, and I am incapable of recognizing the ones I have said hello to and the ones I have not. So I just wander around, looking people in the eye and trying to see if they are expecting me to do something or not. Most of the time I will screw up at some point and it is quite embarrassing.\n\nAnyone else with the same problem?", "Barber shops are opening up again in America, good luck everyone \ud83d\ude2d  Yeah, I have got another month at least before the shops open up here I am actually excited. My hair does not look the way it normally does because of the inability to get a proper haircut, and it is driving me insane. I have been tying it up just to prevent seeing it down and incorrect. I know! My boyfriend got a haircut so now I have a new boyfriend apparently \ud83d\ude2d", "I saw someones face I am really shocked. I have prosopagnosia, I cannot recognize people or see their faces inside my head. I can see people when I look at them but cannot really distinguish them from others. Recently I met someone and today I could see his entire face in my mind. I am confuse how its possible, I cannot even imagine my own families faces. Has it ever happened to you? What could be the explanation? Fascinating, I am not sure what could have happened. Was there something notable about the face ? not particularly...the person had a scar on the cheek. But I could see the whole face in my mind. No idea. Happens to me periodically too. Some faces are just...visible. Happened to me once. I have been married to him for 11 years. I have this rarely if the person has a distinctive characteristic that is really rare (at least... from what I have noticed lol).\n\nAlso, for a while I tried to play chess consistently and it led me to recognize facial features better.  I looked into some academic research and found that there is some speculation that regular chess players learn to recognise patterns the pieces make on the board with the facial recognition part of the brain.   \n\nSo did you do any different hobby or activity that required pattern recognition that may have boosted that area of the brain? I bet it was the scar. Sometimes I find that an image will 'crystallize' around a single distinctive feature.\n\nI am not a scientist, but from what I understand, there are two ways the brain remembers images: one for regular images and one for faces. Our face-remembering pathway is broken, but many of us can still remember an image of someone is face the way we would remember, say, a glimpse of a famous painting--just not with the ease and immediacy that people with functional fusiform face areas have. (This is not true for all prosopagnosics--it is a spectrum.) So you may just have somehow gotten your brain to remember that face as a visual image rather than as a face. Ive found very few but it is fun!", "Could I have this? Sorry if this is annoying, maybe many people ask this here... but I am genuinely curious.\nI think I could have a mild case of this, because ever since I was a kid, I mix up people. At school there would be pairs (or trios or more) of similar siblings (not twins but on different years) and I was always confused thinking they were the same person.\nI lived in England for a year when I was 4, and I do not remember having trouble there, but then I came back to my own country, where unlike England most people have the same colours: black hair + brown eyes, and I would constantly get my classmates mixed up during my first year.\n\nI am 24 now and, the people I do know I know perfectly. I am extremely good with names and know the first and last names of all my generation at college. But when I watch movies I always have to ask 'Is that the same guy as before\", etc. Once I saw someone on the street and could not for the life of me determine if that was my school psychologist or my gynecologist.    \nI can usually tell when I know someone, but it seems my brain stores people in the same category sometimes, so I mix them up a lot.    \nThere have been times though where I actually did not recognize someone. At 8 yo I played with my new neighbour for a whole day, and the next day she came to my house with a different hairstyle and I did not understand who she was or what she was doing at my house. I had a similar thing happen with a teacher last year.\n\nSo do you think I belong here? :^) I think yes \ud83d\udc4d Im faceblind and I do not recognise people when they change their hairstyle or wear a hat, or wear unfamiliar colours or clothing, or appear in unexpected places (like in a supermarket when you have only ever seen them is at the gym). If this happens to you too, it is likely that you have prosopagnosia. If I do, it must be a milder version for sure. Because I do not have it to extremes of turning angles, but as I described in my posts I have always had this incidents. If you are even asking the question, the answer is most likely \"yes.\"\n\nIt is weird, is not it?  Most people never realize that it is a thing.  It is only in the past 20 years that it is even been recognized as something that is not super exotic. The angles thing does not happen frequently for me, but is weird and a little upsetting when it does. You might also have trouble with objects like cars. For most of my life I was mystified by people discussing different features of cars, until I discovered I was face blind. I do not know exactly what it is that I cannot 'see' but cars are very confusing. Last year I watched a TV interview with a face blind woman in Scotland, who has the same problem. I am actually completely blind to cars too! :0\n\nOne detail that I have noticed I have completely different than most people here is that I am excepcionally great with names. But it may be because I have synesthesia, so I have particular ease with remembering words in general because of their colors.", "What is Braille? Blindness EDU ", "What jobs would be incredibly difficult with prosopagnosia? I was thinking the other day just how bad I would be as a passport officer on border control. Trying to identify if the person and their picture match would be hell and I would fail pretty hilariously.\n\nJust wondered what other jobs people have thought about would be really hard like maybe a detective? \ud83d\ude02 Doorman. Security agent. Portrait painter? Politician (meeting all the donors).  Spy. Brad Pitt believes he has prosopagnosia and he says it makes people think he is arrogant and egotistical when he cannot recognize them. I am a waitress and it is a struggle sometimes. As soon as people switch tables or places, I have no idea who they are anymore. Sometimes people will go out to smoke and come back in and I will greet them cause I do not remember they were here the whole time! I work in the social work field and it is always awkward when I meet clients for a second or third time and I walk right past them or ignore them at first. I just try to look for someone who is making an abnormal amount of eye contact with me, but it can still be awkward.\n\nWaitressing was also awkward because sometimes a guest may get up from the table and ask for something, then you got to watch to see where they were sitting since I am not going to remember which person said that. Or if I was their waitress and then moved over to cashier a bit and my table walks to the register and I ask \u201care you guys picking up today?\u201d even though I was just with them when they dined in \ud83d\ude44 Anything involving relationship management, and most sales jobs which were not simply retail. Most political jobs. Almost all senior management jobs, and anything else which involved a lot of networking and personal relationships.\n\nAnd of course, the jobs that super-recognizers get, usually in law enforcement of some kind. Portrait painter's not impossible. I have done charcoal portraits from people sitting in front of me, and they are fairly recognizable, if not exactly professional-level. As an artist, portrait painter would still be possible since you would be working either from a model or from a photo and not from memory. Same and after 6 years I have hardly any regulars because you have to do something really out there to stand out to me.  I love people who always sit in the same spot and order the same food, then I can recognize them so much easier. It is a struggle I have been working in restaurants for years, right now as a sommelier. \n\nCurrently the difficulty is recognizing regulars, or people who have come in before and I have chatted with. Generally I can figure it out after talking for a minute, but it can be embarrassing.\n\n\nWhen I worked as a host it was more of an issue, because I would repeatedly greet people who had just stepped out for a cigarette. Yep. I am a freelance IT contractor, who typically starts in a new environment 1-4 times per year. I have learned to cope by the usual methods, tagging people with their distinguishing features, but it is hard to form the networks and work out who is who and who is important each time. Actually, face blindness might be an asset for an artist. A big part of learning to draw or paint portraits is overcoming the brain's tendency to recognize a face as a face and instead see and draw the shapes that make it up. (See: *Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain)* I am in the same boat! I have everyone is bills completely separate but then one or two people move and everything falls to pieces! \n\n\nSometimes I will think that a table walked out on their bill, but they actually just went to play pool and Im still serving them (but with a new bill because I thought they were new people). This is not a job but having to identify a criminal in a row... I seriously thought this about myself all my life until I found out I had this!!!! Sounds like a pain \ud83d\ude2c I vote we make it a legal requirement to wear giant name tags! \ud83d\ude02 That must be super annoying. I hate it when people recognise me and I cannot them. I worry they will think I just do not value them whatsoever. Those joke fake undercover disguises such as glasses and a moustache would actually fool us as spies \ud83d\ude02 Yeh I think table numbers would be a great help for that.\n\nAs far as the abnormal eye contact... I am disabled and a wheelchair user and oddly this seems to just attract people to either stare at you, ignore you, or come up and talk to you as if they know you and tell you everything about their life or ask personal questions about yours. \n\nThis is soooo hard as I can never tell who knows me and who is just responding differently to me because of my disability. Wish it was like in those video games when people have their names hovering above their heads... Would makes it easier! \ud83d\ude02\n\nI bet it was awkward having too explain why you did not recognise people everytime. Yeh I would not make a good witness whatsoever. I would have to refuse to identify because there is a decent chance I will get it wrong. This is the reason I want AR glasses. I just want a computer to do facial recognition for me. It does not need to be tied to a big database, just people I already know. I am an executive with a high-profile design job (meaning, I give talks at events, interviews, etc.), and relationships are 95% of the gig.\n\nIt sucks.  Thank God I am really good at playing it off casually so that no one gets offended, or they at least get LESS offended, but it is brutal.\n\nAnd I could always play it off, but it is definitely become much harder as I have become more successful.  Before it would be seen as, \"oh, she is just a flake,\" and now it is more like, \"oh, she is an aloof asshole.\" That is a pretty common experience for people with proso. Chuck Close was famously faceblind, and a super well known portrait artist.\n\nSupposedly painting the faces helps him remember them. It is one of the reasons that during the times I worked onsite for places small enough that I might be expected to remember people from day to day, I would put together a floor map with the location of all the desks and the names of the people who sat there (along with other site information so it did not just look like I was stalking people). It did mean that if I was told to go help \"Jim\", I could find his desk, but there was always the chance that while I was walking there I would walk straight past Jim in the corridor and not even blink. School teacher. I actually wanted to be a teacher, but the thought of trying to recognize my students made me feel sick to my stomach. I actually am a HS teacher, and it is not as bad as I thought! I did luck out in that it turns out kids are a lot easier for me than adults. They are just more... different looking. I have also gotten kind of good at recognizing people by not-faces.\n\nBut basically, day 1, I mention the faceblindness thing and how it will take me a while to get them down, but bear with me.\n\nLucky factors here are that #1, my school is really really small and I have 40 kids across all my classes. In fact, I can recognize all 60 or so kids at the school, with the exception of some of the freshmen I have never taught. Not with 100% accuracy, and I have made silly mistakes, or had two students I thought were the same person for an embarassingly long time, or a running joke about two students I kept mixing up, etc.  But I am open about it so people are patient and we laugh about it, because Lucky factor #2, my kids are awesome and do not take advantage of me. I did have a student I am close to get a haircut and jokingly walk in without her glasses to see if I would know but like, there is 8 students in that class and she is not any of the other ones, so I saw through that ruse.\n\nThere is also advantages, I have found, to the faceblindness thing. Like, I can recognize kids just as well from the back as from the front because I do not rely on faces at all. Or if they are wearing masks, it does not matter, I still know them. Even in the dark, I get them by voices. So that is almost a superpower.\n\nOnly downside is that I 1000% will never ever get their parents. But as soon as I meet them, I bring up the faceblindness thing and they find it really interesting (because it IS), and I tell them to please introduce themselves every time as so-and-so is parent.  And if they do not... I bluff. I really should just ask, but I do still have some small amount of embarrassment for not recognizing people I know I should know, that I am working on.\n\nOne time I had a parent walk in and start talking in a friendly way about her son, and I went \"I am so sorry, faceblind, who is your kid again?\" and she says her kid's name and I am like \"oh that is why you look so familiar! Because you are my... coworker.\" Because she also teaches at my school. But we both laughed.\n\nThe AP Psychology teacher has me come in every year when she gets to perception disorders and talk about my faceblindness. It is so fun and they all find it fascinating. Again because, it is.\n\nSo tl;dr, even if you decide teaching is not for you, life gets SO MUCH easier when you acknowledge the faceblindness thing from the getgo. I teach elementary school.  I feel that it is better than say a retail job.  Kids are easier to recognize.  Plus you can talk to them vaguely while you are figuring out who they are more easily than adults, and after a few years if you do not recognize them, you can blame it on them looking grown up.  AND you can assign them seats and make them sit there.  You can even make them wear name tags.  It is recognizing parents that really sucks.

I get these uselessly gay feelings going on. Sometimes I just ask her, \"hey, look at me for a moment, just look at me for a sec. I want to take it all in,\" and she does and she is really pretty.\n\nAnd then the moment I look away, my memories of her face crumble, and in two seconds they are gone.\n\nAnything I can express in language, I can remember. She is got long brown hair, cute glasses, a lazy eye, stunning teeth, a classic and old-timey dress sense. \n\nBut the way her face goes, the shape of it and the way she smiles, there is no words for that. That is the part I cannot remember, and that is the part that amazes me every goddamn time.

It seems like there should be more than that, since I am pretty sure I have it, and you say that you have it.  \nLike, right there doubles the known cases. It is admittedly hard to diagnose, since it comes from personal experiences and repeated and extensive testing. This is really sweet, OP &lt;3 \n\nI get so annoyed at my silly little brain sometimes for not being able to remember faces properly but this is a good reminder that it is not all bad. It can be pretty neat too :)) Most face blindness testing also relies on showing you faces and having you pick them out again, but that just means that you will remember them, so you cannot use the same test twice.\n\nAnd when you have associative instead of preceptive prosopagnosia, it does not work. You can still see the face and know that they have a mole or something, so you just look for the mole on the next set of faces. Thank you so much for this. I am \\*sure\\* I have this. I have all the symptoms. I always thought I just had a mild case of prosopagnosia, but I think it is this instead. It could be both, but yeah.\n\nIt seems like prosopamnesia is a smaller subset of prosopagnosia.  \nI am pretty sure I have it as well, with just a sprinkling of prosoagnosia for \"fun\" :p Oh, thank you! I have just recently been realizing that the way I struggle with faces is genuinely significantly worse than average and is not down to laziness or lack of care. I am perfectly fine at recognizing people I know, even out of context, but I struggle to learn faces and cannot imagine faces. I can recall faces in photos or as part of a larger memory where facial expressions are relevant, as long as I do not focus too hard on the face, but I can only really recall actual face in bits and pieces. \n\nProsopagnosia did not seem to really fit that since facial recognition is not an issue once I know a face but prosopamnesia sounds like it might be exactly the description of what I am experiencing. And I have a condition that interferes with working memory and makes it less likely to inscribe into long term memory, which sounds like it might be a similar process failing to prosopamnesia.\n\nFunny that it is such a rare diagnosis, I have run into enough people who are at least as bad at learning faces as I am that it seems like it should be a fairly broadly recognized symptom or condition instead. There is only two confirmed cases, probably because it is hard to distinguish, diagnostically, between prosopagnosia and prosopamnesia.\n\nAnd from what I have heard from people who relate to the latter, they also have the former.\n\nSo I am sure it is really difficult to address. And it is not like there is a treatment or cure for either, and in both cases you would just teach coping techniques. I do not have it, but I must admit I cannot help but admire his outlook on his lot in life. I wish more people could find positives rather than negatives where they exist, no matter how big or small. This is adorable", "A neurologist explains how Alzheimer's disease caused him to become faceblind  Who knew? People with early-stage Alzheimer's can become faceblind. I wonder how their experience, distress and coping mechanisms compare with those of us with congenital prosopagnosia?", "Do I have a prosopagnosia or just bad at memory? I can see others' face clearly. Can tell the differences between 2 faces or people. Or like, if you show me 2 or more of your friends, I can tell who they are after the introdution.\n\nBut then, if I close my eyes, and they change their positions. I cannot tell who they are.\n\nI can say \"Oh, I met you before, but who you are?\". It is like you sturdy foreigne languge. You learn some new words and forget their meanings. And never recognize them even you see them everyday.\n\nI can remember others' voices, shape, style of hair - walking - stand - sit..., or even their smells but only get trouble of their face.\n\nDo I have a prosopagnosia or just a bad memory? But my memory is not that bad. The face is the only thing I have trouble in remembering. Definitely Prosopagnosia what you describe !\n\nI actually done the same question post as you last Jan, ant others also did. Fun to see that everybody discover it this way I am not sure, but for me, it is like my \"automatic (read: normal) system\" kicks in after a few weeks or months, depending on the intensity and frequency of interactions. Before that, I will have to rely on details like glasses, facial hair, watches etc. Same here. I had a group of friends at uni who I can recognize anywhere I see them, but anyone else? Nope I think the two are linked if I am not mistaken. That is how I describe it to people.  I recognize people at work,  but I tell them if I run into them outside of work I will have no idea who they are. It is all based on context for me. I actually talked to all my friends about this and they said they cannot do it either but they are definitely not prosopagnosic. \n\nWhen they see a face they know, they are able to immediately recognize it, unlike me, but they cannot just picture what people look like if they are not actively looking at someone. Interesting point of view, my friends all said to me the opposite, like \"If I knew how to draw or how to paint really well, I could certainly paint this person that I know very well since long time, almost accurately\"\n\nI cannot really verify what they say (I would need to go into their mind). Maybe you should test your friends :D\n\n\nFor me, I could try to draw your hairs and face roundness, and few characteristics like scars... But there will be no hands, no feets, no face (or at least some random face to fill the blank)\n\nI do not know what do you think about it, or how your friends/others /u  think about it, interesting question ! I have learned to tell people I meet that I will not know who they are if I see them somewhere again just to me where I know then from. .and they should not take it personally, my brain is just not wired that way. That was even before I knew why. Just knew something was wrong Ooo good idea to tell people not to take it personally.  I have had people get upset after I tell them I might not recognize them. I am trying my best, I promise! When you watch live action movies do you have trouble telling similar looking people apart? For example I had trouble telling Aragorn and Boromir apart in Lord of the Rings For movies, every character has their own characteristic, like hair style or suit style. If Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne go to the same party in normal/daily suits, I cannot tell who they are.\n\nEven my oldest and older brothers, I cannot tell who they are just by looking at them in the same suits.", "When someone recognizes you that you do not recognize, what is the polite way to tell them you are moderately faceblind?

I rely on other cues (hair style, body shape, gait, etc.) to recognize people, and it can be frustrating when one of those things changes\n\nJust positing... perhaps you are a super-recognizer of some sort, such that the changes in the face (that is, the color, contouring, etc.) caused the face to be different enough for you, that you did not recognize her?", "Do I have prosopagnosia? I just found out about prosopagnosia yesterday and it is been such a relief. I am pretty sure I have it but it is much milder than a lot of other people's on here. I can recognise my friends, family and people ive interacted with a lot but have difficulty with pretty much everyone else unless they have a stand out feature like unique hair. I also might forget the faces of people I used to interact with a lot of its been a while. Just to be sure I wanted to give you guys some examples of problems with faces I have had ask you guys if this is prosopagnosia or I am just a dumbass.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nI started a karate class and this girl came up and talked to me. I talked to her for about 15 minutes before realising she was the girl I had been working with at my job every Friday. I only realised this because she started talking about our manager. I then had to pretend like Id recognised her the whole time. \n\nI have spent at least an hour talking to like 3 different people from one of my classes (when I first started uni this year so I would never met them before) and really enjoyed talking to them. I wanted to be friends but lone behold when I walk into class the next day I did not recognise any of them and so could not approach them again to continue building a friendship. \n\nI made this friend when I started at a new school and I would constantly walk past her and 'not see her' in her words. I could be standing right beside her and not know its her because her hair was so similar to so many girls at the school. \n\nThese are just some of the examples I can think of right now. My main problem is the one I outlined in the second example. It is been very hard for me to make friends because everyone has the same skin tone and such similar hair colour and styles. It is been giving me mad social anxiety this year.\n\n Is this prosopagnosia? Sounds just like it Yup I am 41 and just figured this out in the last couple years and only Bev I saw a post on Reddit. I legit thought I was a snob because I was so bad at remembering people. Definitely. Sometimes to help myself recognize people I pick an item like a water bottle or a significant feature like a scar as a kind of cutie mark so I can remember who the person is. I am also very straightforward with letting people know I am faceblind, I will just tell them enthusiastically right away as part of my introduction. I have found it is made life a lot easier, and people have only ever been supportive or curious. I have also noticed that I will memorize people over time, like how they walk and what they say, so before college I did not know about my faceblindness at all because we had such small class sizes. I am really glad I know now! How do you work being faceblind into an introduction without it being awkward? Same. Not being able to remember people's faces definitely makes me feel like a stuck up snob sometimes. It is definitely made a few people think I am a bit of a bitch lmao. You know that you have trouble recognizing faces.  That is all that matters.\n\nExactly 50% of people have worse than average facial recognition abilities.  Chances are 50:50 that you fall into that group.    \n\nExactly 2% of people have prosopagnosia. Chances are 50:1 that you fall into that group.\n\n1% of people fall into both groups. Classic interactions - I reckon you are in the club Haha, I am a very enthusiastic person. Pretty much I just go, \"Hi! I am _____, nice to meet you! Oh and I am faceblind and I might not be able to recognize you  in the future so just remind me who you are! :) \" Just with tons of confidence. It always works out. I will give that a try. Yeah sounds like it. You can go to faceblind.org and sign up to take the faceblind test. They might ask you to participate in further testing if you are interested. \n\nI try to tell new people I am faceblind and explain a little bit about what that means (mostly that it is neurological and I am not just being stand-off-ish). I think it helps because then they at least know what is up when I do not know who they are.", "Thanks i hate memories ", "She looks the same? Just different lighting and filters and other editing, but it is very clearly the same person  As someone without FB, she does NOT look the same to me. If I try to use context clues (or however it is you might try to recognize her) then yes, her hair looks the same, her dress, her necklace, and her boobs. But those are not how I would normally identify her. Using her face I would personally think they are two different people. Well yeah evidently this is what non-faceblind people think, which is why I took this to the faceblind sub\n\nedit: But even when I go through her features individually they are the same. Same nose, same chin, just a slightly different angle. Her eyes look different cause she is staring into a ring light in the first one. I do not think her chin is the same, it is more angular on the left one. And her face is thinner on the left. And she has more prominent cheek bones on the left one. Maybe the cheek bones can be explained by the smile but not the chin. Please remember that this is a sub designated for individuals with face-blindness. I know that **you** can see the difference, and I think your intention is inherently good in trying to help us to see the difference, but it is coming across as a little condescending. We cannot see the difference in faces because we have an actual disorder that is stopping us; therefore, you trying to explain the difference will not help as much as you think it will.\n\nFurthermore, if we need assistance telling two people apart, we will ask. Do not expect us to need your help, we are not helpless. When we post and comment on this sub, we do not do so with the expectation that someone will sort out our disorder and solve everything magically. We post to share our experiences and connect with others like us. This is not an appropriate space for you to be commenting what you just commented. Please be more respectful in the future. I am in the same boat. The second picture has different mascara on, and her hair is a little too puffed in the back, but I noticed that after a second of intensely studying their features. On first glance, the only thing I saw that was different was the filter with a dimming effect on the second picture. Thank you.\n\nAnd again, when the whole public conversation surrounding her recently has been about how she looks so different now, and how this tweet is literally just about how this person feels like she looks different in these pictures, it is a bit redundant for another non-faceblind person to come say the same exact thing.\n\n(And when it comes to cases like this I do not even want to learn this \"skill\". Yes it is good to be aware that pictures are edited and that surgery is a thing as long as it is to help with accepting and not placing unrealistic expectations on your natural self, but a lot of people take it past that point. I think she looks beautiful in both pictures, and be it my faceblindness or not, I do not want to learn to be more judgmental of people's appearances lol) Yeah, no worries. Did not mean to offend. I am only in this sub to try to get a better understanding of what my son faces on a day to day basis. So I know I will probably make stupid comments in here that I likely make to him too. If I do, point them out to me and hopefully I will learn. I hope you are not saying that non-faceblind people should not participate at all though. Thank you for the acknowledgement, I appreciate it. I do believe that there is room for non-faceblind people in discussions here. But we do not need someone to highlight the differences is faces, there is no room here for that behavior. \n\nPeople here to learn about face-blindness are absolutely welcome! If you have any questions about the disorder, check the helpful links that have been included. If you have any specific questions, make a post and we will do our best to answer. Left one has a much more V-shaped chin and her eyes are narrower. I think they were mostly pointing out the editing, and are worried about Khloe. She is known as the \u201cugly\u201d kardashian sister and it clearly gets to her. \ud83d\ude41 Granted I do not feel too bad for a multimillionaire but I can empathize. If she been dressed differently in one of the pictures and if the pictures were not side-by-side, I would not have recognized the 2 pictures as the same person.  Wait, are those pictures of the same woman or no? I cannot tell and the comments are confusing.\n\n(Not faceblind here, just someone who tests below average on facial recognition.\n... although after this conversation, I may be reconsidering my supposed not-faceblindness haha) I found the comments confusing as well! It sounds like they are not the same person. \n\nAfter some scrutinising, I found a foolproof difference: the distance of their mouths from their noses. Girl on the right has like twice the distance of the one on the left even though their lips are the same thickness. They.. are not the same? O.o Not sure why this is here. Kylie has extremely edited photos online. This photo is comparing her actual self, to the photoshopped hot mess on the left. Both are khloe what even is the point of that tweet? Her head is pointing down slightly and her lip is raised slightly from smile making it look closer. However there is what looks like a mole on her face not there in the other. Maybe edited out so idk.\n\nEdit: after searching apparently these are both of Khloe Kardashian. What you said was fine. They do not like non faceblind people here. You should read up on Oliver Sacks he was a neurologist and he had it. He writes up interesting case studies and has written a bit about face blindness as well. It is cool you are trying to understand your son's perspective! Best of luck! It was not clear to me it is the same person. Even side by side the proportions of the forehead and nose both look an inch longer. \n\nI thought this was Denise Richards at first from when she was younger. That Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian in both pics actually. She is been getting called out for very extreme and inconsistent photoshopping this past months I think.", "Apparantly, there are different people in this picture. Took me a minute.

I thought they were all princess diana If it was not for the title I would not have put in the effort to get the joke.\n\nAt first glance it was clearly 4 different people, and the bottom right was David Bowie. I never realised how much Owen Wilson looks like Princess Di. I am shooketh.", "A small victory! Last week I met someone new and, while we talked, mentioned that I am faceblind. I explained that that is why I might not recognize her next time we met (especially with masks) and that it happens with everyone. And today I saw her again, and she came up to me and reminded me of her name and how we met! It was awesome! Definitely worth the slight potential awkwardness of bringing it up in the first place.\n\nJust thought it might be encouraging to have an example of non-faceblind people being cool and helpful and understanding about it. What a great idea!\n\nI really do not understand why some people take my faceblindness as a personal attack.  It is bizarre. Praise!!! This is glorious. Because the idea of someone not recognizing faces is beyond comprehension for neurotypicals. It is always names, never faces, so the assumption is that you are snubbing them. It is on the front end too.\nMy husband was telling his friend about it and she got upset just from his saying it was a possibility I would not recognize her after meeting her once. That, or they think you are \u201cspecial,\u201d especially if you are younger than 21. Like, if I wanted to be \u201cspecial,\u201d why would I choose something like prosopagnosia?

Turns out he was played by Leo and it all made sense. Sure he is not ugly in any way but without knowing he was Leo I had no idea why his looks were so hyped.

I remember telling my mom after school about it and her saying that he did not come, he was working as usual that day. I always thought it was weird that she did not know my dad did this special thing that made me proud at the time. \n\nAnyway, looking back I realize it must have been another kid's dad who also had dark hair and glasses. The guy was probably being nice to the weird kid who was acting overly familiar. This is pretty scary as I realize how easy it would have been for a complete stranger with similar features to one of my parents to get me to come with them as a young kid.. yikes! One time when I was 3-4 years old I was at an extended family reunion and I ran up to my great aunt and hugged her, thinking she was my grandmother.

It is a good system. OMG same!!! Working retail though I was told the best identifying things to give the cops in a theft situation is height and shoes, since the thief cannot change those (at least not quickly when it comes to shoes) when they leave the scene.

After never previously associating the two, I can say that it makes a lot of sense given brain fog and various other cognitive dysfunction and related difficulties in remembering details/paying attention. Are there any more **chronically** (ch)**ill** users here suffering from both fibro and prosopagnosia? Oh interesting! I dont have fibro, but my mother did (past tense; she is one of the very rare who is been in remission for over 20 years). I am medium(?) proso though. I can recognize friends and family, but not the stranger I saw 2 minutes ago that took their hat off ... and maybe not the friends and family that changed their hair style. Not fibro, but RSD (reflex sympathy distrophy), which is (from what I can tell) similar. Not the same, but both cause intense pain and are not well understood. I think most people with prosopagnosia do not have fibromyalgia. You would probably have to check with fibromyalgia community to see if prosopagnosia is more common with them than in the general population. I def did not think that *most* people with proso have fibro too, I was just curious about this sub\u2019s user population :)", "My mum and I both mistook a stranger for my sister today My mum\u2019s whole life fell into place 3 years ago when I discovered I had faceblindness and she realised she did too. There is only been a couple of times that she is experienced it in front of me and it is always hilarious, but today I think we really creeped a woman out.\n\nMy mum was walking back from nursery with me after collecting my daughter and my sister (let us call her Dawn) text asking if we were still around. I told her we were round the corner from her place.\n\nSo we turn the corner and we are walking down the lane towards her flat, and a woman is walking toward us. I see that it is Dawn, but since I always have to check myself when I think I recognise someone, I gave them another look or two and determined that this was not in fact my sister at all. She was wearing red lipstick which Dawn never does, and on slightly closer inspection was probably 45 while Dawn is 29. Her similar walk and dark hair had fooled me.\n\nBut as we get close to the woman my mother suddenly sings out loudly \u201cHere she is!! It is aunty Dawn!!\u201d\n\nBy the time she has finished the last word she is realised it is in fact not Aunty Dawn, but a confused older woman who we are now both firmly avoiding eye contact with and walking along as if nothing happened.\n\nDawn, 5 minutes later, was quite offended by the story since she does not relate to faceblind issues. it took me a second to understand FB did not in fact stand for facebook in this story but wow that is quite funny\ud83d\ude02 Haha, I have seen it used here before but I guess I was being too lazy.

Hi r/Prosopagnosia, nice to meet you!  \n\n\nI have \"suffered\" from face blindness since birth (feels weird to call it that), and did not learn that I saw the world differently from most people until just a few years ago (though of course, it all seems very obvious now in retrospect).\n\n  \nI frequent a subreddit called r/socialskills to help strangers on the internet with whatever social problems and questions they have got. Just yesterday I got into a conversation about a poster, and suggested that the person in his story might be face blind. I mentioned that I am, and I explained to him what it was like. The entirety of our conversation is ( if you wanted to read through it yourself.  \n\n\nDuring the conversation, the poster asked how I experience attraction to people, and says that to him (and apparently most people), initial attraction comes from the face.  \n\n\nI am asexual, and I have never thought about my prosopagnosia being correlated with my sexuality until this conversation. Because of how sneaky prosopagnosia is (it is relatively unknown, and many people have it without necessarily knowing it), there are not many scientific studies about it out there. I really wanted to ask other people who are face blind and find out (if any of you are willing to share, that is) how many of you are also asexual (or thought you might have been when you were younger) - to see if there is some kind of odd correlation between the two.  \n\n\nAnd to any of you who are not face blind, I would like a few more opinions on \"the attractiveness of a face\" - which is something I have never really considered before today.   \n\n\nAt any rate, thank you for taking the time to read through this. I did not see any community rules posted, so I hope I am not breaking any. I will take this post down if I am.  \n\n\nAnd like I said before, it is nice to meet you all! Prosopagnostic and sex-repulsed over here! I think you might be on to something... Happy Cake day! \n\nAnd two hardly establishes a pattern (and even if we start to see a pattern, it correlation never implies causation).\n\nBut even seeing one other person with the same combination is enough to not make me feel foolish for bringing it up.  Same! I am just happy to have someone with a similar experience! :D Yeah, I dunno about how the person in that thread says 70 to 80 percent of attraction is based on the face. I think those of us who are NOT face blind attach a lot of emotion to faces. So when we are infatuated or in love with someone, we tend to think their face is just the most gorgeous thing ever. But a large part of the obsession with the face could be caused *by the infatuation*, rather than the other way around. I am not sure we could tell which way the causation goes just through introspection.\n\n Thank you for your insight! I really appreciate it!  \n\n\nI was totally blown away with how the user described it in the thread - and I had no reason to not believe him (especially considering that I am asexual on top of being face blind). Facial blindness is a bad name. We can see faces. We cannot recall faces. I have prosopagnosia, definitely not asexual though.  Thanks for speaking up :)\n\nI appreciate it! You are a patient person. If I were face blind, I do not think I would have tolerated that stuff about \"a blur\" and \"blank canvas\" as well as you did. I mean, I know those are common things to think, because my husband tells me about people reacting that way, but it blows my mind every time. The concept is just not that difficult to grasp, people ... Face blindness and bisexuality  Haha! I guess I am a patient person. And I never mind trying to teach someone about it. I was only a little annoyed since I had mentioned earlier that I can see faces. \n\nBut he seemed genuinely enthusiastic about learning more, so no harm done. Prosopagnosia has been causing me problems for as long as I can remember (some of my earliest memories are of mistaking strangers for my parents because they were dressed similarly or had similar hair etc).\n\nInterestingly, I have never really been attracted to the look of people's faces, rather I find myself falling for personality and voices. What makes me look twice is how they dress, walk and their height.\n\nUntil reading your post I would never connected this with prosopagnosia, seems like a logical notion though.  &gt;Until reading your post I would never connected this with prosopagnosia, seems like a logical notion though.\n\nI felt the same way. u/eidolonwall (who does not have prosopagnosia) wrote above that being attracted to faces is not quite as common as the person in my original conversation made it seem. It is all just our individual perspective though, it is fair to say that we may be underestimating the complexity of initial attractions.\n\nAlthough, I used to dread first dates because I knew I would be unable to recognise my date. Whatever had attracted me to them did not necessarily mean that I would pick it out of a crowd!  &gt;It is fair to say that we may be underestimating the complexity of initial attractions.\n\nTo be sure! face blind and the thing that most attracts me is hair.  I love long hair...and also pointy features, like sharp angles in faces...think elvish. \n\nTo me most people have similar roundish, faces with roundish features that do not really stand out to me, but add a few angles and those faces are much more interesting and attractive to me.  Like eyebrows with a prominent arch (kind of pointy at the top) or strong cheekbones, or a sharp thin nose.\n\nBut hair, I am crazy about long hair...I even dated people I thought were not that good looking but had amazing hair. I would say that I am generally attracted to more distinct/exotic faces.  A lot of classically beautiful people I found boring/average because they look similar to me.\n\nWith that said I have a pretty mild case of prosopagnosia. My proso is very mild (I can recognize family but I cannot always recognize coworkers) but I am sex-repulsed and asexual. So maybe there is something.  I am demisexual and I while I can definitely identify whether a person is conventionally attractive or not, it is all down to time.  I am bisexual, and find that I am not attracted to people because of their looks (or their plumbing), but their mind/personality/sense of humor. Also, the way they smell. I have Prosopagnosia, Alexithymia, and I am asexual (demisexual).  \n\nI personally struggle with eye contact. It was worse when I was younger, but I can now \"look\" people in the eye. The thing is, my eyes will be in the direction of a person's face, but I cannot say I am actually looking at their face -- the difference between looking and seeing... I attribute my issues with faces to be largely due to this. \n\nI have read that Alexithymia can be related to issues with eye contact (( The idea is that so much of interpreting another person's emotional state is due to being able to read their face, so it hinders developing emotional intelligence (speculation, no source). I think this idea makes sense to me.\n\nI view my asexuality largely to be part of my personality, rather than related to the others. If I was not in my current relationship, I do not know how likely I would search out another.   I have mild-to-moderate prosopagnosia and am definitely not asexual.  \n\nI see faces and will form an opinion as to whether they are attractive or not.  Just do not ask me to remember what they look like (until I have seen them *a lot*).   If you are still interested in replies, I am mostly gay (I am a trans man) and not asexual. I have a mild case of proso, but what attracts me is faces that have something \"unusual\" about them. For example, hooked/beaked noses really make me swoon. I am also partial to long hair and a general \"alternative\" look. Generically attractive faces do not interest me because I cannot \"see\" them. \n\nAnd wow, you were really patient with that poster. He came across as a bit condescending to me.  Thank you for your perspective, and for your kind words &lt;3 I am probably bi but I have always been not interested in sex. Although I do feel aesthetic attraction to people and romantic too. \n\nI do not think I am asexual since I would have sex with a partner to make them happy.\n\nI have always liked people with weird haircuts and unique voices which might be due to proso. You mean coitus? Your description sounds like a standard asexual, and I thought I was bi also until people explained to me that asexuals can still feel aesthetic attraction, affection/romance, can still have partners and are (usually) willing to have sex for the purpose of keeping their partner happy. \n\nOr how Asexuals who masturbate do it in a non sexual context (like to tire one's self out).\n\nErm, sorry if it feels like I am jumping down your throat or something. I really do not mean to. I just read a lot of my past self in your post.\n\nThank you for sharing your experience :) This does seem pretty close to what I have felt. I will definitely read up on what it means to be asexual and think about it. Thanks! Glad I could give you something to think about.\n\nWhatever you end up figuring out, do not let it get to you too much. Being able to put a name to how you feel does not change who you are, or the relationships (including friendships) you have built.\n\nStay classy! Same here! This is mind blowing... Never thought of the correlation between these two I find eye contact doesnt come easily and i think it is related to prosopagnosia.  I dont like it when people deliberately move into my eyeline because they think I am not paying attention to them. The thing is, I find it much easier to listen to people if I do not have to look at them as well. same here, though, I do not feel it is linked in my case. \n\nI definitely do tend to like boys with particular hair, like longish hair or big curls, had not quite clicked that it is probably because of the prosopagnosia. I have thought about this. I am hetero and married, but I have never understood \"he is so hot!\" or thinking celebrities are attractive. I genuinely feel like nice people are attractive, and even very conventionally attractive people who are mean look hideous. I do not know if that is \"normal.\" I have also mused that, while I have no problem with people have casual sexual relations, the thought of having sex with someone that you do not know well repulses me, because you do not know what kind of person they are. And what is surprised me about that realization is that it is not \"Even if he is hot I would not be able to do it\" but it is \"How can you even be turned on when you do not even know him.\" ", "I was like: that would be the perfect plot twist, but his nose does not look like Taylor's...

But according to some, they are not even /that/ similar. The point of actors is that they are supposed to be different people at different times, right?  So why am I supposed to know who the actor is when they are going to the trouble of looking like someone else?  (Of course, I often do not know how the CHARACTERS are either, so...) I do not usually have issues with cartoons or anime , but when I watch a new show with people it usually takes a while to start recognizing them. Watching Stranger Things S3 recently, I was trying to figure out if Steve was a major character. I would known I would seen him before, but had to see the other's interactions with him to be sure. I just use the \"I do not watch many movies\" excuse. My husband likes to show me pictures of The Beatles and ask me to identify which is which. If John is wearing glasses, I do okay, so he would been using more pictures w/o glasses.\n\nOne day he showed me a picture of The Beatles, where they were wrapped in a British flag. I tried guessing, but kept getting them wrong.\n\nHe finally let me in on the joke. It was actually The Who.\n\nOne of the many reasons I married him was for his sense of humor :) My wife is still shocked at my answers whenever we watch a movie and she tells me \"look who it is!\" and makes me guess.  She is pretty understanding but I find that so frustrating when she makes me guess.", "I used to get the \"opposite\" of prosopagnosia occasionally when I would get sick when I was younger, wondering if anyone here has heard anything about it So I guess its not technically the opposite, which would be the \"super-recognizer\" phenomenon i see when i try to search it.\n\nWhen i would get a common cold when I was younger, i would start to \"recognize\" everyone, even/especially people I had never seen before in my life. I would go out in public and every face had a \"I know I have seen you somewhere before\" feeling. It was more personal than feeling like I saw them on TV or the internet. It was like we were old friends, except it was pretty much every face I saw and I knew eventually I had never seen them before in my life. It tripped me out at first and I would walk up to random people and say \"do not I know you from somewhere?\" or \"have we met before?\"\n\nThe symptoms were usually for the first day or two of the onset of the sickness, and has not happened in years (was mostly between ages of ~15-20). I cannot find any similar stories anywhere or information about this, so I was wondering anyone in this community had done enough related research to possibly know anything? Look up \"Hyperfamiliarity For Faces\"; it should be what you are searching for. \n\nI do not know about any correlations between catching a cold and HFF. I have seen folks on here talk about what seems to be something of HFF and Prosopagnosia. ( \n\n\"Acquired prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize familiar faces, is the best-known face recognition deficit and typically ensues from damage to the (right or bilateral) temporal lobes .

This comes after immediately recognizing Nathan lane's voice as the meerkat in lion king while everyone in the room, and on the internet, thought it was Billy crystal. I just knew 100% and there was not a doubt in my mind. As soon as he spoke, I saw Nathan lane's face. Thing is, I realized I was impeccable at remembering faces a long time ago. Like recognizing actors by their face when they are younger in an old movie, and my wife will be like. Really? It looks nothing like that? How did you know that? It happens so often that at this point, if I say it is someone, she just knows I am right. And lately, in the past year, it is been happening with voices too. The reason I am asking this is because it seems like such a waste to be so talented at such a useless skill. Is there any way that any of you guys have found that recognizing voices have helped you in life? Being really good at ID'ing sounds saved us a couple thousand dollars.  There was a barely-audible sound coming from the heater vents in the bathroom.  Nobody else could hear it.  But it was definitely a water dripping sound. \n\nSo I called a plumber, and HE could not hear it in my bathroom.  But he went under the house anyway (we had years of history on successful projects together) and sure enough he found a pipe slowly leaking water towards our foundation.  Good thing we fixed it, it would already excavated a little trench. \n\nCar problems, emergency vehicle sirens, weird noises... I am Bat Eared Plotty, I will ID  them. Sounds like you are what they call a super-recognizer.  Not only is it NOT a useless skill, you can turn it into a career.  Lots of law enforcement involved recognizing people from photos or grainy video, for one.\n\nYou could also do well in politics.   You could be that person who recognizes that constituent they met once three years ago.  People appreciate being recognized.  And if you do not want to be a politician yourself, you can work as an assistant/advisor to a bigwig, remembering the faces they cannot. \n\nHeck, if I was rich, I would happily hire someone just to hang around and tell me who people are and where I know them from.\n\nThose are just off the top of my head, and you obviously do not have to make it the focus of your employment, but if you work in any public facing job, it will be an asset to recognize everyone who walks in the door. As the other commenter said, you are probably a super-recognizer - a person with exceptional face recognition ability. And it is not a useless skill, if you are good enough at it, you can get paid decently working for the police and helping them identify criminals in videos. You also might be able to participate in research studying this phenomenon. It sounds like you have the opposite of prosopagnosia: you are a super-recognizer. (From your post it sounded like you might be confused about what prosopagnosia is, if I misread then you can just ignore my explanation.) Prosopagnosia is difficulty in recognizing faces. Some people with prosopagnosia may rely on voices to recognize people as a coping mechanism for not being able to recognize them by their face, and can become quite good at it, but being able to recognize voices is not part of the diagnosis. I would not describe your skill as useless at all\u2014 it can save you a ton of embarrassment in social situations! And from other comments, there is apparently a market for your skill as well. Congrats, being a super-recognizer is really cool!", "Thank god he kept his hair and glasses the same throughout the photo or I never would have understood this  Maybe the commenter in the image has prosopagnosia!

I know my classmates a year now and i know we are in the same class but i still have trouble with girls names (mostly because they have the same hair type and style)\n\ni start recognizing when I know somebody or see them very often\n\nwhen i watch tv and new character has a pony tail in another scene i cannot tell who it is\n\nalso i have aphantasia\n\npls help idk what to do, i had a couple situations when i mistaken somebody I know for a long time and I cannot explain them anything\n\n(for my whole life I thought that Remus Lupin were two diffrent people because in one film they were calling him profesor Lupin and in the next film people called him Remus and I was confused who was this new character, and my friend explain to my like a month ago that this is one person). Yes, you most likely have it.\n\nIt is a spectrum, which is why you can recognize close friends and family but not new people or classmates you are less close to. (Although it is also common to not recognize people you are close to if you see them somewhere you are not expecting them -- ie they show up when you think they are on a trip, or at a large festival when you did not know they were coming.) \n\nThere is not a medicine or much you can DO. But by being aware, you can adapt and maybe not be so fast to say someone is name when you are not sure, or not ask who they are and wait a little bit for more context clues. Sounds like it to me. The reason you are recognizing people you have known longer is likely because you have learned to recognize features other than the face for them (jawline, hair, gait, voice, body type, style, etc). You sound like you are me. :) This is very similar to my experience (confirmed prosopagnosic). The way I explain it to people, based on what I have read (e.g. ( is that neurotypical brains have two pathways for recognizing visual images: a general pathway that works for all visual images, and a specific \"shortcut\" pathway that is just for faces. The \"shortcut\" pathway allows people to recognize, learn, remember, and imagine human faces much more quickly and efficiently than other images. In my brain, the \"shortcut\" pathway does not work very well, so I \\*can\\* process faces, but I have to process them using the main pathway. So recognizing a particular face is as difficult for me as recognizing, say, a particular apple. If I looked at the same apple every day, paid close attention to it, and hung out with it all the time, I would definitely learn what that apple looked like. But if you just introduced me to an apple and then put it in a group of other apples, I would struggle to pick it out. I might manage it if it was the only green apple in a bunch of red apples, or if it had an unusual shape or distinctive features. But I would not just confidently say \"that is that apple!\"\n\nAnother analogy I use is that I am no better at remembering people's faces than I am at remembering dogs' faces. I can recognize \\*my\\* dog--although I still might struggle if he was in a room full of just other black labs--but that is because I see him all the time and have \\*learned\\* his face. When I found out I had prosopagnosia and started reading about it, I was surprised to learn that neurotypical people just \\*recognize\\* faces without conscious effort. I knew I was bad at faces, but I assumed that other people were just better at learning and memorizing faces than I was. From what I understand, non-prosopagnosics do not generally have to pick out and memorize particular features. They just recognize the face as a whole, the way I do with voices (maybe you do too--I think I have heard that research is currently ongoing about whether prosopagnosics tend to be better than average at voices!). I think prosopagnosics often underestimate how faceblind they are because they do not realize just how easy it is for many other people. This may be contributing to your confusion.\n\nIf anyone who has a deeper understanding of the science would like to clarify this, please do!\n\nWhile you do not have to somehow \"prove\" that your faceblindness is real, I find that taking a face recognition test can be reassuring and clarifying. It is actually how I found out I was actually faceblind and not just forgetful--I signed up for a research study where they gave me the Cambridge Face Memory Test and I scored in the bottom 1% of people! If you are interested in taking it, there is a (different) research study online that will administer it: ( You have to be 18+ to participate for data safety reasons, so as you say you are 17, maybe it is something you can look forward to on your next birthday :)\n\nBut test or no test, your experience sounds very similar to that of many prosopagnosics. I do not think you should hesitate to say that you have prosopagnosia.", "Face Blindness Quiz I made. Tell me what you think. Thanks.  This is a little quiz that is totally anonymous, no email needed or anything. I was interested in face blindness as I do not have trouble recognizing faces but do have trouble with emotions on faces, and it led me to read about prosopagnosia.\n\n\nI looked at tests online but they were mostly recognizing famous people (not good if you do not know who they are), or like a matching pairs game with the same photographs appearing.\n\n\nI would not call mine a test, I just made it for fun, but I have tried to make it a bit different than other tests and address some of the failings as I saw them. Just as a baseline someone without face blindness scores ~46 I scored 43 and consider myself to have somewhat mild prosopagnosia.Some faces were easy for me to recognize because of same hairstyle,make up, clothes or other non facial information in the picture.Otherwise it would have been much more difficult. Ah ok, thanks for taking the quiz!\n\nI wanted to include other information like hairstyle, clothing, background too see what effect it had. I can see from your score that you could tell who you had not seen (apart from 1 person I think), but if clothing or hairstyle changed on the people you had seen that caused a few errors.\n\n\nMy brother just took the test who does not have face blindness and scored 47 and two other anonymous people have taken it who scored 37 and 31 respectively. I was able to mark people up fairly easy with hairstyle, jewelry, clothes, and temporary markers like lighting, color of the picture, and sweat. If you cropped out all that information and gave us only bare faces to work with, I would have a much bigger problem. As it stands, you are basically only testing memory here, by including such a large sample set and asking us to memorize photos rather than actually learn faces. From feedback I have seen on other forums people have said the tests that are just cropped faces do not mirror real life and they would like other information, as it is often hairstyle, clothing etc changing that throws them off.\n\n\nSome of the doubles have similar photographs in both sections and some are quite different in terms of pose and clothing. It was just something I thought I would try. From the scores that are in you have scored quite highly, so maybe you are good at picking up on other details.\n\n\nThe cropped face test I have seen was for famous people but that runs into the problem of actually knowing who that person is. I guess my quiz tests (if it tests anything) if you remember this particular person, which if you have face blindness would be difficult and means you rely on other data. There were too many variables in the pictures unrelated to faces to be a good test. I liked the structure of the test, though. I think it works better than the popular celebrity ones.  I consider myself to be faceblind and I scored 40/50. There are a number of characteristics I was able to use to recognise some of the faces. \n\nI also do a lot better than expected on faceblindness tests. Apparently I do somehow recognise faces after all. The thing is, I feel like I am guessing randomly all the way, I have no confidence in my ability and its error rate is too high to be socially acceptable.  Yes you are right. I think to do it better I should have cropped out all the backgrounds and extraneous stuff and also not had as many faces to remember like someone else mentioned previously.\n\nThanks for having filling it in, appreciate it. I think some of the extra info in the photos is sometimes helping and sometimes distracting from identifying the person. I should have cropped it out tbh.\n\nThe average score at the moment is about 35, so 40 is quite good, but that is 6 or 7 short of non-faceblindness scores I have. I guess that is 6 awkward situations that could happen if mirrored in real life.\n\n\nThanks for having a go at the quiz. I enjoyed the quiz.  Afterwards, I would have liked seeing the matching photos next to one another.\n\n I am searching for a good test, because I am pretty sure I have prosopagnosia, but it is really difficult to find an appropriate one. Many of theem only asks questions, which does not help for prove. It only answers if you believe in having problems in face recognitions, which is mostly true when you try a test.\nThe second problem is, when you use pictures, you do not need to test the ability to memorize. It is the ability to compare which does not work. \nWhen I see identical twins in different shape or with different hairstyle, I think they are not related. Because many people look so similar from my view, that I compare single areas of a person. Otherwise, when 2 people are wearing the same and look similar often I believe they are twins.\nThird, no matter how often I saw a person in tv series, when the change there style it is very hard to identify the person. For example a charakter changes from straight blond to curled brunette)\nExtremly hard are movies which are playing in the 30or 50s, when they all wearing the same and have identical hairstyles, it does'nt make fun, because I am not able to follow the handling. \nFinal,these details may help you to improve your test. And I would be lucky to take it, when it is ready. Thanks for your detailed response. Yes maybe a comparison test that does not rely so much on memory would be better for a future test.\n\nThat is interesting about old movies and all the fashion being the same so everyone looks the same, never thought about that before. So you cannot add in the \"I did not see that person before, and I got that right,\" into the scores. Your true score is how many of the people they did see before vs whether they got that right or not. Slightly curious as to whether I would have recognized these people in an outside situation,,, I copied all the pics of people seen before, compared them with each other, and noted who I recognized, and not.\n\n\n\nI recognized four people,,, the green dots. One guy's scar and hairdo combo. Another guy's smile/suit combo. Gal's vacant stare and similar makeup hair. Intense looking stare and water drops.\n\nThat is what I recognized n those people! Not the faces particularly.\n\nThe yellow dots are the people I could match up when copying pairs of pictures. Once I knew what I was looking for I could find them again.\n\nThe two red dot groups of gals I actually had to do some intense picture comparison to figure out who was who. My mind kept telling me to check again, it does not look right.\n\nThe blue dot dude,,, is just sad.

Would be kind of creepy if we walked around all the time just seeing slabs of skin in place of a face lol.\n\nCannot help you here man. Yiiiikes! You may just be very sensitive to chlorine and the eyes are a mucous membrane that absorbs stuff. Please get some swimming goggles! Protect your eyes, you only get one pair :) Brains fill in the blanks.\n\nMy hypothesis:  \n\nFirst off, inability to see facial features is not facial blindness. Inability to recall facial features, even after glancing away briefly, is facial blindness.\n\nI got through 40+ years of my life without ever knowing about prosopagnosia and I never knew I had a problem. I did know that I could identify people at a much greater distance than anyone else, but I secretly chalked that up to being smart. The fact that I could not follow characters in movies..... I chalked up to being inattentive.\n\nNow I know that I relied upon different ways to identify people than the general population. Most people identify people based upon facial features, I identified people based upon their general style of dress, body shape, or the way they walk, thus I could identify people long before I could see their face.\n\nI hypothesize that you identify people based upon their fashion style, and your brain fills in facial features. In a pool, where everyone is wearing bathing suits and fashion clues are limited, your brain is not identifying people.\n\nCan you follow the characters in Game of Thrones? If so, facial blindness may not be the issue. Glad you brought up GOT. That show was a nightmare to watch with face blindness. That Is not face blindness, that is just regular blindness.  Maybe get some goggles?? I do not know what is going on with OP's scenario but I once participated in a face blindness research study and the researcher was telling me that some people with face blindness literally cannot piece together a face, like it looks like it is melting to them because their brains just cannot compute it, so it does happen! I had to rewatch it multiple times in order to recognise the characters I have read abut the \"faces melting\" thing, but I think it may be more common in acquired faces? I once read that acquired cases are more severe than developmental ones\u2014is that true? I have read this somewhere on here I cannot remember.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith faces, I have noticed that the more I look at faces and just generally bother with them, I get super dizzy, nauseous, etc. I do not know how prevalent is this amongst the face, but I have also seen that whenever I look at a face, it has this weird incoherent feeling I see\u2014they are not literally melting in front of me, but it feels like every feature of them is \"forced\" into that mold on their face: a bunch of facial features on a slab of skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan you link me the \"faces melting away\" thing? It is super interesting to me. I think you are just getting blurry eyesight from having water in your eyes dude. Do not worry about it, it is definitely not face blindness. It sound like you are seeing what those of us with astigmatisms see. It is not like the whole world is fuzzy. It is just that when I look at faces directly it looks like their skin has closed in on them or like everything was fused together smoothly. What would you call it if their faces look fused together or like a layer of skin has grown in front of their eyes, nose, and mouth? Well my eyes just seem to fuse them together kind of like what you would expect slender man to look like. Except without the paleness and tallness. Also with cheek/eyebrow bones and hair. Well I do not know what that is but I am pretty sure it is not faceblindness... Best of luck to you in getting a diagnosis I sometimes have this too, but because I do not wear my glasses when going swimming", "Faceblind thoughts \"I cannot tell the difference between these asian women, they are all skinny with short hair... am I racist?\n\n\"Wait, I cannot tell the difference between any of these white women either, they are all skinny with medium blond hair... and I cannot tell these lumberjacky hipster men apart... nor these black women except this one has cool dreds...

Argh, I got to keep my mouth shut more.\" You are not racist, you are just face blind. I have the same experience. Cannot tell white people apart either if their hair is too similar. I have this same inner monologue all the time because if two people have similar skin tones+hair colors I really struggle to tell the difference. But I feel a bit better knowing that I (a white person) can never tell white people apart if they have the same hair color so I tell myself it is not racist if it applies to everyone lol. \n\nI gave up on attempting the watch the Bachelor/Bachelorette because every season is a dozen plus white people who I cannot for the life of me tell apart\n\n(Edit: spelling) &gt;Cannot tell white people apart either if their hair is too similar.\n\nRight?  For me, it helps if they dye their hair, the roots that show are indicative.  \"You are the one who never keeps up on touchups... Dana, that is your name!\" When I was little my mom told me it was racist to say I could not tell anyone apart in Westside Story. She did not understand I actually meant that I could not tell who were Sharks and who were Jets. I live in an extremely white area and let me tell you I know maybe 40 people out of my 300 person year group reliably, and 3 of those are the 3 black kids in my school Man you have poured my soul onto this text Im Caucasian. I had a Korean friend and we would drive around and she would point out Japanese and Chinese people and how their face is different from her face and basically scream at me when I did not get it. I did not know I was face blind then and I would try so hard and feel really bad. She did point out though that Japanese is more angular and Chinese is more round so sometimes I can get that but anyway I feel your pain. Even now that I know I am face blind it is Awkward at best I do not want to make people feel bad. I cannot even tell people the same ethnicity as me apart! In fact, when on group video calls, I mix my own face up with people of the same ethnicity.\n\nAnd just a few weeks ago, I got two men (latino; white) mixed up cause they both have very curly hair and similar skin tone (tanned). One of them has shoulder-length hair and the other has short hair. And then the former cut his hair. \n\np.s., I have never been officially diagnosed with prosopagnosia.

Like, they had a sketch artist waiting for me to describe this person's face. It is such an unlikely scenario, but I thought about it a lot \ud83d\ude02 anyone else? Funnily enough, I encountered a burger in my home and had to go sit with a sketch artist.  Then when they arrested the guy, they gave me a page of about 9 potential people.  I was completely unable to identify him, and I am sure my picture was garbage.  This was before I realized I was face blind, so it made so much more sense when I found out. I have joked about this a lot, how helpful I would be. \"He had two eyes... I am *pretty* sure. His nose was... normal. Regular chin. I dont know, he was just a guy. I mean, probably.

Like, how in the frick frack can someone describe a face well enough that someone can draw it? What do you even *say*?? Omg I get so worried about that!!! I have actually practiced a lot at like, not seeing faces as faces, you know? I studied art and would practice noses and eyes and cheeks and things separately. Now I look at people and almost hone in on one thing about their face. It is one thing, but it is better than my previous nothing!!!! My French teacher did this as an exercise. She walked to the back of the class and made us draw her face and describe her look in French, as if we were the last people to have seen her alive. The moment she was out of sight and I could not remember what her face looked like despite having seen it for 4 years was disturbing.", "Also out of curiosity, are you self-diagnosed? \n\n( Haha my psychiatrist had not even *heard* of Prosopagnosia--I was the one who told him about it. But he was really interested! And it is like... very obvious, in my case, so self-diagnosing was easy. I feel like its a pretty straightforward diagnosis. Grabing random strangers hand in public as a kid. Walking into mirrors. Not knowing who the heck anyone is. Yep that is faceblind Yeah. I heard someone say that people should not say that they are face blind without being diagnosed, but I thought that was kind of strange since it is not easy for everyone to see a mental professional (especially one who has experience in prosopagnosia) and it is pretty obviously there for the people who have it, so I thought I would see what the demographics were like here in terms of self-/non-self-diagnosed. i personally do not see a point in getting a diagnosis. it is not like there is any kind of cure or treatment, and it does not affect me enough that i could call myself disabled because if it. it is just a thing about me that is annoying at it is worst and a neat fact at it is best. To my knowledge, there is not a formal diagnostic measure for prosopagnosia. The only times I have heard of people being formally diagnosed is when they have acquired prosopagnosia. well there is different levels some people got serious like above commentor said and some got low level like can handle things with height and width data, their choice of clothing or voice etc Do not be silly. Only doctors are qualified to make that diagnosis according to the rules our misguided moderators have established for this forum.\n\nEdit: Speaking of rules, was this poll preapproved? Cannot have people who merely have questions post a poll. All polls have to be preapproved, clearly stating your research goals to qualify for inclusion in this prestigious forum. My mother always said I had it and I was in denial forever; have not had an official diagnosis, unless these majorly anxiety inducing test with the faces with no hair, lashes or eyebrows that are on the internet count ... Do not forget that people cannot ask whether or not we think they have prosopagnosia even though this is possibly the only (active) Internet forum for people with prosopagnosia and therefore one of if not the only place they can ask that question that does not require a (potentially expensive) trip to the doctor (who may not know it exists) and then another (potentially expensive) trip to a psychologist only to get an evaluation of sometimes questionable validity depending on whether they use a test or a questionnaire, which test they use, and what type of prosopagnosia you have only to get a fairy pointless official diagnosis for a condition with no remedy (note: situation is exaggerated and probably would not happen, more likely result is just that the person would decide yes/no without asking)\n\n(Although I am pretty sure it says \u201csurvey\u201d or \u201cresearch request,\u201d so I am probably safe. It is not like I am researching anything for any kind of organization.) I knew for years before I got a diagnosis, but I do technically have one The psychiatrist that diagnosed my autism did not even know what prosopagnosia is when I was listing all my symptoms. I was diagnosed with mild prosopagnosia when I was 8 or 9. For me the prosopagnosia is from a series of mini-strokes.", "I thought these were two different people at first.  I used to really struggle every time my boyfriend shaved because he was suddenly a different person. He does not grow a beard anymore.", "Any tips for how to keep up with movies and TV shows and the different characters? One of my big problems is watching movies and TV shows and figuring out who the characters are. Like if I see someone in one scene, and then another scene five minutes later, working out visually that they are the same person. It makes following plots a whole lot trickier!\n\nOne thing I have found helpful is that if I am watching on Amazon, they have this 'X-Ray' feature for a lot of shows where you can bring up the names of people who are on the screen. And sometimes subtitles have clues, but usually not.\n\nAny advice on this? I usually keep up OK by focusing on hair and costumes, provided the costume designer has kindly kept them distinct.   But when that fails,  my favorite trick is the Descriptive Audio track.   Much more frequently available these days, (at least on  DVD, Netflix, etc), and the narrator tells you exactly who is doing what.   Very handy!    \nFirst figured this out with Haunting of Hill House, when I could not tell which lovely brunette was which.  Worked great! Shows I watch they change clothes a lot. I can sometimes recognize voices. Otherwise it is the standard tricks I use, trying to put distinctive features into words and then looking for those distinctive features via words. Sometimes works.\n\nNever considered the audio track for the visually impaired. Do you still hear all the dialogue? Yeah, the narration just fills in gaps.   They are generally very careful not to speak over dialog. Sometimes subtitles change colour (iPlayer) or have the name of their person speaking (some Netflix), this has helped me keep track but mostly I have given up watching live action stuff. My solution when with my bf or someone I trust is to ask if we can pause and I will ask them to answer questions about the actors. I am also aspie/autistic so sometimes I am just not sure of the social nuance in a scene. \n\nAn example is I watched half of Twelve Monkeys last night and I had trouble recognizing Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis in short flashback scenes or photos where there is no dialogue. I think I recognize their mannerisms and voice mostly. At one point even being told a guy with long hair was Brad Pitt in the past really was unbelievable. \n\nWhen I watch shows alone I look for episode recap blogs that have screenshots of that episode alone. So there is no spoilers but I can look through scenes and work out anything confusing. Two words: ra dio\n\nI have not watched TV in years. Even if you find the secret formula I am not sure I can go back. I watch things with distinct characters.  Costumes, ways of moving, mannerisms, facial expressions, sayings, etc. are more consistent in characters than in real life.\n\nI watch things with repeating characters and a small cast.  (So TV shows without a lot of important extras that only show up in one episode rather than a movie with a million important characters.  In other words, the TV show Friends = good, the movie Oceans 11 = bad)\n\nI watch things with my husband and make him tell me who people are.\n\nI just figure out by context, and sometimes do not know what is going on for awhile.  I rewatch things though and can sometimes follow it better when watching it again a few years later.\n\nI listen to TV and half watch while doing something else, which makes me more aware of voices and distinct characters than if I am looking at their faces. I am having the same problem with Haunting of Hill House! I worry the descriptive audio track might get annoying for me, but I might give it a try. The closed captions sometimes say what character is speaking, which is helpful too.", "Hi ladies, no palease start every sentence you say with your name.

It is a struggle. I feel like I am talking with a celebrity.  Can I have your autograph?

It was a bit of a cliffhanger to give someone with prosopagnosia the information that most people that see a face recognize it in one-seventh of a second, then ask the question \"How do you do it?\"\n\nThat next page gave just enough context to provide the assumption that facial recognition is part of that \"top-down processing\" whereas when those with prosopagnosia see a face, it stops at \"bottom-up processing\" and there is no top-down process that recognizes the face.\n\nAnyhow, thank you for sharing the discovery!  It is always fun when something gets called out in a textbook and you sit back and say to yourself, \"That is me!\" no problem! tbh i had not even seen there was a second page, my next class was starting just after i posted this. i cannot wait to start this unit in class just so i learn more about all this.

I am a science fiction writer (you can read one of my previously published stories ( and I have written a story involving characters with prosopagnosia. One person with prosopagnosia has read an earlier draft and given me some extremely useful feedback, but I want to get other perspectives before submitting this to a publisher. If you have prosopagnosia, and you like reading science fiction, and you would be willing to look this piece over, I would be very grateful.\n\nThe story is called \u201cSomething You Know, Something You Have, Something You Are.\u201d It is about 4,300 words (22 double-spaced pages) long, and these are the opening paragraphs:\n\n&gt;Fifteen minutes after the end-of-school bell, Izzy Miura was sitting in Alan Russell\u2019s seat, trying to act natural. He wore Alan\u2019s orange tie-dye baseball shirt, Alan\u2019s black pants, and Alan\u2019s light-up sneakers. Two tables away, Alan sat, wearing Izzy\u2019s baggy red windbreaker, fidgeting with Izzy\u2019s Temple Chazon NFTY hat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When Alan got up, they made eye contact, and Izzy let himself nod. Alan twirled the hat on one finger, in a very Izzy-like gesture. When he reached the door of the fourth-grade classroom, he spun on his heel. \u201cBye, Mrs. Vygotsky,\u201d he called.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A multicolored ruler was painted on the doorjamb. According to it, Alan was 140 centimeters tall.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The tattoo down their teacher\u2019s left cheek was a column of red, yellow, and green apples. The green apples rolled as she smiled at Alan. \u201cBye, Izzy,\u201d she said. She tapped on her tablet computer, marking Izzy Miura as gone for the day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So far, the mission was proceeding according to plan. Sure.  I give no promises on timelines for feedback though.  PM me. Hey I would like to check it out. DM me This is under the assumption that the teacher is the one with Proso.\n\nThe voices of the kids would have to be pretty similar. I can usually tell who someone is once they speak, if I was expecting it. If I was expecting my sister's voice and it was my cousins, I would be confused. \n\nAlso, you might want to consider the other students' reactions. If the other kids act confused or are giggling, that is a sign something is up and would make the teacher suspicious. \n\n(I tried a switcheroo with one of my friends that I thought looked exactly like me, but I was the one with proso, and not my teacher. It did not work.)", "Drawing faces Does anyone else suck at drawing faces? Even by reference? Could that be a proso thing or do I just suck at drawing lol. I do understand now why I could never draw faces from memory but is drawing from a reference also related to that? It does make it easier when it is just step by step and I only have to draw the lines without seeing the big picture. I can draw a face, but I cannot draw a specific face. It cannot have specific characteristics. It has to be freely done... Sometimes the characteristics do not match each other at all too and that is a struggle. \n\nI definitely think it is a thing. \n\nIdk about the step by step/with a reference though. Yes! That is also the step by step thing for me...circle...lines...circles for the eyes etc, it is not a specific face and just lines The only face I am good at drawing is mine, because I have drawn it a lot. I also have learned to break it down into smaller shapes and draw those individual shapes, and I have learned to recognize specific images of myself that I have drawn. \n\nIn the wild though, I still get confused by images of myself that I am unfamiliar with. Yes exactly! The smaller shapes! And same hahaha, I get confused when I dye my hair lol I have scared myself so badly with my own reflection after dying my hair lol. Same hahahaha In school, once we had to draw a portrait of the person that sat vis-a-vis.  In the end, the girl I had to draw basically looked like a female version of me. :D \n\nWorth noting, many drawings of my classmates looked subpar, too.\n\n  \nSeemingly I had a basic idea of my face, but could not properly process the face of the girl I sat across *for months*. Ahhh that sounds so relatable I just draw anime. Have not done a realistic face in years. This is how I discover I had prosopagnosia. I was in the second year of my Fine Arts degree and I was attempting to draw a portrait of a loved one. I drew it from memory, they were sitting on a couch, I got their clothing, hair and body language perfectly... But when I went to draw their face... I had no idea what they looked like... It was a really strange feeling. I am a part time artist and half the commissions I get are for faces. My customers have always been satisfied with their ressemblance. Of course, I use reference photos as well as knowledge of the structure of the face.\n\nI would not, however, be able to realistically draw someone from memory. Then again, I would not be able to draw most things realistically without references, for example, my car or my home.\n\nI think that prosopagnosia and the ability to draw faces are two separate things. Once I finish a portrait, regardless how realistic it is, I would not be able to recognise that person in real life.\n\nIf you want to draw faces, go for it. Do not let prosopagnosia stop you. Enjoy the process even if you are not satisfied with the result. It is amazing to look back at old drawings and realise just how much you have improved. I do not draw \"faces\". I draw the eyes (one at a time), then a nose, then a mouth, all of them separate. \n\nIf you got 2 out of these 4 right, no one will notice! I have always been an artist, and I am actually good at drawing faces. However, I absolutely cannot do it without a reference. I cannot \"make up\" fatures for characters, because I cannot picture anything (although probably a bit of overlap with my aphantasia there-an inability to picture things in the mind). I have always wanted to draw cartoon characters for comic strip ideas that pop into my head, but I absolutely cannot figure out how. Cartoons are so successful because of facial features and expressions, and I just cannot manage to figure it out.\n\nThat is probably why I like drawing anime so much and do not really stray from that style, once you learn a basic anime face, you can draw a million different anime characters and it people accept it without question. If you draw anime, all you *really* need to able to do is draw different hairstyles and outfits. That I can do.\n\nIt is sad, but even though with a reference, I can draw portraits of people that are hyper-realistic, without a reference, I can either draw incredibly detailed anime characters or...stick figures. Me too. I have always had trouble drawing/visualizing faces while it is the first thing my peers would learn how to draw...", "Cinderella I am sure many people have thought this before, but I just realized Cinderella's Prince Charming clearly has prosopagnosia.  Although this does not explain about her feet.  Any other well known characters with facial recognition issues? Lois Lane? Anyone involved with a Silver Age superhero who wears a tiny little mask? There is a character in Zero Escape: Nine persons, Nine hours, Nine doors (999 for short) that has it. And it is not a fan theory, it is a important plot point that he has it.

Are you also going to threaten to make me have to use the bathroom multiple times during the day?\"  But the drill sounds scary. That is the first thing I said when I learned I had prosopagnosia! I also had an ex that looked like Superman (or Clark Kent most of the time because he wore glasses). I found the difference in his face without glasses so disconcerting that I rarely opened my eyes during sex. \ud83d\ude02 You mean all of metropolis.

I do not know if this is a good way to help this problem. Could you guys help me out with answering this question?  Can display glasses with face recognition help people with prosopagnosia live more social life ? I have always thought that would be a great idea for us, although it would be tough to convince the rest of humanity to not find it creepy. I have emailed smart glasses manufacturers before who are developing face recognition for the glasses, but they said it is mainly for law enforcement purposes (which I find creepy). \n\nPlease keep us updated if you decide to do it. I would love to try it, I think it would be extremely helpful. Such things exist. The problem is you get people getting angry that you are 'filming' them, and they try to punch you in the face. Thank you for your reply Plus there is the privacy issue... either you are using a public database, which means people expect each other to be on it, or you are using your own personal database, and all kinds of corporations and government agencies will try to access it without your consent. Or simply tell you to hand it over. let us ignore the privacy issue for a while. I am curious whether this device is actually useful for people with face blindness. Do you recommend any articles and papers describing the usefulness of this device ? Specific ones, no. There are some VR demos floating around somewhere. Thanks I will check it out I have thought about this before, the big problem for me, aside from the privacy issues, is that where are you going to get the facial database? I guess for friends and family you can just scan it on device but maybe Facebook has an API for their facial recognition? Considering that so many people use Facebook for that. For now I am only using friends and family. You must be too young to remember Google Glass.  The people who wore them were called glassholes and banned from as many private spaces as possible -- here in Tech Nirvana San Francisco, all singly-owned bars and restaurants in Bro Central BANNED THEM.  This was because fights continuously erupted around glassholes.  Many people would not let them in their homes... I certainly would not. \n\nIt was INCREDIBLY invasive.  I followed their development, and it was creepy as fuck.  It is permanently tainted (no pun intended) Heads Up Displays in public forever.  You can try to develop it -- ignoring legal and social ramifications -- but do a little research and check with your advisor first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n( \n\n( &lt;&lt; read the last few paragraphs of this -- you could use an old Google Glass pair and just whip up the software for it (if it does not already exist, check the subreddit), but damn that is a hell of a security flaw! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might be interested in Rich DeVaul.  IIRC he is already developed what you are talking about. \n\n(\n\n ( \n\n&gt;(  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Rich DeVaul, now at Google, experimented with  flashing subliminal messages on a glasses-based display to remind  wearers about shopping items, their next meetings, or the name of  someone standing before them. (DeVaul optimistically predicted that his  \u201cmemory glasses\u201d would be on the market by 2005, and sell for $300.) Thank you for the article. It really means a lot. For the most severe cases this could be useful, but I think most of us do okay with the people that we would consider our friends and family. It is not like I sit down at the breakfast and am not sure if I am eating with my dad or my sister. Also, close friends and family know about my problem and are understanding. \n\nFor me, the real problem is all the tertiary relationships. You see a guy at the grocery store that you talked to for 20 minutes at your friend's barbecue 4 months ago. A woman that works in HR that you talk to once or twice a month is at your son's soccer game. I would not recognize these people but they would expect me to recognize them. In order for this to be useful the database cannot be limited to close relationships. \n\nHonestly, I probably would not use this product even if it were free. I would have to have it on for a lot of hours for it to occasionally provide value. The only way I could see this being valuable to a person with my degree of prosopagnosia is if I had a high visibility job in a large organization where I frequently had spontaneous interactions with people from a pool of 100 to 500 people. Less than that and I could probably get by unaided based on clothing context and other physical attributes. More than that and it would not be worth putting people in the database because I might not ever see them again. thank you for the reply \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a I will keep that in mind. Thank you for your reply \ud83d\ude0a. I will update you if I comeup with something but I do not think I can finish the prototyping anytime soon because of the\n Corona virus. I had this idea in my engineering white paper a few years before Google glass came out Other people covered legal privacy issues and what already has been created pretty well, so I will not address that.  But privacy issues are real.  And some of the things I list below are NOT legal.  Other than that:\n\n* I would need a way for it to input data in real time.  I can think of two ways, probably connected to my smartphone, and ideally the glasses would allow for both.  \n\n1. I push a button to record.  (Recording voices runs into legal issues, so maybe only allowing a short time to be recorded.)  While looking at a person, I say, \"Hi Bob.\"  Later, I can go through new images (probably on my Smartphone) and update info, so connected with Bob's face would be, \"Bob - church - motorcycle\" or something to know who he was.\n\n2. I directly type the info on my Smartphone which is hooked with the glasses.  Sometimes this would not be appropriate, and I am not going to know who the person is later, hence the recording option.\n\n*Retrieval of data needs to be an issue.  I see several ways to go about this two, and again ideally, the user could choose.\n\n1. It indicates (maybe with a small light in the corner of my field of vision) when I am looking at a familiar person.  Maybe it indicates HOW familiar they are, by color code, like how often do I see this person and have I saved data.  It would be nice if I recognized the grocery clerk, but I do not need a name there.  Then I could push something if I needed more info.\n\n2. I have a little ear bud that looks like a hearing aid.  It says that data I saved (Bob-church-motorcycle) when I look at someone.\n\n*Although these would certainly be helpful, but there are some logistical issues beyond legal/privacy concerns.\n\n1. How would this affect the current coping strategies I have in place?  I imagine this would not always work unless I got a full view of their face, and I suspect if I rely on this, I would use my other strategies less, meaning I do not recognize people as well from a distance or a side view.\n\n2. Can these be used with prescription glasses, because I imagine some people would need both?\n\n3. How do others react to me when I use this?  How obvious is it that I am using this device?  This is the big one, beyond legal issues.  People sometimes treat people with devices to assist with a disability differently.  Now, prosopagnosia is not well known, so it is already a \"weird\" thing and people tend not to understand, but even if it became as socially accepted as using a cane if you were blind, it would affect how people socialize if they knew.\n\nCurrently, the coping mechanisms I have make it so I can socialize normally on the surface.  I know that it is hard for me to make friends (cannot be friends with someone until I know who they are,) I am anxious when I would not be otherwise, and I am playing games to remember people, but people are not picking that up.  If I was using something that was right there in their face recording them and telling me who they are, I think that would drastically change how people treated me.  If it was not noticeable (and legal) it would be helpful. This is awesome.  I realize a lot of people are bringing up privacy, but our privacy is already gone.  Google knows every place I have been for at least the last few years, and cameras are EVERYWHERE now. Keep on going with this, it is an amazing idea! did you make it ? Thank you for you reply. I will keep all of these in mind while designing the prototype. I need to answer one more thing on my paper. If like you said the device was not noticeable and legal to use , would this device help people with prosopagnosia live more social life. I cannot seem to answer this question without some survey data or paper backing it up. Do you happen know any survey conducted done in this topic ? Thank you. True but I still need to figure out ways to use this device without violating privacy laws\ud83d\ude35 Maybe.  I have a dashcam which turns on every time I start my car.  AFAIK, I do not need to paint a big sign on my car warning people.  Our police are starting to wear body cams.  They are not spending all of their time announcing it to people that might get on the video, they are just continuing to do their jobs.  A large number of businesses have outside cameras that capture anyone walking by on the sidewalk (public property), but they are not warning anyone.  Many people have Ring doorbells here - they start to record every time there is any motion in front of them - people walking by, cars driving by, birds landing close to the camera.  No warnings in front of those houses.\n\nMaybe you live in a place with strong privacy laws (like Europe).  The US seems to have gone from being the champion of privacy and freedom to just not giving a fuck anymore.  I cannot tell where you are from - I am in Canada, we are more like the US than Europe, but we at least have a little bit of privacy laws.  IANAL. I live in Japan. The privacy laws are pretty strict here. I really doubt that there is, because the only way to know would be to actually try it.  Theoretically, it would probably helpful.", "Seeking prosopagnosic participants for my final year undergraduate research project Hello, everyone!\n\nMy name is Noah Lorenz Shapiro; I am an undergraduate at Regent\\`s University London, doing my bachelor\u2019s thesis on individuals with prosopagnosia. The survey will take 15-20 \u00a0minutes to complete, and involves 2 short questionnaires plus some face recognition tasks. The survey has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee at my university. I would greatly appreciate if you could complete this survey. **Everyone is welcome to do it**. If you wish to participate, please click on the link below, which will take you to the survey:\n\n(\n\nPlease note the survey only works on a laptop or desktop computer; it will not work on smartphones.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me at my private email address:\n\n\n\nor at my university email address:\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nBest regards,\n\nNoah  Shapiro Is this just a copy of already existing tests ?  \nI already saw these questions; exact same formulation somewhere...  \n\nFeedbacks: Could use light in eyes to recognise some faces, and how faces are cut for others. But even so I totally failed on pixelated pictures.. But as there is no \"I do not know\" answer, I played random (I hope this not break your statistics, because I do not think that is valuable data)\n\nAlso, there are only mens. (And actually most of the tests I did shows only men faces). Is this because you know there will not be any particular difference, or is this for any other reason ? (I do not know, maybe I am better at recognising women faces)\n\nGood luck with your test ! Hope you will get lot of data (and send me back studies feedbacks, I have given my mail) Could you make it avaible for mobile? If its avaliable mobile you will have a lot more participants! Some were just guesses since I had no idea but a lot of them I could recognise from the expression or how much of a double chin was showing, for example. a lot of them were guesses and I could tell some from eye colour.

I am a regular at a little store in my town.\nI am a talker, so I naturally developed a friendly relationship with the guy who owns the place.\nWe talk alot, we always say hi, I always feel welcome when I enter his store.\nI always recognize him, never doubted who he was when I entered his store.\n\nBut one day, I was shopping for groceries at another store.\nAnother costumer greeted me and started talking to me.\nI am a *master* at pretending I know people, they never have a clue that I am panicking in my mind about who the hell I am even talking to.\n\"School? Maybe. Work? No, almost every single one of my colleagues are women.\" Went though my mind, I could not figure it out.\n\nI was trying to figure out who this man was all damn day, when suddenly it clicked.\n\n*It is the owner of the store I am a regular at*\n\nAs soon as I saw him out of the place where I usually meet him, I could not recognize him at all.\nHe is very tall, so I should be able to recognize him simply by that trait alone, but nope!\nMy faceblindness is mild, but this is something I never really thought about.\n\nThere are some people in my life that I strongly associate with places, seeing them outside that place makes it hard for me to recognize them.\nHave any of you experienced the same thing? This is my experience 90% of the time with my face blindness. \n\nIts *why* I am so good at pretending to know people. \n\nPeople from college courses? Yeah I know them in the class. But if they saw me outside of it and talked to me I never knew who they were. \n\nEven friends I often have to ask my boyfriend who someone is. \n\nThe longer I know someone/the more often I see them in other settings the better I am at telling who they are. The less diverse moments I see them, the less likely I will recognize them. \n\nI once had pretty close school friends(couple) go to a concert I went to and I saw them, acknowledged them as a very cute couple. It was not until they told me they were at the concert that I realized it was them I saw. \n\nI honestly believed I had \"change blindness\" before I knew I had face blindness because it was typically a different setting I could not recognize people in. That is exactly how I experience the world.  In most settings, there are a limited amount of people that someone can possible be.  So if there are 30 people at work and 5 are men, I only have to recognize which one of the 5 people a man I run into at work is.  I have probably met thousands of men in my life, so if I do not know the man is from work, that is a lot of options. Same thing happened to me just before the pandemic hit.  \n\nI was in line at a Subway to get lunch, and another customer walked in and we were chatting.  \nI had this \"I know you from somewhere\" feeling, that I could not place.  \nMy local friend group is really small and she was not one of them.  \nI work from home, and the only other person who works for the same company that is on the same island is in another city, and a different gender.  \nMaybe from that game store that closed a few years ago? No. Not that.  \nThen just as I was leaving with my food, it clicked.\n\nShe was the barber, that I have taken my son to for years, including just a couple of days before this encounter. Lol! This is exactly what I am talking about!\n\nI also get the \"I know you from somewhere\" feeling the majority of the time, I *KNOW* that I have met them before, but cannot for the life of me understand where and when I met this person. This is so relatable. I think for me, rather than just being a certain setting, it is the fact whether or not I *expect* to see them.\n\nWalking into work, I can always expect my coworkers faces. But if I were to run into them in a grocery store? Even the most standout people in my life, I will be standing there questioning for a while if it is actually them.\n\nIf I make plans to meet my friends somewhere in public, there is a little panic, but I can usually find them because I am specifically trying to. But for the love of everything, please do not blindside me with a surprise run-in at the store.\n\nI remember once I was at Wal-Mart with a friend, and we were talking about this guy from our friend group in  high school. Literally right then and there, that exact guy walks in the front door about 30 feet from us. Even though we were talking about him in that moment, I still was not *expecting* to see him, and therefore could not recognize him (luckily, being with someone else gives me a bit of a shield, so I always wait for them to react first).", "Is hyperfamiliarity for faces type of prosopagnosia Hi. After a couple of migraines last year, I now think that I know every face, name and number plate I see but cannot pin down where I know them from. Apparently this is a result of the two sides of my brain not communicating correctly and is called hyperfamiliarity for faces HFF. Do some of you with prosopagnosia have this issue or is this a completely different thing? Thank you. I over-recognize people as well as under-recognize people.  So like I sometimes do not know if I have met someone or not.  I think it is because I am identifying based off of features not a whole, and although a person's face as a composite is unique, features are not as unique. Also, was this a change after having a migraine?  If so, I would be concerned that it was more than that.  Hopefully you talked to a doctor. Well, everyone fits into a category of similar features that I have seen before. Sometimes I see the same face every where.\n\nI am good at recognizing familiar license plates. Ah you sound similar to me. When I see people I do not know if I have met them before or not. Yes I saw my optician and gp and after a 9 month wait I have a neurology appointment for May. I smile and nod at so many people, because I think I know them.\n\nIn actual fact, I only know seven people, so the odds are very low that I know 50 people at the grocery store. Oh wow it is really interesting to meet others with similar issues I smile at everyone too, just in case I know them! That is really interesting Well this is something for me to look up. \n\nProsopagnosia for me is sometimes: \u201cis this (complete stranger) a friend or celebrity?\u201d And sometimes \u201cwhy is this complete stranger waving at me? -*two hours later*- OH it was Sam who I have known 15 years\u201d I have no idea, but this sounds so incredibly annoying - I HATE when I see someone I recognize but cannot place them. For the most part it is like \u201cI have never seen this man in my life\u201d but when I do recognize someone I need to know what I recognize them from, immediately. I am the worst to watch movies with. Oh goodness, I have had so many problems thinking people are Billie Piper or Catherine Tate. It is hilarious to read your comment.", "Does prosopagnosia give anyone else anxiety? I am so happy about finding this subreddit, that I am in tears! I do not know anyone who has this problem. I just made a post on the Multiple Sclerosis subreddit asking how people with M.S. cope with Anxiety from Prosopagnosia symptoms. I am embarrassed and anxious being accused of sexual harassment for \"staring\" at female coworkers that I do not recognize and I do not know how to inform people about my disorder without sounding like I am just making excuses.  I frequently do not recognize people until after I have been speaking to them for a minute or more. I get people confused or I am SLOW to recognize them in general and I do not know how to cope with it. Can any of you guys comment, here in this thread and/or over in the Multiple Sclerosis subreddit?  Holy cow I am slow... I *just* realized why I have been having nightmares wherein I cannot see womens faces or their entire head is either an inhuman shape or \"out of frame\" in the dream. I wish I had some advice for you, but all I can say is you are not alone with feeling anxiety from prosopagnosia. I am constantly worried about ignoring someone in public who I should recognize and hurting their feelings. I wish we could keep wearing masks forever because it makes me feel like it might be less abnormal not to recognize someone at first. Thank you for responding. I like your positive take on mask wearing, maybe Im just a little depressed about things? Mask wearing makes it more difficult to convince people \u201cNo, my brain does not work right.\u201d Oh and on top of it all I have \u201cslowed Information processing speed\u201d from my brain lesions. I can look for a different visual cue but it takes awhile for it to register. I think the poor sense of direction is more stressful. I do not think I have that. Does that effect you when you are walking around or only when driving? Have you always had it? One symptom of prosopagnosia for a lot of people is a terrible sense of direction.  I get lost walking in my own neighborhood. Driving is the same.  I can read a map but cannot recognize places I have seen before. Oh wow that *sucks*! As far as I can tell I am mostly just slow or get people confused and forget them quickly. Yep, especially on family outings.  If I lose sight of my wife or kids for even a second, I am worried I will not find them again.  Which is stupid since everybody has a phone with a GPS in it and I can track their locations.  It does not stop the panic though. I get anxiety from proso as well. I find being more open about it has helped. However the years of misunderstanding and thinking it was some how my faults took its toll. You are not alone in feeling like this. Only advise I can give you is to reach out to others like you Lol I remember discussing this on a proso forum. So many of us with a broken compass. Also people with proso have some amazing artists as well. I have some symptoms of social anxiety, but only in very specific circumstances...basically situations when proso makes it hard for me not to be rude.  It did not make sense to me at all until I learned more about face blindness and figured out what was going on.  For example, I am extroverted and like being around people, but hate parties. Small information cards should be available, to explain to non believers, about this neurological condition.\n\nI will suggest this, in another post in this sub-Reddit.\n\nI have many neurological conditions, especially Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, created myself 1984, thirty seven years ago.  Luckily they Australian police forces now are trained to deal with the complaints made about this neurologically condition. Many others after not trained at all. Including the police, about prosopagnosia. I get anxious due to prosopagnosia as well, specifically about being perceived as stupid or racist due to misidentifying people. The plan my therapist and I came up with was to be more upfront about it, it is not shameful or embarrassing, it is just the way my brain works. Likening it to dyslexia helped a lot for me. I try to mention it early on to new people I meet (\"I am really bad with faces so I may not recognize you if I see you again\") and am more intentional about talking about it with friends too. Highly recommend discussing it with a therapist for help in navigating the anxiety. Going to a highschool with very restricted uniforms and required hairstyles made everyday  like an anxiety attack Oh wow that would *really* suck and I cannot imagine growing up with it.  How did you cope? I acquired it as an adult due to Multiple Sclerosis and I do not *always* experience it, I think it has to do with whether or not certain brain lesions are active.  I work in a hospital where every nurse wears scrubs and they all seem to TRY to look alike with the same hairstyles or by coloring their hair in similar colors. I *guess* that is normal behavior? I have had it ever since I can remember I suffered some pretty bad head trauma when I was about 5. I  use voices but I am also deaf in one ear caused by the head trauma so it was pretty hard. Now I just use favorite colors, clothing styles, accessories, hairstyles and tattoos. That is insane! So, I have head serious head trauma, too. Is that common for people with prosopagnosia? I think the head trauma was probably the cause of the Prosopagnosia. Please do not make yourself stressed because of this daft affliction, it is not \"your fault\" :) . And do not worry about things that have not happened and might never happen - the harrassment accusation idea - you are looking at their faces not their boobs! so I doubt this is going to transpire. (I actually think in my case that I do not re-recognise people because I do not spend enough time studynig their faces, possibly). the worst thing that can happen is that people think you are a bit odd - but my approach is just to tell people about it briefly so they are aware why (do not think I am being rude if I do not recognise you immediately, I have this thing where I cannot recognise faces). And to be jolly and polite until I figure out who I am talking to! (Often I never figure it out properly but what can I do... it is not worth stressing about because it is what it is).  I do not know about you but most people I come into contact with regularly I can recognise fine. So the issue is only a smallish percent of interactions. And there is no point in wasting energy stressing about the possibility of those happening, before they actually happen. Cope in the moment. Do not try to cope now with things that are not happening (that is just overwhelming).\n\nI hope that is not too straight-talking! I hear you saying \"I do not know how to cope with it\". I suppose I hope you can think about these (admittedly slightly embarrassing) situations from a different angle where they are what they are, and you do not have to wind yourself up about possibilities that have not happened yet. Maybe I embrace my weirdness and just have to hope other people do too (if they get upset, that is their own response that they are responsible for, because I am not doing it deliberately) - especially if I have explained the situation. The mask thing at the moment is making things worse for me! I can sometimes rely on hairstyles but when students have headscarves and masks I have zero hope really. Sometimes I cannot recognise people without their hats on either. It is a bit tragic but I have to laugh at myself at the end of the day.\n\ngood luck to you, look after yourself That is very interesting. I evidently did not go through anything as serious as you did. But I did smack my forehead very hard against a doorframe when I was 2, had to go to the hospital to be sewn up and I still have the scar decades later. It could not have done my brain much use at the very least. And I know I have had the problem since I was about 3 or 4 as I can recall incidents. It is making me wonder now! (My family claim prosopagnosia is not something they have themselves). I would not have thought of it if you had not said. \u201cI do not know how to inform people about my disorder\u201d - this is hard because it is rare. \n\nI have used a line like this before: \u2018It was so helpful for me when I got a formal diagnosis for my Autism.  The psychiatrist also identified two sub-clinical disorders.  One is Prosopagnosia, a condition that makes it hard for me to identify faces.\u2019\n\nMy formula for the line was\n1. Open with a better known condition (in my case Autism).  This gives the listener a first step - most people have heard of Autism.  \n2. Share a simple definition of prosopagnosia.  Most people have never heard of it, and there is no way to move towards understanding without a shared definition. The problem with proso is people might not know they have it; I think my older sister only caught on recently about her own issues because I started talking about it in regards to myself. (It was hilarious watching Iron Man 3 with her this week because she went, \"Wow, wait! I recognize that character from the last scene! Wait, and I recognize him in this next scene again! \\ It is almost like there is a cohesive narrative happening! Who would have thought!\" And we watched the movie because she said it was one of her favorite Marvel movies, so it is not like it was her first time seeing it. (Irrelevant aside: great movie, btw. If anyone's looking for something to rewatch or a film series to watch \\, I recommend it lol) )\n\nAfter a particularly bad case of face blindness -- I only recognized a classmate on the second day of class because of where she was sitting and because she was being friendly to me. Otherwise, she was an unrecognizable stranger -- I FINALLY went, \"Okay, something is not right here.\" That is even after trouble making friends after high school because I am almost never sure if I know a new person or not until I have met them multiple times. The classmate incident happened only a couple years ago, when I was 22 or 23.\n\nPoint being, it really took me some time to realize there was anything unusual about the situation, and I may have gone even longer if I had not read or heard about face blindness before, which I was probably exposed to several years before while I had a stint reading books on memory. Something that tends to work for me is saying, \"Sorry if I ignore you if I see you outside of \\. I am bad at recognizing faces. \\ Yes, it is actually a thing! Please do not be offended if that happens.\" Same for me! And if I see photos of streets that should be familiar to me I often do not recognize them Dunno whether to call that anxiety, but I can say I am 100% terrified whenever I am outside with people. I got to remember them by what they wear or distinct features like height or hair colors, otherwise I am going to mistake them for any stranger that looks bodily similar to them ;-; Heck, it is easier to recognize my family members by footsteps rather then their heads &lt;/3\n\nI had some awkward moments where I managed to lose my family or close friends in crowded (and not-so-crowded) areas, I once thought I found my little sister somewhere and brushed her ponytail with my hands just to realize it is some other girl because she was skinnier ._.\n\nLuckily groceries with my mom are much easier, she has a turquoise bag that is really easy to spot and the fear of losing her in the middle of the supermarket is not as bad XD It definitely makes me very uncomfortable, not necessarily anxious. It feels so unnerving being unable to do something everyone else takes for granted, it is as if you are the only one in the room who cannot read. I do find myself acting almost anxiously to make that feeling go away as quickly as possible.", "Research Opportunity! :) Hi everyone! I am a graduate student at Dartmouth College, and my lab focuses on better understanding prosopagnosia. My PI is named Brad Duchaine (he was one of the researchers on the 60 minutes special on prosopagnosia), and he recently won a large research grant to study the neurocognitive factors that contribute to face blindness. We are starting an online study and are working on recruiting people with prosopagnosia. If you are interested in learning more about it, please follow this link\u00a0( Also, even if you do not want to participate, feel free to read more about prosopagnosia and our research:\u00a0( If you have any questions, or would like more information just let me know (you can email me at  Thanks so much for your time, and I hope that everyone is doing well during these difficult covid times. I have participated in several surveys on this subject, and one thing that some researchers and questionnaires seem to commonly miss is to ask about the \u201ccrutches\u201d that some of us so commonly use to compensate for our lack of ability to recognize faces. Since I learned over a decade ago about prosopagnosia and came to the dawning realization that I likely had it, I have closely monitored for similarities in situations where I succeed and fail to recognize people.\n\n1) Context is a huge part of it, and in many social situations, I know the people who I can expect to see, so I am more likely to be able to pick them out from that much smaller list of people I know. Seeing a random person who I am supposed to know outside of the context where I usually see them is the single biggest challenge for me.\n\n2) Voice and accent is another huge crutch for me. I believe I am something of a \u201csuper-recognizer\u201d when it comes to voices because I know from discussing the subject with friends that I am clearly much better at hearing a higher level of detail in minor pronunciation differences or even specific inflections of a wide variety of phonemes. And it happens for me without even trying the way that other people can recognize faces without even trying.\n\n3) Strong or even slightly unusual hair, face or body features help considerably, especially when context alone is not enough.\n\n4) I can recognize a certain smaller subset of people just by the way they walk, subtle gestures only they use, or otherwise even the way they overall compose themselves around others. Now that you mention it, maybe I am slightly better at learning new languages and picking up on foreign pronunciations. I cannot recognize voices like some of us can, but I am more attuned to \"text\" and how someone talks especially in text. \n\nAnd I agree: context is a huge part of it. I cannot pick family members out of a crowd if they appear out of context, but I am decent at picking out most coworkers in the office if I can associate them to a name. Does it matter where you live to take part? Is there compensation and can you be more up front about risk? It might be helpful if you included a little more detail about what is expected and required to participate in the study.  (\"Participants will complete X tasks online.  It will take about X time.\")  You also might want to include more details about what your research goals are.  This is pretty open-ended and you might get more participants if you were more specific. There might be something to the language fluency being related to prosopagnosia. I have been a software engineer for much of my career, and I am one of the few I have ever known who knows every major programming language.\n\n Another interesting anecdote, I only took a few years of Spanish in high school. But a few years ago, I dated a Colombian girl who could barely speak any English, so I just spoke Spanish with her and, before I knew it, I was dreaming our conversations in Spanish. It was a very strange experience to start thinking in another language without hardly even trying.\n\nI also watch a TON of foreign films because I eventually can pick up most of the conversation without having to read the subtitles. Now you are making me think that foreign language comprehension could be correlated with prosopagnosia somehow. Very interesting. What will participation entail? Like how much time will it take and will we just need to access the website, or something else? ...I am going to guess that PI stands for Principal Investigator, rather than you having hired a detective. Thank you for giving all that information and bringing this point up! It is really valuable to hear what we might be missing/not asking enough about, and to know the strategies that assist you! It is interesting that you are really good at voices and movements specific to people - that is actually two of the domains that we are really interested in learning more about :) That is a good point. I will add a bit more information :) Hello! Luckily, because many of the tasks in the first part of the study are virtual, where you live does not restrict if you can participate! Feel free to contact us/ express your interest, even if you do not live closely to Dartmouth :) Hahaha whoops, sorry about not writing out the full name. Yes it does stand for Principle Investigator! Hi! I will comment a bit more information on my original post, but to answer you directly, yes you will be compensated for your time if you participate in the study! I do not have the exact amount yet, but I can give people that information once I have that specific amount. Thanks for asking about the risks! There are minimal risks to participating in this study, and if you end up participating, you may end your participation at any time you would like to stop. The initial part of the study will involve a series of online memory tasks, so we do not foresee many risks associated with this. In future parts of the study, some people will be asked if they would like to complete a fMRI scan, which also has very minimal risk. We make sure to conduct all of our studies as safely as possible at all times. It is a handful of short answers and a series of multiple choice questions that takes less than 15min. It also asks you if you will allow them contact you and how willing you are to do an in-person study. Great question! I will comment with more information on my original post, but to answer you directly, participation will primarily consist of completing online memory tasks. I am not sure about how much time it will take in total (we are still compiling the tasks), however before anyone agrees to participate, we will make a point to tell them how much time it will take and specific details about the tasks. The form on the webpage linked to my other post should only take between 7-10 minutes to fill out :) Hi! For clarification to some of the comments on this post, I just wanted to add some additional information about the study. You do not have to live near Dartmouth to participate, and people from all places are welcome to contact us with their interest/ fill out our online form! Additionally, you will be compensated for your time if you choose to participate in the study. This study will primarily consist of completing online memory tasks. While I do not currently know the specific amount of time it will take to complete the tasks (we are still developing some of the them), this information will be available to all people who are interested in participating once the tasks are finished being made. Overall, our goal is to learn more about different domains of memory (such as memory for voices). Thanks for all of the comments, and as always, feel free to reach out if you have more questions! Do you need to have an official diagnosis of prosopagnosia to participate? Or is it worth it for self-diagnosed people to fill out the form? Hi! I think that it is worth filling out the form even if you do not have an official diagnosis :) I have done this before.\n\nDid not really know what to put for the question which was like \u201cwould you be willing to go to one of our facilities?\u201d though since what actually matters is whether or not I could get permission to.\n\nEdit: Nevermind. I think that was a different survey thing. Hi, I think I filled out this form a month or two ago--do I need to fill it out again, or do you already have my information? Hello! If you have already filled out the form, we already have your information and you do not need to fill it out again. Thanks for asking :)", "Josh Davis: Researching super recognizers - Faceblind Podcast ", "Able to recognize cartoon / non photo realistic faces Hi !\n\nAfter a couple of years realizing I got prosopagnosia, I just realized last week that I can clearly identify non realistic 2D cartoon faces.\n\nI mean, I never give it a real thought because most cartoons are in 2D and I watch since I am a kid.\n\nIt sounds silly, but the turning point is when I started to watch \"Archer\" on Netflix, my condition strikes back, whereas cartoons like Simpsons, Rick and Morty and so on ... Well I am doing fine on thoses ones.\n\nSo I started googling \"photorealistic drawings\" and this hit me... All blured.\n\nDoes some of you can or cannot recognise cartoons or mangas, well basically drawn faces ?!\n\nI am curious if some of prosopagnosians cannot regognise ANY face even on cartoons or smth !\n\nCheers ! Cartoons are totally fine to me. The artists design the characters to look really different from each other OMG same! The only TV shows I can watch without assistance are highly stylized western cartoons like Gravity Falls or Rick &amp; Morty. I tried Archer and had to give up after a few episodes. Almost all anime is also an issue due to the characters looking too similar. Many \"kids\" shows these days are surprisingly good, but I am hungry for some adult content that does not revolve around alcohol and comedy! Funny, Archer was also my struggle. Most of the characters look totally different, but in the beginning Brett (guy always getting shot) would throw me off, and if there were recurring characters, I would not realize it until I started binging the show a little more. \n\nAnime style shows really throw me off. I tried to watch Jojo's bizarre adventure with my son, and every once in a while they make his hair a different color in a scene. But anytime characters look too similar it makes it impossible.", "I volunteer with the blind. Why did I do this to myself?? Back before I realised what prosopagnosia was and I still just thought I was an ignorant dumbass, I signed up to volunteer with a local vision charity. \n\nSounds fine, right? \nLiterally the worst choice ever. 95% of the people I end up interacting with are blind enough they cant recognise you by sight and are reliant on you finding them in whatever group they are in AND you telling them who you are and where you have met. \nIts terrible.\n\nNone of my coping strategies work, I cant turn up early and let them find me, I cant rely on anyone elses ability to tell people apart! \nI do a lot of volunteer driving and it is fine when I pick someone up from an address, but going back to the dance class/treasury meeting/lunch club afterwards and having to pick out one old blind lady from 40 others is an absolute nightmare. \n\nWhy did I ever choose this? I am in too deep now to back out though, its been 5 years and I am still useless!  Could have picked literally any other charity :P Have you discussed it with people? Made it clear that you are also operating with a sort of minor disability? Could you, for example, ask the people that you are volunteering with on any particular day to show up carrying a plastic fork or something since you cannot store visual information in your long-term memory? I have not,  i probably should but part of me feels like it is been too long now. Ridiculous i know \nI have mentioned it in newer groups but when I have already known these people (well, if i ever knew who any of them were) for years now it feels a bit too late. \n\nThe other volunteers are not too bad as they seem to all remember me (I am the youngest volunteer by about 30 years) but there is no real practical way to make it easier to pick out the right service users. I sometimes ask other volunteers but it doesnt always help and i do get a bit of \"really? Havent you been shopping with  since 2016?\" Oh my goodness!  I never thought about this.  I have only known one person that was blind well, and she was fairly distinctive looking.  I cannot even imagine. idk, I mean, it is still for all intents and purposes a kind of disability - I would expect people in that line of work would understand if you put it that way, and just explained that you did not bring it up because you were embarrassed and did not want them to think it was something personal! :) I only knew one beforehand and really it was no harder to find her than it was anyone else! \n\nNever really thought about it until recently, but wow I am really making life hard for myself lol", "im a total goober i was watching the sound of music with my family and i said Maria's actress sounded like Julia Andrews, Mary Poppins' actress. everyone started laughing and i found out why when I googled her :') Well, you were not wrong!! ;) Congratulations, you have good voice recognition! To be fair she looks really different between those two movies", "In honor of my discovery of this sub, I will share the story of how I watched an entire movie thinking Michael Sheen was Simon Pegg It is not a very exciting story. \n\nA couple years ago, my husband and I saw the movie Brad's Status at a movie theater. Now, I really like Simon Pegg, so he is one of the actors I can reliably recognize when I see him. When a certain character was introduced, I thought to myself, \"Oh cool! I did not know Simon Pegg was in this movie!\"\n\nAfterwards, my husband and I were chatting about what we thought of the movie (it was just okay), when I mentioned \"the guy played by Simon Pegg\". He was very confused. I described the character and was like, \"You did not realize that was Simon Pegg??\" The actor had a beard in the movie, so I thought maybe my husband did not recognize him.\n\nMy husband said, \"That was Michael Sheen.\" I was like \"Number 1, who is Michael Sheen? Number 2, it is 100% Simon Pegg.\" I adamantly maintained that I was right until we looked it up on IMDB.\n\nIt was Michael Sheen.", "This song is way to relatable ", "I have been initiated! I am struggling with this TV show I have never struggled with a show so much.  I have really only had issues with a movie, but they were twins.\n\nI am watching 3% and multiple times questioned how a girl was in certain places (avoiding spoilers).  It was three different girls.\n\nAnother scene I was thinking, \u201chuh, I never saw these people.\u201d  Well, the one I had not, the other I had because it was their flashback. Flashbacks are the worst! So hard to know if I have seen the characters before. I remember watching a series where the main character's dead wife, the woman he was cheating on her with, and the woman he later married, all looked EXACTLY the same to me. I definitely feel your pain on that one. Flash back I think had the same actor, my brain just erased them real quick.\n\nThough another movie had a guy in a picture with brown hair (married to) and the guy with white hair (cheating on).\n\nI was wondering, \u201care these the same people, just different ages?\u201d\n\nIt was definitely foreshadowing, but I had to question everything, lol.", "Do I have mild prosopagnosia? Hi, I am not sure I have prosopagnosia or not but if so, it might be mild. \nI have no trouble recognizing my family and close friends. But for people I am not close to and have not seen for so long, I cannot really remember them.\n\n\nSome of the scenarios:\n- This happened just now where I was talking to a teacher who I believed to be Miss A, for example, because a friend told me Miss A was there. Then the person I was talking to was also female with similar facial features like eyes. Cannot see her full face because she wore a mask and cannot recognize her from hair because she was wearing veil or hijab. Turns out I recognized her wrong (there are some other teachers with similar style/who were wearing hijab) and had no idea who she was and got into trouble because of it. I have been going to this school for so long and saw them before, but it is been a few years for some teachers and a few months for the other teachers so I honestly cannot tell. \n\n\n- I saw another teacher I seem to know but I cannot remember his name although I knew that I had ever talked to him and was supposed to know who he was. I think I worked some assignments with him before covid. I used to remember who he was. Now I have no idea. I can guess but I am really not sure. \n\n\n- I need to google a teacher's name several times because I am not sure if the person I am going to see is really them or another person. \n\n\n- A few friends who I just saw several times then met me and greeted me. I honestly have no idea I even know them and some even asked \"You must not remember who I am??\" after seeing me looking at them with a questioning gaze. This has happened all my life that I just nervously tried to laugh it off as \"I am bad at remembering names\". \n\n\nThe thing is, I can picture some people's faces well. People who I am or I was close with, for example.\nBut it frustrates me that the scenarios above happened. The last straw was about how I failed to recognize who the teacher I was talking to was, and got in a trouble because of it, getting scolded by another teacher due to my giving the wrong name of a teacher. I am such an embarrassment and I need to know what is wrong with me... \n\n\nMy friends seem to be able to recognize the teachers... they do not simply forget after not seeing them for a while, and they seem to be able to recognize them even with masks on... \n\n\nIf you think I do not fit in the category of mild prosopagnosia, then do you have any advice on how I can remember people and recognize them? \n\n\nIf I fit in the category, may I know how you guys can get the proper diagnosis of prosopagnosia? I never heard anyone getting tested or going to a doctor for prosopagnosia in where I live... Sounds like my experience. I am also pretty mild and recognize family, but people I do not see regularly or people who I do see fairly often but who have similar styles  (bald guys are the bane of my existence), not a chance. Thank you for telling me I am not the only one... And yes, that is exactly what I am experiencing...\nDid you get diagnosed or tested for prosopagnosia? No never, except for by my mother who has it too... She is a psychologist, but parents diagnosing their children is a bit iffy... Yep, this is my exact experience Any advice on how to remember/recognize people?  Here is my take -- my situation was the opposite of yours.  I was the teacher trying to remember my approximately 100+ new students every year.  The hardest for me were the white girls with brown hair.  It took me MONTHS to correctly match names with faces.  And I have a terrific memory.  Before I even met these students, you could fire names at me and I could tell you exactly what their state exam scores were from the year before, their former teachers, their addresses, their disciplinary records -- but I could NOT remember their faces.  Here is how I coped:  basically, I kept them in strict, alphabetized seating charts until I memorized their clothes.  I mean, I did not realize at the time that that was what I was doing (did not know about this affliction until my last year of teaching), but I did it.  In addition to their position in my room on my map (seating chart) and their clothing, I also added other reference points, such as unique voices and friend combinations (ex. the brown-haired girl who talks to the blonde is Hannah like banana).  It was very, very hard, especially since you crush a middle school student's psyche when you have been working with them for a month, trying to make them feel special and seen, and then call them by the wrong name.  In June, after school let out and I went to the beach for a week, I lost about 97% of that year's face memory, but I could still tell you every single thing about damn near every thing they did that year.  It sucks.  Long story short - memorize your teachers' outfits and only call them by name when you are in their specific classrooms or offices. Sounds like it to me. And I would also consider if it truly is a mild case, or if you just learn to recognize features other than the face when you have known somebody long enough. It is unfortunate you got in trouble for not recognising Miss A.  It looks like you have put some time into trying to make sense of how this happened. Thanks for sharing, and try to take it easy on yourself.  \n\nIf I spend a enough time with someone or meet them frequently, I eventually recognise them.  It becomes embedded, like a built in memory. I have not figured out how.  Likewise, if I do not spend much time with someone or I do not interact frequently, I do not recognise them.  The mechanism by which this happens is invisible to me.\n\nThinking out of the box: ask Miss A if you can share something personal with her.  Tell her what happened, and how you are not sure whether you have prosopagnosia \u26a1\ufe0f It is very similar with me. I will easily recognize people that I am close to (especially if I talk to them regularly) without any issues. But the co-workers I see everyday but never talk to are always a challenge even after many months. I will often not recognize people I have only met 3-4 times. I will *never* remember if I introduced myself to someone or not. I will *never* remember if I have met a person before if I have only met them once or twice.\n\nI have coping strategies. I know who to *expect* in a particular place which makes it easier to recognize people. But if someone unexpectedly shows up, or I meet them out of context (at the supermarket) then often I will not recognize them at all.\n\nSometimes I mix up two similar looking people, to the point where if I rarely see them together, I might think they are one person until I see them both side by side.\n\nSometimes I will be certain I recognize someone only for it to later turn out that we have never met.\n\nI am very bad with names. I may recognize someone without any issues but even after a year I might not know their name if we are not super close. I try to make a list of people's names on my phone but this only works if I also have photos to go with it. It does not help that most people share a name with someone else in the same place.\n\nIf I meet many (a dozen or so) new people at once (new job, new school), I will forget every single one of them and will be completely unable to figure out who is who for a very long time.\n\nThis causes me to avoid conversations with people unless they are one of the few that I am 100% sure I recognize, in order to avoid saying or asking something that would reveal that I do not recognize them or that I mistook them for someone else. I see, thanks for answering! How do I know/start considering it? Thank you. It helps to know now, although I am not sure what I can do with this new knowledge... Just out of curiosity do you consider yourself an introvert? I might make a separate thread about this. Thank you for sharing!\n\nSounds like the same with me. After some time not interacting or seeing some people, I lost the ability to recognize them... \n\nIn the case that I mentioned above, unfortunately in my university setting as of now, most teachers are wearing similar clothes (protective uniforms) and masks... And I thought I was sure because a friend of mine said they saw this teacher here some time ago and when it was wrong, I went with the knowledge of their schedule (who should be in this room for supervising)... only to have it wrong again. Thank you. It helps that I can share this here.\n\nI am not sure if my teacher will believe me, that is why I am also looking for more information at the moment. I hate to admit but my university environment is very toxic. I once committed a mistake because I really forgot something and the teachers already accused me of lying and cheating to the point of bringing me to tears. \n\nWhenever a student commits mistake here, the consequences are quite bad. From scolding to having it being talked by the teacher to the other teachers--spreading the name of the student and the mistake they committed. It happened to me once. \n\nWhich is why I was devastated by the mistake of not recognizing them... I really hope no teacher will bring it up again the next time I have to go there... Yes, that seems to be the same with me!\n\nI thought this should be the case with most people or I simply have bad memories for remembering people all this time... I am an introvert! :) Facial recognition is based on perceiving and remembering the very specific proportions between the eyes, nose and mouth. JUST the front part of the face that contains the features, not the chin, forehead, hairline, ears, moles, freckles, or anything else. These specific facial proportions can vary by only a few milimeters from person to person, so  facial recognition ability is very complicated and precise. \n\nWhat helped me realize I was not a mild case was looking at celebrity deepfake videos. Find ones of celebrities that you think you can recognize consistently, and see if you can recognize their faces on a different head and body. \n\nFor example, I have seen many Jim Carrey movies, and I thought that I had looked at his face enough to be able to recognize it. But when I saw ( deepfake video (without having seen the title), the only difference I could see was that he looked younger than the original, and my initial assumption was that somebody had digitally de-aged Jack Nicholson. I did not recognize Jim Carrey's facial features because they are on a different head shape with a different body and voice. So that got me to think that I am not recognizing Jim Carrey by his specific facial proportions, but rather I am remembering his overall head shape, hair, chin, body type, expressions, or voice. \n\nHope that makes sense! Thank you! \nI do not really follow celebrities but I tried finding some famous people's deepfakes and I thought they looked different and unfamiliar because it is fake? \n\n\nAlso what I noticed so far from trying some prosopagnosia tests online (like the Cambridge/CFMT and the others available), I was not remembering people's faces by their front part/features. I tried to remember people from their chin, jaws angle, moles, forehead, etc. When it became hard to see their other features that I remembered beforehand, I was so confused. \n\n\nI thought that was the case with most people too! Is not that why some people often mistake someone for another person? That is why I never suspected I could have prosopagnosia... I thought it was just normal. \n\n\nI have always dreaded meeting the people I have not seen for so long, though. Scared I would not remember them, even though I remembered them before not seeing them for quite some time. I thought it was normal too! But I keep getting approached by people who I supposedly met before that I am perceiving as strangers. So that tells me most people have an ability that I do not. \n\nI think the reason why some of us think we have a mild case is because, if we are born with it, we have had an entire lifetime to cope and learn to recognize people without using the face. Whereas people who acquired proso from a brain injury have no coping mechanisms and some cannot even recognize close family or themselves in photos after their injury, since they were so used to heavily relying on face recognition ability.\n\nPS- I tried showing the Jim Carrey deepfake video to my bf and asked him who that was. He immediately said Jim Carrey without hesitating.", "I share and apartment with identical twins and they are having a meeting with their clones in the living room Ok so turns out they are not twins, and they actually \u201cdo not looking anything alike\u201d (???).  Also, it is not clones, it is just a group of their friends, who also apparently \u201cdo not look anything like each other and even have different color hair\u201d.\n\nI am not buying it. If you are not clones or twins, then why cannot I tell which of you are my roommates, hmmmm??!! \n\nThis is very suspicious. I will keep you all posted. It may be a twin conspiracy! I think I have saw one of them on the bus earlier! Take care!\n\n/uj I like your sense of humor :) I love this! I seriously thought it was the start of a story on r/nosleep or r/wholesomnosleep and I scrolled back to see which one before I clicked on it :) This is great \ud83d\ude02 He hasnt responded back. \n\nTHe clones got him. I have a husband and two sons who are all around the same height and of similar shape and colouring. When all three are in the house I have to check who is who all the time as visually they all register as the same person.", "Curious, do you think prosopagnosia leads to more (unconscious) stereotyping? Because one of the things I think is linked to prosopagnosia is that you group people together based on general appearance. Would you say you immediately assume (behavioural) stereotypes in a certain group of people? Or would that be a more general non-prosopagnosia related thing? \n Personally I think I go the opposite way, and try really hard to pick out individual differences - I guess I am consciously over compensating for my prosopagnosia.\n\nI have quite an eye for detail though, but this is like the chicken and the egg question, which came first...  I dont think i stereotype people, but i think what my brain does might LOOK like stereotyping if that makes sense. For example, at my school there are a LOT of brunette sorority girls with long hair that look identical to me, because the clothing they wear is....pretty homogenous, especially when its warm. So many monogrammed shirts. Any group that has a pretty homogenous haircut is very hard for me to identify (ex. Crew cuts) because hair is the first thing i look at to identify people unless they have some other obvious marker (ex. Very tall, a very distinct backpack) I have to be very careful when i explain this to people who dont know what prosopagnosia is and dont know that im not racist, because in my high school i had a hell of a time telling most of the students apart, because so many people had the EXACT same haircut. Someone who is not aware that i am violently opposed to bigotry of any kind (had quite enough of that shit from my very southern family, vowed to never be like them) might hear me explain this and think what i mean is \"all people of whatever racial group look the same\" which is not at all true. Its just certain haircuts are very common and if there are no other obvious markers, i cannot use the face to identify them obviously, and that makes it difficult. I am glad prospagnosia is getting to be more mainstream knowledge, because i hate the idea that someone would hear me explain it and then think i am a bigot. I have the same problem at school now like i said with the sorority girls, so i use that to explain it now. It is distressing that someone would misunderstand me. General appearance? No I look to very specific things in order to place/ name people. While a lot of people with similar features may look alike to me, it makes me need to look at other, more often deeper features.  Completely agree with this. I took the Implicit Association Test for Race and showed no bias towards any race. Because part of the test involves seeing faces of people of different races and rapidly associating them with characteristics, I struggled because I do not see ANY characteristics in faces let alone hate, anger, violent, etc. \n\n(", "Sharing embarrassing situations I have been in at work I have only really looked into what prosopagnosia is last year, as I had to do a full presentation about it for my neuropsychology class. I did tons of research and the more I read about it, the more I could relate.\n\nAs a university student, I did not have much problems telling apart my 3-4 friends I always stayed with. But as soon as someone else from my class was mentioned, it was very hard for me to know who they were. I kind of shrugged it off because it never bothered me.\n\nI began working in a school this year, and I have been in some pretty embarrassing situations with people I work with. The worst situation happened today and motivated me to write this post, I will tell you more about it at the end.\n\nThe first one happened during my first day. The vice principle being my direct superior, she introduced me to some of the staff. I stay a few minutes in the administrative building, then I see this lady with black hair coming in. I recognise her to be the secretary that has been already introduced to me, so I do not really mind her (I am kind of shy which does not help, I suck at small talks). But the lady stays here, and she says \"oh, you must be *my name* !\" and she goes to shake my hand. She then introduces herself, turns out she is the principle of the school, and she must have thought I was a complete jerk as I was not going to say hello to her, or anything.\n\nSome things like that happened with students too, I still have so much trouble knowing who is who, even when it comes to students I have talked to several times. I have an excuse though, there are more than 500 students in the school so I cannot know them all yet. What sucks the most is when I do not recognise adults working with me. \n\nNot so long ago, a lady from the administrative part walks in, and as she sees me she asks how I am doing. So I reply \"I am great and you ?\" (as I am French, I am using \"vous\" which is a polite way of saying \"you\", mostly to people older than you or people you do not really know) and she tells me I can use the familiar you (which is \"tu\" for those of you who did not have the chance to study French). She leaves, and five minutes later a lady that looks exactly like her goes in. But I know that another lady working in the administration has the same hairstyle and all. At this point, I do not know if I should say \"Hello\" to the person who entered and just make a complete fool of myself if she is the lady I have seen five minutes ago, or if I should just say nothing, and being seen as a jerk if she is a lady I have have not seen today and that I have not greeted yet. I chose the second option, I pretended not to see her so I could ignore her, but I feel really ashamed that I had to do that. To this day, I still have no idea which one is who. \n\nAnd here is the most embarrassing thing that happened to me. See, there is this teacher who is pregnant. We were talking about a student yesterday. As I was talking with someone else this morning, this teacher comes to us because she wanted to have a word with the person I was with. After they are done, I tell the pregnant teacher \"by the way, I have seen *name of the student* you told me about yesterday.\". And she is just really confused. She says \"I do not know who that student is.\" and as she is a fun person, at this point I just feel like she is messing with me pretending not knowing who the student is, so I keep going. \"Yes you do, we talked about her at lunch yesterday.\" and she still has no idea what I am talking about. That is when she says \"oh, you must have mistaken me for Mrs. PregnantTeacher.\" and yeah, I did. The teacher I was talking to just happened to be a bit overweight and had the same haircut than the pregnant teacher, so I thought they were one. She then goes on and says something along the lines of \"it is not the first time this happens. This teacher and I kind of have the same morphology\" and laughs it off, but I still feel terrible that this happened, and that this was my first conversation ever with that teacher who must now think I am an asshole. \n\nLike most of you, I have a bunch of other embarrassing stories because of my fb. But honestly, it is so weird because when I was in uni, it never bothered me much. The worst that happened was people telling me hi and me replying without knowing who they were, so most of the time they did not even know I did not recognise them. But now that I am working, it seems so much harder and it is been overwhelming how quickly this has become a bit of an issue in my everyday life (but still manageable, I do not have it worst). Could this maybe be helped by explaining your problem as it happens? I know it will be annoying to have to tell so many people, but look at it as an educational opportunity. Tell your class, tell your coworkers, tell the supervisors, teachers, everyone you know. Explain it. Let those people know that it is not just that you are not good at recognizing faces, but that it is something that you can hardly manage at all. \n\nThen they at least know why you confuse them with others. I do not think it can hurt. This is a good idea, to be honest I have not thought of that because as I have said, I have never been bothered by it before so it is brand new to me. I did talk about it to two of my coworkers today though, because we get along really well and they have noticed how much it is hard for me to recognise some students.\n\nI will consider letting other people know, but as my contract in this school ends in a few months, I do not know if it is worth taking the time to explain it to everyone around. I just needed to vent a little bit haha You may as well get used to it, and if it will make your work life easier, it is worth the time. It could make the difference between a good recommendation from your principal, and a not so good one if that person understands you are not rude, but have a genuine neurological condition that makes it impossible to recognize faces. Yes, I definitely did not see it like that. I will think about the best way possible to tell at least my superior, and see who else I will let know. Thanks for taking the time to reply to me (and teach me how to write \"principal\", I have no idea why I kept spelling it \"principle\" as we also say \"principal\" in French lmao) That is one that gets lots of people. Think of it this way: a principal is a person, who has principles. ;)   *She leaves, and five minutes later a lady that looks exactly like her  goes in. But I know that another lady working in the administration has  the same hairstyle and all. At this point, I do not know if I should say  \"Hello\" to the person who entered and just make a complete fool of  myself if she is the lady I have seen five minutes ago, or if I should just  say nothing, and being seen as a jerk if she is a lady I have have not seen  today and that I have not greeted yet.*\n\nOh I do know what you are saying there. You feel a right idiot either way do not you. It is awful. I am lucky in that I am usually alright with people I have met many times before (something must change in my head. what is all that about?). My coping mechanism is like featherfeets's - I tell people often that I have got this thing about being terrible with faces. I am hoping it makes a difference sometimes when I do not acknowledge them. But do not let it start making you avoid contact with people to avoid embarrassment. That would be bad. Well yeah, you are totally right. It happened at 8am, I was still half asleep haha. But after thinking about it, I agree with you, it is better to be straight forward, to greet the person and if they tell you that you literally just saw each other, it is the perfect time to tell them about how it is difficult for you to remember faces, and it will probably make things easier in the future. \n\nThe same goes with me though, there are some people I work with that I can identify without any problem, but most of the time it is because I have seen them a bunch of times already and had an interaction with them, or because there is something that catches my attention in their gesture, way of talking...\n\n(by the way, it feels really great to have people relate to what I am experiencing as I have just discovered this communauty, thanks a lot for your reply) I do not have prosopagnosia, but I just think it is kind of interesting. I know it is probably a total hassle for you folks, but if I did not know about it I would probably be really interested to hear more if you explained it. I was thinking maybe if you had a pin \"I am faceblind not an asshole!\" you would not need to constantly tell everyone you met, but the people who meet you multiple times would probably notice the pin and just ask you about it. Then word would get around. I am a teacher.  I do not usually tell my peers, because I am pretty good at work arounds.  That being said if it is obvious that you are making repetitive mistakes, I think it is better to say something to explain.  Even if you do not stay at the school, you sometimes run into the same people.\n\nWith some other teachers, I have casually mentioned that I am not good at recognizing faces.  Easier to say than explaining the whole thing.  I did tell my current principal, but have not told former principals.  She was awesome and asked what I needed.  I told her to never ask me to check parents' ID, to introduce staff when we have a new teacher, and to tell me if I offend someone, and then I am good. Hah - do not listen to me, I do not take my own advice. Only yesterday, a woman came to the door of the office accompanied by a student. She said \"Oh, here is EBCE, she is the one you need to talk to\" and quite frankly, I could swear I had never *ever* met this woman in my life before. She did not introduce herself and it seemed she evidently knew me. \n\nI did my usual thing of pretending everything was jolly, and it was not like I was not perfectly able to do my job i.e. suggest things the student might require etc etc. So it was not exactly a problem. Immediately afterwards I told my boss \"I have no idea who she was\" and actually neither did he, but he evidently thought I did from my mode of interaction with her.\n\nSo it seems I generally have evolved good coping mechanisms. But when it came down to it I did not take my own advice at all. I was too embarrassed. AARGH it is so annoying.\n\nWhat is more, when I came home, something my partner innocently said (\"do you remember so-and-so?\", some friend of his from 20 years ago that I met maybe once -  yeah right) totally TRIGGERED me (to use the current parlance), and a short argument ensued until I realised what had set me off i.e. the interaction from earlier in the day.\n\nApologies for the long reply, but you are right, it is great to actually have people that relate to what one is experiencing! so you are catching the fallout I am afraid!", "Visual snow Anyone here effected by both visual snow and prosopagnosia? I am, yes My visual snow comes from migraines and csf leak... As a disclaimer to anyone who sees this thread: some level of Visual Snow is pretty common -- a potential majority of people will see static when looking at black surfaces.\n\nVisual Snow as a neurological condition is when it becomes a hindrance to the person, potentially blocking them from seeing properly. Yep! Hey it whenever I look at a neutral surface (blank walls of a uniform color for example)  or in the dark. ive never hear of visible snow until now. What is it? I thought I could see air atoms when I was pretty young. I have always had both. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It is where you see something that looks kind of like static on an old TV. You can probably see it if you press your palms into your eyes or look at a bright light. Prosopagnosia is also a neurological condition caused by a very close section of the brain as visual snow. \nI was just wondering if there was any correlation No, I do not.  (Not like the neurological condition.  Sometimes when I am tired at the end of a very long day with a lot of computer screens or when I have a bad head ache, a little bit, but I think that is pretty normal.)  I would be very interested in a chart with the rate of correlation between prosopagnosia and other conditions. When I have a migraine or feel faint for any reason, yes. It looks like the snow on old TV's except green and black instead of black and white. It is pretty rare, though. I had no idea this was thing, but I have it", "Anyone else have trouble recognizing their own family members? I have lived with my mother my entire life, but last summer after she had brain surgery I went to visit her in the hospital and her hair was covered and I just did not recognize her and it was really disturbing. Has anyone else had this sort of problem? She does not have any really distinctive facial markings/scars so I usually use her hair to recognize her. Yes, out of context it is difficult. I have lost my dad in a Supermarket, my mother in a cafe, and I cannot spot my kids in a group, unless I memorize their clothes.  this is the same for me. \n\nI need to remember clothes most of the time because I cannot recognize people by their face mostly if there are lots of people or if they just change one thing like haircut, or wear hats...\n\n My sister has lost hair due to cancer treatment multiple times.  She DOES have pretty distinctive features, but I still find it disconcerting because she looks like a different person to me. that is what is proso any king of change make us not abe to recognize someone even if it is a minor change. and often even if there is no change I am not able to recognize people... Yep, dad shaved his beard one day and I got startled by the \"stranger\" for a week.  I regularly lose my family in shops or crowds. Recently had a 5 minute conversation with my grandmother before figuring out who she was! Yes. Not me personally, but I know someone who gets worried when his wife is not wearing her hat. He went to lengths to get her hat back to her.  I stepped out of my bedroom and a stranger was cooking on my stove. It was my kid. She had her hair pulled back in a pony tail, which she never does. I said,\u201d uh good morning.\u201d She completely ignored me. That is how I figured out it was her. I thought it was some friend of my kids who I had never met. All the time. Here are some of my favorite moments:\n\n1. My son and I were going to my dad's house for Christmas and got lost. We called my dad and he said he would come out and lead us back to the house. We waited, and some guy drove up. I asked my son \"Is that him?\" He said, \"I do not know\". We took a chance and followed him. (Yes, it was him.)\n\n2. Every time we go to a movie, my husband removes his hat and then goes to get us snacks. While I am waiting for him to come back, some stranger comes up to me and tries to sit in his chair! Just when I am about to say, \"Excuse me, my husband is sitting there\" I realize that the stranger is my husband. (Now he is likely to say, \"It is me\" when he comes back.)\n\n3. Some kid waved at me as I was heading to pick up my son. I waved back, and then waited for my son to show up. He walked up to me and said, \"You walked right past me.\" I said, \"i did not see you.\" He said, \"You waved at me!\". (He is face blind, too, so he understands.) On occasion. I have walked past them on the street without a flicker of recognition. Yes, absolutely. I do not see my family very often, so when I do, any major changes to their appearances can confuse me. My brother shaved his head and I did not recognize him until he walked over to me (he walks kind of weird). My parents have a pool, and my mother looks like a completely different person when her hair is wet. When my children were school age and used to go around in groups, they knew to call out if they saw me. I could mostly recognise them on their own but not with other children. I suppose I just presumed I would not recognise the other children so did not try to look for my own. Now the boys are adult and are all around the same height, shape and colouring as their father. If they are all in a room together I have to keep checking which one is which. &gt;We took a chance and followed\n\nmy entire life My sister, who is in the Airforce and was stationed on the other side of the states, did a surprise visit one Christmas and showed up at my job.

I am currently writing a paper on prosopagnosia. If it is not too much of a bother, would you mind answering a few questions?\n\nThese questions are quite specific so I could not get much answers from Google. Thank you!\n\nMy question is what do people with prosopagnosia see in their minds when they remember a specific memory? For example, memories from your high school? Or memories from your first date? Do you happen to see a face? Do you happen to know which people are in these memories but minus the face? For example, you have a memory about a man who offered you a seat at the train. Then you later realize that this man is named Daniel. Does that happen or not? :) \n\nThank you for answering in advanced!", "I tried watching Haunting of Hill House BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. Jesus. I probably asked my boyfriend, \u201cWHo IS THaT????\u201d a million hundred thousand times. Luckily, he does not get annoyed. I do not know how. The show is SO good. And yes I know I am late to the game watching it. I struggle with every TV show/movie but this was by far the hardest. I also struggled a lot with this one. Way more than usual. I did not even finish it and my wife could not figure out why. I have heard that close captioning helps a lot with this show.  I found it impossible to follow and my husband hates the captions, so I never got to enjoy it. Oh I basically live on captions. Luckily my boyfriend does not mind. I do not know how he puts up with me! Anyone try watching the handmaid's tale? The only character I can recognize is the one with one eye. I found descriptive audio such a huge help with this one, (narrator tells you who everyone is!), but if your husband cannot even tolerate captions, I am guessing this will be a no-go too  :( I struggled hard with this show. I swear all the women characters were the same person Ugh yes! I mean, on one hand, great job casting people to look like they are related, but on the other hand... Could someone have like... Blonde hair maybe? Or red? Or not look like every other female character? Closed captioning is a life saver haha Loved that show, but the only reason I could keep up was because my girlfriend acts a spotter so I can ask \"who is that?\" at any given time Holy crap, I did not know that existed on Netflix.  Thank you! I found that once the show started focusing on one sibling each episode, the show got easier for me. The first episode or two I had to ask my boyfriend which was which every 5 minutes. Haha - no chance for descriptive audio.  That really creeped him out. :) I hate close captions too...not sure why, because I love to read and am a pretty fast reader.  Maybe just because I am trying to make things as hard as possible. I had a really hard time watching Band of Brothers. Would never have gotten through it if I could not constantly ask my wife who is who.", "Any ideas? So basically I have all the classic symptoms of prosopagnosia, it is not so severe that I cannot recognise someone full stop and after a while I can tell people apart so long as other their other general appearance stays static. \n\nI really struggle watching TV as I cannot tell characters apart and if they change costume or location I would not recognise them. I often get confused by any characters with similar hair colour or sometimes characters who I have been told look nothing alike yet  am completely unable to tell themapart. Black and white movies are out of the question. Any TV shows I watch I have to have a character/photo cast list on my phone so I can try and identify people. So yeh all classic prosopagnosia except... I can tell identical twins apart so easily?!\n\nThis completely contradicts everything and I do not know how it works? I could have two completely different people who look hardly alike who I mix up but then I can tell the one person from their identical twin easy. I mean granted I have to be around then long enough to learn their names but once I have identified them and their differences I can tell them apart at any point unlike people who look nothing alike.\n\nAnyone know of anyone else as messed up as my facial recognition is? \ud83d\ude02 I am not too surprised. Identical twins mess up cognitive-normative people because their faces are identical. To people like us with Prosopagnosia, Amber and Ashley look just as similar as Amber and Emily. We are already very apt at telling people apart based on things *other* than one's face.\n\nSo if one of the twins speaks a different way, or walks a different way, or has a different style, or does their hair a little differently, **we** are already picking up on that. For me, telling identical twins apart is about as difficult as telling apart Shawn Spencer from Psych, JD from scrubs, or Peralta from Reno Nine-nine (I could make a longer list, but you get the idea). Yeh that is a good point. I tend to get a different 'vibe' from twins which is at least part of whatever I am gathering to differentiate them. I have synesthesia as well which I think comes into play somehow.\n\nWith finding identical twins easier than strangers I wonder if it is a similar phenomenon to the whole 'uncanny valley' thing. Where by because they are so identical but have slightly differences it actually stands out more than if they were less alike? Idk it is a weird, counterintuitive thing but also pretty interesting. Ah yeah, I am exactly the same! Cannot tell which waiter is mine, cannot recognize the Starbucks employees out of uniform, cannot recognize new (and some old) coworkers anywhere outside of work, but can tell Mary-Kate Olsen from Ashley Olsen with no difficulty.  Same here. If you have Amazon prime, use that for TV. Whenever you pause it, it tells you all of the actors in a given scene. They do not have everything, but if it is on Amazon, I choose them for this reason. Plus, even going by the faces, we are so used to getting people mixed up we are looking for anything to set them apart from each other, may one twin has a tiny scar or particularly memorable freckle pattern. &gt; Shawn Spencer from Psych, JD from scrubs\n\nGoddamnit.  YEah. For me identical twins are no more difficult than normal people. Before I knew about face blindness I found it confusing in school when people would have difficulties telling identical twins apart when they had a height difference and one had a small mole on her forehead! Yes! I discover this last year... It is an amazing feature. \u263a\ufe0f Good to know it is not just me! I was struggling to decide whether I class as having prosopagnosia if I can tell identical twins apart easily. It seemed to be completely contradictory. It is funny how it works is not it and then if you are good at telling twins apart nobody believes that you cannot tell people apart who are said to 'look nothing alike'. Ha, me too. I have got twin-recognition super powers. Most identical twins I have known wear their hair slightly differently so it is pretty easy to me. Non-related people with the same hair style though? Forget it.  Ummm in college I dated a guy for six months who had an identical twin brother who he lived with. I did not realize they were twins until about a year after we broke up and a classmate mentioned it. I mean I noticed they looked a lot alike. But I mean I know my brother and I look a lot alike too.

Is there something about a drawing that is different from a photo/irl face?  I think perhaps their key features stand out more crudely, like a caricature, as they are stripped of all the other busy details that would normally distract us. The distinguishing feature that makes them look like Einstein/Darwin is mostly the hair, which speaking personally makes it easy. I could not tell either one. I recognized the beard on Darwin, but I did not remember whom the beard belonged to.", "My friend talked me into trying an app called Reface the other day... Basically it uses a selfie and imposes your face upon scenes from movies and such.

She pointed out that the random asshole that keeps appearing in the videos I click is me \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23  \n\nI do not remember choosing whatever my user name or I would have picked up on sooner but I thought it was pretty hilarious after all that.  I wanted to share and thought if anyone could appreciate/understand it would be this community. I have a friend who shares videos to Facebook with her face on other people (like from movies or music videos).\n\nI can tell there is something off about it, but it always takes a bit to recognise that it is because the face is not right for the body. I do not see it as her face, though. Not even after staring at it knowing that it is supposed to be her. \" I kept seeing some random asshole\" That did make me laugh, thank you.\n\nThen I was smugly thinking 'well at least I can recognise myself'. But the more I thought, the more I wondered if I recognise myself in photos from what I am wearing (I think I often use what people are wearing) and what my hair looks like (again, a common hack). But in these videos of yours I guess \"you\" are not wearing your own clothes and perhaps you are wearing someone else's hair as well.\n\nI think I would be stumped as well, I would probably have no chance.

Like \"Hey Aunt *my name* you are not wearing your normal shoes, I do not recognise you now\". Or \"why are not those singers wearing the same clothes like last time, now I do not know who is who\". Do I do something? His parents know I have proso but I also do not really want my nephew to think he is different from others and stuff. Should I just talk about it in like 10 years? When he is old enough to understand? I do not know. I would probably hold off on mentioning it for a few years so that he can develop the coping mechanisms with it that we all have.  Then give him a name for it when he, for example, goes from elementary to middle school or middle school to high school. Thank you! That is indeed what I was thinking, I do not want him to feel like he is \"handicapped\" and skip the copings, but I want him to understand himself There are things you can do and things his parents can do.  You can suggest things to his parents, but ultimately they get to decide.\n\nParents:\n\n*Have him evaluated and do a lot of reading on the subject.  I do not know if any measures have been normed for children, but they can certainly try to see what they can find out and anything that might support him.\n\n*Practice explaining it to his teachers.  There is a ton of school stuff that is hard that a teacher could help with if they knew and understood.  \n\nYou:\n\n*Keep it age appropriate, but do not ignore it when he brings it up.  \"I notice that it is sometimes hard for you to tell people apart.  That can be hard for me too.\"  \n\n*Give him tips!  A simple one would be teaching him to look at hair and noticeable facial features instead of clothing.  Point out that people usually changes clothing (again, when he brings it up) but that you notice their whatever. Luckily he already is homeschooled so if his parents know that is enough for now, but the part about just telling him that I struggle too is really good! That does not make him feel weird and it is also not like sitting him down and telling him like a huuuuuge thing. About the copings, I think he has those pretty much already! He says I look weird with my hair down (its always up), he describes people by clothes, he knows he is seen people before but \"barely recognized them because their hair is different\" and stuff. He seems really good at maneuvering through social stuff with copings. I could drop a simple explanation every now and then tho! (Like \"yes I changed shoes because it is getting warmer! Mom and dad do that too right?\") He is old enough to understand. He is already working on his coping mechanisms. However--I would have the conversation with his parents and let them decide when to have the conversation with him. Explain you have noticed that he has some coping mechanisms, explain what that means, and ask them what they want to do. Make sure they know you are on standby as their expert in prosopagnosia. If I remember correctly, it is actually perfectly normal for a child five or younger to do this. Full facial recognition skills actually take until about age 14-16, and they have only really started developing properly at his current age. Oh cool!

But people always use some really well-known image as their \"test\" case so they can \"call me out\" on \"faking for attention\"). I also hate when people think \"face blindness\" literally means that we look at people and physically cannot see a face at all, but I know that is just an assumption from the phrase and it bothers me because the concept of somebody with a completely egg-smooth face (like a noppera-bo) has haunted my nightmares since I was a little kid.\n\nDo these things bother anyone else?

I am constantly lost and have no sense of direction (I have heard that is related to face blindness?). So I have taken up driving Uber on the side. Why the hell not.  Definitely. Or security guard for a building or something. That would be a pain in the ass too. I am a restaurant hostess. So many times I have greeted a guest only to realize I already talked to them earlier. I used to be an adventure tour host and had to learn guests\u2019 names at the start of each tour. The programs were 30-45 minutes each, with groups of up to 12, and the activity was unpredictable and dangerous. Hence, why our boss insisted we should be able to call out names to get someone is attention quickly and efficiently. This was a water activity so big life vests covered up most of their swimwear. I had to rely on hair (until it got wet) and other body subtleties to even come close to being successful. Oy.  Lol I am a teacher and it is rough XD;;; I teach multiple classes a day and I really only know the names of the troublemakers x.x;;; Some girls wear the same hairstyle every day so that helps, but sometimes I will pass them by in the halls and not know if they are one of my students or not  luckily, they all recognize me, they have assigned seating (that will never change lol), and my really young students gave nametags haha XD;;; Have you ever brought your condition up to the students or would that just be an open invitation for them to mess with you?  Have you ever observed a student that you thought might have Prosopagnosia as well? I work as a sound recordist. It is not as bad as other professions but has caught me out a few times. I sometimes get told by the assistant director who I should mic up depending on who is speaking in the scene and what not. Sometimes when they come out of hair and makeup they they might have a wig on or wearing compleatly different clothing as to when I was first introduced to them at the start of the day... I was thinking Police officer sketch artist. Private Investigator would be rough for the same reasons you describe. I am well aware I could not work in a role that includes facing external customers or where I would have to meet a lot of people.

I was in an opera once in which I did not realize two of the sopranos in the chorus were different people until we got costumes.

I mostly call on students without using names, for fear of calling the wrong one, and I have found lots of workarounds for taking attendance and handing back graded work, which used to be the bane of my existence, but I do still worry about failing to great my students when I see them around campus.  I am sure it happens all the time, (as well as accidentally greeting students I do not actually know, who probably wonder what that was all about).  Haha omg yes! Some of the schools around where I work even require certain hair cuts as part of their uniform and I am always like o.o;;;;\n\nLol, yes! I just greet anyone who looks at me like they know me... and sometimes I am just wrong and it is awkward XD;;; Luckily a lot of my students are young, so they will run up to me or start waving and I will know they are one of mine XD;;; And ugh... handing back work... I just call their names and have them raise their hands or come get it from my desk, lol. What are your workarounds? My favorite workarounds:  For attendance, sometimes I pass around a sign-in sheet, (which saves class time too, but the best part is that, since they sign in the order they sit, it becomes an instant seating chart).  Sometimes, I take attendance from an in-class assignment I collect.  (I have read about those automatic attendance apps that sense students' phones or something, but I have never tried them).    When I am calling on people, just pointing to the person with the hand up and making eye contact usually seems to do the trick!\n\nPassing back assignments, I usually make sure the grades and notes are not visible on the front, and let students come find their own test in the alphabetized stack.    That method also has the advantage that people do not have to sit nervously waiting for their names to be called, which I always hated as a student!  Ooh those are great! I especially love the sign-in sheet one~ I also just usually point and make eye contact, haha~ I will definitely keep these handy ^.^ Mortician. \n\nPeople look different when they come in to make arrangements and when they come for the funeral. \n\nAnd I could not recognize them. It was terrible. If they had distinctive jewelry, I could remember, but that is it. \n\nPeople got really upset sometimes.  When I was younger, I worked in retail sales. I enjoyed talking to people about the items I was selling as I genuinely liked those areas. What sucked was if someone asked a few questions then walked away for few moments or worse came back after a few hours or days to talk to me, I had no idea if I had talked to them before. This often made things awkward for me. \n\nSo, yeah, retail sales... &gt; Also? I am constantly lost and have no sense of direction (I have heard that is related to face blindness?). So I have taken up driving Uber on the side. Why the hell not. \n\nAnecdotal but I have the same issue. I just use my phones GPS nonstop. Politician. Customer service in a small service shop with regulars. Sales, of the face-to-face account-manager type. Onsite tech support in a medium-size one-office business (have done this one). I have worked customer service for government departments. Fortunately, people coming to government offices do not tend to show up again over and over, or expect to have their names remembered when there are sixty other people waiting to see someone.", "I may have traumatized an elderly woman at the grocery store. I went to the supermarket down the street that both my Mom and me shop at. I saw her at the checkout and was going to help her out with her groceries. I walk up and grasp her arm to give her a hug. Suddenly, scared old woman just looks at me well... scared. My son is like, \"That is not Memaw!\". \n\nMe......... Fuck............. \"I am so sorry!\" Lol.  The good news is \"sorry, I thought you were someone else\" is generally well-received. Oops! I hope you were wearing a mask! That is the part that would have concerned me.

I am starting a new job at a cafe next week and I am so excited to work there! It is a dream work location for me (as silly as that may sound). I would love to keep working there for the next 4 or more years if possible.\n\nSo...I have met the bosses before (but, you know, I do not remember their faces). The interview went great. But now I am pretty stressed because I keep thinking about the last time I was working in a cafe, about how the customers would get annoyed that I did not recognise them as regulars. Or sometimes I would look at a sea of people and not know who ordered the coffees I just made ect. This even went so far as to me giving the wrong things to wrong people, them saying \"it is no big deal we will just have this\" and then the original people yelling at me, wanting to talk to my manager, or leaving yelp reviews about my poor service for serving others in the line before them. And yes, I get this was bad of me, I should have put my foot down and taken the orders away and called out for the right table...but I was young and shy, too meek to correct an 'adult' when they insisted on taking the incorrect order off me. \n\n\nI really do not want to screw this up. Is a notepad and pen okay, or even a good solution? Maybe I could note down things to help me know who is who? But also noting down names and descriptions might weird people out, also I cannot exactly flick through a book of notes everytime someone enters. \n\n\nI do not know, I am overly worried...it would just that this is such a new job, and I really want it, I have not told my employers about my recognition problems and honestly I think they would be pretty irked about it. The cafe I am going to work in is one that has a real sense of community, it runs quiz and game nights and there is such an emphasis on knowing who is who....maybe I have screwed up.\n\nI just did not want to say in the job interview for this amazing place that \"by the way I have this quality which makes me a poor fit\". \n\n\nSorry for the ranty, ambling nature of this. Has anyone else been through something similar? How did you deal with it? Any and all advice is appreciated!  I think it is a mistake to try to hide your proso from your employer.  They are going to jump to conclusions about the difficulties that you will have as a 'waitperson' and fire you for not performing your job.  An alternative would be to confer with your employer sooner rather than later and try to work out something that will work for both of you.  This will obviously not be easy, but you may have the law on your side.\n\nIf you can establish a diagnosis of prosopagnosia (see below), then you have a disability that is covered by ADA   ADA requires the employer to make 'reasonable accommodation'.  So the employer should not object reasonable things that you need to do to keep your customers straight.\n\nWRT establishing a diagnosis, you probably need to get some sort of credentialed authority to test you for proso.  Either a medical professional an academic researcher.   to get a diagnosis from the experts.\n\n\n\n  Not everyone is cut out for every job. Admitting it does not reflect poorly on us.\n\nBut since you do not want to hear that I will share my get out of trouble line: do not take it personally, I only remember the bad customers. I do not have any advice but uhg I feel you. I literally cried at work before because the regulars yelled at me for not knowing them. I no longer work in the service industry. &gt; Not everyone is cut out for every job.\n\nProsos need not apply for the Super Recognizer job\n Customer service is always a tough job for people like us! The best I can suggest is to add things about dress or hair to your notes on who gets what. \nAs for regulars, you see hundreds of people a day, people need to get over themselves! Pray for that regular who always wears the funny hat or has odd facial hair.  I used to work at a bar/club, so it was dark and noisy and that much harder to recognize people. \n\nWhat worked was learning features about people. Like, here is X who has to the super sharp and pointy Dracula eyebrows. Or, here is Y with the flower tattoo on the wrist.  Clothes. Focus on the clothes they are wearing. Ex: remember the guy who ordered the black coffee is wearing a blue polo. It will not help with regulars coming in on different days but at least throughout the day you will get the right orders to the right people. Sometimes I recognize regulars by their voices but mostly I just pay attention to who *acts* like a regular and go with it. I have been a server for three years. It is possible.  (sorry for bad english) \n\nI also have prosopagnosia and work at a bar/fast food restaurant (yes that is a combination that exists where I live) . I have some tips that might help you.\n\nhow to remember who ordered the coffees? = &gt; try to really pay attention to what the people who ordered are wearing. After the people have ordered, repeat it in your head. Example: 2 coffee for the man in the blue shirt and the woman in the red dress. If the group is too big to remember what everyone is wearing, choose the two in the group that stand out most and remember them.\n\n\\- how to remember the regulars =&gt; This is still difficult for me, but I have learned to recognise some of them. Some always sit on the same seat, some always wear the same glasses, ect. If you think a notepad can help you with this than go for it. If your boss knows about your prosopagnosia and you explain to him this is how you deal with it, he should not think it is weird (and maybe even appreciate you making the effort). If a customer asks what you are writing or why you are looking at the notes, just make up some excuse.\n\nHope this helps! good luck with your new job!  prosopagnosia do to MS is brain damage ,  aking some one else how to avoid it makes no sense because other areas can be damaged too ,  prosopagnosia by brain damage is complete different from a born state genetic,\n\n&amp;#x200B; I abandoned the idea of working as a waitress.\nit is too hard for me.\n\nI was working in a snack, and it was a mess !\nI never knew which clients I had taken the order and so I could not serve them, I was saying hello the same person twice, I did not remember who was the person I had to give the change back...\n\npsychologicaly awful and tiresome...", "Ever feel yourself losing a face? I have a mild-to-moderate case of prosopagnosia (confirmed by testing), so I cannot really recognize faces other than close friends and immediate family, but there are a few celebrities/actors that I can more or less picture--usually people I am a big fan of (so I have seen them a *lot*, and have learned to recognize specific images of them) and who are also quite distinctive-looking, even odd. The other day I was thinking about a show with one of these people in it, and as I was picturing her, I could literally feel myself losing my carefully-pieced-together memory of her face. I could not picture her anymore. It was such a weird feeling--it was like forgetting your dream as you wake up.\n\n(I did look at some pictures of her later and remind myself what she looks like. I am not sure I am picturing her *accurately*, but it is good enough for me.) Yes this happens all the time to me. I will have the face.... and then I realize wait no it is actually kind of fuzzy. And then the more I try to focus I start to realize I do not know anything about the face... not the eye color, eyebrow style, or anything. I only thought I knew the face because I never actually tried to test myself on it. It happens with friends too though to a lesser extent. I could not say to what extent this could be a universal occurrence if people were to focus on visualizing a face: it is shown that sketch artists are better able to recreate a suspect than the witness piecing together a face with software. (As in, iirc, if someone is constantly looking at or thinking about different possibilities for the features, the memory starts slipping.)\n\nBut it might be a more common and consciously-felt occurrence to people with prosopagnosia. I do have memories of the feeling: trying to remember who I met during the day and going, \"...Uh. ...Uh... Hm. Did... Wait, no, that is not what they looked like. But... Uh-oh.\"", "Help! Is it the same person on all 4 images? ", "Recognizing people by their \u201cvibe\u201d Has anyone else noticed that they recognize people by their overall vibe, not really what they look like? I know this is vague but I think it must be a combination of body language, general shape (lol), presence, and how I feel around them. I have also noticed that I will often confuse people who look nothing alike because they have a similar \u201cvibe\u201d\u2019 Omg are you me? That is exactly what I do and why I think people look so similar when they are not even closely similar (according to normal people)! Yes, there are a number of pairs and trios of people in my town who i call 'doppelgangers'. They look identical to me but my family cannot see how and think it is hilarious. \n\nI agree with the vibe. I think it is a combination of movement, stance, the clothes and colours they wear. Gate. Posture. Clothing style.\n\nYes. Long before I had heard of prosopagnosia I knew I was much better at identifying people from a distance than others. I never understood how people could not identify people from a distance until I discovered prosopagnosia, then I pieced it together. Yep Wow!! This is the perfect explanation I have never been able to say at loud. Me to a tee!!  There are three people in my office who look completely identical to me and I do the same thing to differentiate between them. I am a contra dancer, which means that I dance with maybe 200 people in an evening, swinging in the arms of other people for 16 beats or so, then onto the next. So there is no talking, just being held in their arms and looking into their eyes, interacting with them as we dance. Each partner has a vibe and with each person there is a unique way they feel as we spin together. The weird thing I realized is that although I do not know who a person is, by the end of an evening, I know EXACTLY how they swing/how they feel in my arms as we twirl by the end of the night. As I see who is about to swing me, I already 'know' them by their swing, in a way I never 'know' anyone by their face. So that is 100 people I sort of 'encode' for how we feel, the chemistry and feeling as we swing. And I realized to my utter amazement when I watch youtube videos of contra dances with people I have danced with, I can TOTALLY  'recognize' how they would feel in my arms swinging. It is amazing to actually 'recognize' anyone from a video, but I do. If you do not know what contra dancing is, have a look. \n\nOtherwise, I have a pretty severe case of face blindness. I met my husband contra dancing 29 years ago, and 'fell' for him simply by how I felt in his arms. It was a crazy- electric-sweep-me-off-my-feet STRONG feeling in my body.  I have had that 'vibe' with only one other dancer in all these years and felt like I was cheating on my husband to have 'allowed' that level of chemistry/vibration to be shared with another person. It totally shocked me to feel it with anyone else. (Please understand, nothing happened/no transgression - but just the one in a million kind of electric synergy that I had only felt with my husband.) Hey there. Would you be interested in talking about the opportunity to write a first-person piece on the challenges of living and dating with prosopagnosia? Email me for more details:  This is a journalist, btw. Oh boy yes! People always praise my \"sharp eye\" because I can recognize people from afar, even though that is really not the case. I never really thought they assumed I was looking at their face!\n\nWorst part is when they add value judgement to it, like \"oh, you knew him from a distance! You must be crazy for him!\" or \"How could you mistake her for that old man? Are you saying she is ugly?\" and I am like BUT THE WAY THEY WALK...", "Just realized I have prosopagnosia, does that signify something wrong with me? My whole life I have always had some trouble distinguishing and recognizing people, I thought I was just like below average it, maybe Its just a weakness of mine, until I realized how bad it was, I have trouble distinguishing people in shows and public. It makes me seem super rude when I do not recognize people, and in Public I always have SUPER awkward stares with people because I cannot tell if I know them. \n\nIt is pretty sad for me because right after looking at my girlfriend I cannot recreate her face in my mind at all, I draw blanks. Even right after looking at her, I have tried hard.  I cannot even Recreate my own face in my mind. \n\nIn a way its sadly made me objectify people since they all look the same, not unique. I will forget about how they look as soon I turn away which is their identity which is what makes them unique. \n\nI have OCD so I do not know if that contributes to anything. \n\nI am relieved I know what my struggle is, but I have more questions than answers. Is there something wrong with my brain? Is prosopagnosia that type of condition where I have to find out what the root cause is to fix it? Did my childhood trauma and lack of Attachment make recognizing faces useless to my brain? Its been like this for as long as I can remember. Proso is a cognative disorder and one of many disorders that can effect how we can recall certain things. There is no cure for it there is only learning how to deal and for some adapt. Funny thing about proso is some are are born with it (like me) others aquire it through a brain injury. Like many things proso can get stacked with other things. I have proso, anxiety disorder, and wide scale sensory disorder. edit: Faces are attached to attachment so some struggle with attachment. Prosopagnosia is nothing bad. Objectification of people because you cant remember their identity is. You have attached identity to appearance, which is a huge lie. Identity is personality and habits. Identical twins are entirely 2 separate people who look alike, with vastly different interests and personality.\n\nIf we were all literally blind, we could still identify eachother no problem. People are unique because of the ways they interact with the world.\n\nYou are more than your looks. Learning to value yourself for good behavior and taking responsibility for your lifestyle outcome due to that behavior is the first step. People's appearance is not their identity! You recognize people in different ways than most people do, but that does not mean you cannot distinguish them or they are all the same to you. For me, it was really helpful to pinpoint some of the ways I do tell people apart: for instance, I pay attention to how people's voices sound different from each other, and their characteristic movements and gestures. You probably have similar coping mechanisms that you do not consciously realize you are doing, and if you work out what they are you can use them more effectively! Everyone has different mechanisms that work for them.\n\nProsopagnosia is neurological rather than psychological--it is not affected by your mental or emotional state at any point, it is just something about your brain as a physical organ. Of course, your mental state can affect how well you are able to cope with it, and having it to cope with can act as an additional stressor on your mental health. So if you are seeing a therapist or a counselor, or even just have a trusted friend you are comfortable talking this out with, it is definitely a good idea to bring up your prosopagnosia and how this realization has made you feel, even though they will not be able to fix or cure it. They can help you process your feelings about it, and they might also be able to help you brainstorm coping mechanisms (like the paying attention to voices thing that I mentioned).\n\nIt may also help to keep in mind that prosopagnosia is much more common than people realize--many people just never realize they have it. I think the current estimate is that about 2% of the population has prosopagnosia, so there is a pretty good chance that in any given group, you are not the only one! And like the sidebar says, \"facial recognition is a spectrum.\" It is not like everyone else never forgets a face and you are the only one making mistakes.\n\nIt can be awkward, but it does not mean you cannot have social interactions, and it certainly does not affect who you are as a person. You can choose how you treat people regardless of whether you can remember what they look like! \\&gt;Is prosopagnosia that type of condition where I have to find out what the root cause is to fix it?\n\nUnfortunately, no. Prosopagnosia is usually developmental (meaning you are born with it), but it is possible to get it from a head injury. Basically there is a very specific and complex part of the brain that is meant for facial recognition, and on some people it is either underdeveloped or damaged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a link between prosopagnosia and other neurological conditions, so that might explain the OCD. I personally have asperger's and a terrible sense of direction, which are also linked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is no cure as of yet, but there are coping mechanisms. Try paying more attention to features other than the face (hair, body, voice, gait, etc.) I did not realize I had it until my forties, specifically when I listened to the Radiolab episode called 'Falling' and suddenly everything made sense.  I remember when I spent ten years as a middle school teacher -- those first few months of learning everyone is names (approx. 120 students) were incredibly difficult, because I basically had to memorize everyone is specific wardrobes and attach them to the names I had on my seating charts.

What is the inverse of a solipsist? Depersonalization That is interesting because I am *too* linear! I wish I was more of a lateral thinker. It is interesting to wonder what kinds of thinking are best served via language, and also whether the experience of an inner monologue is an epiphenomenon for some people. Like, when I do think in sentences, it feels like the words are a pale copy of the thoughts. But when I write, the paper is almost a prosthetic device that lets me think on the fly and circumvent the limitations of my short term memory. I hope you are not calling me a naval gazer. I might be, but I swear it is a new habit that I only recently got into after faceblindness researchers got super interested in my brain and wrote me up in papers.  There is nothing more mysterious than the human brain, that much is certain. Nope, not in particular.  If a solipsist believes that they are the only person in the world that exists, because you can only be sure of your own experience, presumably the inverse would believe that everyone in the world except them exists.  Almost like a variant of Cotard's syndrome (although that is super rare). Well that is interesting. But I think modern empiricism (&amp; I) would argue that you can triangulate on inner experience with multiple sources of information (brain scans, galvanic skin responses to particular stimuli, self report). It is not perfect, but it is as good as we are going to get, and much better/more interesting than just giving up at the outset. I do not have one when Im tired. When Im feeling ok I have a voice in my head but I cannot describe what it sounds like. It is not my voice. I lean more laterally. When I was in highschool I always solved math problems in a way different from what was taught because I was more comfortable that way. I do too, but when I reason out loud, it is linear.

Some faces, like his and my mom\u2019s, I can visualize for a brief period following our last interaction. It is been a week since I last saw him, and I just realized I cannot remember what he looks like. I can visualize some individual features, like his jawline and his dark hair, but that is it. I am giving myself a migraine trying to remember. I could look at a picture but I will not. It is probably a good thing, but I am still crying about it.\n\nI do not know why I am posting this here. Maybe if you had a similar experienced that you would like to share or something, I would very much like to hear it. I just do not really have anyone else I could talk to about this without them looking at me weird. I get it. I have a friend who died and I cannot remember a damn thing about his face. Thing is, I learned a long time ago that while society puts a huge focus on the face, it is not actually that important. I remember the things my buddy said to me and the things we did together. That is more important than being able to point at him in a picture. It is not quite the same with a breakup, since it is a voluntary thing but who cares what led you to the decision to break it off. You still lost someone you loved. Do not worry about his face. It is the happier times that matter. I get the same thing with one of my family members who is dead. I can imagine the memories of him like voice and structure and clothes but not the face. It is quite distressing since I really do not have many photographs of him, he was an old man, however sometimes it becomes vivid in my dreams. Oh yeah that happens, and it really is probably a good thing in this case. Or at least not bad.\n\nI have an easier time visualizing photos that I have seen. It is still vague, it is not like I could draw them from memory, but it is something. People in my memories just look like specific photos I have seen of them. But if I have not seen any for a while, I just forget. This is why I keep pictures of my exes even though everyone usually says to delete them lol. But yeah, I always stop myself from looking at them too while I am still getting over them, it is good to forget their face at that stage. I find that it ends up working to your advantage to some degree I am in almost exactly the same situation. I broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago after nearly a year together and I cannot for the life of me remember what she looks like! I am honestly happy about that but still it is weird seeing how quickly it fades. It is worth noting it also took about 6 weeks of seeing her several times a week before I could reliably recognize her. Exactly the same for me! :( We were together over 5 years and now like you said I can maybe remember some individual features if I really focus on them but the whole face? No way, it will not come to me - it is just not there.\n\nIf this is something you have just realised about yourself it can definitely be hard. But I found some comfort in the idea that what we really remember is how someone made us feel. I think face blindness can sometimes make you feel lonely inside your own head at times - particularly during this quarantine - but I am thankful we live in a time where we are actually able to video chat, take photos and many of them. \n\nSending love and support to you OP \ud83d\udc9c I can relate. My father died recently (he was almost 88 years old), and it is killing me that I can not picture his face. Because of the pandemic, there were no services, no viewing, and no visits before he died (does not help that my sister basically hid him for a year), so I look at photos of him -- but they are all of a much younger man and I do not remember that face. I have a vague impression of the old man I knew, and I can picture him sort of, remembering events from childhood, but I do not remember him without grey hair, without the age in his face, or his younger voice. I am sorry for your loss. This is a very tough time to lose someone not being allowed to be near.\n\nThe more I try to imagine the more I am unable to view his face. So I just keep that one photo in mind first and then imagine a memory, after sometime or in my dream my mind somehow does the rest of the job to complete the face.\n\nSometimes I cry not being able to picture my parents, I know I can see them when I want to but it will not be forever this way. I can recognise people but not imagine their faces. Thank you so much for your heartfelt reply.\n\nI am sending lots and lots of love &amp; prayers your way, both for your emotional healing and for your health during quarantine \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 Funny you should mention the photos thing\u2014I do that too. (Like, I cannot visualize my mom at all, but I can remember our last photo together relatively easily.) \n\nThe best way I can describe it is, faces are like a bowl of mixed fruit: it is pretty hard to remember the precise arrangement of a particular fruit basket (there is an orange here, a couple bananas there, one pear...or was it two? And were they on top of the orange or below? etc) and some fruit baskets look very similar but no two are exactly the same\u2014but a still-life painting of it might be easier to imagine. Not sure if that makes sense, but it is the best way I can think to describe it haha I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you for your supportive comment and I am sending lots of love your way", "Face-blind portrait artist Hi there! I have mild face-blindness, which often leads to mortifying and confusing encounters with strangers who turn out to be people I know. I often muddle through, using strategies like frantically checking Facebook to try and figure out what people look like so I can tell them apart at a party. I can tell people apart (though not well), but I have a lot of difficulty recognizing them, even people I know well and care about. To make matters worse, I have some serious memory problems, so occasionally I will recognize someone but have no memory of knowing them.\n\nA few years ago I developed a bit of a counterintuitive strategy. I am an artist, and I found myself obsessing over faces a lot, so I decided to try portraiture. I turns out that painting or drawing a face uses totally different parts of the brain than recognizing a face socially. I started sketching pictures of everyone I knew on Facebook, which was very fun and social, and helped me figure out what actual features and structures made each face recognizable. I am usually able to recognize someone more easily once I have painted them.\n\nI still struggle a lot, but now I can look at faces a little differently and spot little features that help me out later.\n\nHere is a sample, a portrait I did of my husband. I recognize him pretty easily now, partly because I have painted him a lot, partly because I spend a lot of time around him, and partly because he is very tall and distinctive. Every once in a while when I see him out of context I get a brief moment of confusion, but then it clicks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xeq0d3b0npi31...*  That is really smart! I cant draw well, but maybe just trying will help me remember too. Sounds like writing notes down to remember things better. I am also an artist however i cannot draw faces at all. I can draw super realistic animals and plants or anything else really. Great with anatomy overall until I get to human faces. I can look at the source photo as many times as I want, study it, trace it, put every ounce of effort I want into the task but as soon as I glance back at my paper I am lost and completely unsure what to do with my pencil \nI wonder what our difference is I also have facial blindness from a TBI. I use distinctive markers for recognizing people. Like my son has a patch of white hair and and has a specific way he walks. When he was doing swim meets, all the kids were tall and skinny and walked like him. When he would put his swim cap on, it would cover his white patch. I had no idea who he was anymore. He would walk up to me and have to tell me \u201cmom, it is me\u201d. Other parents realized I did not know when it was him so would let me know his heat was up. I also work as HR for about 300+ people. The thing I have found the most helpful is just flat out telling people from the beginning. \u201cIt is nice to meet you. I have facial blindness. When you come back in my office I will not know who you are until I get to see you more often. After that if you change something I might not recognize you again. I probably will not recognize you outside of your work clothes\u201d.    Then when I do not recognize them it is not awkward for any of us. Bonus, even if I do recognize someone out of work, but maybe do not want to engage, everyone just accepts it as part of the whole facial blindness thing.", "Facial Blindness Stories I think it would be fun to share experiences based on our issues with facial blindness. I have never been diagnosed, but I am pretty sure I have a mild to moderate case of it. I was probably born with it, since I never had any head trauma and suddenly experienced it.\n\nI have introduced myself three times to a new employee in the past two weeks. Normally this is not an issue because I assume the person I do not recognize is the new employee, but we have had three, and I cannot tell the difference at all. \n\nI spent about ten minutes or so trying to identify someone a while back because the leader of a writing group I am in saw me at church, out of context. She tried to talk to me, but I feigned knowing her and answered the basic 'how are you' questions until she gave up. Then she talked to my grandfather, who was there with me, and only after she mentioned the writing group was I able to piece together who she was. \n\nIn that writing group, it took me months to figure out differentiating the people there because they kept changing seats and I could not remember who I talked to the previous time. \n\nGenerally, when I meet someone I want to talk to again, I ask for their number and their picture. I spend time studying the name with the picture so I can more easily identify them the next time. Although, that is not a fail-safe. I would even given someone a nickname, but when I had not seen them for a couple months, I reintroduced myself and knew something was wrong immediately when they looked at me confused. I went through my phone and felt incredibly embarrassed when I found them.\n\nI had a picture of someone I knew in my phone, but I can only guess they cut their hair because I could no longer find them in the usual place we met up. There was someone that kind of looked like them, but I was not sure, and did not want to go embarrass myself by asking what could be a complete stranger about it. They never approached me, I lost the picture somehow, and now I have no idea who it is. Obviously, we do not talk anymore. \n\nI am an assistant manager and am supposed to kick out the customers who are not allowed in the store, but even with their picture on the cameras, it is too blurry to make out any distinguishing features. I cannot recognize them, so I am absolutely sure I will not be able to kick them out if they show up. \n\nI once got threatened with being fired at a previous job because I did not recognize my boss and treated him like a customer. That really freaked me out.\n\nI watched Divergent in the theaters, and remember being really, really confused because I could not differentiate between several of the characters. I would read the book first, so I was trying to identify them based on what I remembered of their speech in the books. Movies suck when everyone wears the same stuff. \n\nAnyone else want to share experiences? I just wander around never knowing who people are.  Sometimes I am a little anxious about not knowing people when it is socially appropriate, but I do not really expect to run into people I know even though I live in a small town and work in a school.  I have cultivated a preoccupied look and a daydreaming for when I am doing errands to avoid rudeness, although I am pretty situationally aware.  I wonder if students' parents just think I do not want to be bothered.  (Which to be fair is completely true sometimes.)\n\nI guess where I am going with this is that I have certain experiences (like yours) that stand out and have shared many of them in the past, but my whole world view is to not expect to know people unless I am specifically meeting them.  I feel like my husband lives in a different town, because he always sees people we know. I once went into my son's first grade classroom to pick him up early for a doctor's appointment. It is not unusual for him to get really dirty at recess and have to change clothes during the day, so I did not think anything of not recognizing the outfit I would put him in that morning. Unfortunately for me however, he would had a haircut the day before that I had somehow forgotten about.\n\nI walked over to him to tell him it was time to go. Of course it was not my son. The really inexcusable thing? My son was the only white kid in his classroom. I would picked out a Hispanic boy because he had a similar hairstyle to what my son used to have. I recently officiated a friend's wedding, and ended up having a full-on mistake of a conversation due to facial blindness mix-up.\n\nAfter the rehearsal dinner, the best man's boyfriend asked me what time he should arrive at the venue the next day. This confused me a bit, given that they live in a different city and had presumably traveled together, so I asked him what he would be doing, if he was helping to set up, etc. We had a whole conversation about his duties, then I asked if he was not riding with Greg, the best man. He got awkward, and told me he \"did not know everyone is names yet\", at which point I realized I had made a mistake.\n\nTurns out it was one of the ushers, someone I have met a bunch of times and with whom I have quite a few mutual friends. He has similar glasses and a similar balding pattern to Greg's boyfriend, although there is a noticeable height difference... Oops. At least they are all good-humored!\n\n\nAlso re: watching Divergent in theaters, I tried to watch Game of Thrones without reading the books first, and was hopelessly lost, despite watching the first season twice and the second season once, so I read the first few books specifically so I could follow... Can you imagine just... Being able to recognize people? Like the first time around?? I will share the three that I generally share in person when explaining how my prosopagnosia works.\n\n1) My parents briefly had a nanny for my brother, who generously offered picked me up from school one day. She arrived, I got in the car in the front seat and a classmate got in the backseat. I asked \"what are you doing?\" He replied \"What are YOU doing?\"\n\nIt turns out that that was his mother, not the babysitter and I had gotten in a stranger's car. His mother just figured I was a classmate.\n\n2) I used to go to sleepaway camp every year. One year, my bunk was entirely new people (instead of a mix of old and new). I impressed the entire bunk because by the end of the night, I knew who everyone was - their names, hobbies, etc. In the morning, I they thought I was a total idiot. \n\nI use clothing as one of my many cheats to remember people. Everyone had changed outfits, so I did not recognize anyone. I went from people thinking I was cool and in the know to them thinking I was a trolling asshole.\n\n\n3) I was working in retail and my boyfriend at the time was going to pick me up after my shift. He came in and I excitedly went over to him to give him a big hug to greet him.\n\nIt was not my boyfriend. It was a complete stranger who looked mortified that the employee was getting so handsy.\n\nWhen my boyfriend DID eventually come in, I let him come to me first. I went to a dinner party of 3-4 other people expecting to see my cousin Rose who I know well, but I would not seen in over a year.  She was visibly pregnant.  I introduced myself, 'Hi, I am Rose's cousin!'  The next day we had lunch and I tried to explain prosopagnosia. I had a full conversation with a girl hat I sat next to every day and was good friends with only to find it was not her. Could not recognize my own dad in my house because he was wearing a hat. Thought a student was a sub because she was not wearing makeup. Thought a sub was my teacher and that my teacher had just dyed her hair. \nThe icing on the cake was when I was tagged in a photo on Facebook and spent several minutes trying to figure out who that fat chick in the photo was and how she looked like an ugly troll before realizing it was me. Me and my wife went to Europe for my job a few years ago and spent some time in Amsterdam.  We had a bad experience with some druggie who kept following us and taking pictures of my wife until he followed us into a restaurant and I jumped up and stopped myself before I flipped out and attacked him because he had an open wound with discharge on his hand and was afraid that I might get some kind of disease.\nThe manager called the cops, we reported him and after that I was always on guard because all I could remember was that he was some lanky black guy with a wound on his hand.  I remember hearing one guy talking to his friend because he thought I walked to the other side to avoid him because of his color; honestly I was just afraid of running into that psycho again.\nThere was another time I was robbed at gun point in my house by 3 guys.  A few weeks later I thought I saw one of them at the grocery store and after my wife talked me into calling the cops we went down to the station where they reviewed the security footage.  I am glad my wife went with me because I was convinced I found one of them and would have felt terrible if I had the wrong guy arrested.\nMost of my life I had had to look over my shoulder because where I grew up being nice made me a target (plus I was an overweight ginger) and I have spent almost half my life living in a rough area.  I cannot help but wonder if the multiple concussions i have sustained helped to contribute to my face blindness. My husband leaves for work around 5am, I leave at 7am. I am walking to my bus when I see a guy roughly his stature, build, and hairstyle standing at the corner of an intersection. I start smiling uncontrollably thinking it is him wanting to surprise me or something even though it is kind of illogical because his job would not allow something like that. So I am walking up to the intersection (and I cannot stop smiling because I am just rly happy whenever I see him LOL) and when I am finally next to him i realize this guy is not even the same race as my husband. But even then I was not sure if he was pretending not to see me or something so I crossed the street and texted him to see if he was at work. He was.\n\nAnd this happened recently: the day before an event, I met with a financial advisor and her intern but it was really brief and we did not interact much. During the event, she arrives with who I think is her intern, so I did not pay too much attention. Later my husband asks me why I ignored him because it looked like he wanted to talk to me. I am like, really? I do not really know him. Turns out he is an acquaintance that I have had dinner with a couple times. I completely empathise with this. I take the view if that if I do not offend someone this time, I have probably done it before or I will do it next time. It is just crazy, because you could offend someone and not even ever know.  In general I am pretty aware of what is going on, particularly social stuff, and have an excellent memory for what happens.  That part drives me nuts. I used to be very conscious of my shortcomings without knowing what it was and concentrated all the time on the people around me and what was going on. I had a really unsuitable job for a FB person but I wanted to be successful and would not quit. Then I found out I had faceblindness (about 15 years ago). For the first couple of years I was determined to overcome it. I tried to learn new techniques and concentrated extra hard but it was exhausting and did not help. Fortunately I came to my senses, realised my FB wasnt going to get any better, gave up trying, quit the job and life improved dramatically. Now I work in a small team and make no conscious effort to recognise anyone. It sounds hard hearted but I have decided that if people really care they will acknowledge I have a problem. I know an autistic man who understands and says his name if he comes near me. Ironically he is quite distinctive and I usually recognise him but if he can do it everyone else can too. I actually stopped trying so hard when I figured out what was going on.  I had developed pretty good coping techniques and some of the things I was doing (like making more of an effort to listen attentively to people and remember what they were saying, which meant I paid less attention to what they look like) to try to remember people better actually made it worse.\n\nVery few people in my life know about face blindness, simply because it is not a common thing and explaining seems to not help as much as it should.  Some \"Yeah, I have trouble with names too,\" a few \"I think I have that,\" (when they clearly do not,) some convinced that I am just thinking I have everything (this is the only thing I have ever self-diagnosed myself with,) and a lot of just forgetting.  A few people (like two) are amazing and make sure I know people, which is awesome. Aaagh it really annoys me when people say \"I am bad at names too\". In fact I almost never tell people about my FB because I do not want to hear it and be annoyed. My autistic acquaintance plus one other person are considerate but, like you say, most people who do know seem to forget. I tell myself it is because I am good at covering it up. Embracing face blindness is not so bad. It removes the burden of trying to be nice to everyone!\n\nOut of curiosity, do you have trouble with cars too? I have a big problem with distinguishing one from the other and have on occasion got in the wrong one (or tried to). I also found out that dogs have different faces. Did you know that? I always thought a black labrador looked like every other black labrador but apparently that is not the case. I am not good at telling cars apart, but I think it is because I have little interest in them.  I can recognize my car easily among similar cars (because it is dirty...or by other features) but I never know the makes of them.  I am pretty good at telling dogs apart, but I like them! Got another one from today. At work, a customer came up and started chatting with me. I recognized that I would seen her before, so I assumed it was a regular customer. Then she asked about her schedule in the office. She was my coworker, but was in casual clothes. One time I was out with my friend and his group of friends, some of who I have not met. I offer to go get one guy (who I would never met before) a drink and leave with his cup. When I come back to the group there is quite a guy there trying to sell us drugs or something, I just assume that this is the guy who is drink I got so go up to him and say \u2018heres your drink. \u2018 Luckily my friend noticed and told me to shut up and the actual guy did not notice lol, turns out the guy who I offered the drink to was a random guy who no one knew and everyone assumed was homeless. Got very close to offending someone!", "I would have never guessed this was Bob Ross. legalessaywriters.com Online class help and Exam help. ", "I do not notice when people gain or lose weight - anyone else? I just do not seem to notice, and even when told, I may not see the difference unless it is a very significant change.  Does anyone else have this? Yes. Same. It makes me feel bad when someone close has lost weight and is super proud but I have not noticed. :/ Only notice if it is a BIG amout of weight, like 10 Kgs or more I cannot tell either. When I tell someone I do not think they are fat, I am not being polite. *I genuinely mean it.* Absolutely notice. Body shape is important to my recognition. Not to mention that the wardrobe may change and I have learned to recognize people by their clothing. Body shape is important to how I recognize people, but it is a detail that does not carry over well moment to moment.\n\nLike, under normal circumstances, any given person can look like a completely different person just by turning 90 degress. Changes in fat over a 2 month period, I am likely not to notice, unless it is a really drastic change. Not if it is like 5-10 pounds gradually.  I notice bigger changes or very sudden changes.  It also depends on how much their previous weight played into me recognizing them.  For example, gaining or losing weight can sometimes affect face shape, clothing styles, or the person's general body shape in which case it would be noticeable for me because it may make them hard to recognize.  But sometimes it does not really affect any of those things in which case I am unlikely to notice.", "Why is this community so small? For something that 2 in 100 people struggle with, and possibly far more may experience to varying degrees, you would think that this condition would have greater represented. \n\nYet we have less than 1000 subs and, outside of this tiny subreddit, it is virtually unheard of. Why is that the case? \n\nAlso, does anyone know of other subs that might discuss this condition? I had it for 46 years before I had ever heard of the condition.\n\nI had no idea I perceived people differently than others. Had you told me I perceived the world differently I would have laughed.\n\nI thought I was just \u201cbad with faces\u201d.\n\nI suppose most people do not realize they see the world differently. Considering how common it is, I think we are just good at adapting. I was well into my teens before I figured out something was wrong with my facial recognition. There is people that to their whole lives and do not know. Also, most people do not think it is a condition, they just think, hey, I am bad with faces. As well, even for people who do know it is a condition, most do not remember what it is called.  This. Along with we have so many coping mechanisms. Hair, personality, common clothing items, sound of voice, gait, styles, tendencies, etc, ... We are just keyed into something else. Most of us are good enough to pass as normal in every day life due to this, so most do not realize they are different Pretty much. I was in my 30s before I realised there was a name for it and other people have it.  At least this community is pretty active.\n\n I am admittedly not. I will sit there and say aloud that someone I am looking at looks like someone else I am not looking at, and people would be all \"whaaat.\"\n\nIn fact, I did not really believe I shared a common visage with a voice actor until just recently, when I compared my picture and hers side by side. :/ Same here. I always knew i wasnt comprehending something that other people could, but had no idea what it was until I was in my late 40s. I suppose, based on the statistics, you are correct. However when it comes to something so personal and subjective as recognising people, I can see how many people with prosopagnosia would never think they had it, or that it is a thing. It is quite unique in that it is only not recognising faces when I can still recognise other things. To be honest, it is something that is easily overlooked.\n\nI found out I had it rather recently when I was 21, and I only realised it was a thing because I mistook two famous celebrities, and mentioned they looked the same (apparently they do not), and my friend mentioned the condition light-heartedly. Now I am aware that I cannot recognise people by their faces, and it is a bit embarrassing because I cannot even recognise my own mother\u2019s face, and I even struggle to tell the facial differences between men and women. But before I realised people can see and comprehend the world around them fine, but be unable to recognise their own face, it just seemed impossible. I never once considered it. I think that might be the issue - it is a very invisible and misunderstood condition.\n\nAs for other subs that might discuss it... I am not sure. I have seen it pop up every now and then on a few subs, but I have not noticed another sub dedicated to discussing it beyond this one. Probably because there is not that much to talk about. On the contrary, I think increasing awareness is key to promote understanding of this condition. It certainly affects daily life in a significant way. I agree. Most of our stories and coping mechanisms are similar. The rest is just anecdotes about \u201cthat one time I did not recognize my mother/husband/colleague \u201c &gt;I think increasing awareness is key to promote understanding of this condition.\n\nThere are only a handful of people that need to know about my prosopagnosia:  my boss, my close family, my romantic partner(s).  The effort to establish and maintain a mutual accommodation and compensation is large and ongoing.  People have to be motivated to make that (costly) accommodation.  The general public and casual acquaintances are not motivated and they are prone to see a vocal 'person with proso' as a whinny bitch.  I do not need that backlash.  Look at the shit that 'people with Asperger's/autism' get.  I am not sold on any 'proso awareness effort'.  I do not want to wear a ribbon.\n\nSure, people that do not understand my proso draw incorrect conclusions about my personality and character... why should I care what those people think?  Part of my accommodation to the world is to be gregarious and take an active interest in the people that I meet.  I may not remember them, but they remember me.  When I do not recognize them, it is enough for me to say, 'I am really sorry, I am terrible at recognizing faces.'  Most people accept that as more than an excuse.  People already have some awareness that some people are terrible at recognizing faces.   I was born with it.  I cannot even recognize my self in photos. (unless it is something I know I was wearing)..\nI figured it out when I was 23 or so.\nI can recognize gender  though, my brain can calculate your gender :P and CANT be fooled \n\nI am a 30 year old virgin because of it   I have social anxiety. pretty bad. \nVisually sexual attraction broken as well.

Almost everyone had them.\n\nThen one day I am out shopping and I see a person with lots of tats and I thought, \"Oh hey, it must be a coworker!\"\n\nSpoilers, it was not.\n\nBut it still helped while I was actually at work. The only time I successfully flagged down the correct waitress was when she had a massive chest tattoo so yeah definitely helped! \n\nOne of my friends has quite distinctive piercings but by the time I am close enough to see them I would be awkwardly close if it was actually a stranger. Tats and funky hair colors make life easier. It is great as long as they are always there to identify the person, otherwise it is like people changing their shirt for me. Do I know you? Maybe. I do not know! Fuck! Act like everyone is a long time friend you have not seen in years! For me it is my glasses, I only change them like every 5 years and I wear them every day so I recognize them", "Do I have prosopagnosia? How inclusive is the spectrum? For starters, I do not imagine faces, like when I am thinking about someone I cannot picture faces I mostly just associate people with a unique blend of colors and the sense that gives me and that is how people appear in my mind. People are faceless in my dreams. I can recognize a person but before I get to know them, their appearance is not associated with anyone specific for me. I can often tell I know someone but then end up wrong because they have similar features or hair to someone I know. Obviously it can be much more serious to the point where you cannot recognize family or friends but does this sound like what anyone experiences? I have fairly similar.  \nIn dreams I do struggle to construct a full face and thus often are just 'faceless', or I do not even look at faces in dreams.  \nIn reality though yeah, I cannot remember faces. It is not severe where I can have a friend stand in front of me and I do not know who they are, but if they are not immediately next to me or so, I struggle to even remember what their face looks like.   \nI try to remember pictures of people as it is easier, then I try and build up the face from there if that makes sense? I remember specific features about that picture to build it up. Even then though that does not always help me to imagine the face away from the picture.  \nGetting to know someone better for me does not do much either, as I struggle to remember what my mum's face looks like most of the time. Yeah, that counts.\n\nThis is not a particularly \"exclusive\" community, no one's really going to be upset if you diagnose yourself with face blindness even if it is just partial. Most of us are in your situation, \"total\" face blindness is super rare and probably only happens in case of brain injury/illness The scientific definition of prosopagnosia (for research purposes) is that you are in the 2 or less percentile for facial recognition (the worst 2% of people at recognizing faces). The 'spectrum' is 1-100 percentile with average people in the middle.  Super-recognizers are towards the top.  \n\nThe inability to read emotions in faces is considered a separate deficit, but some people have both. If you are asking the question, the chances are pretty likely that you have some degree of prosopagnosia.  More people have become aware of it over the past twenty-five years, but it is still not commonly known or accepted.  It is certainly uncommon, but also not as rare as researchers used to think it was.    \n\nSo - most people who have stumbled across the word usually either went looking for it on their own, or like me, happened to say something which prompted someone else to say \"hey, maybe you should look into this thing I heard about some people being unable to recognize faces.\"  \n\nEither way, proso or not, I have never witnessed any gatekeeping here in this community.  It is not a large or very active sub, but it is very inclusive.  \n\nThere is also a similar condition called  (\n\n&amp;#x200B; **Prosopamnesia**\n\nProsopamnesia (Greek: \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd = \"face\", \u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 = forgetfulness) is  a selective neurological impairment in the ability to learn new faces.

Well not really met... I was talking to some dude for two weeks and then he turned out to be a girl. She originally was from a different city of Odessa, but had a work trip to Kyiv and asked if I would like to meet in person. We did not exchange the numbers, just agreed on time and place and shared our photos in private messages of the forum *(prehistoric times)*.\n\nI came to the place 5-10 minutes too late. It was rather big and long, consisting of two separated rooms. First one had windows facing the street and the other was closeted with no windows and had kind of intimate lighting. I have checked the first room, it had these couches with very tall backs that you was unable to see if anyone is even sitting in them. I saw her sitting near the end facing the entrance. I came to her, said *hi* and *how was her day*, *what work she was doing*. She looked rather sad. She started talking about her work and her ex, and her ex husband and about the work again, then about ex and then she wept. I gave her mine handkerchief. It was terrible. I was thinking if it would be rude if I would just leave saying nothing. I have ordered a teapot and was drinking tea non-stop. After 20 minutes I started to make joking remarks about her job, and after 30 I was getting somewhere and I made her laugh eventually. I felt proud of myself and a desire to go to restroom after all that tea.\n\nWhen I returned she was sitting there smiling to me. The waitress came to our table, and I said *thanks, nothing more*. But she was standing there saying and doing nothing for few seconds and I was about to ask her what is wrong, but she outstripped me and asked if she can join us. *WTF?* *I am not going to leave any tips here* were the only thoughts I had before I looked at her face. She was a red haired girl, the very same looking girl as the one who was sitting against me. The only thing that she had those makeup lines at the edge of her eyes, the one that I have noticed on the photo that the girl from the forum send me.\n\nI understood what happened but I did not understand how it happened. I was thinking that it has to be some prank. The real girl and I went to the closeted part and talked for an hour or two. When we were about to leave I have remembered that stupid me ordered the tea to the table with impostor girl, and did not pay for it. So I rushed back with no hope to find her there, and of course she was not there. The table was clean, there was only something laying at the far end of the table near the window. It was my handkerchief. I took it and saw there was something in it. A small paper with *thx :)* written on it.", "I think I have bit of prosopagnosia. It seems to be kind of of strange prosopagnosia \nI am from Turkey and we have lot of people in black hair and darker hair. And bit darker skin. After moving out of Turkey and seeing lots of blonds, light yellow hair and lighter hair it seems through some thing is way of. I think this is because I am not use to those looks . Even on magazines and on movies and TV shows.\n\nWell family and friends have no problem and they seem odd it seems odd for me. There was this girl in a magazines with blond hair from Russia and I said she look like she is in her mid 30s. The family and friends are shocked said no she is young only 21 year old. But person age 29 from Turkey or Mexico I would say they look age 21 and the family and friends are shocked say they much older.\n\nSo some thing with hair and skin being different is making it way harder to pick the age by guessing.\n\nI have friends who changed their hair to light yellow or blond and they look different and there age also looks different.\n\nSome thing about prosopagnosia is effecting hair and skin.\n\nWell if I had blond hair and blue eyes and born in Sweden or Russia it would be opposite of what Im experiencing.\n\nIt just non of my family or friends have this problem. The act of hair and skin being light, really light or dark or really dark as no effect on age of person. So there are other features they picking up on that I am missing. \n\nI find this really strange and odd it seems to be type of prosopagnosia. Difficulty telling age is something that is common with prosopagnosia.\n\nMaybe you pick up on subtle differences in hair (like volume, shine, etc.) and attribute those to different ages mistakenly. Not being able to tell age can be a symptom of prosopagnosia (I do not have this symptom, personally). Sounds like you equate hair lightness with age, rather than looking at signs of aging in the skin around the eyes and mouth. That makes sense in Turkey where most people are born with dark hair that gets lighter as they age. \n\nDo you have trouble with recognizing and remembering people? Especially people who look similar? None of them had wrinkles or lose skin typical of older people. None of them had grey hair.\n\nSo I do not know why blond or light yellow hair is making them look older. I also notice rounded faces look much older than oval faces. So 34 old in really oval face could look age 21 well person age 21 in rounded faces can look really like in their mid 30s . Just sounds like you have not had much experience with other races, and are not faceblind. Different races hold Different patterns for aging, and age-blindness or race-confusion is not to do with face recognition. I may have bit of prosopagnosia.\n\nWhen I see some one there clothes, hair, tattoos, face acne, accent, how they talk and body movement is what really stands out.\n\nI hear prosopagnosia have trouble with age. \n\nAll blond and really light skin may be less contrast and some thing is throwing it off.", "My car \"trick\" backfired today. I use cars to identify people. The other day I was with a car group driving around including a guy in a White Golf R. Later that same day I see another White Golf R and started talking to the driver all buddy-buddy. Quickly realized by his reaction that I was talking to someone I do not know. At this point, I should just start memorizing license plates to save the embarrassment. Or just add them to your friend group! I am in the automotive industry, so your experience is just another Tuesday in my world. I have collected SOOOO many 5 star reviews for being \"so friendly, etc\". Little do they know, I am just clueless. People often talk about how I am so friendly with new people too.  It is not that.  I just do not know if I know them or not, so generic friendliness is safer.  It is probably good that I am not very intimidating looking.", "I made a prosopagnosia starter pack and I think you guys might appreciate it  Also \u201dwait who is that guy/did not he die already?\u201d while watching a movie. Turning off the show/movie when you realize there is more than 2 characters with the same hair color/skin color/hair length and you will never be able to tell which one is which. I feel there is irony in that I am faceblind but not autistic, but the autistic friend that I have spoken with about this is not faceblind. Also - having a long conversation with someone before you realise they are not who you thought they were ... and you now have no idea who they are. I am on the spectrum and have mild faceblindness, but yeah, by no means do they have to be co-morbid.\n\nIt is funny - in my mid to late 40s I find that mostly I have manged the ASD (found ways of coping/masking) but the faceblindness is a lot harder.\n\nAbout the best thing I can do for that is if I am friends with someone on social media I try to make sure I pay attention to their latest photos so that hair changes are remembered and new tattoos are memorized. \n\nI hang with a crowd that does a lot of tattoos and radical hair color/style changes so IF I can keep up with those I do well, but if I miss I can totally be talking to someone I have known 20 years and if their voice is not identifiable enough I can be clueless.

I have a friend that for years I kept forgetting she is black. It only clicked for me when she made a joke that was funny based on her heritage. I could tell if I saw her, but would not remember.\n\nI also had a roommate in college that I did not realize was Hispanic until someone pointed it out, in a \"how cannot you tell?\" way. \n\nThere is other examples, but those two are representative.\n\n(Background: there were no POC in my high school and people tanned themselves brown for fashion, so maybe skintone was not a reliable identity indicator and race was not a useful category. I do not know.) I know my husband (who has prosopagnosia) sometimes does not notice race the way other people do, although it is not clear to me under what conditions he does or does not notice. My experience has been quite different, I easily remember the people who are non-white and have a distinct appearance for someone of that race. (It is a general trend that people are better at remembering those of the same race.) I have the problem with not realizing someone is race sometimes, and for those people I have a harder time remembering their race. I have to keep reminding myself. Thinking more, think it helps when someone has a distinct accent. I once had a co-worker from Haiti and never forgot he was black. Absolutely. I have difficulty retaining that information. I have talked to a guy for several minutes, turned around to talk to someone else, turned back around, and it was now a black guy standing there. It was not until he spoke and I recognized his voice that realized it was the same guy. Variations on that basic scenario happen to me quite often. I have never had this but this is interesting Yes. People think I am being, like, unwoke. \"Oh, I do not see race!\" So I do not tell them. I have made an effort to be less-woke and ask myself if the person I am talking to has a different skin tone than I do, because it does come up sometimes, but then I just end up mixing up ethnicities pretty extremely - I cannot tell latino and asian people apart, but only like maybe 40% of the time. I have also noticed I have confused the backgrounds of middle eastern and Ethiopian people, but map-wise this seems more reasonable.\n\nI also cannot tell accents apart, which means they are absolutely no help in trying to narrow something down (in the situations where someone says \"at home, X,\" and I am supposed to have an idea of where that is), because then we just throw every-other-background-in-existence into the mix (like maybe you are white but grew up in China and only speak Mandarin, or maybe you are asian but you grew up in Brazil and only speak Portuguese! Aghhh! So many things!)", "Harder to recognise women than men? I just had a fantastic med error at work (I am a LTC nurse, and FFS, you live independently when your leg is not broken. *Maybe* not respond to other people's names?) and it was one in a long line of womens' faces being more difficult for me (peaking with white women  in their 20s and 30s. I basically had to write off ever actually knowing who a third of my nursing school class was, knew all of the guys fine). I worked on the hall I do not work on as often, but it hit me-only 2 of the 25 residents are male, but on the other nearly half are (chance based on open rooms), and bonus, some have such distinguishing features as 'being 6'6\" ' or 'survived self-inflicted GSW to the head'. Does anyone else have it vary by sex? To me it is always been easier to recognize women. More variance in hairstyles, clothes, makeup etc. Most white men have the same outfit and the same haircut in either brown or a slightly different shade of brown, lol. The only saving factor is glasses and beards.\n\nThough honestly it depends on the person, some men have a really recognizeable presence or just a unique face and then I can recognize them even if their style is not that unique. Same with women, of course. I fill in general it is easier to recognize women, because there is more variation in style.  BUT sometimes there is a certain style a lot of women adhere to making them equally as hard.  When I was in high school I swear everyone had straight blonde hair -same shade, some cut, same length.  I feel that there are about three styles that a huge portion of baby boomer women prefer. I had a professor in college who had it *severely* (he had to be with his wife when she bought a winter coat because if she bought what looked like a particularly 'average' one he would never find her. Also collected potato mashers. Interesting guy.) and he spoke of the hairstyle thing often. And then the 'betrayal' of straightening hair/haircuts. Lol. One of the women had her hair down when the photo in the computer has it pulled back. Definitely did not help. And yeah, these are both \"older boomer\" age. Hahaa this is one of the reasons I cannot work in a LTC setting \ud83d\ude02 Ikr?\nYOU ARE A/O x4 AND SET TO BE DISCHARGED TO HOME-HOW WAS THIS SO DIFFICULT?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc8a\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f For me, it is definitely harder for me to recognize men. I work in a very male dominated field where most people come from very similar backgrounds and look the same. They almost all wear similar clothing, cut their hair the same way and have the same build.\n\nSo for me, if I see someone who is not just a white midwest boy, I am able to identify them a bit easier. It feels like I am going through a giant rolodex in my mind and playing Guess Who to narrow down the outliers. A colleague asked me today what I did to recognise people and this is my standard answer too, that I have a card index in my head and I try to narrow the options down. It is great to hear that someone else thinks this too. I have a WAY harder time recognizing women than I do men.  I think it has to do with the amount of makeup women typically wear, coupled with the lack of facial hair (which helps a TON for me with identification). Same for me. I can recognize women more successfully than men due to hair. \nShort haired people all look the same to me.", "Can you recognise faces in your dreams ? I usually cannot, I mostly do not really see any features, it is more of a blur but I know most of the time who the person is For me I think it is more accurate to say that I do not have a problem recognizing people in my dreams. It is not that they look clearer, or more identifiable, just that I know who they are, no matter what they look like.  I am not sure if I see their faces, but I know who the person is, and I know when I have dreamed of someone I do not know, so I must see facial features to some extent. I do not see faces in my dreams. If I am dreaming about someone I know, I just know it is them somehow.  That makes sense. Your brain put them there, after all. I do not dream often but, people are like colored silhouettes. Yeah, there are eyes, a nose and a mouth, but there is no detail in faces. Almost like a cartoon. Same here. I never look at faces in my dreams and it is just sort of a fuzzy blank space where a face would be if I try to remember the dream after I wake up. I definitely see faces in my dreams. I do not think they are like, accurate though? I like, it is more just an assortment of facial features (i.e. nondescript nose, mouth, eyes, eyebrows) and I just sort of, know what person it is supposed to be?

I just see the outline of the head. Very fuzzy details if someone is particularly unique looking. i see hair, nothing else. sometimes a mouth if im lucky bc i tend to focus on lips for lip reading bc of my SPD. I miss my grandad. I sort of remember his hair but everything else has faded for me. Apparently yes.  I had asked my nonfaceblind husband about this in depth once in response to someone is post.  He said he could picture a random employee at the grocery store in his head whenever he wanted!  (Just as an example.  Not limited to that person.)  That was super amazing to me.  I am more like the OP.  I can occasional get part of something, but usually I am remembering a photo.  I do not really picture things in my head visually often. I usually remember the shape of someone and nothing else. Like you said, if it is a photo, sometimes I remember some details. But that is it. Crazy!

My mother and I have the same difficulty. Oh jesus fuck yes.  Our Studio door is closed and locked so I have to get up and go open it for students as they arrive.  Remember names from faces seen through a grille?  It is been FOUR YEARS AND I STILL DISAPPOINT PEOPLE! I had a hard time with The Witcher 2. (Video game) because of this!  There were not even faces, and I could not keep up with who was who, and what was going on. Same here, I am curious if it is a thing that could come with the prosopagnosia. Why are not we all born with a nametag, it would make it so much easier. Game of Thrones is by far the hardest show I have ever watched; there is just too big a cast and for the most part they all just look the same to me. On top of that, by the time I recognize someone, they are probably about to die anyway.\n\nWith that show in particular, names did not help me, either. Usually, I am great at names, but with that many characters, I was still lost all the time. I had to have my seeing eye human summarize for me. It improved in later seasons once the show cut down to a reasonably sized and consistent cast. It is weird - I am actually pretty good at memorizing names when I try.  I was a substitute teacher for awhile, and could learn the names of the DESKS by lunch.  But I really struggle with remembering names in social situations. I have had the exact same situation you described with multiple TV shows.  I think my brain knows that names are useless information, because you cannot match them to people anyway, so it does not even try. I am having the hardest time with movies in war settings for this reason:\n\nYou start out in a training camp with new recruits (although the majority look alike, they still sometimes have a few recognizable characteristics), they get their uniform (and hats/helmets) and are suddenly all speaking the same, moving the same, acting the same. It gets even worse when they go to actual (fictional) war, where they get covered in mud, blood and mainly move around at night. I usually cannot tell who is being left behind by their appearance alone, but since I never really got to connect the names to their physical shells anyway, I am just lost.\n\nI just have to contend with \"this is a sad scene: unknown soldier A says goodbye to unknown soldier B after the latter is shot. They probably had a particularly close bond of some sort.\" yeah i think for the sake of culture i will end up powering through and just hope they kill enough people that i can start to recognize some yeah i think this is why i do not like war movies, i just do not know when i am meant to be sad about an important death I am also terrible with remembering names. My theory is cause we do not remember faces well, a big part of remembering names is attaching it to a a face as a way of committing that info to memory. Hi, same thing. Same!

Is that your experience also?  (Also, I am not great at identifying races, so it could be I am missing some racial diversity especially in black and white pictures.) We know that people are better at recognizing faces of people with familiar features, so if you live among a predominantly white population (like I do) you may theoretically perform better than someone who lives in a predominantly black population.\n\nI wonder if tests will be updated to be more racial diverse.  And if they are, I wonder if they would have to make them longer? I believe this is so that the tester gets a more accurate representation of the subject's facial recognition skills without any other visual aids. If the sex or skin colors are too varied, it gives the subject things to identify without having to look at faces. I took a test where it asked me to differentiate between a light skinned woman with red hair and a dark skinned man, and i did not feel like i learned anything from my results. But there is a huge amount of data that suggests that people are comparatively awful at recognizing people outside their own race. So it follows that a reasonable hypothesis would be that many people taking the tests who are not white would test far worse than they might of testing within their own racial group (ie a test of comparatively similar faces in another race, or gender -although I do not know that the same issues exists for gender). \n\nSo yea, if research wants to advance, remaking a few of these tests with other racial groups would be necessary. It makes sense to me that the test faces would be the same race and sex, otherwise the tests might be too easy. But I think it would be useful to test female and POC faces too. I have heard that some people with prosopagnosia cannot distinguish between male and female and cannot determine race or age based on facial features so that would be worth testing for imo. \n\nMyself I can distinguish male/female well enough but am not always able to recognize race. They could have different races/sexes for different questions though. Like maybe the first question shows you a white guy, and you have to identify him from several other white guys, and the next question is the same thing but with black women, etc. That would also show if you have trouble recognizing faces in general, or if you are better at it with particular groups of people. I dont think it matters. When I was first tested for prosopagnosia I was given a test like the photos of faces test, but with photos of doors. A quick glimpse of a photo of a door, then pick it out of a group of four. There were house doors, barn doors, office doors, church doors - every kind of door you can imagine - but I could not do it unless there was something obvious to remember like the door was red or there was a shrub in a pot beside it. What I am trying to say is that I dont necessarily agree that testing with any type of faces is the right question to ask. Perhaps the tests should focus more on pattern recognition or something similar. I was quite shocked to discover the doors issue, but subsequently realised that I cannot tell cars apart either. That was exactly my line of thinking very clearly explained.  \n\nI am white and I live in a super white area.  I actually am equally bad at recognizing all races (which is fascinating to me) but I have noticed people who seem to have no issues with facial recognition of white people confusing black people that I can easily tell apart.  Theoretically those white people do not have prosopagnosia, but may test as being face blind if the test was primarily black people.  \n\nSo with the current test, there may be a lot of false positives for people that did not grow up in a predominantly white area. That would make sense.  It would also make a multi-purpose test - Do you have prosopagnosia and do you have racial bias in your facial recognition? Difficulty recognizing objects is actually a different thing, but a related problem to prosopagnosia.  (A lot of people have both.  I think they are both types of visual agnosia, but cannot remember more than that.)  I score average on pattern and object recognition, but extremely low on facial recognition.", "This is disturbing for me! What is it like for you to watch this?  Actually, I find this really cool and inspiring for some reason. My first thought was that it shows how we are all so similar as human beings -- not that our differences do not matter or are not beautiful, but I think sometimes we forget that there is a fundamental unity to the human race -- each of us inherently valuable and deserving of respect. Watching one face merge into another just demonstrated that unity and similarity for me. It is disturbing for the normies too. This will not make sense unless you can relate but this reminds me of what breathing feels like on acid. Ahahaha cannot relate, definitely solidifies my fear of acid It is definitely a wild ride.

I am not seeing that at all. Yeah, me neither. There is a face? Yeah, its freaky cheek-eye blind with the sight of oracles to me too.", "Why do I seem to recognize some actors better than others? I watch a lot of live action movies with Hugh Jackman, and I had no idea it was him until the credits role (or I knew he acted in the movie before watching it). But somehow, when I was watching Ant Man and the Wasp, and immediately recognize Bill's actor is the same as Morpheus' actor from The Matrix. Weird that I could recognize him even though I have seen three movies with him in it (I am also counting the sequels). I think some actors are easier to recognize because they do not change their look much from movie to movie. Will Smith is an example. There is also voice to go by so long as they are not altering it for a role. On the other hand there are actors like Johnny Depp who change their look and voice so much that I do not stand a chance at recognizing them. \n\nAnd then there are the generic looking ones that are indistinguishable from each other (like Chris Pine and Chris Pratt) I watched almost all of Wedding Crashers before figuring out the actress was the same as the one in Mean Girls (Rachel McAdams). Like had no idea at all and thought it was cool this new no name actress was getting a shot at a big role lol\n\nI have a semi-photographic memory (funny, right?) so if I can picture a picture of them, I can make a connection. It kind of makes no sense that it would work that way. Like my brain can remember a 2D picture of a face but not a face? Anyone else like that? I am the complete opposite memory-wise. I remember the overall outcome of conversations but not what was actually said, to an extent. Same with pictures. I will remember how something makes me feel and the overall topic, but the details blend together dramatically. Some faces are just easier. At least in my case, it is not that I recognize no faces, it is that I can recognize about twenty and everyone gets generalized as one of them. Plus Laurence Fishburne has certain features like his gapped teeth to make it easier.\n\nI would be very surprised if anyone here has difficulties recognizing Benedict Cumberbatch but I there is a bunch of white male actors I cannot tell apart for the life of me. My theories:\n\n1. Distinct features.  Either they have an usual features for actors or their demographic is less commonly represented in that type of media (for example, films from certain periods may have a ton of blonde, white young women, but not many older black women.)  If you have access to an audience reaction, this can help you know someone is particularly well known.\n\n2. Type cast.  The person kind of always plays the same role.  Similar hair, clothes, and mannerisms.  This is especially true if they are in a type of video that lets you recognize the character easily.  (Lots of dialogue, distinct characters, etc.)\n\n3. Screen time.  I can learn actors in TV shows, because I see the actor more without them changing their look all the time.  (If I see someone in ten different movies, but I do not realize they are the same person, I am not learning to recognize them.) Although some of it is vocal recognition. I feel like I usually recognize Chris Pratt in movies, I think it is his voice. I also do not know who Chris Pine is though so maybe I think they are the same person \ud83d\ude02 Always fun, too, where the same actor is playing multiple roles in the same movie, but it is supposed to be a subtle and deliberate literary aspect instead of just for comedy or because the movie character themself is dressing up as different people.\n\n*Wizard of Oz*, for example, has much the same cast in Oz as it does in Kansas, and it is supposed to indicate that the Oz-native characters are either Dorothy's reimagining of the people she knows in her life, or at least parallels in some way.\n\nLikewise, in *Peter Pan* productions, Mr Darling is traditionally played by the same actor as Captain Hook, and the audience is supposed to recognize this and consider it part of the metastructure.\n\nFailing to spot this means you are missing out on a part of the structural underpinnings of the story, and part of what the author or director is trying to say about links between those characters. The wizard of oz is how we realized I was face blind. My mom was trying to talk about how, was not it clever how they cast it like that? And I was like, ??? He played captain kirk in the new star trek movies. I thought Chris Pine and Chris Pratt were the same person for years. I did not know that about either, now I have to rewatch them. That is a really interesting twist.\n\nI have the same issues with stage shows where the cast is changed around to play different characters and there are jokes about how two people can never meet. I had to have it explained that they were all the same actor - then it made sense! Benedict Cumberbatch should be an easy one I guess but no. I did not recognize Dr StrAnge was in 1917 until it was pointed out to me... this happens to me! there is a few actors i can almost always recognize, i think it has to do with defining features, voice, or they are usually typecast into the same kind of role.\n\nfor example, the Rock is an actor i have always been able to recognize, but the other day i watched SkyScraper with my sisters and in the opening scene, the Rock is decked out in military uniform and has a helmet on and i did not realize it was him until he started talking and i heard his voice. i guess i relied on his bald head and visible muscles more than i realized lol", "Hi! I do not have prosopagnosia, but I learned about it in my psychology class today and just found this sub while trying to learn more. I have some questions that my teacher did not have an answer for and I would really appreciate it if you all could answer them :) Please forgive me if any of these are dumb questions, they were just the first ones that came to mind!\n\n1. Can you distinguish between the faces of animals? For example I have two dogs who, in certain lighting, look like a nearly identical color, same breed, height, and build with no distinguishing markings in their fur, but I can tell them apart easily because their faces are shaped differently. People who do not see them as often cannot figure out which dog is which, but it is usually extremely obvious to me since i have memorized their faces. I am wondering if the same thing that causes human face blindess would also translate to animals.\n\n2. Do you all see faces in situations where there are none? Like for example when I look at the fronts of cars or trucks they often looks like goofy faces to me. Or things like rock or cloud formations that have shapes that vaguely look like a face will jump out to me, do people with prosopagnosia not experience this?\n\n3. Can you all remember the faces of emojis? Like can you visualize a specific emoji face you want to use without looking at it? Or since they all have the same basic face with different emotions does that not apply? Also does something like this \":)\" or this \":(\" automatically stand out to you as a smily face and frowny face, or do you just naturally read it as a colon parenthesis? (Again, really sorry if these are dumb questions!!)\n\nThanks in advance! :) I have very mild prosopagnosia, but i will answer since no one else has. \n\n1. No, I cannot really distinguish animal faces, but as you say that is pretty normal among humans. \n\n2. I sometimes see faces in inanimate objects, although I seem to do it less than other people. \n\n3. Distinguishing between emojis is extremely easy for me. They are not processed by the same part of the brain that processes real faces.  1. Yes? Maybe? The stakes are way lower, so if that is a thing, it is probably not noticed nearly as often. \n2. I do this, presumably as often as people without the condition. Things like car headlights, etc. I do not believe there is a correlation.\n3. Yes. I am not an expert but I would presume that human facial features are far more complex than a 2D computer graphic. It is not a matter of not understanding what a frown or smile shape is. \n\nImagine this...\n\nYou see flowers and plants a lot. Maybe you have some in your house. You certainly have some you see daily on your walk to and from class. Maybe a tree is right outside your window. There are plants you see a LOT. But if you saw that same plant out of context, would you notice? If your house plant was repotted (different outfit) and put in your classroom, would you recognize it as the plant you have at home? I am not talking about swapping daisies for tulips. Every daisy is different. Slightly different color, different number of leaves, number of petals, size of stem. If you had to draw a flower you see every day, would you remember that level of detail? \n\nThat is how I feel about people. I see them when I look at them. But once they are not right in front of me, those details slip away unless something was incredibly striking. I cannot recall eye color. They were either tan, black, or hispanic - I honestly cannot really recall. Hair was medium? I did not notice it was crazy long or crazy short, so somewhere between a bob and down to their lower back.  1) I have never been in the situation where I have had to try to distinguish two identical animals by their faces. As a general rule I can distinguish animals just fine, I do not know if facial recognition would even come into play here since they are not human faces.\n\n2) I do see faces in inatimate objects sometimes. I am not sure if it is as much as those with normal facial recognition as I have never had normal facial recognition. I am unsure if all people with prosopagnosia retain this ability, but my guess would be that some of those with severe recognition issues would not. Prosopagnosia is a spectrum of recognition issues.\n\n3) I cannot visualize emoji faces but this is due to my aphantasia and not my prosopagnosia (I cannot visualize anything). In regards to being able to differentiate between emojis or other drawn faces, of course I can and I would bet everyone else with prosopagnosia can as well. I think issues with faces for the most part only apply to actual human faces or hyper-realistic renderings of them. 1. I have two black cats who is faces are pretty much indistinguishable to me, I tell them apart by their size (one is slightly smaller than the other), their sounds (different meows, one's claws tap on the floor) and their tails (one has a little curl at the end of his tail).\n2. Not very often, but it does happen.\n3. Yes. Emojis are symbols not faces. 1) Not really, but I think most people cannot. It is a metaphor I some times use to try to explain face blindness to people. Most people cannot tell your dogs apart, because the differences are super subtle. But if you spend a lot of time with your dogs you can probably learn the subtleties. That Is kind of how it is with me. I cannot tell the two brown haired white guys apart in a grocery store, but if they were my coworkers I would eventually find ways to tell them apart. \n\n2&amp;3) Yeah. Cartoony faces are totally different than real life faces, because the differences are made to be super obvious and exaggerated. When you see faces in fronts of cars or whatever you are seeing it more like a cartoon face than a human face. \n\n Apt description, I love the flower analogy.\n\nI can also relate to the eye colour thing. As the prosopagnosia is comorbid with ASC for me, I tend to avoid eye contact, which adds an extra challenge.\n\nI rely on peoples voices to identify them, then their clothing and the context I am seeing them in. That is, am I expecting to see this individual in this location.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; Exactly! This is a perfect description of our problem. I would add:  \n1. Yes to the extent the fur pattern is distinct (just like we would always recognize someone with a beehive, monocle, tattoo, etc).\n\n2. Yes, basic pattern recognition (and preference for facial arrangements of symbols) is not the same mechanism that is impaired in prosopagnosics.\n\n3. Yes, emojis are simplistic stimuli with distinctive features. 1. Probably not.\n\n2. Yes.\n\n3.  Yes. I equate emojis to cartoon characters. Cartoon characters are no problem to differentiate or remember. \n\nFor contrast: I just heard a Monty Python meme a few hours ago so this example is still fresh in my mind: Long before I had heard of prosopagnosia I had watched The Life of Brian, and Holy Grail. I had absolutely no clue that the same guys were playing numerous characters in each movie. I probably saw each movie a half dozen times before I realized this, and it was their voices that clued me in, not their faces. 1.  I have never noticed an issue, but I recognize people often by silhouette/general shape, so I probably do with dogs too.  I have a friend who has two very similar Australian shepherds and I do not know which is which.   The might be normal though.\n2. I think I remember seeing faces where there were none when I was a child, but I do not now.  \n3. Yeah emojis are seen just normally.  In fact, I am really good at seeing expressions or micro-expressions on peoples faces as well...like scary good at it.  I just do not always know who that person is at first.  The facial communication is 100% there for me, just not the identity recognition.\n\nBrains are weird.  1. I cannot tell extremely similar animals apart. But it is possible that if I owned two of the same breed of animal, I would eventually learn their faces. Just as I can recognize human faces after a long while of being exposed to them.  \n2. I do not see faces in cars unless someone points them out. I also have difficulty recognizing cars (which is common for people with prosopagnosia). I recognize my own car by the license plate and by certain dents/cosmetic damage it has. But if I am looking at clouds I do sometimes see things that look like faces to me. \n3. As someone else pointed out, cartoons are processed by a different part of the brain (but for some reason the face recognition portion of the brain also recognizes cars). I can probably draw several emoji from memory. I have heard also that prosopagnosiacs tend to prefer animated over live action because we can recognize the characters better. Definitely true for me.\n\n Same here. John Cleese was the only one I could recognize with any regularity, since his features are so unique and he is much taller than the rest. I especially could not tell who was who when they dressed in drag, because of the wigs.  I second all of this, with the exception that I can remember color. It is more of a problem in the 3D details, like nose shape, eyebrow width, etc.  &gt; Brains are weird.\n\nThey totally are! I will agree with the other comments, but add a little bit to question one.\n\nI have three cats in my house.  One is grey tabby with white paws.  One is a ginger. The other is white with black splotches.  Disregarding fur color and pattern, I can see that they all have distinct faces.  The white one has a delicate jaw and cheekbones, but a blunt boxer's nose.  The ginger has what I would call a classic cat face.  The grey has an oversized forehead, a wide nose, and mildly crossed eyes that make him look perpetually a bit confused.  Years ago there was a stray cat in the neighborhood who was the spitting image of the white one, both in fur and face.  I would bet $$ that mine is her daughter.\n\nIn any case, I can describe all of them from memory without looking at them, especially their distinctive features.  I can close my eyes and visualize them - but it is a lot like trying to visualize the people close to me.  It is like assembling a puzzle picture one piece at time.  Nose looks like this, eyes look like this, cheeks and mouth... whiskers... I have to add it up into a whole a piece at a time.  And if their expression changes I need to start over.  I think that I memorize their faces the same way that I memorize human faces.  It takes effort and it absolutely floors me that other people do not need to expend effort to memorize faces.  \n\nOther big factors (that other folks have brought up) is that there are not that many animals in my general daily sphere.  The few that I do see are easily distinguished by their coat color and pattern.  Life would be easy if I only needed to recognize four people. Also,the cats that I call Fluffy instead of Mr Furpants do not get offended.  They just need to see if I am holding treats.  No treats? ^OK byyyeee... 1. Yes. We had two female Weimaraners, and I could easily tell them apart. However, while I am pretty sure I could tell them apart by their faces, even 45 years later, I mostly used their bodies to tell them apart. \n\nSide note, I think the instant recognition of faces that (most) people have (and that we lack) does not apply to animals. I think other people do what we do for people when they see an animal. \n\n2. Yes, all the time. It is fun finding faces in things.\n\n3. I am old and do not really do emojis :)  Just gunna echo: this description is perfect. Someone a while back posted the perfect explanation of what pros is like:\nEver played an RPG with a limited number of faces for NPCs so the guard in one town looks just the merchant in another? Think Skyrim. It is not that I do not know what faces are, it is that the faces just are not distinguishable from each other. I usually compensate with stuff like hair, clothing choices and voice. When Thor and Captain America grew beards it became hard to tell them apart.  1. Yes, to an extent.  I seem to be a little better than average on differentiating specific animals.  I think it is because I am used to paying attention to details to try to tell people apart.\n\n2. Yes.\n\n3. Yes.  I am not good at visualizing anything in my head (not sure if that is prosopagnosia or separate) but an emoji is a symbol and simple/easy to remember.\n\n\nSo your teacher probably told you that there is a system in your brain that helps people recognize faces; it works differently than your recognition of cars, fish, or chairs.  The thing about prosopagnosia is that system does not seem to work right.  Recognizing other people's face is not different or easier than any other thing I am familiar with.  People do not use their special facial recognition system on animals, face shapes, or emojis.  Face blindness does not mean that you do not know what a face is or what face look like, just that you have trouble seeing a face is a whole, easily to remember unit. If the animals are mine, yes. Otherwise no. I might notice breed. Yes, as many have said, pattern recognition is different. I see faces in clouds and emoji are different, although I encode them verbally- I remember the face with hearts for eyes but all the slightly different smiles? Like all the slight variations of a single line? Not sure how many there are.  I have never been officially diagnosed but here:\n1. I am MUCH more likely o recognize people by their dog than by their faces.  I am MUCH more likely to remember a dog of cat than a human. &gt;1. Can you distinguish between the faces of animals\n\nYes, to an extent - obviously I can recognise my own pets. But often I am caused a great deal of embarrassment and unintentionally offend people as I recognise their dogs and not them.\n\n&gt;2. Do you all see faces in situations where there are none?\n\nYes, I can create a face in the clouds or see a pattern that looks like faces.\n\n&gt;3. Can you all remember the faces of emojis? \nYes. No problems with any 2D cartoon renderings, similar to the recognition of \"faces\" where there are none. \n\n Thank you for the flower analogy! I am going to use that when I try and explain my issue to people  1.) Animals that are well known to me, sure. Same thing with people. Context is also important. The trouble arises with people you do not see regularly, or seeing people out of context. Even those relatively well known to you can take a few moments to recognize in a strange place.\n\n\n\n2.) sure. Immediately. It is not actually seeing faces that is the problem, but recognizing them as someone you know,  or what telling them apart. \n\n3.) Same as above. I see faces, I see every feature clearly. The problem is recognition. Do i know that face? Who is it? Is that the same guy?\n\n\nI do not know much about the condition, or how it manifests in different people. I only recently realized I had a real problem... one with a name!\n\nI always I assumed I was just inattentive idiot. Unless you were someone I currently saw all the time, I would likely be unsure if I knew you. I never remembered people or their names. Following movies was always difficult because I would think 2 or 3 people were the same person. Unless there were obvious stark differences between characters- size, race, hair color, age, etc.. - I would never know who anyone was.\n\nNow, I heard this could also be caused by right brain injuries. When I was 14 (now 50), I had exactly that, though after a few months all seemed to return to normal.\n\nI do not remember if I had the problem before. I think I did, but have grown uncertain the more I think about it.\n 1. Not always. I volunteer at a shelter and mix the cats up a lot.\n2. Yes, I do. \n3. I do not really picture stuff in my mind very well, but I do think of what emoji I want.", "Tips For Job Interviews? My wife has very bad Prosopagnosia and as a result social anxiety. She has a big job interview next week (three hours, meeting with lots of different people). Any tips on how to cope with interviews? Writing down all the interviewer names and what they are wearing so if they walk back in she can recognize them? If she is worried it might be better to take the heat out of the situation by telling the interviewers up front. No need for a long explanation - how about a few words and a printed handout in case they want to read more about it later. You might be able to copy and paste something from  or similar. Your wife should use all of the coping mechanisms that she has been practicing all of her life.  There is no reason to try something new at this late date.\n\nTrying to explain face-blindness to new acquaintances never goes well, and it seems totally inappropriate to bring it up in a job interview. \n\nI have a lot of experience interviewing and hiring people for professional positions.  Focus on discussing the job and your qualifications.  Smile.  Be friendly. I would definitely not tell the interviewers.  First of all, face blindness is not well known, so she would have to explain it.  That would make her memorable is the weird candidate which, in most fields, could not be good.  Second, although a disability should not interfere with hiring, it may make them concerned that she would not be able to do her job well and less likely to hire her.\n\nThe exception would be if she realizes she did not remember someone that she clearly should have and it caused offense.  (So like if an interviewer walks back out, comes back in a few minutes later, and she introduces herself not realizing that it is the same person, and they correct her and look unhappy.)  In that case, I would briefly say that she was not good at facial recognition and try to follow their cues about whether to say more.  (More would probably be better received in a social services job that did not involve working with the public than a business job interfacing with customers.)\n\nI do not know if writing down names of the interviewers is a good idea.  One is that I think it is better when you just meet people to not know someone is name than to say it wrong (and some may be dressed similarly.)  Two is that although she could probably write it quickly without it being weird, finding the person's name on the list would be weird.\n\nLearning to cope better with the anxiety should help, so she might explore that.  (Not something one can master by next week and social anxiety is a LOGICAL reaction to prosopagnosia and understanding social rules, but she could look up some tricks for general anxiety.)  The reasoning being is that she cannot control her ability to recognize people (beyond the basic tricks) but she can address her anxiety.  And being anxious cannot help recognizing people I am sure.\n\nBut practical things:\n\n1. I have interviewed people as one of four to six people doing the interviewing for a half an hour interview.  About half of the candidates do not remember meeting the people that interviewed them.  We use name tags, so that interviewers can remember who they are talking to.  When people with normal facial recognition skills are nervous and focused on what they are saying to a bunch of new people, they sometimes are not great at remembering people either.  So it is likely that she will not be expected to recognize anyone unless she is hired.\n\n2. She should pretend that she does not know names instead of faces.  Now using a person's name is a great tactic, but forgetting a name of someone she met once is not socially offensive.  In fact, sometimes showing a little weakness makes you more likable, so it could be an advantage if otherwise she is pretty together.  Saying something like, \"Please remind me your name,\" is fine...if she is positive she has met them before.  Otherwise, just leave off the name.\n\n3. Follow the person's lead and be vague.  Let us say she was being shown around.  When running into people that she is not sure if she has met, a friendly smile and variations of \"hi,\" work well.  If they stick out their hand and introduce themselves, she can assume they have not met yet and add, \"I am meeting so many people today, I am afraid I will not remember everyone is names.  Please remind me your name next time I see you.\"  If they keep walking, she should not do anything.  If they start talking to her without introducing themselves, they probably (but not necessarily) met her before, so she should listen to the conversation for clues.\n\n4. Just use regular good interview strategies.  I bet she has a lot she can bring to the job, and she just needs to focus on proving those things. Business cards are my crutch.  If you are all seated at a table, lay them out in front of you in the same order that the people are sitting.  If you also have a notebook and pen on the table, it does't look weird at all.  If someone does not have a card, I will surreptitiously write down their name a few minutes after introductions.  Preferably during the corporate presentation when everyone else is tuned out and checking their phones.\n\nIt has been awhile since I have needed to interview, but I am in a job that routinely puts me into rooms full of strangers wearing business casual.  It was a recurring nightmare until I saw someone else using this trick.\n\nIt also helps that people tend to return to the same chair if they leave the room then return later.  The higher up a person is in the organization, the less likely this will be.  I think it is an anxiety/comfort thing.  If introduced to the VP or Plant Manager they are also less likely to give you their card.  Those are the people that need to be memorized, and they are also the most likely to pop in unexpectedly later in the day.\n\nBest of luck to your wife.", "do my symptoms match with this condition? i posted on some medical subs as well, but figured i might as well do right to the source as well. i have been noticing this more, and i do not know if it is something everybody does, but i am a little concerned. like the title says, i cannot recall faces in my mind when i try to. i recognize people when i see them, but it is mostly based on voice, hair, glasses, etc, and only if i have known them for a while. i normally have good visual memory (vivid daydreams, reading books more as movies than text), but when i try to conjure my parents, who i see everyday, in my head, there is just... nothing. is this prosopagnosia, or do i just have a crap memory? thanks :) Have you wantered into this sub yet? r/aphantasia may be part of the equasion for you. It might be. Do you regularly get approached by people who you do not recognize, but they seem to know who you are? Do you have trouble telling people apart who have the same haircut? \n\nAlso take a look at some of the deep fake videos that people posted here - can you recognize the faces that were superimposed onto different bodies? i just did, thanks for the suggestion! i have actually got a pretty vivid imagination, but only for places, not people not sure about seeing people in public, since i did not leave the house much before all this, but i have always had trouble telling people apart who look similar. i have misidentified my parents before in school pick up lines when i was a kid, and telling the guys (all pretty much have the same haircut and we do not live in a very ethnically diverse area) in my school apart is/was a daily issue. looking through the videos and pics here, i am not convinced some of them have more than one person, cuz it looks like the same person in just different outfits. Then in my (not professional) opinion, definitely yes. The Susilo lab website is private currently, but when it opens back up I recommend signing up for their face blindness test. You might be able to find similar tests on other websites if you search. That is pretty close to how I would describe myself. I do not generally have an issue in day-day life because you normally meet people in context e.g. yuor colleagues at the same desk as yesterday. Bumping into people is harder and actors in different shows is basically impossible.\n\nThere are online tests for proso. I scored in the potentially have an issue range. That might help you get to the bottom of it. Ultimately, I am not sure a label matters as much as understanding that you are at the extreme of the bell curve in terms of recognising faces. Then you can develop coping strategies accordingly. this is really helpful, thank you. i am planning to talk with my psychologist next time we (virtually) meet and see if she is got any ideas, but i will try some of the tests as well. yeah not a professional but \"cannot recognize your own parents\" is apparently a big and unusual issue. i mean i have been like this my whole life and i cannot tell my mom from any other short white lady with a Karen haircut but i am told that for most humans it is pretty unthinkable to be unable to recognize your own parents lol Just be warned I found those tests extremely stressful and uncomfortable, they are just streams of neutral faces with no discernible features like hair or beards. Same here\nI can recognise people but cannot imagine their faces Just to add: people with aphantasia can still be avid daydreamers and have a rich imagination, it is just that we have poor visualization skills, etc. but since you also mentioned the \"reading a book feels more like watching a movie\" then I would say it is probably Proso.", "I think my problem is more about remembering faces than recognizing them Or thinking I remember faces better than I do, I am not sure. Does anyone else relate?\n\nLike my parents are always recognizing actors, saying \"I know him! What is he from?\" and I will try to contribute to guesses of what actor I remember looked similar. Almost every time they will actually burst out laughing or come near to it because my guess apparently looks nothing like the person they are looking at. Sometimes I will argue them about it because I am sure they look similar, but then they will pull up a picture of the actor I named and I can tell, by comparing, that there is not much resemblance.\n\nNot sure if that made much sense lol I have notice I memorize moments in time  and that people\u2019s constantly changing expressions look like different people to me. Yes, this is what it is like for me too. I have read that some people actually want to distinguish prosopagnosia (cannot see that a face is a face) from prosopamnesia (cannot remember or recognize a specific face). Can you tell if you are looking at two pictures if they are the same person?  Like can you check someone is ID with them standing there and be reasonably sure it is that person? As I read, these are 2 distinct syndroms, but really difficult to tell witch one you have, because symptoms are really similar.\n\nActually, since I documented myself on Prosop', I feel also more like I cannot remember, than \"I cannot recognize\". But papers I read make me think this \"felling\" is not enough to diferenciate between Prosopagnosia and Prosopamnesia\n\n(basically, different part of the brain is disfunctioning, causing finaly that your memory does not get the face data; for Pspagnosia, caused by face regognition part malfunctioning; Pspamnesia because of face memory mechanisms)", "Do you ever get to a point where you question if you really are face blind, only to have an incident that restores your faith? I was picking up my sister to go away and I texted that I was there and she said \"We will be right out\".  In my mind I am trying to figure out who else was going with us.  My sister comes out and this other girl then hops in the backseat.  I said hi, I was tempted to introduce myself.  During the drive I am trying to figure out who this person was.  It was not till we got to our destination that she started talking a bit more and I suddenly realized it was my nephew's girlfriend who I have met dozens of times before. I had not had any real hiccups for awhile, and got into a lulled sense of security I suppose. Then there was a seminar offered to my company by a membership group we are a part of. Our top two owners were going, and they also wanted me to go because my department was the reason we were in the membership group, and I was the one who knew the other people in the group.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe got to the seminar and sense it was in a different place than the typical meetings, I did not recognize a single person in that meeting. I sat there the whole time in a seminar that did not really apply to me wondering if I should have told the owners I had prosopagnosia! I finally did start telling employers and clients. It was just too embarrassing when people thought I was deliberately blanking them if we met in public or at a conference. A couple of people have still been very rude about it, but most people have said, oh yeah, I have heard of that, bummer, I will try to remind you who I am. Oh yes, when I discovered that two different people in my life (a girl named Sarah who I went to night classes with, and a girl named sarah who I worked with at a coffee shop on the weekends), were in fact the same person! \n\nCommon name, different contexts, I thought it was two different people until she asked me why I was so friendly to her at work, but always walked past her in classroom. ", "What are some things that someone without prosopagnosia can do to help? My cousin has just been diagnosed and whilst it is a condition I knew existed, it is admittedly one I know very little about. \n\nWhat sort of things can be done to help, if anything at all. What are some difficulties we should be aware of, that he may struggle with in life. \n\nIt is something I have just found out about so I do not know much about his particular recognition issues in detail at the moment. When you go places with him, act as his facial recognition buddy.  For example, use people's names in conversations so he knows who you guys are talking to.  \n\nDo not assume that he knows even close family.  I had two cousins that I could not tell apart for about 30 years...and now they have very different facial hair, so they better not change it.  Just say who you are if you see him, especially unexpectedly.  Of course, he may recognize you.\n\nBasically any social situation where you are expected to recall who people are (which is pretty much all of them) is challenging. Thanks for that, I would not have thought of some of this as it would not be part of my ordinary interactions. \n\nLuckily none of us will ever get offended if/when he does not know who we are without prompting, but others outside of the family may so do I will definitely remember this. I will second that advice: I have a few family members who will go out of the way to use names of whoever we are talking to, and it is so very much appreciated!  I have spent most of my life pretending I know who I am talking to, hoping to figure things out from context before anyone catches on.  I am very good at it.  But it is SO much nicer to just *know* who is who! Thank you! Oh this gives me anxiety! yeah just say people's names a lot. My partner will often help me out by sort of announcing who someone is. Let us say were in the grocery store and a coworker is there. He will say hi when we bump into them and he will say \" ah if it isnt my favourite coworker anton, you remember anton from Company right babe?\" And it is not awkward for the other people but it helps me. If we have more time, like spotting someone from further away he will also say where I met them or what the person is wearing so that when we get closer to them I can also say hi like I know who they are Say hello when you see him out and about.", "Next time I have to explain prosopagnosia to someone, I am just going to show them this tweet and say \"this, but all the time\" &amp;#x200B;\n\n", "When are your side effects the worst? I can tell you about mine, but what about yours?  My prosopagnosia was the worst in the dark.  I thought I recognized people that I did not know, then you see their face in the light and you feel very embarrassed that you thought that was who you thought it was (like a friend from middle school or a good friend)  \nI do get it in general sometimes where I feel like I recognize someone from a movie and they are not even an actor.  It is not as bad as it used to be, but in the dark, it rears its ugly face. From a distance. This is probably actually an eyesight problem, but I wait until I get VERY close to someone before I think I am recognizing them.\nExample scenario:\nI am walking down the sidewalk, and spot my roommate walking the opposite direction maybe a hundred feet away (I would really be recognizing their clothes). I will keep my head down, and watch them with my eyes as we approach. That way by the time we are close enough that we will exchange a wave, my head is still down but I can watch with my eyes to check it is really them. This saves me a lot of \u201chey, why did not you wave back earlier?\u201d And vice versa, waving at someone I have literally never seen before. When I do not have a physical location to tie people to. It helps me to think back to where people were standing in a group or where they were sitting at a table. If I did not learn people's names in a group and recite them to myself shortly after, I will not remember them.\n\nThings get even worse when there are multiple people with the same or similar physical description. For example, last time I met a group, there were two similar people. I was saying people's names again before heading off, and I got told by one person, \"Haha, no, that is the *other* tall white guy with glasses.\" And I thought to myself, *Okay, it makes sense I got them mixed up. But* ***thank goodness*** *I am not getting teased about not being able to tell apart minorities.* *...Also, they summed up how I usually recognize people surprisingly well!* (Like my brain might go \"short black guy,\" but if there are two or three \"short black guys\" in a group, well oop: it will take a bit to tell them apart or establish other features for me to recognize them by.) When I am sleep deprived. This might seem obvious, except that it is a whole other level of poor recognition.", "How to be diagnosed? I have a suspicion that I am moderately face blind. I use people's hair and clothing to remember them... Which means if I see them on a different day I have a hard time recognizing them. In college, I often had people greet me in passing and I had no idea who they were... But once I spend enough time w someone, I can remember their face. \n\nI tried an online test but it didnt control for hair and clothes so I was able to easily pass it. Thoughts?", "Not sure if I have mild/ face blindness. I have always had a better time with names than faces and an even better time with usual clothing and way someone walks than their face as well. I did the famous faces test on the side var but I also do not pay attention to famous people/faces as much. \n\nIt can take me a while to put a name to a face even when i do pay attention and the usual circumstances help a lot more too. \n\nI hate how people judge self diagnosis. Honestly I hate having to but the world just does not work that way and for a lot of people, especially with mild/non classic presentations, its just a lot harder to get diagnosed/help than it should be. \n\nIs it a sign of face blindness that when I do dream in pictures, I am not sure if the people have faces? I do not remember dreams often/picture things in my dreams but I am not sure if they do have faces when I do. No one in my dreams has a face but I generally know who everyone is. It is more that their faces are blurry and unrecognizable not that they lack one completely. So I see lots of people in my dreams and I somehow know who they are. Every once in a while I wake up and realize I was dreaming about someone I did not know and then I spend a few days feeling unsettled about it. It is probably just my brain incorporating a random person but it always feels really weird!\n\nFace blindness is a continuum. Some people have it worse than others. It sounds like you have symptoms consistent with it even if you were not officially diagnosed. I would think most people on here, myself included, have never been diagnosed by a doctor. I am totally with you on the self-diagnosis thing. Doctors are very expensive and often do not have expertise in conditions like prosapagnosia. Your self-assessment that you are not good with faces is probably pretty accurate.\n\nI tend not to imagine visuals at all when I am dreaming. I just somehow know what is happening and might feel bodily sensations. Faceblindess is usually fairly apparent when you become ego dystonic to it. I have found it is a \u201cyou definitely have it\u201d or you do not. Yeah there is definitely a continuum aspect to it, but similar to IQ/ID there is a pretty apparent cut-off/line. To me, your case sounds more like a mild memory issue within normal range. Some people are just bad with faces, but are not pathological cases. You have compensated through pretty typical means by assessing other bodily constants. \n\nDreams would **not** be a good metric for facial blindness. People have multiple dreams a night but forget most of them. You may experience faces in a dream and forget it upon wake, or your mind just does not prioritize facial construction in it is dreams. Dreams in general are an iffy psychometric no matter what you are talking about.\n\nI *am* a critic of self-diagnosis, given I am going to school for psychological assessment and diagnostics (In a masters of psychological science currently). That being said, prosopagnosia is a *really* special circumstance. The value of a diagnosis is in how it can benefit your daily life, especially when it comes to accommodations. However for. prosopagnosia there is not anything a diagnosis can really give you besides a sense of knowing. There is no formal accommodations which can be given and there is no treatment method you can pursue (given it is usually either neurodevelopmental or due to lesion/trauma which you would receive other healthcare for). Why would I, as a diagnostician, waste your money and my time for a professional diagnosis that is not really going to help you? This is one of the few cases where the usual logic and rhetoric of anti-self Dx **does not** apply. I hope you can keep that informed opinion in mind when you feel down about Self-Dx in this instance. I know people preach against self-diagnosis and TBH I understand where they are coming from. HOWEVER prosopagnosia is different story that can be very difficult to find someone to state the obvious. As was said to me, when I was diagnosed by a therapist, close yoru eyes picture a face of someone you know. What do you see? Do you see eyes, nose lips, or nothing. If you see nothing or shadows then you probably are faceblind. I herd of proso YEARS before I was diagnosed but I never felt that was me. The pictures usually portrayed are the worse cases and be being born this way did not find myself anything like that. Recently I drew a picure of a face how I remember it, and how another person remembers faces and I realized I am pretty bad off. For me it was a accidental diagnosis by a sharp eyed therapist but to be completely honest I do not think I would have other wise been aware enough to self diagnose. I am encouraging you to reach out and do not be to quick to say it is or is not. But if you are honestly having trouble recognizing people you should then you probably are. it is funny because i scored okay on the face blindness test that everyone says is the gold star for proso, but have had trouble recognizing several of my closest friends and family members. i thought this was normal growing up but often was confronted by classmates and family friends who would become irritated or even very offended that i failed to recognize them. \n\none of the most memorable experiences i had was when my high school gf\u2019s mom approached me at the store and i had absolutely no clue who she was. the whole time we dated if i saw her outside of her own house i did not know who she was or would mistake her for someone else. another experience i had that stood out was that i had two classmates who had a similar height but apparently look nothing alike and for the first year i knew them i would constantly swap their names to the point they became mad at me because they thought i was doing it to upset them. i think proso can be really hard to diagnose formally, so if you believe that you experience it based on your symptoms, i think it is fair to say you likely have it. Anything can happen in dreams, so I do not think they are a good way to determine whether you have any form of face blindness.\n\nProsopamnesia might describe what you experience -  I find it describes my experience more accurately, and I know I am not full-on face blind.\n\nI am not a fan of self-diagnosis, but the other comments make good points about why this is an ok exception. Also, a recurring theme is that people will pay more attention if you explain that you may not recognise them in future because your are 'prosopamnesiac', rather than 'not good with faces'. \n\nYou know you have difficulty recognising people, there is not much more a formal assessment is going to tell you, and not much that you could do with an 'official diagnosis' anyhow. You (and I) know we find it more difficult to recognise people than the average person, and this subreddit is a good place to find out how other people  with a similar problem (many of whom have worse recognition abilities than us, or non at all) deal with life, and where we can share frustration or amusement about the situations we find ourselves in.  \n\nAs a mid-way between formal diagnosis and self-diagnosis, you could find and participate in a study which is examining people who have difficulty recognising people, you could take part and see what the researchers conclude about you. They crop up from time to time, try a web search, especially of nearby universities, usually Psychology or Brain/Neuroscience departments. (I did one and the research assistant ended up giggling as I attempted to match famous names with their faces!) Desktop version of /u/Violet_Londoner's link: &lt;\n\n --- \n\n ^(( ^(Beep Boop.  Downvote to delete) Lol about swapping names, my mom has a friend and two of her kids took me a long time to be able to tell who was who. So frustrating! Yes that does fit a lot better! Thank you for sharing it! Funnily enough I actually had aphantasia most of my life until last year and do not have episodic memory at all, a condition called severely deficient autobiographical memory r/sdam, images are the only mental sense I have other than thinking in words. Here is a sneak peek of /r/SDAM using the ( of the year!\n\n\\#1: ( | (  \n\\#2: ( | (  \n\\#3: (\n\n----\n^^I am ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ( ^^| ( ^^| ( Just throwing out: I do not pay attention to famous people either.  I thought it was because I just was not interested, but now I am pretty sure it is because it is difficult for me to identify who, for example, actors are and it usually does not matter that I do not know, so my brain does not see that as important information.  So I think face blindness caused my lack of attention to famous faces which decreased my performance on that particular test...which would probably already be bad.  I actually do slightly better on the famous faces test, because I can sometimes guess based on demographic clues (age of photo plus race/gender of person plus style of photo and it is somebody that would be recognized especially in the US but ideally internationally...often that narrows it down a lot.) SDAM is having a hindered autobiographical (semantic+episodic) memory, not an absence of episodic memory. Having no episodic memory would be more like amnesia, because you would not remember your past at all. &gt; If people with SDAM have no memory, how can they function in day-to-day life?\n\n&gt; The impairment in SDAM is specific to\u00a0episodic autobiographical memory\u00a0or the vivid reliving of past events. Other forms of memory that do not require this type of \"mental time\u00a0travel\" are preserved. These same learning and memory processes support normal acquisition of language, skills, and factual knowledge (such as the ability to remember the name of your school or the last four presidents).\n\n&gt; People differ in their memory abilities. What makes SDAM special?\n\n&gt; There are individual differences in memory abilities. What makes SDAM different is the degree of impairment. We are currently investigating whether SDAM reflects an extreme expression on the low end of normal variation or whether it should be considered a separate category on its own.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the FAQ section. Yes. I have read it, the phrase in your quote you need to pay attention is \"vivid reliving of past events\". It does not say anything about the inability to recall those memories, although if you do more research you will find a trend in studies that indicates a deficiency in the number of remembered events, and not just information about those events.\n\nThey repeat that aforementioned phrase in other ways too, emphasis mine.\n\n&gt; SDAM refers to the **lifelong inability to mentally relive or reexperience personal past events.** Memory changes due to aging, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia have a different origin and are not considered part of the SDAM syndrome.\n\nI have spoken to a few researchers on it, as I am writing a book on this a few other neurodivergence's. None of the researchers I have talked to have indicated that it is a complete lack of episodic memory, including the people at BRRI UofT, who run that website. Someone with SDAM may have less episodic memories, so they only remember a relatively limited number of events from their past, compared to the average person. But SDAM is not a complete lack of episodic memory. You need to know that episodic memory still includes factual data about specific events, which is the basis for autobiographical memory, it is just that the fullness of the event being recalled is lacking in the fidelity that most other people have. If you have no episodic memory at all, that would mean you do not remember any events from your past, and that is called Severe Episodic Amnesia, which is a completely different condition.\n\nFor example. \"Roses generally are red\" is semantic memory. \"I saw red roses at my grandmas house\", is episodic memory. So when SDAM comes into play, you would not be able to say *when* you saw those roses at your grandmas house, you may not be able to say when was the last time you went there, you may not be able to say how many roses there were, what they smelled liked, you would not have a memory that recalls seeing them from a first persons viewpoint, you may not be able to explain what the weather was like when you saw them, or any other environmental conditions, you may not see anyone else in the memory just the specific rose bush, if you see the rose bush at all, and I do not mean see as in conjuring an image in your minds eye, but simply memory being in your conscious awareness. However, you would still know that at some time in your past you saw red roses at your grandmas house, and you also probably know that it is your memory, and not a memory created by someone else telling you that fact. I think we agree and there is different ways to use words. \n\nWhen I say I lack episodic memory I am talking about the reliving aspects of it. My semantic and personal semantic memory is in tact and actually really detailed mostly because I use it so much But I still cannot relive it. I use know and relive instead of remember. I can sorta agree with that, I guess my issue is that some of these terms have a specific medical definition. Like episodic memory, semantic memory, and personal semantic memory, all have fixed definitions, and if we all want to expand our knowledge with each others experiences, we all need to be using the same set of terms. Personal semantic memory, for instance, is a combination of semantic and episodic memory, but not exactly the same as autobiographical memory, more of a subset, because PSM is only the facts about a specific event. \n\nSomeone with SDAM would still be pulling from the episodic side, they would just be pulling more the semantic-like information about that specific event. By semantic-like I mean it has no temporality, no emotion, no first-person viewpoint, it is just \"neutral\" facts (or Vulcan like, as I put it) about the event, SDAM also usually causes the memory to not be very detailed in its breadth of facts. Though the key being they are just event specific, so it is not stored in semantic memory, because semantic memory does not hold event specific memories, so it is instead stored in episodic memory. \n\nSo, if you have facts about a specific event, e.g. \"I went to my friends wedding, and they were wearing blue tuxedos\". Knowing what a tuxedo is, is semantic memory, knowing that the tuxedos were blue at the wedding, is episodic memory. Having both together, would be a form of autobiographical memory, but more specifically it is a personal semantic memory. But being able to recall that and not having FPV, or emotion attached, does not mean you do not have episodic memory, because if you did not, you would not remember the wedding at all.\n\nI should note that I too have SDAM, and wondered why I had such poor memory, with few personal memories (relative), and of those that I could remember, they only ever contained specific facts about certain events, which is why I started researching it around the middle of 2016. I am now delving into why I am so bad at remembering peoples faces, and attaching names to faces, which is why I came to the sub. I do not have prosopagnosia, but I am on that side of the spectrum, however people sometimes post interesting articles, blogs, research studies, etc.. here, so I pop in from time to time. Oh hey I think that must be what I have too! ", "Anyone Else Pefers Face Masks on Everyone? I am not sure how weird this might sound here. But between my prosopagnosia and mild autism, faces stress me out. Trying to analyze them and figure out who they are, and that is something you usually only get a few seconds to do in public.\n\nEver since masks became a thing however, I have found it *easier* to recognize people. Do not get me wrong, I hate looking people in the eyes. But I think masks covering half of people's faces just means I have less to analyze. Most of recognizing people for me is other clues, like style of dress or mannerisms. So I think seeing a person's full face gives me too much detail to process, and can even make me doubt if that person is who I think they are (*that looks like so-and-so, but is that what their mouth looks like, or is this someone else?*) The masks simplify my process; there is less detail to take in, plus most people tend to stick to certain types of masks, which helps even more. Plus, if I still cannot recognize them, everyone understands the mask excuse a lot better than, \"I cannot recognize faces.\"\n\nI did not realize that other people were struggling with this until my coworkers were discussing it one day. Everyone else thinks it is harder to distinguish and recognize people under their masks, but it is so much easier for me.\n\nRecognizing people for me is like being given a long math problem, and the masks just seem to cut out the hardest part of the equation. I am still bad at math, but I am a little less bad at this kind of math, so hey, I will take it.\n\nNow that the mask mandate has been lifted, I know for sure the masks have been helping. When I see people come in without masks, I am having trouble trying to take in an entire face. There is just too much detail for me. Imagine face masks with a name tag on them Not really.  I do not like looking at faces much either, but if I do, I look at the mouth area.  It helps me understand what people are saying and sometimes the expressions people make with their mouth are a recognition feature for me. \n\nOn the other hand, masks do make a great excuse when I fail to recognize someone. I feel the same way. Masks also reduce my stress because I can safely not recognize people. Faces have always been parts, but never a whole for me.  \nLike, I can look at someone is mouth and notice the details, but then forget them as soon as I am not looking.  \nProsopamnesia mixed with prosopagnosia.\n\nI have found that I notice people's eyes more. And some people have really nice eyes, or cool makeup. And I am not sure I would have noticed before because I am usually seeing the whole face so forgetting the details. Makes it way harder to recognize people for me, but gives me such a wonderful excuse to ask who someone is. For some people it makes them easier to recognize and for some people it makes it harder to recognize for me, BUT it is a great excuse for not recognizing people! I love masks; I find it much easier to recognize people. Pink mask is M, purple flowers is R, Red mask is K, and unlike a coat, they have to put the thing back on! Nah. I like seeing women smile Interesting that  you say that. My coworkers also mentioned that they have a harder time understanding people because they are used to watching mouths move while they talk. I guess since the mouth is the facial feature that shows the most expression, I normally do not look at it too much, bur it is something I never would have noticed before. Maybe you could blur your eyes a bit? Focus your vision closer or further away than the face is?  \nIt would be less details to focus on. Somewhat, and it gives a buffer for not instantly recognizing people Actually, it is been easier for me too, because even if I do not recognize them, I can make the excuse that it is the face mask or hope that they will probably think that... Hello, fellow autistic person!  I LOVE the face masks. I still cannot recognize people, but at least now I have a socially acceptable reason for not recognizing them. It is now okay to ask who they are without being thought a weirdo or racist. I have always mainly recognized people by their voices, not their faces, so I now have a slight advantage in recognizing people.", "Faceblindness and regular expressions I just had a \"shower thought\":  Face-blindness is like programming without regular expressions.\n\nThose who do not work in software might be asking right now - what is a regular expression?\n\nRegular expressions are a self-contained pattern-matching language that is included inside of almost every other programming language. They recognize bits of text by applying a pattern to it.  For example, if you want to recognize an American postal code, you would use something like `/^\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d(-\\d\\d\\d\\d)?/`, which means five digits and an optional hyphen followed by four digits. (There are more concise ways of writing this, but let us keep it simple).\n\nAs an end-user, when you fill out a web form and it tells you that is not a valid zip code or email address or phone number, the site is using a regular expression to make that determination.\n\nWhat if this feature did not exist? You could still identify patterns in text but have to do it the hard way:  `if (isDigit(firstChar) and isDigit(secondChar) and isDigit(thirdChar).... )` ... I will not write out the rest of this, because it is long and tedious.\n\nPeople who have facial recognition built-in are like programming languages that support regular expressions. They can easily construct a pattern that will match a face they have come across, then stash that pattern away for later use - perhaps years later, even though the target face will have aged considerably, the pattern still matches.\n\nThose of us without this feature built-in are mentally constructing long, complex, and brittle if/then/else statements - not as easy to store and remember, and more likely to break if presented with something unexpected. We have to do it the hard way, with the most primitive tools of mental logic, because the specialized tool just is not there. That is such a good analogy!! I am always trying to explain that to people\u2014it is not that I cannot learn faces at all, it is that I have to learn them the same way I would learn any other image. I do not have shortcuts. But most people do not even realize they *do* have shortcuts. or, if there is a memory database for people, usually Face is a unique ID column but for us it is a binary column that says \"human face?\"\n\nwe can still identify a person using a combination of matches from other columns, though I think that is a really good analogy. Also works well with the concept of:\n\n&gt;Some people, when confronted with a problem, think \"I know, I will use regular expressions.\" Now they have two problems. I have actually been on both sides of this and developed temporary face blindness. The loss of facial recognition is extremely eerie. Best I can describe is something from black mirror in that episode where people can be blocked (through eye implant/augment). You can see someone is face but completely unable to perceive it. I like this explanation...will be handy for reference :-) I find it hard to explain so well. I wonder how many people also have Aphantasia (I have both and because I cannot see pictures in my mind, I wonder if that impacts my ability to store faces) and if the causes are the same; perhaps a particular neurotransmitter that is lacking. Reminds me of the story of how they could not recognise ships (on the horizon) as they could not process what they were And now you have two problems. That was my first response as well! (", "Would you want an app to help with face blindess? Pure curiosity here: would anyone benefit from an app to help with face blindness? Like if you could wear glasses that would send a video feed to your phone, have an app recognize faces, and  then hear the person's name with an earpiece. Would something like that help, or would it be unwieldy? Would it be beneficial on top of what you already do to recognize people not by their face? Seems like the same problem that made it necessary would make it impossible to use.  When I do not recognize someone,  I also do not know if they are a stranger or not.\n\nTo use something like this, I would first have to generate a database of everyone I know, even slightly.  Then I would basically have to go around face-scanning randos as I went about my day.  I can just imagine that conversation.\n\n\"Um... why are you staring at me like that?\"\n\n\"Oh do not mind me.  I am just taking your picture to see if I know you.\"\n\nIf they turn out to be a stranger, it comes off as supremely weird.  It is not much better if they are a friend, and if they are an enemy... not recognizing someone you hate is problematic enough without getting in their face.\n\nOn the technical side,  has facial recognition software progressed well enough for this to work?  It is been a while since I worked with it (a facial recognition time clock about 10 years ago), and the damned thing was useless.  It could not even get an initial reading on darker-skinned employees.\n\nThe idea itself is not bad.  I have use SOs for this (bless my boyfriend when he turns to me and says  \" you remember so-and-so from XYZ event, right?\").  It would be really tricky, though, to come up with a viable system. Not to mention the problem of collecting consent from people to be in the system! Lol seriously!  At best, you would get a bunch of \"face blind?  Like in Arrested Development?  That is not real!\" Software-based facial recognition systems can recognize a face out of a photographic image and then, based on the distance between various facial features, translate that image into a list of 128 numbers between -1 and 1\u2014in other words, a point in a 128-dimensional space. Two images are considered \u201cpictures of the same person\u201d if the points generated by this algorithm are sufficiently close together.\n\nAt this point, AIUI, they are about as accurate as a neurotypical human being.\n\n\\\n\nThe thought has crossed my mind: if those 128 numbers were translated into some kind of geometric shape (such as a flower), would people with prosopagnosia find it easier to remember and distinguish those shapes than remember and distinguish images of the original faces? If so, an app could process pictures and videos and superimpose the appropriate shapes next to the faces that it picks out\u2014sort of like auto-generated closed captions for the deaf. Absolutely not the way you describe. Privacy nightmare.\n\nWould I use an app to attempt to get better at memorizing faces despite proso? Maybe. Would not wear AR glasses, even if they could be adapted to work over my existing, and extremely necessary, vision-correcting glasses. Would not want an app to scan everyone is face around me to compare it to a database of my friends, because honestly, *privacy* *nightmare*. Would not wear an earpiece for this purpose, either.\n\nFrankly, I may be in the minority, but I kind of like the way I navigate through large social groups of strangers. Because of my prosopagnosia, I tend to be drawn to talking with people who stand out in some way, or end up hanging out with people who are hovering on the edge of the group. Either way, those are often people who do not quite fit in with the norm of the group, so I make different and maybe more interesting or diverse connections than I would if I were more comfortable talking to the people at the core of the group's dynamics. I am not sure I would actually want that changed.\n\n(This occurred to me this morning when I was thinking, it seems like statistically an awful lot of my friends are not neurotypical, why is this? And then I thought, duh, because neither am I. At least the way I have learned to cope with prosopagnosia, it tends to bring me together with people who are, for their own various reasons, equally bewildered in large groups of strangers. And I love the group of friends that has resulted!)\n\n(Where I *would* want to recognize people more easily is not so much in social situations, but randomly in the grocery store/at the library/in line at the coffee shop, so I would have to wear this glasses-and-earpiece arrangement *all the time*. I think that would be difficult to implement even if you could get the thing to work in principle.)\n\nFun fact, though: in ancient Rome, some aristocrats had slaves whose job was to memorize the faces of politicians, clients, and other connections, and whisper their names in the aristocrat's ear. A slave who did this was called a *nomenclator* in Latin.\n\nSo if anyone did build this highly inadvisable app, they could call it Nomenclatr.\n\n(Please do not.) I cannot see it working without major privacy violations, either deliberate or very easily hacked in.\n\nIn order to not have these violations available, it would need to run on hardware which had no external comms - no WiFi, no Bluetooth, no cell, no nothing. That leaves out any smartphone. A system like this can be done all \"offline\" so they are not in some cloud nonsense. \n\nAnd if it were in a pair of glasses it would probably be very discrete. There is no helping it. It is an impairment that does not really get better with training. It is like asking, \u201cWould you like an app to help you be less near-sighted?\u201d\n\nSure...if it were actually possible. I have honestly dreamt of this. I would not want an ear piece though I would just want it to show me in the glasses the name of the person or if I have seen them before and where I have seen them I got a lot better at being able to \"store\" faces after I saw that infograph of 100 faces blended over each other to make one face then listed the composite average of people from that country.   \nIt made me realize the subtle differences I can note in people and started listing people's characteristics and general information. It was not perfect but it would be cool if there was an app that helped you be able to tell the subtle differences of people's faces then how to store them better like any memory game you would play.   \n\n\nFor me I have noticed that I can store people's faces better if I can see a picture of them that I can associate with their name and then can associate their name with their face in person at least three times. I still suck at recognizing people but I have gotten a lot better over time. I would love to try something like that, and I know the technology to create it exists (AR glasses with camera and face recognition technology). Only problem is most people would find it creepy and I completely understand why. To be fair, that is not really what OP is suggesting. They are suggesting an app that bypasses face recognition altogether by scanning crowds and pinging you whenever you see someone you know. The points where it runs aground would be in implementation and privacy (and, for me, the fact that I, personally, plan to be the last person in the world to adopt AR glasses). I do like this, especially if it pointed out features to notice. A diverse image set, including photos of the same people in different contexts and angles, would be great to practice on, especially if it were gamified  somehow. YES\n\nAlthough what I want ideally would be a visual display of the person's name that appears above their face, rather than audio. Haha, or a bunch of \"so you cannot see my face?\" I am no hardware developer, but the need for storage and a small computer in the glasses would make them more bulky though. The camera and battery already require their space. For the privacy bit it would definitely solve a lot to have them offline though. Yes Watching Holo love on Netflix.

I worry about a parent coming in midyear when I should know them without an appointment to talk about their kid and not saying the kid's name.  (I am a teacher.)  So I would be having this parent conversation and not know which student it is about.\n\nOr maybe asking the superintendent whose class her child is in.  (She does not have children and has been in our smallish district several years.)\n\nAnd I dread being assigned to check IDs when students are being picked up.  No idea how me looking at IDs would help.\n\nWhat is the most uncomfortable prosopagnosia problem you have at work?

So do not let such people in unless they show ID. Doing onsite support and being told \"Go find Fred Bloggs about so-and-so issue\", and despite having made copious notes about where Fred's desk is because of this exact issue, still managing to pass Fred in the corridor on the way there, or not finding him because he is at the next desk over talking to someone. It is honestly really hard to see something like their ID card clearly on the little screen I have to use to identify them. And even then, being able to tell that the picture on the ID matches the person I am looking at is a challenge. Bring it up as an issue so that when the shit inevitably hits the fan, you can point back to it and say that management was informed of the problem on XX-XX-XXXX date. I remember doing that with papers in elementary school.  I knew I was supposed to know who kids were, so I would shove the papers to the bottom of the pile while looking for name tags.  They other kids passing out papers would always finish first, so I would give them mine to work on.  I think my teachers were confused, because I generally move pretty fast and am fairly capable.

I fear sometimes I come off ignorant as hell because I have gone up to latinos in the courtroom talking to them like they are my Latino clients. \n\nAnother big thing is when a client sees me and acts excited to see me... I know they clearly know me, but the only thing I can do is either give them a bullshit greeting or I can go into my \u201cI will pretend I know you \u201c routine.  That sounds incredibly hard.

I know this makes me sound like some blooming serial killer or something, but I genuinely find people like 10x more attractive when their faces are cut off (not literally) or blotted out.

Every single person I have tried dating, I was not attracted to their face, and the thought of putting mine near someone is is gross. \n\nDrawn faces are fine, but we know here that fictional faces register differently to the brain. But I cannot help but wonder if proso is affecting me to the point where I am not just having trouble recognizing them well, but if it is making me face-averse/repulsed as well.

I was known for often crushing on very \"unlikely\" people who are not considered traditionally attractive. \n\n It took me very many years to figure out I find kind, smart people physically attractive, and I find jerks to be physically repulsive. Friends were surprised when they met my now-husband that he is actually traditionally attractive. This is honestly the best part of having prosopagnosia.", "Brand New Wor(l)d. Until two weeks ago, I had never seen or heard the word prosopagnosia. Actually, I had never even heard of people having difficulty recognizing faces. I have always been a bit of a ditz and am really good at acting dumber than I really am\u2026 so it is usually easy for me to b.s. my way through a conversation until I figure out who I am talking to. Then one day I read a book (I have an addiction to romance thrillers) where one character was completely face blind and it prompted me to look more into it.\nI do not actually know if I have some mild form or none at all. All I can say is that I have never understood what the heck a \u201cstrong jaw\u201d or an \u201caristocratic nose\u201d even mean. I can understand different colors for eyes, hair and skin, but different shapes do not register with me unless they are extreme. (I always recognize my kids\u2019 pediatrician because his nose is so long it looks like a beak)\nWhen I see someone often, such as my husband or my kids, I can USUALLY recognize them instantly\u2026. But seeing a coworker outside of work hours, or seeing my mom for the first time in a month is like looking at a stranger and it sometimes takes the whole conversation for me to figure out who just started talking to me. I also have a lot of trouble with subtle facial expressions. \nI am not sure if this really is a form of face-blindness or if I just have a few wires loose, but for the first time I have an explanation for my type of crazy. The feeling is a bit surreal.", "Gov Hickenlooper running for President is face blind Good interview by a face blind reporter interviewing a Democratic presidential candidate who is face blind. Pretty interesting and very relatable.  \n\n I would be interested how he got to the Governor position with faceblindness. I would having imagined almost all political positions would strongly favor people with really good facial recognition capabilities. He is obviously an outlier. The article said I believe that he is incredibly sociable.", "Education needed about prosopagnosia. Education processes need priorities.\n\n1. Pre-school, school, college, specialities.\n\n2. Standard images, signs, metaphors, jokes, comedians, learning &amp; teaching aids. Similar to the wheelchair symbol.  Perhaps a series of children's drawings of buttons (human \"faces\").\n\n3. Targeting of specialized professions. Police, Corrections staff, teachers, medical, emergency, educators, supervisors, managers, etc.\n\n4. Common situations:. \"People of that type are all the same (appearance, sex, body build, etc).\".

Learning to distinguishing genetically identical twins. How and why.\n\n7.  ... Other suggestions, please! Honestly all we need really is for people to understand there is at times no such thing as bad at faces. I have the born with it proso not the acquired. The hardest point was before diagnosis when people told me to try harder to remember faces.  It is really honestly hard for some normal people to grasp our view. I have drawn faces as I see them in my mind and another person sees them in their mind to help explain. If it really is an issue there are proso pins you can buy and wear to alert people. Other then that no one treats me different and TBH in my view I am not. I have thought about drawing a symbol such as a head with question mark inside instead of facial features, and underneath the symbol it would say something like, \"I am face blind! Who are you?\"\n\nA cool idea could be some form of \"closed captioning / subtitles\" for us. So whenever a character appears, their name would appear in text on the bottom of the screen. Whoa, I never thought about proso closed captioning! That would be great! I am glad that, for the most part, a lot of popular movies and shows tend to keep characters to certain color schemes or certain ways of carrying their bodies, but, yeah, that could be helpful when things are not so clear.", "I think my prosopagnosia is getting worse... There is one guy who I cannot work out if he is just one guy or actually two different guys. Either it is one guy who keeps changing his outfits, or it is two guys wearing different outfits. This really screws my mind. Checking shoes can help sometimes. Generally even if some people keep changing outfits at work (there are valid reasons for it) they do not change shoes. So, chances are if you are seeing two different sets of shoes (especially if they are the same type of shoe e.g. running) you are seeing two different people. Just a thought. That is a really good idea!", "I saw Once Upon A Time In Hollywood I could not keep Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio apart when they were in the same film. That is when my (doctor) boyfriend said to me that that was ridiculous and here we are! About to be formally diagnosed. \n\nAny similar stories?! I would be interested to hear if there is a standardized formal test, and if so whether it has a name or reference. It could be useful for people seeking diagnoses themselves. Where I am, a hospital has a specialisation in it. They encourage everybody to seek a diagnosis with them, I guess for research purposes. For me it was the show Veronica Mars. I watched an entire season and still did not recognize Logan (the main male character) because he just looked so generic to me. My roommate made fun of me for having to ask who that was every few scenes before I eventually discovered I could recognize him from his necklace. Until being made fun of for it, I did not realize it was not normal to struggle to recognize someone for so long. I made a very similar comment in this forum yesterday.\n\nAre you yanking my chain? I am slow to catch on. This is why I have almost no culture on movies, I rarely watch them due to not being able to follow the story because I am unable to tell two blonde men apart... Yes, this is how I figured it out. My fianc\u00e9 at the time was fed up with me asking \u201cwho is that person\u201d on the TV when it would be like Brad Pit or Angelina Jolie. The last straw was when within the same movie or TV show the main character would change their appearance in some way and I would think it was a new character and lose the plot. Once we figured out there was such a thing as being face blind I did not need a formal diagnosis, my entire life suddenly made so much sense. Ironically Brad Pitt has it too I am really late to finding this sub and particularly your comment but I could not watch the show Friends when it is originally aired because all of the men had dark hair. I could not tell them apart.  Even if I figured out who Joey was, by the time next weeks episode came out I would have forgotten again. \nNow that I can binge watch the show it is a whole lot easier. \nAnytime there is 2 or more dark haired men, or worst, 2 or bald men, I am lost.  This happens in real life too. My mum says the same! If two women have long dark hair, she has no idea who is who. I am the same.", "A comforting faceblind moment I found out I was FB just last year, and everything fell into place for my mother when I told her. Not just for me, but for herself, and she also realised her mother must have had it. She talked through examples of her having trouble with faces, but I would never witnessed it so blatantly as this.\n\nWe were visiting my brother this week with my sister, and we bumped into one of my sister\u2019s school friends, Helen. So our mum has seen Helen at her home and in my sister\u2019s life for maybe 2 decades. She was a bridesmaid at her wedding a couple of months ago.\n\nMy mum greeted her in a way I thought was slightly odd, too enthusiastic, then when we walked away mum said \u201cThat was Dorothy..?\u201d Clearly doubting herself a bit.\n\nNow Helen is British, while Dorothy, is Chinese.\n\nThey are a similar height and build, and I, empathising with my mums situation, totally understood why she would make the mistake. But it was a hilarious one from an \u2018outsiders\u2019 POV.\n\nMy sister\u2019s reaction was one of pure shock and indignation, while mine was glee.

Hear me out.\n\nSince i was a kid, everytime someone says hi, my mind goes into overdrive. I try to guess where i know this person from. (Is he my age? He must be at my school. And he is tall, i only know 5 tall guys at school. And he looks athletic. That is it, we played basketball together last week)\n\nAnd this would go on for years, daily training my brain to guess and deduce who is who, establishing links, analyzing context... I relaized i have prosopagniosia only few years ago, when my friend used snap chat to edit my head into someone else body and i did not recognize myself, while everybody else could. I did dome research and voila. Before that , i thought i was particularly forgetful\n\nSo come today. While i feel that i have missed out on many opportunities (running into my crush and not recognizing her, not saying hi to a potential business partner i met few days ago..) i have gained something valuable i attribute to faceblind: i have better-than-average deducing skills. i am great at reading body langage, looking for clues if the person i am talking to is worried, lying, happy... i am good at establishing links between 2 events that seems unrelated to someone else. By observing the person i am chatting with (unconsiously) i usually know what the persons needs and where he is trying to take the conversation and why :p ( a bit like doctor house)\n\nGood skill, right? I am sure all those years working our brains out bared fruits somewhere! This is what I was thinking when someone asked about going to therapy for this. Thanks for articulating it well. I am a really fast processor.  (Basically I think about stuff fast.  Does not mean I get somewhere BETTER, but I get there before most people.)  I am also good at multitasking.  I can usually follow two of my students talking to me at once, which is probably me just processing quickly and switching between them in my head, deducing what I miss.  I wonder how much is that is just the way I was born and how much is my brain working on overdrive all day to figure out who people were. Wow, I wish I started using deduction like this when somebody greets me. Instead I go \"This person knows me but I do not recognize them\" and just kind of get frozen there. I agree with this. And I was just having a conversation with 3 other friends with proso (It is more common than you think), and all of us happen to have a very good sequential memory, meaning we remember a lot of facts and details about events, even from early childhood. I wonder if not being able to remember faces leaves room for other parts of the brain to compensate? Kind of like how blind people develop a really good sense of hearing to help compensate for their lack of vision. Hopefully we will get more research soon. Bluff, bluff, and bluff. Say hi, smile, ask abt work.. one time i was like: \"how is..euh... how is... what is hia name.. hmm..\" and he answered: \"oh u mean X?\" (One more hint) most of the time the person will not know u did not recognize him.", "Testing my brain Fun fact: Watching 2008 iCarly and then looking at a recent picture of Miranda Cosgrove has my brain fucked up cause it does not take in the whole face all at once like i can only see one eyebrow or her chin etc and i have to \"scan\" it a lot longer for it to click and for me to see the face as a whole, then even a bit longer to recognize that it is, in fact, still Miranda Cosgrove.", "Too many posts that are just photos of similar people or one person over time and not explaining which it is These types of posts should be banned. It is incredibly frustrating to post that in a sub about people that cannot tell the difference I do not know if I would bother banning them, but I do not enjoy those types of posts.  It is kind of like making posts in Spanish on an English speaking site.  Sure, I took a little bit of high school Spanish and could muddle through some of it, but I do not really get it. The first one I saw was like ok a brain teaser. Now it is just annoying and I cannot help wondering if it is not lsadistic ppl without prosopagnosia just trying to torture us.

Hi I am new here!:) I am curious, for those who have a more serious prosopagnosia diagnosis here, and how do you judge if someone is prettier, more attractive to you, by just looks? Do you judge from some specific face part, such as eyes or lips? I reckon myself has mild prosopagnosia, I could not differ a lot of new faces even I have actually talked to them. For me, it feels like they have a mist in front of their face, that blocks me from knowing/understanding them. Can anyone share me your thoughts? Thank you:) \u201cFace blindness\u201d is a misnomer. For most of us, we can see faces with complete detail while we are looking right at them. If I were staring at a person\u2019s face, I could describe it in complete detail to, say, a police sketch artist sitting behind a wall from the two of us.\n\nWhat we cannot do is recall faces from memory with the same level of detail as someone without prosopagnosia. I would be useless describing a face to a sketch artist entirely from memory. For anyone without prosopagnosia, picturing a face from memory brings an image to mind much like looking at a photograph of that person. They can see tons of detail from memory that we cannot.\n\nThe best comparison you can use to describe the experience to someone without prosopagnosia is to ask them how much detail they could describe about the palm of someone is hand after looking at it once only briefly. There is plenty of detail there to uniquely identify plenty of people, but humans did not evolve the capability to automatically memorize tons of detail in palms the way that most people do with faces.\n\nTherefore, I personally have zero difficulty seeing how attractive someone is when I see them. When I can no longer see them, I can only remember what my OPINION was of their attractiveness but cannot recall the exact features which lead me to conclude their overall attractiveness. Make sense? Completely agreed. I can immediately see whether someone is attractive and why, and I can remember that I found them attractive for those reasons. However, I would never be able to draw or accurately describe what they look like. I have tried with a girl I dated for 5 years and it was quite unsuccessful! It is so interesting, thanks for sharing! I found myself interested in people who has strong feature by look, or just they have a unique style with clothing or hair colour etc. Maybe I just like people with interesting personality:)", "Software solutions for prosopagnosia Hi there. I am a software engineer and I was interested in working on a solution to help people living with prosopagnosia. Have there been solutions you have heard of or tried in the past. If so, what were your experiences? Looking forward to your comments! None that I know of. If you are looking for ideas, then I am waiting for  a Google Glass like device running a good face classifier. I want it to highlight people I know and give their name. Just the negative information (not recognising most people, so they are strangers) would be nice. So you are willing to wear some kind of device if it identifies people for you? Would you be open to something on your collar or wrist instead of glasses? Collar would be nice and less obtrusive. Collar would be nice and less obtrusive. I figured it would need a camera somewhere near head level. I want to build a rapid prototype of what I think may help. Getting the hardware right may take some time. If the software started off as an app you used on your phone and later became an external camera of some kind would you still find it useful? By the way, thank you for engaging in this conversation. It helps tremendously.  Name tags. And how was that experience for you? I have used name tags and they are great. I sometimes joke that if a computer could just create a human readable unique identifier for everyone, that would be a big help. People I know, sure, use their names. Strangers, that feels too creepy, so use something impersonal. That is great insight. I am a facial biometrics engineer where I currently work and that could definitely be a unique identifier for a person.  My husband, who is also a software engineer, has remarked before that he would definitely wear something if it could ID people for him. He mentioned Google Glass as something he would be willing to wear. My husband frequently jokes about license plates. \"Humans should be required to wear them, just like cars!\" Would your husband be interested in talking with me about possible software solutions? Would you mind PMing me your email address so we can communicate as I develop this software? Would you mind PMing me your email address so we can communicate as I develop this software? Would you mind PMing me your email address so we can communicate as I develop this software? I am not sure it is a problem he is interested in from a technical perspective, but I will ask. Hi there we are working on a solution that will allow someone to login via Facebook and will try to guess his FB friends. Yes Google Glass is a solution but it is expensive. We are developing a mobile app.  When you say guess their facebook friends what do you mean? I do not know of any but I am equally as interested. It would be soooo useful to have google glass or something which tells you who is who. It would basically solve prosopagnosia. I have settled on trying to get to the bottom of whether they have some type of closed captioning that labels characters so I can watch movies.  Honestly I just about lost my shit when I saw the facial recognition glasses they use in China:\n\n\n\nThis would help me uhhhhh A LOT. But it would have to be more futuristic, like embedded in my brain or something. Kind of like.....an actual ability to recognise faces ;)  ? I go to a lot of conferences and am often in a position where I need to recognise people I have met before. All these conferences have name tags, and the ones that help me the best are ones that are printed on BOTH sides, ones that are on lanyards which are not too long (to make it less obvious I am looking at their name tag) and written the name very clearly in contrasting text.", "This video is so confusing...  I saw this video a few days ago for the first time on a 70s music channel", "Not being able to picture faces in my head Does anyone else have trouble picturing faces that should be easy to picture? I can only picture a vague representation of people (regardless of how well I know them), and when I look at a photo of them, it feels like I am not even really in the ballpark. It also happens with my own face. For me, it is one of the worst parts of prosopagnosia because I cannot picture someone when I miss them, and I wish I could. I think this must be a fairly common feature of prosopagnosia as it is the same for me and others have mentioned it.  It does not bother me except I like writing fiction and find it hard to hold on to a visual impression of my characters. Instead i find a photo of someone who fits the bill on the internet and keep it on file to remind me.\n\nHave you found about your prosopagnosia fairly recently? I very much have this issue. I can manage faces of people that I know super well. But even then, I have sometimes have problems. I can sometimes picture them better if I imagine a photo I have of them (which is weird, like I am picturing the photo but not them directly). Also I think maybe it is a quite particular fixed image that I imagine. I do not have the ability very well to imagine them in new places or from different angles, but maybe I can picture them better from situations we have actually been in, perhaps. So it is rather different to when I know someone is voice well, and I can then imagine them saying anything in their voice.\n\nI get a sheet of the photos of new students at the beginning of the year. I try to match the person to the faces in the pictures. I find this very difficult even with them standing in front of me, unless they have got an unusual face or hair. I think part of that is that some people do take daftly posed pictures. But I fear in lots of cases it is just me. Then I try to use the pictures throughout the year to remember names. But it is hard!\n\nI am sorry you have the problem of not being able to picture people when you miss them :( I cannot keep a face in my mind for a second, \nEven my dreams can be perfectly realistic in every aspect but no one has a face, it is too blurry\nAnd I will not even notice the lack of faces in my dream until I wake up and try to remember who it was, sometimes one role in my dreams will switch between 4-5 people and I will not even notice until I think about it the next day. \nI am an artist and I cannot even transfer the image of a face from one paper to another right next to it \nIt is crazy Very much so. For me when I try to picture someone it is like their features are blurry or obscured or even ever changing and impossible to pin down. I cannot picture my own face, my parent's, my husband, and sadly, not even my daughter's. \n\nIn fact, she is sleeping on me right now. Even though I was just looking at her moments ago, I cannot accurately picture her face in my head.\n\nI think that is one of the worst parts. Not being able to picture her face and when she gets older, knowing I will not recognize her and if I did not dress her or do her hair for school, maybe I will not know her in a group. Will I be able to tell my children apart in pictures 15 years later? If they get away from me in a store, will I be able to find them again? And so many more questions and worries... I was diagnosed a few years ago, but I did not know that other people could picture faces accurately in their heads until recently. Thank you! &lt;3\n\nThe photo thing is interesting. It does not seem to work for me though unfortunately. I can picture the rest of the photo clearly, but faces are still pretty blurred. It is kind of like the rest of the photo is drawn photo-realistically by a talented artist... and the faces are drawn by a 5-year-old with markers. That is the best way I can describe it haha. Yes, I totally know the feeling with dreams. The art thing has to be hard to deal with. Do you still draw portraits or do you focus more on non-human subjects? If you still draw faces, how do you manage that, if you do not mind me asking?\n\nI think part of the issue behind the dreams (and likely the art) is that prosopagnosia brains do not have a good grasp of how different elements of the face combine to make a face, so generating one in the mind\u2019s eye is much more of a challenge than it otherwise would be. I avoid humans all together. Even cartoons make me uncomfortable. I could probably try drawing faces if I really wanted to, but the problem is I have a VERY realistic style, I want a surreal amount of realism in my artwork, and after I draw a face I know something looks wrong, but I just cannot tell what. It frustrates me \nIt is very hard for me to place facial features in the correct place, size them correctly, or figure out what might be wrong with a sketch\nIt is something I have absolutely no problem with when it comes to animal faces, I can draw bears, cats, horses, whatever just fine. \n\nThe few portraits I have done ended up with blank lightly shaded areas where the face went, and it took me hours and hours to paint the silhouette of the face itself. They end up creepy looking If I want to do something with humans in it I would rather turn to photography Oh wow, I did not even think of how scary that could be with kids. My biggest concerns are accidentally offending someone or witnessing a crime and being absolutely useless when interviewed by police, both of which have a much smaller impact on day-to-day life. \n\nHopefully as she grows up and develops her own unique mannerisms, you will be able to recognize her (or at least her voice) in person. I have certain coping mechanisms to recognize people even if I cannot recognize their faces, although it is certainly not a flawless system. I would guess you have similar coping mechanisms. Perhaps that could put your mind at ease a tiny bit? It still does not help with photos unfortunately. I am so sorry that you have to worry about these things, Oh yeah, drawing people with a realistic style while having prosopagnosia seems like a bad combination. I have tried sketching faces before, and it ends up with a slight uncanny-valley feeling that I can never get rid of. I stick to digital graphic design now, which is much less frustrating for me. Prosopagnosia is full of surprises. I did not find out until fairly recently that dogs have different faces.  I know someone with black labradors and always assumed that one looked just like another, but apparently not. I have sort of the opposite, I really struggle to picture people I know well, I am much better at people I have not seen very often.\n\nI am completely useless at recognizing people from photos though. Mine is not that severe, it must be difficult. Can you recognize people by their walk and mannerisms? I can often recognize someone from behind half a mile away just from their movements. Yeah I normally go on a mix of voice, walk, mannerisms, hair and clothing style. \n\nIt has its bonuses. I can often recognize people from further away than others. Just the other day I was shopping with my mom and pointed out an old friend of hers from across the parking lot. She said there was no way I could see her face from that far, but I could tell it was her by how she walked, the best she wore, and her hair style. I am the same, now I have got some new much improved contact lenses, I have gone from being completely useless to being able to pick people out from the other side of festivals, as long as they are moving or I know what they are wearing. Seems to be common! I do not think mine's severe, but I can relate to this, as well as what others have said about dreams and art. I would like to add characters from books or other non-visual media, too. I just have this nebulous, faceless idea of the character's appearance and can go through a checklist like \"reddish hair, large mouth\" if they are mentioned, but I cannot tell if the actors resemble their characters if a movie version comes out, other than their general vibe.\n\nI have always been a bookworm, but for some reason it only dawned on me when listening to *Welcome to Night Vale*, where the appearance of main radio host Cecil is never touched upon (that I know of). I saw lots of people online debating body type, height, ethnicity and even hair texture and I realized that I had no idea what \"my\" Cecil looked like. As far as I knew, he was a disembodied voice. I had a vivid picture of his surroundings, his cat, the sound of his footsteps and even the smell of his clothes, but never his looks.", "School Presentation Hi, All!\n\nI just found this community and am hoping some of you can lead me in the right direction. \n\nMy daughter is 11 years old and was diagnosed with developmental prosopagnosia a few years ago. We kind of knew there was something to her inability to recognize faces from the time she was 3, but did not have a name for it. She did not get the official diagnosis until after she had a Temporal Lobectomy in 2016. Her doctors suspected the diagnosis but were hoping that after the surgery, which was successful in stopping her seizures, the other side of her brain would pick up the processing for faces. \n\nIt is been a struggle to communicate this diagnosis to her schools. They just do not understand it. Honestly, I know and I have a hard time comprehending it. One of the ideas that we had to help her build relationships with her peers was to share information about proso and how she sees the world. \n\nThere is not a ton of material out there. Does anyone know of any kid friendly materials that we could use or borrow from to build a presentation that she can share with her classmates and teachers? \n\nThanks for the help! I bought this book in 2013, \"Understanding Facial Recognition Difficulties in Children: Prosopagnosia Management Strategies for Parents and Professionals (JKP Essentials)\" by Nancy Mindick. I got it for myself (I am face blind) and even though it was for kids and those who work with kids, it was still helpful to me as an adult. It is on Amazon. If it is of any comfort your daughter will develop recognition skills, just not relying on faces. Most prosopagnosics manage to navigate through life, albeit with some bumps in the road, but it is a huge advantage that you recognised it while she was still small.  I expect it will help her at school if her friends and teachers can be persuaded to casually mention their own names or those of people around her, or if people can accompany or fetch her rather than waiting for her to find them.  They need to be aware that just because she just saw someone it does not mean she will recognise them again. I have failed to recognise people I was just talking to who simply moved slightly. Also the school should know that putting on or removing a hat, jumper or coat, or putting hair up in a ponytail or letting hair down may render a person unrecognisable. School uniform may give her a problem if everyone looks the same. \n\nIt might be worth knowing that some prosopagnosics have difficulty with other objects. I cannot tell cars apart - colours, shapes and sizes simply dont compute with me. I also discovered recently that dogs supposedly have different faces - not sure about that but I am assured it is so!\n\nBest wishes and I am happy for your daughter that she has such supportive parents. Forgot to mention that Faceblind.com may be worth contacting about support material. Does anyone know if there is an archive of that prosopagnosia website that used rocks to explain/demonstrate prosopagnosia? I think it was prosopagnosia.org but it disappeared a few years ago.", "Anyone seen Orphan Black If you do not know it is a drama about SEVERAL clones who grew up seperately and end up meeting more and more of eachother in adulthood as they uncover an elaborate conspiracy.  It is full of drama and suspense but sometimes throws in hilarious situation humor. (Like when the soccer mom clone and her husband have to bury a body)\n\nThe thing is... the actress who portrays the clones does a fantastic job, she usually has major changes to her hairstyle and clothing and she adjusts her mannerisms to fit the various different characters perfectly.  \n\nSo... to me every time a new clone showed up,  i had to rely on the gasps of the other characters or just outright exposition to know they were clones.\n\nThe worst was when it took me several episodes to figure out the significance of the villain with Karen hair who turned out to be another clone.  (Amazing wig work)\n\nEventually i figured out i every clone had the exact same eyebrows which helped for identifying them but kind of broke the immersion.\n\nAnyways ever since i first saw it i have kind of wondered if anyone had a similar experience Oh I love that show! I felt the same with the clones, they are all so different that I would not immediately notice that a new clone was in fact one of the clone club. Also took me a while to figure out the villain was a clone since she is just so amazingly different from the others. I think that actress is amazingly talented, even the posture and mannerisms are different for each individual girl. I watch it with my big sister and she tells me whenever a new clone shows up, because they are all very distictly different people, and I never caught on that I was supposed to recognize them I am in the middle of it with my partner, I am really enjoying it, luckily he tells me when a new clone is introduced, but it is so bad when they dress up as each other, because you become so reliant on hair style to tell who is who. Tatiana Maslany plays the only woman on the series as a clone so I figure any new woman is her. I went into it knowing there were clones, but I absolutely did not recognise that Cosima was one of them at first.", "Horror comic about Face Blindness  Yup, that is a pretty terrible nightmare... ...we can see faces. \nlike, we do not look at someone and see a blank circle. we see eyes and nose and forehead and eyebrows and a mouth and stuff. I imagined they took some artistic liberties to amplify the fear factor. Yup! We just cannot hang onto the perception of a face for more than a couple seconds after looking away. I mean I get they did that to illustrate what it is like to not RECOGNISE but the text literally says they \"cannot see faces\" and that is incorrect. atleast, if it is meant to be representing prosopagnosia. oh yeah that must be an error, cuz she can see her own face and went into stuff about beards etc It would have been better if they gave everyone the same face, that is more accurate. It is a difficult thing to present thru comics. well but the \"same face\" thing is something that happends a lot in comics with bad artists, so maybe people would just feel the comic had one of those artists that can only draw 1 or 2 faces. LOL ok, do not read comics so I was not aware. ", "Hypothesis - Psilocybin Mushroom To Cure Face Blindness (Prosopagnosia) I was watching an interview on Joe Rogan with Paul Stamets, the mushroom guy. \n\nIn the interview Paul shares an interesting story.  He took a megadose of psilocybin mushrooms, and it fixed his stuttering. According to his research the mushrooms rewired the neuroconnections in his brain.\n\nThe results were instantaneous. When he woke up the next morning his lifetime trouble with stuttering was gone. \n\nHas anyone tried this for prosopagnsia? \n\nIs anyone interested in researching this? \n\nNow that psilocybin mushrooms are legal this would be an interesting thing to test. \n\nWhat the video for yourself here: (  I have had shrooms multiple times now but still have prosopagnosia. I also can confirm this. I have had some pretty heft doses -- like, 7g is a small dose for me. blows to the head will also produce random results, in rare instances amazing, some good, most bad. \n\nI will wait for controlled studies thanks. Anecdote is a poor replacement for actual peer reviewed study. Yep. Mushrooms did NOT cure my face blindness, lol. I think my eyes rolled into my skull reading the title. That was the most interesting interview I think he is done. But I imagine he got lucky that the shrooms affected him in that particular way.  Absolutely worth researching what they can do and what their limits are. I am also curious about the effect microdosing has versus macrodosing. I think microdosing has shown more neurogenesis maybe. I have heard that psilocybin can be a treatment for anxiety, and maybe the stuttering was also caused by anxiety? \n\nI do not know if it could be a treatment for prosopagnosia, what we have is abnormal neurology so it might not work the same way. Would be interesting if it was researched though. Same, full-blown ego death made zero difference. Helped with a lot of other shit, but not prosopagnosia.", "me_irl ", "Advice for university? I am a British student and next year I will be starting at University. There will be 1000s of new people and much more opportunity to meet them out of context. I am really worried about making friends there because of my prosopagnosia. Does anyone have any advice from their own uni experience? I attended in the US, so I do not know if anything is organized differently, but here is what comes to mind.\n\n1. Small classes (typically are not the first you take though, but if you ever have a choice) help.  In lecture classes sit in the same spot each day and you are more likely to sit by the same person.\n\n2. I tend to just smile a lot at people vaguely and be generically friendly.  They are more likely to talk to me that way.  And when you are pretty sure you do not know anyone (like the first few days,) you can approach people. Try to make a friend in each class that you can recognize at least in the class.  Arrange to meet people for studying very specific places.\n\n3. If you are living in dorms, make a friend or more on your floor.  Then you can meet them at their room before going to the dining hall or other places together where you might mutually know more people. It is pretty hard to give concrete tips for this cause I guess it is not really something that can be fixed, just managed. In some situations I take notes, obviously not where people can see me (lol) and it does not have to be crazy detailed but just a couple of reference points to help connect the dots next time.\n\nMy lectures were massive, like a few hundred students at a time, so I did not really prioritise meeting new friends there. I mostly made connections via flatmates (which naturally expands to bigger groups) and student union clubs that I joined. If your classes are smaller then it will be easier to sit in the same spot each time and meet the people around you, which gives you a good chance to try and remember cues that will help you recognise them outside. \n\nBut really the one proper tip I can give is to try not to worry. Face blindness or not, everyone else is actually in the same boat. It is a lot of people for the others too and many of them will be just as nervous.\n\nSometimes all you can do is admit you do not remember them, maybe a quip about being really bad with recognising faces, and honestly it should not be a big deal. It is awkward for like a second and then you can move on with the conversation. If at this point their name helps you remember something from your last meeting, like a specific topic you chatted about, mention that - it can help to show that you did actually listen to them. In my experience, most people are understanding about the situation. If someone else is a dick about it then that is their problem, good riddance to them. \n\nAnd maybe more of a general tip for uni life, but I think it helps with prosopagnosia too, join some clubs, ideally right at the start! It will help give you more context for the people you meet there, many of them will have regular meetings (both for the actual club and for socialising) and you often have a ready-made conversation topic while you try to figure out who the hell you are talking to! Bonus points if they wear custom shirts/hoodies because then they are super easy to spot in big groups! :)\n\nAnd just cause it does not hurt to say it again, try not to stress about it too much and do not beat yourself up about it if it leads to a bit of awkwardness. You will be fine! Some combination of letting people know you have prosopagnosia (so they are not offended when you do not recognize them), and learning how to fake recognizing someone until you can figure out who they are! \n\nFor me, facebook helped a lot since I could stare at people's photos until I learned to recognize them. But idk if young people even use that anymore (I do not even use it anymore, lol). Maybe LinkedIn if people from your uni use that? I was very upfront with people I met and told them I have a condition that makes it hard for me to recognize people. Everyone was quite understanding, and several of my classmates proactively introduced themselves to me each day until I could more reliably figure it out on my own. Hopefully your peers will be as gracious as mine were! For those who did not, I learned to recognize things like what stickers/logos are on their laptops. There were many curious students and faculty who politely asked to learn more about it, and I found these conversations to be quite enjoyable. Straight up, just tell anyone whom you meet and hit it off with about your faceblindness (and drop the big word for credibility).\n\nIt got me through all 4.5 years of college and I have maintained many of those friendships to this day. People in college are generally cool, and a million times nicer than the average high school student. It does not have to be a big deal, just at the end of that initial meeting let them know that you have a brain thing that makes it hard to recall faces, and to not be offended if you do not recognize them when you meet again. I have said/done it countless times and have never experienced an unkind response.\n\n(If you care to hear more, I spoke at length on the Faceblind Podcast about my experiences through college:  I did not find out I was faceblind until after university, but I will agree that people are in general quite patient and kind if you are kind to them! And since I did find out, I have been using 'I am faceblind' as my 'fun fact about yourself' in awkward icebreaker situations. It seems to work OK! I cannot believe I have never thought to do that. It will be my new go-to as well. How interesting, I have taken the opposite approach!\n\nSince I discovered proso post-uni I generally keep it secret for two reasons:\n\n1. I have a mild form and I do not want employers and colleagues to see this as a weakness.  I try hard to pay attention and take notes, so I can distinguish people later.  That is my business.  \n2. People could legit take advantage of me by knowing this and I would like to avoid that (very small chance, but still)\n\nWhat do you think?  I have not put a lot of thought into being more open about it, and when I look at my reasons for hiding it they seem a bit overly defensive.  \n\nHave you found any downsides to being open about it? I am glad you opened the door for me to use \u201coverly defensive.\u201d I do not know anything about your industry, but in mine (military aviation engineering, a very male-dominated industry currently), being seen as weak is not a concept I have ever had to factor into my outward presentation-of-self. Whether you are a Schwarzenegger or a Mr. Rogers-type, your work speaks for itself and you are respected based on your kindness and competency. \n\nAnd as far as taking advantage; I cannot fathom the scenario where I meet someone and they could learn enough about how proso affects me to \u201cuse\u201d it in any kind of capacity against me (beyond cartoonish plots like showing up in a disguise).\n\nSomeday it may become egg on my face, but so far being upfront about it has not ever gone wrong for me. Maybe try it out socially for a taste before bringing it to the workplace if there is additional stakes there. That is super helpful, thanks! Especially the industry - I am was in engineering as well, now moving into a health startup, and I think I put the pressure on myself not to show weakness. Anytime I have been ill or shown weakness it is been met with nothing but compassion. I am not sure why I am so worried about people thinking I cannot do something due to health/mind stuff, because I am always open about gaps in my technical knowledge. You are right, respect is through kindness and competency, I love the way you put that, it has totally reframed this for me.\nWow, really, thanks a lot! Well, that made my day. Thanks in return. what worked for me:\n\n* Be early and sit somewhere that is easyly visible, the others will recognice you and sit next to you (this also makes it easyer to tell who likes you)\n* After the first few weeks we always sat at the same place.\n* When you are going to a canteen do not be the last in the group, it is annoying not to find the group after paying, far easyer it the person behind you finds them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat did not work: During my first master semester I tried something new: We were a small group of 15 people. I said that I have difficultys recognicing people and asked if I could take a photo of their face and save it together with the name. Noone reacted negatively and only one woman said no. It still come across as mildly creepy and somehow on that day EVERY woman managed to \"casually\" insert into conversations that they have a boyfriend (and some of the guys mentioned having girlfriends). On that note the photos did not even help me :-(", "Do you see differences?  I mean, this is racist identification crap that they give out to their cops in russia.  And the problem is not being able to spot differences between pictures, is being able to notice them in real world situations. The differences are so tiny, some have wider features, some have hair... it all disappears the second you take your eyes off the page.  Apparently there are people who are really good at identifying faces, but features are not uniform based on nationality! You did see that this document is from 1960? I can see the differences, but they disappear from my brain as soon as I stop looking at them", "Who can relate? While watching television - \u201cIs that the main character there?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, we have never seen him before\u201d ...\n\n\u201cIs that the same guy from the last scenes?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he changed his sweater\u201d ... \n\n\u201cIs that Ted?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat is Ted\u2019s friend, he looks nothing like Ted\u201d ..\n\n\u201cIs that the woman who has that house?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is Selma Blair\u201d ...\n\nAnd then they be like - \u201cHey is that the actress from .. oh wait who am I asking! Haha, never mind\u201d Yuuuup Yep. I spend half the time trying to figure out who the actors are in real life. Then I have to ask. It just sucks. This is why I use Amazon Video and make sure shows have X Ray. It is insanely helpful to identify who is who Yep, it is why I mostly watch animation. It is processed in a different part of the brain than faces. My absolute worst thing is when a thriller has a killer that we have not seen yet and when they are revealed it turns out to be the for example, the janitor we have seen multiple times before.\n\nIf I do not have someone pointing it out to me I am going to sit there all confused then the characters goes \"It was you all along!\" That me. That explains why I am drawn towards those shows. \nAlthough I do like Handmaid's Tale,  but everyone in the same outfit is a nightmare. I have the IMDB app on my phone ready to party every time I watch a movie. Me, too. Upside is that I am really good at movie trivia. Agreed, that is why I stay away from military themes or movies/shows about schools with uniforms. My dad does this with shows like Game of Thrones where half the characters are just gruff white dudes with beards and scraggly hair. I have a bigger problem with teen shows like Pretty Little Liars or Riverdale where there is always several characters who are just mathematically attractive but bland looking white boys with the same haircut. I call it CW face. Literally cannot tell these dudes apart and ask who they are whenever they come onscreen :( YES.  Also, I can never figure out the mystery of any sort before the characters do unless it is completely obvious.  Because I am busy figuring out the mystery of who is that. It is is not it ? I can identify cartoon characters more easily Same !! Lol Haha ! White boys with brown hair all look the same to me ! I have been resently watching a series were in the first episode a couple of actor put like a mask on their faces and when they remove it, the faces are different. I did not realize at all, I have to ask to someone else who was watching the series with me if something happened and he told me 'they changed their faces!!!' The another day I was watching a series were the actors put a mask on their faces and when they remove them, they have new faces. Somebody else had to explain me what happened, I could realized that the faces have been changed   I can remember by voice  so it does not make it hard to follow a show..", "Describe sound to a deaf person I wonder if being able to recognise someone is face would be a \"sense\" like seeing or hearing.  \nBecause it is just as difficult to explain.  \nTry to explain to a deaf person what sound sounds like. You can explain the mechanics of it with sign or writing, but they cannot experience it.  \nAnd it is kind of the same when it comes to remembering faces. How do you explain to someone who can see faces what it is like not to?\n\nOr explain to a blind person what purple looks like. I think explaining colours to a blind person or sound to a deaf person is something that many people have pondered before. But strangely. I never thought of recognising faces as something that was that out of reach, probably because I have all the senses to perceive it; I just have difficulty making sense of it. \n\nPerhaps this is closer to trying to understand a dialogue between two people in a language that I am unfamiliar with. I think it may depend on your other visual abilities.  I can recognize many things without effort and only have trouble instantly recognizing them in unusual circumstances, so I can use that to understand what recognizing faces is like.  I understand that it is a different cognitive process, but I do not think recognizing faces feels different than recognizing anything else to people who have normal facial recognition abilities. I compare prosopagnosia to looking at people\u2019s faces through a tube. I can see someone is eye(s) or someone is nose or someone is mouth but I cannot put them together. I have the ingredients but I cannot make the dish, so to speak. I have a friend who also has it, but draws characters. I asked her how she manages to draw faces.\n\nShe said that she knows all the parts that are needed, and when looking at the face can tell if any are missing. But as soon as she is not looking at it she cannot remember what it looks like, even though she drew it It is like how there is more senses than just the 5 people often name.\n\nThe sense of balance, for example.  \nExplain it to someone who does not have it.  \nYou just \"feel\" which way is down? What? :P Oh, yeah, for sure.\n\nAnd there is different levels of prosopagnosia as well. Like, some people cannot recognise their family or themselves in a picture, while others can in the right context, and others will could recognise close friends and family anywhere, but not acquaintances or coworkers. I think you may be onto something.  \n\nOn the one hand, people with normal facial recognition abilities are definitely able to understand analogies for faceblindness (e.g. faces are like trees).  \n\nOn the other hand, some of what I have read about acquired prosopagnosia leads me to suspect that for most people, their sense of who others are is almost entirely bound up in facial recognition.  They can lose the emotional connection part of recognition when the face no longer registers properly.  \n\nThere was one interview with a guy who could not recognize his wife of many years anymore.  Not just at the grocery store or out of context, but sitting and talking with her at home.  I found that difficult to grasp; I mean, she still talks the same and dresses the same and moves the same.  He had obviously lost more than just the ability to easily pick her out of a crowd. With acquired, there is generally brain damage involved from my understanding.  \nSo maybe it is not just facial recognition that is damaged in his case. Hi folks, doing a science programme on this and wanted to hear stories/anecdotes of how this has affected you? Good morrow folks, doing a science programme on this and did want to heareth stories/anecdotes of how this hast affectioned thee?\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` There is an artist on TikTok who uses a grid type system to draw faces from reference photos and I thought that was a pretty clever idea. I think I ran into that artist at some point.\n\nThough that is something that we were shown how to do back in high school as a drawing method. Though it was more to keep things in proportion not break up a face.", "Wait, it is not Tom Hanks? ", "People in your dreams Usually in my dreams there are generic people whom I do not recognize. A few times there are people that I know, but I really could not say what features they have, just that I know they are a certain person. I asked some people without facial recognition problems and they say that people in their dreams are usually people they recognize. Does anyone else here have dream people they know or do they have mostly generic people forms like I do? My dreams often contain people I know, but as in real live it is not about faces. I will either just intuitively know who is who or recognize them from voice/general body appearance. I have no idea what the faces in my dreams look like. I tend to see only the features that I recognize like someone with big round eyes and long eyelashes, rather then being completely faceless, they have only some features My dreams almost never contain specific people. They are almost always random people that dream me knows, but do not exist in real life. And I am pretty sure they do not have distinct faces. Just had a dream last night with a lot of people I do not know in it. I would know which person was who, but I could not really describe them or remember what they look like other than \"black lady in purple dress\" or \"guy who looks similar to my bf's cousin but definitely is not him.\" My dreams are 99% populated with strangers.  Only rarely do people I actually know in the waking world show up.\n\n(Phrased that last part carefully because dream characters may be my relative, close friend,  coworker, comrade in arms, etc., in the context of the dream itself). Not sure if I should contribute (I do not have prosopagnosia, but my SO does which is why I sub here), but that is how my dreams are as well. I sort of intuitively know who someone is, but they have sort of swirly faces. They look like seeing someone through a clouded window- generally same shape and size, but not distinct facial features. I have pretty severe facial recognition problems. And my dream experience is exactly as you describe. The people in my dreams too have vague, undefined features, but I know who they are. I have heard that most people dream about people they know more often. But, like you, I mostly dream about random generic people that I do not recognize. When I do dream about people I know, their faces are probably not accurately represented in my dream, but they will still have other features being correct, like height/body etc. Same here. Imagine if everyone had their name floating above their head. Then you would not need to recognize them by their face. That is basically how my dreams involve the people I know, by making me intuitively know who they are.\n\nThat said, I have also had dreams where I was interacting with a stranger for a period of time only to later discover that it turns out to be someone I actually know, but I assume that is just because everyone has dreams that mimic their own real life experiences, and that is a common real life experience for us.", "Do you guys have issues visualizing faces? As an artist who draws characters, I find that I do well with the body, clothes, and hair... but faces always seem like some blur that is constantly shifting when I try imagining them in my head. Especially if they are talking, expressing emotions, etc. Most of the time I have enough trouble that I have to actually google faces to try visualizing them better to stop them from being vague blobs. Does not even last long then lol, but I do what I can. Y tu? Oh yeah.  Imagine my shock when friends said they can completely image faces in their mind! Yeah, I am completely incapable of visualizing faces.  Sometimes I can picture a particular expression (mouth only, not the rest of the face), but that is pretty rare. Actually the idea of visualizing something in my head is already pretty nonexistant to me.\n\nLike, I could close my eyes and think about the concept of an apple and know it is red and know it is round, but I would not vizualize nothing, there would be no image on my head.\n\nBut in my dreams, people have clear faces. r/aphantasia if you have not already Yes! I can picture vivid images in my mind of everything but faces. When I visualize a face it could be anybody. A general face-shape with changing features. I can perfectly visualize my most loved characters, but only because they all have radically different features\none has dark skin and pure white eyes\none has tricolor hair and big round eyes with pink cheeks\n and one has snow white skin with pink blush on her body with monster claws\n\nAll of them are super different with just a minute description, so I can imagine them ease, but the rest are all a blur, I think it depends on how complex they look and how often you use the character yes, absolutely. when i try, i just... cannot. even like my parents, who i see every day, are just sort of blurs when i try to visualize their faces. \n\ni am an artist who does people specifically, and i think that is why my style is more anime (although it is gotten more realistic as of late), because all faces already look the same in an anime style. i had somebody ask for a nose reference for one of my characters once and all i could think to say was... normal? how do you even differentiate noses? i have started just putting a disclaimer on my art fight (drawing event where you draw other people\u2019s characters and get art of your own) explaining my condition and telling people to just do what they think seems right, because i am no help when it comes to describing my character\u2019s faces in detail. I am still not convinced most people do that easily ;-; Yeah everytime i draw my characters they always look different because i cant consistently draw the same face due to the whole face blind thing. I see no faces in my dreams, never did. Not even hair. Posture, clothing, height, nothing about head. If it is a person I know, then I just know that this is the person.\n\nEdit: just remembered that I have seen a guy in huge ass hat that covered all his head and face. I am hobby artist. I have to use photos if I need to paint a face. Usually I just avoid painting them. I cannot visualize faces. The second I stop looking, it is gone. I used to think artists drawing faces were superhuman... turns out they just remember. I cannot do it. I never understood how facial sketches worked in crime shows. Lol right? I cannot even remember what the face of the person I am currently dating looks like, or the one of a partner who I have been working with for a semester. Those artists are superhuman I write and draw, so I have a set idea of what my characters look like. But when I try to visualize them, I either see them drawn in my style, or I see kind of a shifting mess of features. Like a vague blurry face.\n\nI will look at this face in my mind and say \u201cok, I know she has straight red hair and freckles\u201d so I see that. Then I say \u201cher eyebrows are long and thin\u201d and those solidify. But when I say \u201cshe has a defined Cupid\u2019s bow\u201d, her lips solidify, but the brows blur again. \n\nI cannot see everything at once, and it seems like every time I imagine a face it looks different. I looked through my character inspiration Pinterest boards really carefully a while ago and realized none of the \u201cface claims\u201d looked much alike, other than hair color and skin tone. I actually had a board with very Asian and very white photos for the same character, and I remembered being very happy to find each of those faces that looked just like my mental image! Artist here too. I can imagine faces, but the features are generic and not accurate at all. If I try to recall a specific face, I can only recall the head and hair and the face itself is likely just a generic eyes nose and mouth. Kind of like how you can visualize a zebra, but not a specific zebra. i cannot visualize faces really, the faces i draw without reference all look the same. if i have a reference i kind of can draw it? i have always been horrible at facial proportions though i cant tell when it looks right or not lol I have always had this problem but did not make the connection. I also do not see faces in dreams, there is just shadows or blurry features where peoples faces are, but I can still tell who they are (usually by smell as creepy as it sounds) Yes. When I read books, I build characters in my head, how they look, size, shape, etc., but their faces have always been... blurry. I even remember telling that to my Dad when I was a kid, but neither of us thought too much of it.", "Funny situations you have gotten into because of prosopagnosia I have noticed that there is not a lot of discussion in this sub, so I wanted to start some. Have any of you gotten into amusing situations because of your prosopagnosia? I will share one of mine: \n\nI was away at a month-long overnight summer science camp. On the last day, there was an \"open house\" event for parents to show up and see the projects that we would made. I was not sure if my parents were going to show up, because the summer camp was an 8-hour drive from my home. \n\nAnyway, the day before the \"open house,\" I am walking between buildings with a couple of friends, and then suddenly, there is this stranger taking photos of us. I turn around, but he looks like a stranger, so I keep walking. He starts taking more photos. At this point, my friends are starting to think he is a creep; I just assume that he is some sort of hired photographer. (Some of the staff would go around and take photos over the course of the month.)\n\nAnd then he comes up to us and says hello to me, using my name, asking me why I had not gone to say hello to him. Then, it hit me. I recognized his voice. This \"random stranger\" was my *father*. I had not recognized him at all, because I had not expected him to be there. Also, he had cut his hair since I had last seen him, and I did not recognize the camera he was carrying. \n\nAnyway, long story short, this was the point at which I realized that I probably had some issues with recognizing faces. \n\nThat is my story. I would be glad to read some of yours! ", "Does anyone else get accused of racism for not being able to distinguish faces? I have explained to people that faces all look the same to me only for them to get aggressive and go, \"Oh, you mean all (insert minority here) look the same?\" And I will be, \"No, all *people* look the same. Everyone that has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth looks the same to me.\"\n\nDoes anyone else have this problem? Is there a better way to handle it? Yeah, make them understand with emotions.\n\nTell them you could not pick your parent out of a crowd unless they (insert how you ID people here).  I could only find my mom via her hair and shape, and my dad by his voice.  Then tell them \"It is ruined a lot of friendships.  It is OK if you think I am an asshole for having this disability, I am used to it.\"  They will either fuck off or stop being stupid.  Then go find someone else to be friends with.

Where all the men more or less wore the same clothes and similar hairstyles.\n\nOn occasion I would bring in to work a bag of apples. \n\nAsk someone to choose one. \n\nThen put them all in a box, mixed, and ask them to \"recognise\" the apple they had earlier selected. \n\nIt works well to explain it, effective. I have not, but I think it is only because I live in a super white area.  If there are only two black guys in the location, I can use all my proso skills to tell them apart (unlike certain other people in my area) but I cannot tell apart the 20 white guys that look the same.  \n\nI would work on how you explain it.  Give them real life examples.  My new go-to is that it sometimes takes me some time to make sure I am picking up the right kid at preschool. These are not people I am trying to be friends with. I just get people coming up to me demanding, \"You saw me, I know you saw me, why did not you say 'hi'?\" (No, I am not intimately familiar with these people. I am not sure why this is an issue. Because I saw them at work? Maybe?) And when I try to explain, this is the reaction I usually get. (I live in a very multiracial area.) I will have to keep that in mind. Thank you. Yeah I had that happen once when I was living in an area where I was the odd one out. Got accused of racism and I explained that I had the exact same problem with people from my race back home. It sucks, because no one believes faceblindness is a real thing. That is a pretty good idea. Thank you. I gave you a good answer, you responded with the interaction and all the emotions you could stuff behind it.  This indicates that you are not interested in finding an answer, you want to get rid of the bad emotions and find a way for those folks to not have hissies at you.  \n\nI am sorry this is an ongoing issue for you.  You may want to try think about how bad things are for everyone right now and let their hissy fit slide off you.  Maybe they have to go to a Rememberance and they are not acting right.  It is probably not you or anything you did, you are just a convenient target when they are really upset.  \n\nOr maybe you could say \"I have a disability, I am face-blind.  But I know your (hair/voice/whatever)!  You have a really nice (say something nice about that thing).\"  That would probably help, along with understanding that someone who comes at you so angry... is angry about something else entirely.  Do not let them smear their assholery all over you.  Shed it and go on about your day.  You are better than that. It sounds like these are people who are looking for a reason to be aggressive and take offense.  Maybe skip the explanation and just apologize for being spaced out and not paying attention?  Or whatever else it takes to defuse the situation. Thank you. It does suck. That is a good idea. Thank you. A small handful of times but I never had a problem after I explained the condition. There have been a couple of times where I have misidentified someone.  I have never been called a racist because of it, but I always follow up with,  \u201cI guess now would be a great time to let you know I am faceblind.  It is not personal. I cannot even recognize my own husband or son.\u201d I explain it for what it is, a neurological condition. I usually point to the back left of my skull and say \u201cRight here is the fusiform face area, it is home to the neurons which connect the visual of seeing faces to your memory. Mine did not develop quite right.  My brain is not processing faces period, for all humans. Race plays no part in distinguishing faces for me.\u201d\n\nIf there is doubt, I can go into the full science of it but usually I show them the Wikipedia page about it. Explaining is difficult. A lot of people do not seem to believe it exists. I did say that. It got taken personally anyway. I do not think it is publicized enough. I do not have an answer for you but I can relate. It is a delicate balance sometimes which I try to be sensitive to. Years ago in London (very multicultural environment) I interviewed a potential new staff member for an hour. She left her glasses behind and came back next day to collect them, so I had contact with her twice. When I told my staff she was joining us, one asked if she was \u201cblack or white\u201d (fair question as we had predominantly African clients and important to deal with cultural sensitivities due to nature of our work, so no inference of racism). I struggled to answer but her family name was \u201cJones\u201d so I took a punt and replied \u201cwhite\u201d. When she commenced work it transpired she was Nigerian. I just do not see \u201ccolour\u201d and nor does my daughter. I understand that. That is amazing. I might have to try that. :)  There was a tip of my tongue or similar on reddit the other month where someone asked about stylized drawings of a person like who they were? And people guessed and guessed and disagreed. I forgot to save the thread but it was perfect to explain to people how face blindness works. \n\nAs a white person I also get doubly anxious about not recognizing POC because I do not want them to think I am racist or lazy. I do not know how to fix this. Another commenter mentioned taking a box of apples into work, having the person they were having a problem with pick one, put the picked apple back in the box, mix the apples up, and then ask them to find the apple they picked. It is a striking visual, I think. Yes, I like that too! But there also needs something that works person to person in a way that people understand and are not upset anymore. My coping strategy is to just talk to everyone (small talk) and wait for something were I can tell where I know them from. I am lucky to have a fairly mild Form though so after a while I can remember most people unless they are too samy. It would help, I think, if prosogagnosia was not so obscure. Most people do not think it exists and the few that do, unfortunately, seem to think it is \"voluntary.\" Like the face blindness will go away if the people who have it try hard enough. I always feel awkward and a bit ashamed and it actually gets worse when I am stressed. But yeah, some  people tend to think it is careless and not being interested in other people rather than just a weird brain. Have not had it happen but I will say it can be harder for me Before I knew it was faces in general that I could not see, I told people that I could see race.  \nI could tell if someone is skin was darker than mine (which is like everyone, to varying degrees), but not if they were First Nation, or Japanese, or Pilipino.\n\nPeople told me it was \"internalized racism\" or something. Somehow not being able to tell them apart was being racist for not respecting their differences.  \nBut it is really that I could not tell their differences until I knew the specific people better. So unless they were wearing a turban or a button blanket or something, they would look a lot alike. I just phrase it as being unable to remember the features of people.\n\nIt is not so much that they look the same, it is that you _cant remember the differences_.\n\nAnd then I usually bring up the time I could not recognize my mother. That usually paints the situation clearly. Sorry. Yeah. *hugs* I might have to. Thank you. I know I am super late to this thread but I use the example of when I was a kid, I could not tell Chandler and Joey apart on Friends until they got different haircuts. I knew they were different people because they would be in scenes together but I could not tell which was which for a long time. Since they are well known characters, that is an example that quickly conveys how I will mix up pretty different faces, I have done so my whole life, and that it is not about race. Also late to the thread but: something that is helpful for me is giving some examples using white people. \"I am sorry, I am really self-conscious about this. I have a chance to get *anyone* mixed up, no matter their race. If there are two blonde girls with blue highlights, there is a good chance I will mix them up too.\"\n\nThat is one of my go-to examples because it is a combination of personal experience -- one time it was two Hispanic women with blue highlights, and another time it took me months to learn the difference between two blonde classmates in middle school, one of which even sat at my lunch table. I will remember that, thank you. Yeah, I can tell the black guys I know from school apart... because one of them is a good foot taller than the other with a completely different hairstyle. If I interacted with more POC I would have the same problem. Even more late to the thread but I had the exact same problem with those two characters !

I recently learned what prosopagnosia is and I am almost certain that I have a mild from of it because I have noticed that every single aspect that I have read of how it has effected others occurs to me frequently as well. Also every single online test that I have taken has suggested that I certainly have it to a degree. \nI have always been good at memorizing 3D structures so I think that I am very good at compensating for having this (if I do) but that does not change the fact that if I meet someone I forget what their face looks like the second I stop seeing it unless I have found some characteristic that sticks out so much that I can quickly memorize it. Even people I have met many times I do not recognize at all if its too out of context or if they are dressed very differently than they usually do. I could go in to details about why I am fairly certain that I have this but I am sure everyone reading this can relate to everything I would say it would probably just be redundant haha.\n\nAnyway though, my question is, how can I confirm that I do have it? I am not really one to respect a self diagnosis for an impairment based on things read online so even though all signs point to me having it to a degree how can I definitively confirm it so that I can explain it to others with out them immediately disregarding as me just self diagnosing something that I read about online?  I have never had anyone question where/how I was diagnosed when I have to tell them I am face blind. \n\nI am in the hospital a lot, so nurses. I have a sign I print up for my hospital room door that says Occupant has prosopagnosia please ID yourself every time. \n\nI actually got diagnosed accidentally. I would never heard of it. I was seeing a psychologist for other issues and when I ran into her in the hall before our appt I ignored her, she was a stranger. \n\n I have never had people question it, but I do think it is important to have a little more confirmation than your personal experience. If you have not taken the tests below they should give you some external confirmation. I will say I do not know what is actually required for an official diagnosis or how reliable the tests are. There may be some more documentation on the website. \n Thanks, that was actually the first website that I stumbled upon when trying to determine if I might have it.

I only recently heard about Prosopagnosia and I am not sure if this is what I am experiencing or if it is something completely different. I do not think so, tbh\u2026 But, Diabetes can cause eye problems though (diabetic retinopathy) so I would highly recommend you speak to your doctor if you feel like your eyesight is changing or worsening!

You likely have other issue developing that are causing problems, and you *really* need to see your doctor. Not a whole lot is known about proso, whicb is likely why you are struggking to find information. From what I understand, proso tends to be something that you are born with or that is acquired due to a cranial impact. \n\n\n\nThat said, *please see your doctor*. Diabetes, as you know, is nothing to mess around with. It can effect your eye sight. People with proso have facial recognition problems not because we cannot see, but because we just dont recognize the faces that we can see clearly. *Please seek medical assistance.* I have not heard of any connection between proso and diabetes, but T2DM (mellitus) can affect cognitive function and expression recognition. Wow! Thank you all for the information. I know the T2D can cause all kinds of weird/interesting/strange/terrible things and do see my Dr. regularly. The issue that I am experiencing is that faces before a year ago were pretty distinguishable, but then I started to see them as all the same shape (round, long, etc.) and now they are all starting to look the same feature-wise, so if you showed me 2 different people I would not be able to tell who was who. Definitely see your doctor and tell him what is up.  For me I have always been faceblind.  It can be caused by brain injuries and such as well though, so something more could be going on.

So I have been really bad with remembering people for ...I guess as long as I can remember? I always assumed it was just my anxiety (which it could be!). But I also guess I could have some kind of mild face blindness going on too. Here is my reasoning - how does it align with your experience w prosopagnosia?\n\n* I work in retail, and when I am on fitting rooms, I could LITERALLY be helping and chatting with someone for 10 minutes. When they go in - and then ESPECIALLY if they come back out in new clothes - I completely do not recognize them.

That is not how prosopagnosia works. For some, it does. not recognizing myself in the mirror: yes it works that way for me (i know i am standing before the mirror so there is always more than enough context and that is actually the least problem i have with it)\n\nluckily I do not have gender dysphoria so i do not know about additional problems I almost always recognize myself in the mirror - but I look like several completely different people to me.  I recognize all of them.  (Not that I think I am several different people.  Just that a number of factors will change my appearance enough for me to seem different.)\n\nOccasionally I kind of look like a rather unattractive boy to me (I am a women in her 30s) at just the right angle.  I identify strongly as female and it does not bother me.  I mean I am not thrilled and I would not like it if I usually looked like that, partially because it is not a good look, but I guess I do not identify that as me.  It is just how I look sometimes for a second.  I could see how it would be more upsetting though if my experience with gender was difficult, so I was more sensitive to looking like a boy.  \n\nI do not know if it would be different with or without the prosopagnosia though, because if you are at the sink looking in the mirror, you are expecting the person to be you. So I have never been confused about who is in a mirror. Who else could the reflection be? As with most dysphoric individuals I know, my confusion stemmed more from, \"Wait, why do I look like this? This is all wrong, I should not have these traits.\"\n\nThe incorrect sex characteristics I notice on myself might be more prominent to me than to others, not only due to dysphoria and general insecurity issues, but also because I need all the information I can get so I know what to look for when picking myself (or anyone) out in pictures, where most people do not need to look that deeply. \n\nI actually had to learn about prosopagnosia *twice* before I made connections between my life experiences. (The first time was unfortunately portrayed as though prosopagnosia = literally seeing empty featureless faces, which did not help.) \n\nIn short, the whole trans thing was undoubtedly a complicating factor when doing \"self-assessments,\" for lack of a better term, as I had to figure out ways to isolate what the problem really was and rule out what it was not. \n\n(Eventually compared pre-transition images and videos of myself taken very close in time to realize I could not confidently say \"yep, that is the same person\" let alone \"yep, that is me\" unless I remembered the context of it, recognized objects in it, or someone told me it was of me - proving it went beyond being socially awkward, having bad eyesight, or just looking a lot different now.) Interesting.\n\nI think that is the first time I have heard of someone transitioning being used to help isolate a mental abnormality. I was thinking more \"corner of the eye\" kind of seeing yourself in the mirror instead of spending on front of it.\n\nYou are right, though. Who else would it be? proso and trans here, i still dont recognize myself now that i look how i want to but its definitely easier to look in the mirror I guess that makes the most sense.

So I would expect a similar situation from those who *do* recognize faces)\n\nIn terms of face recognition issues and gender dysphoria- I personally tend not to feel dysphoric about my face (unless I am just having a really bad day- but because I do not remember the features of my face really, I only feel said dysphoria when I am looking directly at my face- but even then, I feel that I cannot fully grasp *what* it is exactly that I do not like, because if I change the angle I backtrack from what I think feels specifically \u2018off\u2019 because it does not look like the same face anymore I guess suggesting it as encountering an unexpected mirror in the clothing section of a store would have been a better way to frame it.\n\nSo I guess if you worked in a store like that, so had a uniform or something, then seeing yourself in a mirror would be more likely to think that it was another employee instead of yourself.", "How long did it take you to realize \ud83d\ude02  Realize what?

I do not have an issue in real life or in colored films/TV, but in black and white I am sometimes completely unable even when everyone else I know does not struggle at all. Is it possible for some form of the condition to be related to color? The Twilight Zone. Need I say more. I have the same problem.

I live in a really, really, really white area, and I am also better than a lot of people who grew up in this area at telling black people apart.  (If you grow up/live in an area without a lot of racial diversity, apparently you commonly have trouble with facial recognition for other races.  I have found that I am about the same with everyone, but if there are only two black guys who attend the church and you are in the church, that is easy.)  The point is the way I recognize faces is different, so it sometimes works better than other people's but usually works worse.\n\nI know what you mean socially.  I did great the first couple of weeks of college, because I am fine at meeting new people.  But it is hard to form a relationship if it takes months to be able to reliable recognize people.  I realized later looking at picture of my friends is that I rarely make friends with someone who does not have a distinct appearance.\n\nWhether or not you meet the limits to be classified as having prosopangosia, the coping mechanisms people use probably will help you. I have not been officially diagnosed or anything, but I figured out I had this to a degree when I was in my 30s.  So much stuff made more sense.  \n\nAs others said it is a spectrum, and I describe myself has having like mild red/green color blindness, whereas others are completely blind when it comes to facial recognition.  I can recognize people by their faces, but it takes me a long long time to do it, and I tend to use everthing else including hair and voice to I would them instead.   I tend to identify people as more of a gestalt of the whole, like hair, how they dress, voice, in my office or friend from college all ties into how they are identified to me, so I tend to notice if an office mate changes their hair, but I a lot of times I will not recognize an office mate outside of work unless they speak to me .  I also tend to get people with obvious distinguishing traits mixed up, really tall blonde guy with a beard?  Wait, there is two of them? Whelp, that is news to me.\n\nAs for movies and such, yeah, most actresses change their hair and makeup and I do not recognize them, male actors do not tend to do that sort of thing as much.  Then there is gary fucking old man the ninja chameleon. Then i would say yeah, but im not a doctor so dont take my word to heart. Weird, there were only pictures of white people? Seems a little outdated... If i find any that arent just white people ill link it to you (no promise on speed i have a full plate right now) Shout out to all our spotter friends helping us navigate media and the real world \ud83d\ude4c That Is one of the best descriptions of the facial blindness spectrum ive ever heard! I wish i could pin a comment on this sub. Thanks.", "Just going to put it out there that proso + body dysmorphia is one hell of a combo What do *you* look like? Hell, what do *I* look like?? I now know (well learned more about tbh) the reason why when I take pictures of myself, I feel like I look drastically different with my hair or makeup a certain way, or even an angle. And on top of that I am trying to lose 20lb, and when I tell people how I feel that my face is actually huge, they tell me I am delusional and that I do not remotely look the way I think I do. So now I just have no clue what I look like thanks to dysmorphia as well. \n\nIt is like living a permanent hallucination, goddamn. You are not alone. YES same! I always feel like I look super weird in candids and videos and I think a part of it is that I do not know what I look like, so I am surprised every time. I do not have a strong mental image of my face, but whatever I do have does not seem to match reality.\n\nI have been trying to take pictures of myself (not posed selfies) and videos of myself talking etc just to study them, and hopefully build a more accurate picture of myself in my head. It is kind of cool, but it is hard to stay consistent with it cause I get sick of looking at my face. You are not alone. I am in the exact same boat. I know how you feel , one thing that put it in perspective was when I realized my perspective of myself was completely different than expected if I did not know it was me. Sometimes when I  dyed and cut my hair I would not recognize myself in reflection immediately. As a stranger I was pretty dang hot in the right moment. I have no idea what I look like. When I head to the lavatory and catch sight of myself in the mirror, I have to inspect and learn that face, sometimes I think I look good, most times not so good, but always a stranger. I cannot think how bad having dysmorphia would be! Omg yes. I have lost over half my body weight and I do not recognize myself. On the bright side though I can reassure you that you do acclimate, just slowly. I do not recognize myself in pictures from my heaviest. I literally step out of the way of my own reflection in doors now thinking I am about to smack into somebody. But pictures of me halfway into my weight loss for some reason now look like me to me. CONGRATS ON LOSING HALF YOUR MASS!! And damn yea, that is what I am afraid of. I just hope I acclimate soon enough lol ahhh dang it that sounds super rough :( \n\n\nmost of us do not even really care if our friends are considered traditionally beautiful. \n\n\nI hope your professional medical people are able to provide tailored help, considering how rare proso is. Because of prosopagnosia I have no idea how masculine my face looks, so I have no idea how well I would be able to pass if I transitioned. Pro-trans hugboxes will always be positive, I do not know where to go where I can trust someone to give me an honest assessment.\n\nAphantasia does not bother me at all, but prosopagnosia has some really frustrating downsides.", "Joyce Hamilla: The spy who recognized my arm - Faceblind Podcast ", "No, this is not star wars casting  I was so mad when I realized that was not the case \ud83d\ude02", "I just read about prosopamnesia for the first time I was reading the Wikipedia article for prosopagnosia, which then led me to ( which I had never heard of before. They are very similar, but apparently people with prosopamnesia can and do learn faces, it just takes them multiple times to see them to learn them.\n\nIn this sub most people seem to agree that there are different levels of prosopagnosia, and that some people with prosopagnosia *can* still learn faces after enough repetition and exposure. Were we just wrong this whole time, or do you think the distinction between prosopagnosia and prosopamnesia is bullshit? *Prosopagnosia* and *Prosopamnesia* are just convenient scientific tags for two particular sets of symptoms.   \n\nThere are people with Prosopagnosia who have zero ability to recognize faces, no matter how hard they practice.  Its very real.  The scientific definition of Prosopagnosia is that 98% of people recognize faces better than you do.  If you are not in that bottom 2%, then you do not have prosopagnosia no matter how much difficulty you have remembering faces.\n\nNow here is the thing.  How do you demonstrate that 98% of people are better at faces than you are?  There is no perfect test that will establish that with certainty.  Its all guess work unless you are really have zero ability to recognize faces. I do not know. The distinction is really arbitrary from my perspective. Like, I recognize Obama and a few other celebrities after being exposed to them a lot, so by that reasoning I should never have trouble with people in my family, right? But sometimes I do.  \n\n\nI want to know if they did a proper study of the amnesia version - because without looking into it more closely, my current hypothesis is I am just learning everyone is other common identifiers, so of course the more I am exposed to them the better I remember them. For example, if I see Obama with four different hairstyles, I start recognizing each of them as Obama, and maybe I can even conflate a few to start recognizing him with similar but different hairstyles, too. But if you cut out his face so I cannot see his hair at all, he is unrecognizable. I am not convinced that this prosopamnesia thing is not just acknowledging that we can build several profiles to help us separately identify a single individual. When I recognize people, I do not think about HOW I do it.  I just know them, am not sure, or have no clue.  Often when I learn people, it is not so much that I learn their faces as that I am able to identify them by the sum of their features.\n\nI am pretty good at categorizing pictures of famous people, such as politician or actor.  Politicians usually have a certain type of appearance and expression in their photos.  You can further narrow it down by age of the picture and obvious demographic markers.  Assuming that the photo is of the most famous person that meets that category, often gets you the right person...if you remember that person's name.\n\nIt sounds like there simply is not enough research and agreement on classification to really make distinctions here.  Of course, ideally, we would have a better source than a Wikipedia article...but I am too lazy to google right now. Recognising people seems to be luck of the draw for me. For example I can walk past my own children and not recognise them, or I can see them and immediately recognise them by their stance or the way they move. I dont recognise anyone sitting in a vehicle, but I think that is tied up with the fact that I cant tell vehicles apart. \n\nI explain prosopagnosia as having an index card in my head, with an image, for everyone I know. If I dont recognise someone it is not because I have forgotten their faces, but because I dont see or hear the clues I need to connect them to the right index card. \n\nThere is a weird thing that happens when i recognise someone, it is like their face is suddenly reshaped into one i recognise. It can be quite disconcerting and i have heard from others with prosopagnosia that the same happens to them. So I think there is a difference between prosopagnosia and prosopamnesia but it would be difficult to draw the boundary between them. The article has pretty legit looking sources, those could be a place to start. Thank you, I think prosopamnesia sounds like it makes more sense for me, possibly - and I would not heard of it before. &gt;*Prosopagnosia* and *Prosopamnesia* are just convenient scientific tags for two particular sets of symptoms.   \n\nI might be missing some important detail here, but I do not really see that big of a difference between the two.  For the first handful of meetings, the two would be indistinguishable. \n\nIt makes sense to me that prosoamnesia might be closer to a subtype, rather than a completely distinct condition if both fall into the bottom 2% of ability to recognize faces. Me as well, at least with how it is described in the Wikipedia page. It does sound like it is still not fully fleshed out as a diagnosis though, and that doctors do not really know if it is a distinct disorder or a subset of prosopagnosia. Especially with only two diagnosed cases, makes me think some people on this sub could help them out lol I reckon they probably could!\nI took some online tests a while back and got on a list where a researcher sends me new ones some times. But I do wonder whether I do ok on them, because they do not seem to test the particular things I have issues with. And I know there is a problem, because it gets me into embarrassing / depressing scrapes sometimes. &gt; I do not really see that big of a difference between the two. \n\nThe difference hardly matters for practical individual coping purposes.  But scientific studies might want to narrow their participants to one group or the other, especially if the maladies are attributed to malfunctions in different parts of the brain. &gt;  might want to narrow their participants to one group or the other, especially if the maladies are attributed to malfunctions in different parts of the brain.\n\nTrue, but that is also why the DSM (for example) uses additional specifiers to offer additional details on the diagnosis. If \"prosopagnosia\" is defined as being a breakdown of the facial recognition systems of the brain, it still allows variations and subtypes. Developmental proso could run into the same issue, as contrasted with the type that is onset with brain injury\n\nFor another example, I was born colorblind, but a friend of mine had the condition onset via a car accident. We are both classified as being colorblind despite researchers having differing interests in us as study candidates.  I have never been quite sure if I have prosopagnosia or not but prosopamnesia sounds much closer to my experience.\n\nI can *mostly recognise the ~5 people in my year at school after 3 years together but I can only recognise a couple from the year below me. \n\n* I say mostly because at the beginning of this semester I did not recognise everybody but now at the end of semester I can again. I cant recognize people I see daily outside of context. I cant even recognize my family outside of context unless I identify them by their voice. Never met someone in real life that even understands what I have. It is been really annoying because people think I just dont like them and I am purposely ignoring them. I have Prosopamnesia, and there is an important difference. Basically, those with Prosopagnosia cannot recognize faces when they see them, so everyone looks the same. For those with Prosopamnesia, they can recognize faces, but cannot store them in their memory or recall what they look like.\n\nIt is a small difference, but there is one, though it is impossible for brain scans to tell the difference so you basically have to figure it out for yourself. I only realize I had Prosopamnesia because I could recognize faces, but I cannot recall them at all (paired with my Aphantasia).\n\nReading about people's experiences with Prosopamnesia versus Prosopagnosia helped me solidify that I do have that former.", "Do you post pictures of yourself online? I was just randomly wondering if face blindness made people more or less likely to share photos of themselves in different locations (or did not affect likelihood)?\n\nFor more likely - You do not recognize other people, so you do not expect them to recognize you, so you are less worried about privacy.\n\nFor less likely - You do not recognize other people, so you do not see the point of sharing them.  (For social media obviously; there are other reasons for photos.)\n\nI do not like having my photo published in any way.  I wonder if part of it is because I am easily recognizable and pretty memorable, but I rarely recognize other people beyond a handful I know really well.  It sometimes makes me feel like I kind of want to be invisible.  Not like in a bad self-esteem way, but like in a privacy way. No i do not, i never considered whether my decision against it had anything to do with prosopagnosia I do not take (or have) a lot of pictures. I am not photo averse, I just do not see the reason to have pictures. (Though I do know that pictures are important to other people.) I do post to Instagram regularly, but only to promote my business. If it were not for that, I would have zero interest.\n\nI do not have a personal account at all because I find it very frustrating how so many people do not have their real name on their accounts. I often do not even recognize my close friends and colleagues when they post, so I have had to just memorize some friends user names. It is very rare that I will post a picture of myself anywhere. In fact it is been about a couple of years since the last time I did so. I am not sure how much it has to do with prosopagnosia as I am only mildly face blind, but I hate taking selfies of myself as my face never quite looks right in photos I have taken of myself I do not have very strong faceblindness (so I would recognize people whose photos I see a lot) but it creeps me out when people I barely know remember my face, so I would say I do not share pictures a lot for that reason Little off topic, but for me social media, especially facebook was great in the past because browsing through the feed is kind of like looking at flashcards as long as people post their faces for their profile pics. It has helped me remember what people look like. Unfortunately spending too much time scrolling the feeds has other negative mental impacts. I have never even thought of this. I am reasonably careful about what I put online but I do not think it has anything to do with face blindness. \n\nOTOH I have hated photos of myself since childhood. I was told over and over \u201csmile or you will have to pay to develop the photos\u201d.  I still do not like having photos taken and while I go along with it as an adult, I always feel coerced into it.  I wonder if face blindness has anything to do with this aversion even though I cannot make a conscious connection between the two. I do not think it is any kind of dysphoria regarding my appearance because I do not mind seeing myself in mirrors but photos/videos are always displeasing to me. See, I cannot recognize people from photos very well, so that is not too helpful unless I know them pretty well, just confusing. Same exact answer here. I rarely upload a new one as I often do not like the way I look in most pictures. I do not post photos of myself online, but I also do not really post anything personal online except in this community.  I am generally hyper-private. I do not have strong feelings about photos online one way or the other, but I am quite recognizable in person by my style of dress and I like it that way. I may not remember someone, but I know that if they seem to remember me they are probably not also mistaken: it is hard to miss the woman with The Hat. So glad I am not the only one", "Pride flag? Since prosopagnosia counts as a form of neurodiversity, and a lot of neurodiverse communities have pride flags, is there a proso flag? If not, I have a few design ideas and stuff Is it just a black circle? Like the Japanese flag but black? Maybe with a big giant question mark?!? Haha Maybe! I did a concept design with black, white, and dull blue stripes with the ND symbol in the middle, but I might give it a circle cuz that sounds cool lol &gt;Is it just a black circle? Like the Japanese flag but black? \n\nBeing colorblind, I cannot approve of this. With my particular form, the brightness of red is significantly reduced, so I do not think I could tell the difference between the two, just based on color I guess just a plain black flag? :) A generic smiley face?", "That time my husband had to point out my own brother to me and assure me it was him My beau and I went to the mall more or less on a whim some time ago. This particular mall is about 45 minutes from my parents' place, where my brother was staying while on break from college. Hubby pointed to a face in the crowd and said, \"Hey, is not that ?\"\n\nI looked right at the person he indicated, I was not being dismissive when I said, \"Nah.\" \n\n\"Yeah, it is, that is his girlfriend right there.\" \n\n\"No it is not.\" \n\nIt was not until my husband got my brother's attention and he spoke that I even recognized him. For context, it is not like my brother and I are estranged or anything like that, and we are not far apart in age. We literally grew up together. I see him. Frequently. But the fact that I ran into him in an unexpected moment rendered him a complete stranger until I heard his voice, even when I was looking right at him and actively attempting to associate my info- and face-clouds.\n\nI already knew I met many of the clinical requirements for prosopagnosia, but this was the incident that really made me realize the potential for it to be... Problematic  \n\nIt also makes me look hella racist at work sometimes. I always knew I was pretty bad at recognising people but like you I had a incident that really brought it home when I met my Nan in town and talked to her for 10 minutes before realising who it was. I see her all the time, but never in town, the lack of context made her a complete stranger which was quite upsetting. Did make my family realise I was actually serious about the recognition problems though!  \n\n\nTerrible at work too, not currently in work but used to work in a shop mostly staffed by women between 20 and 35. Could not tell any of them apart, to the point I once asked the lady next to me where my manager was and it turned out it WAS my manager. Whoops.  \n\n\nI can manage to be blandly polite to casual acquaintances (i am polite to everyone, never know when it might be someone I know after all!) but as soon as it gets to the point that I need to identify someone from out of the faceless horde I am totally useless. I am good at being friendly, but terrible at making friends :( It sounds like you have prosopagnosia and, yes, it can be inconvenient and embarrassing. However it comes in different shades and varies in effect from one person to another. I dont think I have it that bad, although I frequently walk past my own children without recognising them if I see them out of the house.  Now they are grown I have trouble with differentiating between my husband and sons if they are all together in a room with me. The main thing is that you can live with it although you may decide to modify your work and lifestyle to reduce sources of stress. One time I went to get my daugther at the summer camp, and she did not notice me because she was playing. I circled the room twice, and I was pretty sure she was not there, so I asked the monitor why she was not there yet. That was embarrassing :) That is ok you are using the face area in the brain for more important stuff.", "Prosopagnosia and Ace Spectrum? I cannot say that there is any correlation, but I am asexual. Which means (in a very short generality) that I do not experience sexual attraction towards others. I feel like it is my prosopagnosia, and because I do not really see physical attraction. Anyone else the same? I would love to hear your encounters and experience.\n\n( Very interesting. I am not Ace, but the only other person that I know that has prosopagnosia is. I never really thought of any possible connection between the two.\n\nI am cis female. He is cis male. I wonder if that plays into it as well. It is definitely interesting and it makes me curious! I am a cis female and I have honestly never met anyone else with prosopagnosia so I do not really get to talk about it much Just curious, have you asked about prosopagnosia on the Ace subreddit? I think there are a number of people that have prosopagnosia, but they do not know it. That is a good point! I will try there too! Cis male. I do not recognise people's faces, but I can (\n\nI am kidding, of course. But are faces really that important for sexual attraction? As long as someone looks relatively normal I am not even going to notice their face. And if their face is abnormal, I might notice it but I would not particularly care. I think the connection would be through autism. People with autism are more likely to have prosopagnosia and to be queer and/or trans I think that is interesting too. I have never thought of  being tested for autism but I also never considered myself to be. I could be wrong though, of course. I am straight and not trans (though I support all those who are), it is just I do not find people sexually attractive at all. When people ask me for my \u201ctype\u201d I really do not have one because I never been able to see it. Yes I can tell body types apart obviously, it is all the same to me. It is weird to explain, I think. Sorry for rambling! I have mild prosopagnosia and I am ace! i am aromantic? that is interesting, i never considered there being any correlation. the way i see it, it is not that i am incapable of *seeing* people\u2019s faces and people\u2019s levels of attractiveness (which, when it comes to sexual attraction, is also not limited to just their faces), i am just incapable of recognizing the faces i already know or remembering/picturing those faces. but when i am looking straight at someone, i can distinguish whether i find them attractive or not. if that makes sense. \n\ni am cis female and bisexual with a very high libido so i cannot super relate to asexuality but i would be very interested to learn if there was any sort of correlation! I cannot make friends with someone until I can recognize them, which makes it difficult because I make friends with people months after it would happen more naturally.  I cannot imagine dating someone who is hard to recognize.  I can see someone and think they are good looking, but I cannot imagine having sex with someone who I cannot recognize.  Seems creepy.  (Cis female who is married to a distinctive looking man.) They are for me. Until I discovered my type very late, I never really felt very strong attraction. (I do not exactly have prosop. , just passing by, but i think i am slightly on the spectrum) I was Ace for most of my adult life. I am not really anymore but my sex drive is still real low. Prior to you asking this my doctors and I always assumed it was related to my screwed up endocrine system (which is not related to prosopagnosia, just poor luck). I sometimes do wonder if I am aspie. I also have synaesthesia I think these things could be connected. My prosopagnosia definitely makes it harder for me to understand physical attraction. 90% of humans look basically the same, so being told some are hot and others are unremarkable does not make any sense to me. I am ace, but I do not think it has anything to do with my prosopagnosia. Do you have any sources for this? (Not doubting - genuinely curious) Unfortunately not \ud83d\ude15\n\nI do not remember where I read it I am Ace too, but I do not know if it has any correlation to Proso. I do find myself physically, but not sexually, attracted to a person's style of clothing. I have 'types' based on that. Wow. When I clicked \u201cYes\u201d I really was not expecting the results to be 1/3 faceblind people are ace adjacent. That is a HUGE amount. That is surprising. 1/3 of people with prosopagnosia are asexual?? It is an interesting thing to ponder.  I am ace as well.  I have never really considered the two things to be closely related to one another (my proso is on the milder side) but it could be interesting to test for a correlation. I used to be quite active on ace forums and it certainly seemed as if a higher proportion of asexuals were on the spectrum compared to the general population.  Of course, this is just based upon subjective experience, so it does not carry the same weight as an actual study to confirm it. I am extremely late to this thread but I do have a lot of sexual dysfunction issues and a part of them are just about not recognizing body parts that are ment to be \"sexual\" as sexual, I have been suspecting it could be facial blindness extending to other aspects of life so it is great to find out there are other people experiencing this and it is not just another dead end or fake lead.\n\nDo any of you also struggle with arousal because becoming hyperaware of someone is body (or your own) does not seem to come as easily as it does for regular people? I find tattoos, patterns, mirrors and anything else that will force me to pay attention can help (sometimes a little, sometimes a lot), but if there is anyone else that has found ways to get this issue out of the way (or at least manage it) any sort of information you have would be a godsend.\n\nWeirdly enough, another thing that seems to help me is wearing tighter clothing made out of weirder materials. That sort of treatment was actually intended for people with anorexia, but both issues seem to stem from neurological body perception issues, so I thought \"why the hell not\". I am asexual and I am wondering if I have prosopagnosia too.... This is actually pretty interesting I am kind of asexual and identify as non binary. I have only had two partners my entire life and 5 crushes my entire life, but once I do have a crush i feel romantic, so I am capable of experiencing sexual desires. I guess ultimately my libido is hardly there. I do not have  flirtatious skills people seem to develop naturally nor do I have a desire to be flirtatious. I never notice when people are hitting on me either, terrible with innuendos in general. My face blindness is moderate and I have mild autism.

How do you manage social situations with your face blindness? Not sure if extrovert is the right word - this question applies to anyone who is really social.\n\nAlthough I am enthusiastic around my close friends, I do get tired out socially relatively easily, and I reallllly do not love talking to strangers. :/ I get stressed in situations where I am meeting a lot of new people at once (big parties, events, etc.), since I am not great at tracking who is who.\n\nI do not think I would like crowds even if I was not face blind, so this does not bother me too much, but then I started wondering - are any of you super social? How do you handle this with your face blindness? I am an introvert as far as needing alone time to recharge, but I am very social! I hear you on getting anxious in large social situations, it is stressful, especially since the context in which you may know someone is different.\n\nHonestly, I often try to let people know that I have facial blindness and may need a reminder in the future; I have found that if I am up front, people are just generically curious, and not bothered. In the future, if I see them again, they recognize me and I do not recognize them, I just say something like 'remind me where we have met?'. The more lighthearted I am about it, the easier it is, I think it just helps for them to know that I do actually care about whether or not we have met before.\n\n I went to business school last year (full time immersive two year program) and am in a cohort of 250 people. That is 250 brand new faces and names. It was really hard and there are still people who I have been in groups with for an entire class that when I see them at the bar or something, I wait on them to talk to me. I mostly fake knowing people and am pretty vague with my conversation until I am 100% sure I know them. I do not *think* they can tell. \n\nTo complicate things, because this is a 2 year program, there was one cohort above me when I got here, and now there is another cohort below me. That is 500 additional people I could confuse with my own cohort, etc. \n\nI gravitate to the people I know really well (who perhaps not coincidentally have pretty unique features). This helps but also means I meet new people more slowly. \n\n I am hella extroverted and strangers are my favorite because they cannot be offended you do not recognize them. Also I realize I hang out with women more because of their accessories. Guys tend to have really similar hair and if everyone is wearing the same suit it is madness. \n\nBut if I have to navigate a social place where people know me. I will find a person that does not have face blindness to be the Emily to my Maranda (devil wears Prada) I tend to pick people pretty good and end up with a symbiotic relationship of sorts. \n\nBut if all else fails I will just talk to the crowd about myself or keep the topic in the moment and never reference the past or future. Sound more complicated then it is and it is all reflexive anyway so I really do not have a hard time with it. \n\nBut if someone tries to catch me out and is trying to be upset about it, then I just admit I am face blind and I barely recognize anyone even my own father. Then they cannot really be mad at me anymore without seeming like a bit of an ass. \n\nI end up at a lot of cocktail parties with artsy people so a lot of them tend to have a \u201clook\u201d they do not deviate from and tattoos.  I quite like meeting new people but I am completely hopeless at picking them out of a crowd. I have been going to the same social group/meetup for 2 years now and can only reliably recognise 3 people and only in context. One is a lady I have actually known for about 6 years but she changed her hair 4 years in so I thought it was someone else for the longest time, one is a big girl with extremely curly hair and one is a trans guy who always dresses like a walking pride parade, so they are all kind of distinctive :P  \n\n\nGenerally whenever I am talking to someone, wherever I am, I am friendly and polite but keep all conversation very non specific until I can pick up some context clues.   \n\n\nBiggest issue is making that jump from friendly acquaintance to friend.

I can never seem to get any further than general friendliness which makes me feel very isolated :(  \nI have considered telling people about my face blindness but at least for this group, it seems a bit late! \"Ah yes I have been pretending to know you for 2 years but I cannot recall any of our past conversations no hard feelings mate but I do not know you from Adam\" might not work so well :P (any pointers please let me know) For starters I never use anyone's name- makes things easier.  \n\n\nPersonally, I try and identify people by their stance/the sound of their voice/their fashion. Women are so much easier to hang out with, they have better fashion/accessories/hair to identify. Living in a socially conservative area, all the guys have the same fashion, and the same short hair. It is annoying when every guy literally looks the exact same.  \n\n\nI mean- with my face blindness It was not like I was ever going to be looking at their face anyway, so I rarely look at people. So, I work on identifying people in my peripheral vision, then confirm my judgement by the sound of their voice, and situational knowledge they possess. Thankfully my workplace requires name badges, so I do get an easy pass- Unfortunately I work in the public sector at the moment, and as such I try and bum customers off to my more socially competent co-workers. I try to set up social situations where it is a controlled group that I can identify, and avoid things like parties.  And generally be friendly, but vague. I am generally introverted, but in my extroverted days I do two things\n1. Adress the room\n2. Dont use names", "How do I get officially diagnosed? I am 98% sure I have prosopagnoisa and I have been telling new people that I meet that I have it because it makes life so much easier but I really want to get an official diagnosis so that I do not feel like I am lying or attention seeking when talking to people. Depends on where you are.  I am in the States, so I would start by contacting someone who does neurotesting (like, diagnosing autism and ADHD, etc.).  They would probably refer me elsewhere, but that is as good a place as any.  Maybe call a psychiatrist and ask them.\n\nThat said, looking at your post history, I think you are in Ireland, so presumably covered by the HSE.  Therefore, I would either ask my GP for a referral to a neuropsychologist, OR google around for researchers at Irish universities that do research into prosopagnosia.  I realize it is not Ireland, but it looks like there is some research being done at Swansea University in Wales, so those researchers might be able to give you a referral as well. Here is the specific research group at Swansea: ( OP, send Dr Jeremy Tree an email, there is plenty of testing you can do remotely. Tell them about Clark Kent.\n\nWith glasses: I am Clark Kent\n\nWithout glasses: I am super hero. Why do you need a diagnosis? What are you hoping to gain?\n\n There is no treatment. A diagnosis is not going to make people who have never heard of such a condition less skeptical. Useful for waving at HR departments, on occasion. That is kind of how I feel.  I talked to my doctor about it for the first time last year, although I have known for a decade.  She did not know anything (but I bet next time when I see her she will have read every research article she could find, so I am curious to see what she says) but 1.) Believed me - I have been a patient for awhile and I do not say I have stuff, and 2.) Got the social implications pretty quickly.  She asked if I wanted to pursue a diagnosis, and I am like there is no point.  (Unless they try to make me check IDs at school.  Then sign me up!)\n\nBut I think for some people it is validating. For me, I would like to be tested for it to understand myself better. Do I really have it, or have I just convinced myself I have it? Same with aphantasia.\n\nAlso, it is something that I find interesting to talk about, but at the moment I am self-diagnosed so I sound like someone from Tumblr. the \u201csounding like someone from tumblr\u201d thing is exactly how i feel and try to avoid sounding like", "Friends But They have All Got Nicolas Cage\u2019s Face GIF  Every time i join a new group and have not established my strategies yet.", "What is the most likely to cause humanity's extinction? ", "Explain it or apologise and move on? I have had people like my neighbours that were a little miffed because I do not greet them when they see me in places like the supermarket. Usually they start to speak and I recognise them from that.\nYesterday I met a therapist I have met before so she did not introduce herself and she mentioned that we met so skipped the introduction. In this setting I felt comfortable enough to mention I am faceblind and she apologised and introduced herself. I did recognise her name and the setting we had met before so we could move on.\n\nIt was the first time I mentioned it outside my family. I am very curious how other people handle it. I do not want to draw attention to myself by stating the faceblindness. But whenever people call me out for \"ignoring\" them, I feel horrible because I do not want to make them feel like that.\nNow I just apologise and come up with something on the spot, like that I had a busy day or I had something on my mind and not paying attention because of it.\n\nWhat is a good way to handle these situations? I find it is best to advertise it broadly and often so that people know what could happen if they run into me outside of their normal context. People usually find it interesting and want to know more as long as I do not behave as if it is some sort of handicap that is taboo or somehow slightly shameful to discuss.\n\nAs a side benefit, people often tell me who they are at the moment they approach me and I have found this to be HUGELY beneficial and I greatly appreciate them doing it as it takes the guesswork out of our conversation. I think it depends on how you are personally.  I do not mention it, because of the people I have told only a few take it seriously and help and the rest have been annoying.  Maybe that will change with time.  BUT also I am pretty good at coping mechanisms.  I cannot think of a time where anyone has called me out for ignoring them.  One thing in public is if there are not a lot of people around, I tend to smile at everybody.  Where I live that is fine culturally; people just think I am very friendly if they do not know me.  If there are not a lot of people around, I put a distracted look on my face so if they approach me they assume I was not paying any attention to anything and that is why I did not see them.  I think if I was frequently having people comment that I was ignoring them it might be worth testing out telling people. I usually just say something like \"sorry, I was not expecting to run into you here.\" I am very open about it. Ever since I did not recognize a close friend who I would known for a decade because she changed her hair, I lead with \u201cI am so sorry, I have face blindness, remind me how we know each other?\u201d when someone seems upset I did not recognize them. I pretty much only have to let people know once or twice before they remember and help me out. Now most folks I run into on a regular basis, like my wife\u2019s coworkers, know to remind me who they are. Some of them even seem to think it is kind of fun\u2014 I told one of them I usually recognize her by her cool earrings and now when she sees me she just points to them. I am happy to explain, but I am not going to apologize for a common medical condition. People will just have to learn to live with the knowledge that not everyone will recognize them on sight. I handle my face blindness really poorly. The few people I have told look at me like I am crazy or brush it off as though it is not a real problem for me. So I tell almost no one. I tend to be really friendly to everyone in public and luckily I have never been called out for ignoring anyone. I do fail to recognize people when I encounter them out of the usual context but am usually able to pass it off as being distracted or focused on something else.  I am kind of amazed by people who are able to talk about this so openly with everyone they know. This is the approach I take too. I tell everyone I meet whom I expect to meet again so they are not insulted. Any discomfort that might come from saying, \"heads up, I have face blindness so please forgive me for not recognizing you next time we meet\" is much, much less uncomfortable than that panicky feeling I get when someone approaches me and I do not know *if* I know them, let alone *how*. 100% explain it.

", "TIL Matt Damon is not Mark Wahlberg - inspired by a previous post I am definitely on the low spectrum of prosopagnosia, until a few days ago I did not know it was a disorder, I just thought I was comically bad at recognising people. I did not realise the coping mechanisms I instinctively developed to help myself (remembering a key feature and hoping it did not change, memorising what the people I was with were wearing in public, etc) were actually coping mechanisms and not just what everyone did. I feel like since I found this sub I have a better understanding of myself and I feel great! So I thought I would share a funny experience inspired by a previous post (see TIL Dave Franco is not Zach Efron)\n\nA few years ago the hubs and I went to see The Martian (starring Matt Damon) in cinema. During the pre-film ads was a trailer for Daddy's Home (starring Mark Wahlberg.) Half way through the film I lean over and whisper to my husband \"hey, he is pretty good in this. Maybe we should go see Daddy's Home, too.\" The look of perplexity on his face did not seem to phase me. I just assumed he thought the trailer looked rubbish and did not want to see it. \"That is Mark Wahlberg.\" He says. I nod \"yes, I know.\" He then proceeds to explain that Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg are not the same person. I still have trouble telling them apart. Now when people get offended that I do not recognise them I just recount the Matt Damon story.\n\nWhat celebrities do you have a hard time telling apart? I too confused the Mark and Matt duo. I also thought Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise were the same person for about a decade.  They do look pretty similar! I have a terrible time with the trio of Joseph Gordon-leavitt, Shai Lebeof, and James McAvoy. There was someone else in this grouping, but I cannot remember who it was \n\nI am also really bad with most actresses. I guess its because they are so likely to change their hair between movies.\n\nFun Fact about Brad Pitt. ( All of the big eyed blondes confuse me The only reason I can tell Joseph Gordon-Leavitt apart is because he looks like my little cousin, but she would not appreciate me saying that heh.\nJust had to look up James McAvoy and you are so right. He looks just like Shia Lebeof\n\nKaty Perry and Zooey Deschanel are the bane of my existence. They are definitely the same person  They are though. Even people whose brains work normally admit that  I am colorblind, so dirty blondes, light brunettes, redheads all look the same to me.\n\nFrom a reverse perspective, Natalie Portman is an actress that I can never recognize from movie to movie. Saw Annihilation recently, and loved it, but had no idea that Portman was the lead in that role, up until the credits.\n\nActually, as great as that movie was, it was just bad for my prosa and colorblindness. One of the make actors, I had no idea was the same person at a couple points in the movie, two different pairs of actresses that I could not tell apart. \n\nAt one point the camera is looking at some fungal growth and just lingers for too long.

", "Recognizing Identical Twins Does anyone else have trouble recognizing that two people are identical twins? I remember attending an event in college and we had a sign up sheet with our names and birthdays. I noticed two of the girls had put down the same birthday. When I said \u201cdid you know you guys have the same birthday?\u201d they laughed and said \u201cOf course we know, we are twins!\u201d \n\nI can compare two faces when they are next to each other and see similarities and differences, but I still struggle sometimes to identify identical twins. \n\nI wonder if anyone else experienced this phenomenon. Actually, most of the people look like identical twins to me Two of my best friends in high school were identical twins! I did not clock them as twins either. When I first met them, they were walking with another girl. Later my other friend referred to \"the twins\" and I was like \"who?\" She finally reminded me of the girls we would met and I said \"Oh! They were twins? Which two?\" Which must have been pretty wild to hear. \n\nThey were not even the same *race* as the third girl. \n\nIt was a bit of a superpower though, because once we became friends I could tell them apart as easily as any other two people with similar hair. They just did not look any *more* alike to me than most other pairs of people. To me, everyone looks alike and nobody looks alike. It is like they have been run through a generic filter.\n\nI worked with a woman that was an identical twin. I saw a picture on her desk of her(?) and a sister(?). They were both wearing happy birthday crowns.\n\nI said, \"Oh, are you a twin?\" (I was not open about my face blindness in those days.)\n\nShe said yes and told me a couple of stories about switching places with her twin, so I figured they must be identical. The problem is the same as siblings who look similar. Face alone if there are no unique identifying features I notice right away I will struggle with recalling the correct name on command, but I can identify the differences between each other like I would other people. So glad to know it is not just me! Lol, if I could tell who looked alike, it would make it a lot easier to tell who looked different.\n\nWhenever I see a movie scene where there are twins or clones or other \"duplicates\" of a character, I play a game called \"is this the same actor over and over, or a bunch of similar-looking actors filmed as a group?  Wait... are they supposed to be clones/twins/whatever or did I miss a plot point somewhere?\n\nI generally cannot tell and do not notice when people are twins.  On the flip side, there have been times when I thought two people were a single individual, leading to some very confusing conversations. Yes, in a TV show I will recognize characters by their style, context, hair, etc. So I am often surprised on a \"long lost twin\" scenario when friends of one twin begin to mistake them as the other. \n\nI have also mistaken two actresses as one character. Like in the latest Mission Impossible I was surprised there were two leading women. I thought the spy lady wore wigs in certain scenes. Then both were in a scene together! \n\nAnd in real life I cannot pick out my server when they are all dressed similarly. Even if they are different race or gender I may confuse if they have the same clothes and haircut or style. \n\nI also have blanked on acquaintances' appearances, but vividly remember their personality or details of interacting with them. I even forgot the race of a coworker I had not seen in a year, yet I knew where she sat, her name, and a procedure I did not do often that she helped me with previously! I had to look in the company directory for her photo. Yes yes yes! I am so happy to see this here.\n\nMy nieces are identical twins and I knew them apart better than their own parents.\n\nI was watching something with my partner recently and after a while I said \u201chey, those two characters look kind of similar\u201d and my partner said \u201cthey are literally twins in real life...\u201d Yes! I have told people I have twin-recognition superpowers. And yeah, I do not recognize that people are twins unless they wear their hair exactly the same and dress similarly. But most twins I have down wear their hair differently, making it impossible for me to recognize them as twins, much less get them mixed up. I have recently befriended a pair of twins who have prosopagnosia as well, and it is been interesting talking about it with them.", "Clothes should be mandatory My two year old has swim lessons right now.  I take him in the women's locker room with me to change and shower before and after.  A bunch of older women seem to be showering and changing after swimming about the time kids are trickling in for their lessons.  Maybe a water aerobic class or just early laps? \n\nAnyway, the other day we went to go shower off before getting in the pool and a woman said hi.  She was completely naked washing herself after swimming.  (Which was fine.  That is what the showers are for and it is a high school pool so no privacy.)  I could not tell her hair color or general style.\n\nShe continued having a conversation with me.  She knew my name and my kid's name, along with personal things about us.  Finally figured out that she went to our church, but by what she knew I have narrowed it down to like five people who I like and have talked to at greater length.  At least I had a quick exit, because kiddo was ready to go to the pool.\n\nSeriously: How am I supposed to know who naked people are??!!  Old church ladies need tattoos or something! Ha! I have not encountered this problem (yet), and I had not even thought of how much that strips someone of all recognisable features. Hair, makeup, jewellery,...so much could be missing at the pool. They should definitely wear lanyards or get tattooed. I think I may have come across is uncomfortable...which she probably thought was because she was naked, but I did not care about that! I can totally relate to that story. So many times I will have a full-blown conversation with someone who apparently knows me on the street (I have become incredibly good at faking recognizing people, having done this for almost 30 years). After the conversation, my wife will lean in and whisper \"Who was that?\" and I will whisper back \"I have no idea!\"\n\nEvery time we go out, it feels like. This is my first read on this site and I cannot tell you how emotional I feel right now just reading yours.  I know there are others like me but honestly, I have never met anyone whose as bad at recognizing people as I am!  I usually feel the way you explained every time I go to town! I was in my high schools swim team and we all wore matching Speedos and swim caps so I never knew who anyone was. I feel so bad for anyone who tried to befriend me all those years ago Yeah, I do not think I have ever had an issue identifying a naked person before.  Not something that comes up a lot.

I think possibly this could be a form of prosopagnosia, secondary to autism, because of the role of the mirror neuron system. Essentially it was a hypergraphy-blindness, but after a first perception of this category of human created visual information in 2017 a fluency building, and crystallised memory process was able to engage, and I was able to catch up with what is real in this regard. Perhaps as well it is possible that people with full prosopagnosia might also sometimes not percieve hypergraphy existing in the world.\n\nHypergraphy was explored in the 20th century by writer Roland barthes, and explored in the \"lettrist\" art movement. I found some album artwork by the band \"slowdive\" helpful in percieving this phenomenon as well as hypergraphy in my environment.\n\nIf any ideas about this aspect, or links to any relevant research please let me know, any researchers interested in having a chat or my participating in a survey e.t.c please let me know.\n\n Also, it would be great to develop a diagnostic category or official condition name for this (if there is a medically recognised already existent diagnostic category please comment it here or message me). Perhaps you could provide some links to what you are talking about.\n\nI am not sure hypergraphy is a well known term. &amp;#x200B;\n\nI am talking about a non perception of hypergraphy, shown here on the hypergraphy wikipedia page below:\n\n(\n\nIt was explored in writings by various writers in the 20th century: for example Roland Barthes, and the \"lettrist\" art movement.  It is a form of content that perhaps could require a \"meta-rational\" overview or approach to handling healthily, I think. It can be very subliminal.\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have documented some examples of  **\"man-made hypergraphy\"** on my user account also:\n\n(\n\nI had a non-perception for this category of visual information or content until 2017, similar in a way to prosopagnosia, but could recognise faces overall, so it was more like a milder form or hypo-prosopagnosia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI now realise from googling once more today, that possibly aspects of it could be defined under: \"visual agnosia\", possibly \"apperceptive visual agnosia\", i am thinking:\n\n(\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere seems to be a lot of crossover between the areas of prosopagnosia, visual agnosia, and aprosodia, and a general involvement often in autistic conditions, perhaps due to the role of the mirror neuron system in autism, resulting in a \"theory of mind blindness, theory of mind partial-blindness, or some non-perception of theory of mind\" secondary to the autism. (I myself have had some suspected autistic traits formally noted in 2017, but am still undiagnosed, on the n.h.s waiting list for autism diagnostics, I personally think I might be a person with \"aspergers\"  or \"high-functioning asd\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps it was this type of autistic agnosia:\n\n(\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso, i am now discovering this exists:\n\n(\n\nThe musicians slowdive have done some musical work that I found helpful in 2017 with this aspect of things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere looks to be more in the field of verbal agnosia in autism as well.\n\nperhaps in future we will also have a diagnostic criteria for \"hyperlanguage agnosia\" or \"hyperlanguage prosopagnosia\" or \"meta-language agnosia\", \"meta-language prosopagnosia\" also (I did not percieve any of this apart from in the standard english usages of course, either until 2017, so it is possible for this aspect to also crop up).\n\nHyperlanguage can be defined as:\n\n(\n\n(\n\nI note also that we can quantifiy usages of hyper-languages or meta-languages academically and that this has been actualised in terms of formalisation to the stage of programming languages based on this concept existing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsuch as \"hypertalk\" by Dan Winkler (I did not know about the existence of this until 2019-2020 or so, only knew of the actor henry winkler, who played the character \"the fonz\" in the 20th century television show \"happy days\".\n\n(\n\n(\n\nthere is some reference online to hyperlanguage and hebrew in linguistic blogs e.t.c:\n\n(\n\nI remember reading somewhere the concept that hebrew had some structural aspects in terms of glyphs amounting to a sort of form-hyperlanguage, the glyphs being cosmic geometric forms, perhaps spatial archetypal forms, and relating to the sounds of the words, although do not quote me on this, it should be the purview of qualified linguists and information theorists, and analysts to study that sort of thing. However I note that perhaps the above article is referrning to a \"content-hyperlanguage\".  So we could have the delineations \"form-hyperlanguage, and \"content hyper-language\", \"form meta-language\", \"content meta-language\", and perhaps \"in between\" or hybrid categories.\n\nIt is worth saying, although, this is for philosophy really (and perhaps I will repost this section of my post in the philosophy sub-forum):\n\nPerhaps **hyper-language style forms in nature** are something to psychologically take care with, and a \"meta-rational\" integration, or overview could be helpful. Although they pretty much are a feature of the cosmos created by: the deity (god).\n\nTo summarise: sometimes the trees and plants in nature look like they have faces or face like hypergraphic forms in them, I feel, this is something to mainly ignore but not worry, extremely, too much about, however face like forms within mathematical formalisms are more complicated, possibly, and also in constellations e.t.c perhaps to not look at these as much as possible without them being applied functionally here (eg: in factory production machinery or a factory or functional business, or scientific process e.t.c) is meta-rational. The argument against this would be arguing that it is a post-hoc fallacy, due to seriality of time, and the impossibility of retro-causality, the argument for would be that since the creator actuates the universe also, it is design was from the beginning factoring in what it could predict, could physically be possible, so it existed both at that pre-creation time, throughout and presently and is the same \"deistic mind\" or \"mind-isness\". Draw your own conclusions on this one in your life, but be careful with yourself and do try to actualise things that are functional as they are value-integrated forms in the universe (this is my best guess on this subject).\n\nThe socratic \"I know that I know nothing\",\n\nand then;\n\nthe hippocratic \"first do no harm\"\n\ncould be good precepts in terms of a functional or \"meta-rational\" conservatism here, they are at least something to consider carefully in life. I read your post and comments, but I am still not entirely sure what you are talking about. When you say \"non-perception\", do you mean you cannot see the hypergraphy art, or that you see the art but do not understand it? (I certainly do not understand the picture in the wiki article) \n\nCould it be something to do with object recognition? Or dyslexia? I really do not know. \n\nAre you having trouble remembering who people are, particularly if they change their appearance or you see them out of context? \n\nWe do know that there is a link between autism and prosopagnosia, so if you have autism there is a higher likelihood of having proso (but It is possible to have one and not the other). In my life until age 30 in 2017 it was a situation where I did not happen to percieve any of the hypergraphy existing, so yeah a pattern recognition problem, to do with surfaces of objects. I think this was because it had a \"theory of mind encoding\" aspect, eg: I did not expect that a person would make this sort of art, so did not notice it in my environment.\n\nPerhaps it was also related to social-emotional agnosia, as I had some problems with reading facial expressions, and vocal prosody past a particular fidelity of recognition, and then understanding, although I was socially o.k it probably was noticeable the odd time, at least that I was managing or working around it.\n\nBut no I did not have any problems recognising people, things were probably normal as regards that stuff. \n\nPossibly I was in some sort of \"in between\" category of, between prosopagnosia and Asperger's or high functioning autistic (undiagnosed, but autistic traits suggested and formally noted by a psychologist), or  the level of non recognition of some content was in the normal possible range for autism.\n\nThanks for responding to my post :) You are welcome! Just FYI you can use the \"reply\" button underneath someone is comment to reply directly to them and they will get a notification that you replied. \n\nIt sounds like you have some problems with perception, but if you are able to recognize people based on just their facial features it is probably not prosopagnosia. But I am not a doctor so I cannot tell you for sure what you have got going on. \n\nThere are some free prosopagnosia tests online to get an idea of your face recognition abilities. Ok slow down. So it is kind of an art form where letters are used to make collages to form pictures? Can you find an actual example of such a picture and what it is meant to represent, because what I find with google images is pretty but I cannot see that it is supposed to mean anything. Thanks very much :) Letters or any other visual element, there is a perception element if it where you might not percieve the overall image, usually the artist has rendered a face with whatever emotion idea they wanted to convey in its expression.\n\nSome examples are here: ", "Face blind teachers? Hi, I have been reading posts here for a while, but I joined reddit with my own account yesterday.\nI have mild prosopagnosia, so I recognize family members that I see at least once a year and my close friends, or at least I recognize people that I met multiple times because I developed instinctive coping mechanism.\nI realized I probably have mild prosopagnosia when I discovered that it exists (like a few years ago). Now I would like to ask: how do you face face blindness at work? I am a student now, but I wish I will teach in the future. Is any of you a teacher? How do you deal with face blindness? How do students normally react when they notice you are not able to recognize them? I also fear that I will be able to recognize immediately only some students because of their particular characteristics so they will think I have \"favorite students\".\nThank you so much for your help Could you assign them specific seats? So you at least 'recognize' them in the classroom. Thanks for your suggestion, that is a good idea My face blindness is rather mild so I only have problems the first few weeks of teaching in a new class. After some weeks I recognize most of my students without a problem. It is just a little bit confusing when they get a new haircut. The only real problem I have ever had were twins that looked EXACTLY the same. On top of that they sometimes wore the same outfit. One entire school year was not enough for me to learn who is who. Whenever I had to call one of them by their name, I thought \"Well, there is a 50/50 chance to get it right!\" but I got it wrong so many times...\n\nI might need to add that I am a new teacher who has never had more than \\~100 students in one year and it might get more difficult for me later on when I get more classes at once.\n\n&gt; I also fear that I will be able to recognize immediately only some  students because of their particular characteristics so they will think I  have \"favorite students\". \n\nDo not worry about that, most teachers only remember some names after the first few days or weeks, and those are the names of students who stand out for some reason. When I was in school, I was a quiet student who did not really stand out, and many teachers of mine only learned my name after some time because I never said anything lol. I definitely did not feel like the others were \"favourite students\", they were just easier to remember. Thank you so much for sharing your experience and for your advice! That is what I used when I was teaching undergraduates! Seating charts. They could choose their own seats and decide to change if they really wanted, but just so long as I knew and could mark it down. I teach third grade.  My face blindness is a little more severe than you, but like you I do okay because I have pretty good coping mechanisms.  First - I find kids a lot easier to recognize than adults.  They have more obvious personality markers.  \n\nIf possible, I would avoid a school with uniforms.  In my area it is not common (there is only one within driving distance of my house that is a public school) so that is easy, but may not be possible, especially for your first job.\n\nI assign kids numbers (for purpose of filing paperwork and order to line up in) and it is easy for me personally to remember which number goes with which name.  Easier than memorizing their names in alphabetic order for some reason.  This helps me know who kids are in line (if the line up right.)\n\nI definitely use assigned seats with prominent name tags.  The first couple of weeks I have them return to their seats after each activity to do something in their seats.  Helps me learn them.  You could have them wear name tags, for when they were out of their seats, but I do not.  \n\nI do a lot of learn names activities which is good for new students too.\n\nThe nice thing about elementary school is you have 20-30 kids for a whole year.  I interact with other third graders in the other classes too, but do not have to learn all of them.  I personally can remember the kids the next couple of years.  After that I have trouble recognizing them, but if they say who they are I remember, so I just tell them they have grown up so much that they do not look like a little kid anymore (and I do remember stories about them) which they like.\n\nWhat I really struggle with is parents.  It takes some time also to learn other teachers, because you do not see some of them very often.  Paras are really hard too, because you do not get their names often and they float around.  But parents are the absolute worse. I am not face-blind, but I thought this might be somewhat relevant.\n\nI had a history teacher who was almost completely blind due to a genetically inherited condition. While he could see clearly enough to avoid tripping over desks, he could not effectively identify students by their facial features (or other physical details, for that matter), and so he relied instead on his memory of students' voices.\n\nDuring class, when students raised their hands, they were required to call out their names; as he had the class roster memorized, he would notice when certain students did not participate often and would call them out despite not being able to properly see them. We did effectively have our own specific seats, and I suppose that also made life easier for him.\n\nDuring the first few weeks when he was still new to the school he had some students minorly harass him--they would approach him during lunch and ask him who they were; very often he would simply respond that because they hardly participated in class he did not know their voices yet, and for all practical purposes this was true. (By the time we were several weeks into the school year, he more-or-less had everyone is voices matched with their names. I suspect that because his peripheral vision was somewhat clearer he could pick up on some minor physical characteristics, and as he was generally quite the attentive person I would not be surprised if he also listened for other surrounding cues as to students' identities).\n\nI am not sure what education level you aim to teach, and I do think that everyone comes up with different coping mechanisms to a certain extent. I am also not sure how much of this you will personally be able to apply, but I hope this helps in some way. Thank you! In my area school with uniforms are luckily very rare. By the way I will try all of your strategies. I imagine how hard could it be with parents... That may be useful, thank you for sharing! If parents try to talk to me after school and I do not know who they are, I usually ask them to email me to set up a meeting or reminding me to call them as I am \"on my way somewhere urgent.\"  Or just chat with them until I can figure out who their kid is.\n\nWhen out in the community, I try to look preoccupied (like I am on a mission or day dreaming) so they think I did not see them.  I avoid eye contact, and - if there are kids - watch the kids for signs of recognition, because they are more obvious.  \"Hi, buddy!\" or something like that is generic for the kid and then you can go from there.\n\nAlso, living a town over from where you teach is good, because it cuts down on frequency of seeing families out and about (not just for face blind people - you really do not want to live next door to your student.) I am a tutor for bachelor students, and I felt so embarassed when I forgot one student's name even though we were 6 MONTHS into the course and made some mnemonics in my head. It remember all the names, but I have to guess who is in front of me from that list of names if multiple students look the same-ish. Before, I blamed myself for being a bad tutor, but now I realize it is because I am on the spectrum. I met a long-lost aunt (long story) a few months ago. She came to visit, and we talked for some time where I even got to inspect her face. But next day, I see her at the busstop and I am not sure it is her or not. It may also be due to the different environment (busstop), but I saw her face clearly and did not recognize her then. It is rough buddy", "Fameous actors feels like us - they cannot regognize anybody and everybody are able to recognize them. Fameous actors feels like us - they cannot regognize anybody and everybody are able to recognize them. \n\nStrangers saying \"Hi\" to to me was always been a scary thing.\n\nThen I had a year long episode in the city theater where I was choosed on the casting to play the main role.\nAfter the premiere of play, random people started to approach me on the streets and say \"hi\" to me.\n\nI could not recognize any of them, it was the same feeling that I knew before, but now... it was a pleasant experience.\n\nI stopped to be recognizable as an actor after a few weeks.\n\nWhat was hard wired in me was that positive feeling - when I cannot regonize anybody, but everybody can recognize me - I feel like a fameous actor. Famous* thx Ha, that is a really positive spin on it! Brad Pitt is face blind, and apparently has had people think he was power-flexing or blowing them off because he could not recognize them. i feel the exact same way. everyone knows who i am and every time someone waves to me and goes \"heyy!\" i usually smile and say \"hi\" back, but inside i am thinking \"how the hell do i know this person again?\"", "I thought a guy I met at work would be a good match for my best friend so I suggested that we all go out for drinks.

I cannot pick people out of crowds either, I even have trouble with my own parents!  \n\n\nAbsolutely hopeless with photos too, I could literally be holding a photo taken that day in my hand and not be able to find the person it was of. Presumably your friend is much better at it!  \n\n\nDo not feel too bad about still failing to recognise someone you work with every day. At my last job I asked the person on the till next to me if she would seen my manager because I needed to ask her something. It was my manager. And no that was not the first time I did that! I think they all thought I was mad.

", "This is a good example of what face blindness is like ", "I am pretty sure face blindness is why black and white movies give me headaches My dad loved watching old movies with my siblings and I when we were kids, but I hated it because they made my head hurt. Now I am pretty sure that is because the styles of makeup and the lack of color wipe out any identifying features I would normally use to tell characters apart. They would not believe that I could not recognize who anybody was in films like It is a Wonderful Life or the original Miracle on 34th street. My sister is a bit of a movie buff now and she still gets frustrated that I will only watch the colorized versions. \n\nTL,DR: Trying to tell characters apart in old movies literally makes my head hurt. They do not give me headaches, but I do not like black and white movies either.  I never thought about why, but you might be on to something.  It is not the style of movie or anything.

Obviously it is meant for people who are curious about what actor they are looking it, but it is a blessing for proso.\n\nEspecially in shows with a lot of guest characters, it is so great to just be able to get a list of characters currently on screen, each with a reference photo of the actor. It is surprisingly functional too, up to date not quite second by second, but almost. yes! back when the x-files was on prime i used this ALL the time, the side characters all look super similar and i had the hardest time following what was going on. i was so sad when the show moved to Hulu, they do not have that feature and it is way more difficult to understand now. \n\nthe trivia feature is super cool as well, i love learning behind the scenes facts about the shows! Yes! Same! Great when I do not have anyone to spot for me. I also have Netflix and Hulu, but 2/3rds of what I watch is on Prime now - and it is largely because of this feature. It is especially useful for shows with a huge cast of characters, like The Expanse, or ones where all the main characters are about the same age, race, and gender, and therefore difficult to tell apart.

This will probably be long because I ramble...\n\nAll my life, people have laughed at me, told me I do not pay attention (where the nickname came into play, always have my head in the clouds) or that I am just ignorant. \n\nI do recognize my family and close friends... Someone I went to school with for 8 years and was in all my classes? Nope... I have had so many moments where people in the street have tried to talk to me and I just have no idea who they are...\n\n When I try to remember what my best friend looks like in my mind, I see her glasses and hair style, vague shape of her face (quite distinctive) but no features. Same with family. I completely recognise them in person, but cannot for the life of me remember what they look like when not looking directly at them. \n\nAt work, I introduced myself to my big boss (did not see him everyday, usually 1-2 times a week) multiple times and got laughed at so eventually just started to quietly ask someone I did know who he was... But people I would worked with consistently/regularly, I eventually recognised. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if I was just remembering hair styles/glasses/clothing/even body shape... Because when not looking at them, I have no idea what their faces look like...\n\nAnother point (could be related) is people's cars... I have been in my sister's hundreds of times. I recognize it parked outside her house... Sometimes she parks it at my house. But I still cannot tell if it is hers then. I have gotten in the wrong car too many times to count. I check every silver car that goes past to see if it is her black hair driving... \n\nEven my cat's... I can picture one of their eyes in my head (distinctive 2 colours) but cannot picture the other and I have had him 8 years... I do remember dogs faces though haha. \n\nI offend people often because they try so hard to get me to recognise them... And I just do not. People think I am rude and ignorant/stuck up because I ignore them. It is not that I am doing it on purpose, I just do not recognise them. \n\nApparently my best friend and I shared multiple classes throughout school together but rarely talked and I do not remember her being around at all...\n\nAnyway, the whole reason I started to think about and look this up is because I cannot tell my sister's ex's apart, even after meeting them, talking to them, multiple times... She has children with 1 and I still cannot recognise him... Sounds like proso, yep. Yepp, sounds like prosopagnosia! \n\nI have had very similar situations at work with higherups I did not see much, and there was a particularly thorny couple of years where I kept getting into the wrong car (now I just make sure to walk a little behind my SO in the parking lot.) Wow okay... Sorry, I was unsure because I do recognise my family and close friends and everything I read on Google said people do not so I thought maybe I just have a mild version? \n\nI have been into criminal minds recently (which is hard anyway as I do not recognize people who make reappearances, so always have to watch the recap haha. Though I do recognise the main characters when looking at them...), But it is always confused me how people are able to describe suspects to sketch artists and things because I would not have a clue! I could not even describe my family like that... \n\nI spoke to my friend about this this morning and the detail she could give on another friends face was crazy to me... google and news outlets like to show the most extreme cases. if any article is going to talk about the condition its got to make it sound as intense as possible. But I think its fair to say it exists on a spectrum, many of us like you said rely on clothing,hair, and context to really get by anyway so its not as crippling as they might want to make people believe it is. We adjust to the world same as everyone else so its hard for us to see how we differ from other POVs\n\n\"But it is always confused me how people are able to describe suspects to sketch artists and stuff\" this is something i always thought about a lot long before i heard about proso actually. \"did someone have a big nose?\" they certainly had a nose... was i supposed to be measuring it? well the fact someone else brought up cars makes me feel more reasonably convinced of my own mild proso ... i had to get close to my old car/look for specific things (pizza shaped air freshener) before i was sure if it was mine, recently went shopping with a rental I would had for a week and ended up walking right passed it to a similarly colored/sized vehicle of a completely different make and model. just got a red jeep and i feel like it will stand out for the most part. Yes this!!!! I walk behind my friends to get in their car because otherwise I get in the wrong car! I did it once after jumping out to run into a shop and got in the wrong car when I came out... Now I look for the jelly bean air freshener! I can never find a car in a car park haha.\n\nAlso once my aunt left her purse in her car so asked me to run back to it in the car park.

Then I noticed a poor child sat in the back freaking out because some strange woman was trying to get in the car \ud83e\udd23 since then, I look for identifying things haha. I think until I asked my friend today, I assumed everyone did that... Its always been so normal for me to rely on things other than faces that I never noticed... Your comment about noses actually made me lol, that is exactly how I think haha Yep, sounds like mild to moderate face blindness.\n\nEspecially \"I check every silver car that goes past to see if it is her black hair driving\", that sort of \"conscious efforts at recognition, based on stored facts\" is classic.\n\nHows your memory? i.e you you might not recognise your boss in inlaw's, but do you remember things about them ok? e.g likes and dislikes or whatever?\n\nThe car's thing is classic too: I find the two are related.  So many friends can see just the tail of a moving car for 0.5 seconds as it dissapears down a side street, and know that it was a Nissan Whatava, or a Toyota etc - they can just tell from the overall bodyshape.

This can be a good way to explain it to \"regular\" folks. If it helps, my case is more mild too. I can recognize family and friends, but only if they do not change major features about themselves. I always remind my boyfriend to tell me when he is going to or has trimmed his hair or beard, because unless he is wearing one of his distinctive shirts, I will not recognize him. Even him just taking his glasses off can get me sometimes. I just focus on other parts.\n\nI definitely cannot recall faces. Once he leaves a room, I cannot describe him anymore. I can do his nose, eye color, and hair color, and remember if he has his beard or not, but that is all I can do.

Hopefully you will accept me to the community nevertheless. I am looking into helping people with prosopagnosia by building a solution involving a body camera and facial recognition. I am trying to understand the life and challenges of the community to see if this solution would work.\n\nTo get into the details a bit further, the way I imagine this to work is...\n\n1. The camera is placed on the person's body and is either obfuscated or, completely the opposite - made to clearly look like a medical camera. I would need to understand the challenges faced with either of these approaches from a prosopagnosiac's standpoint.\n2. When the wearer of the camera meets a person they are supposed to remember, they take a picture with the camera using their iPhone app or a small remote. I would also need to understand here the usability benefits of a small, hand held remote vs using the iPhone app as the remote.\n3. When the image is taken it is saved in the app with the ability to label the photo with the person's name including any other descriptive details. \n4. When a person encounters someone that knows them, they take another picture of them. This picture is compared with the database of pictures of already know people and a face matching algorithm returns the person's name and any other textual details that were associated with them.\n\nI would love to know from the community whether any of these features stick out as being useful or just completely undoable in our current sociological environment.\n\nAny feedback is greatly appreciated and if I have offended anyone at this point, please feel free to school me!\n\nAll my best,\n\nAleksandra My honest answer is that it seems mostly impractical, but there is probably a market somewhere for it. \n\nI say it is impractical because you would have to make sure the persons face is caught by the camera and is unobstructed. You would have to have them looking in your direction long enough to take out your phone and use the app which if you are having a convo with them, may seem ruder than just asking their name and apologizing for not recognizing them.  Or may just seem creepy if you are just staring at them from across the room lol.  Also, there may be difficultly with things like sunglasses. \n\nThe time it would take to do this whole process would be a pain but probably something that could be overlooked. If John Doe comes up to me at the grocery store and starts chatting, it will be really awkward and too long of a process to use the app. Now if it was paired with something like google glass that could be neat and instantaneous but unfortunately no one uses those really. \n\nI personally rely mostly on context, hair, skin tone, fashion choices, and posture to identify people. Context being the biggest one. \n\n\nThat said, there are similar things to this that are very helpful already! Nest home security cameras have facial recognition which is awesome because I will get a text message saying \u201cso and so\u201d is here. I also used to have one facing the front door of my office and I would get notifications which were great. So there is definitely a market for something similar, but I do not know that it is practical in an everyday context for all consumers. \n\nWhat I would find more helpful, especially at work, is having a system similar to the nest cam\u2019s facial recognition but where you can keep notes about the person like you described. Other professions may benefit from the body cam aspect but I personal do not know that it would be super practical in a day to day context.  That would be neat.  Something for when you are in a stationary spot that would recognize the face and you could record what you wanted to remember. One issue with prosopagnosia is it makes you somewhat socially awkward already.  In our society it is incredibly rude to not remember people.  If prosopagnosia was more well-known, people would be understanding for the most part.  For example, if someone is hard of hearing or Deaf there are a few jerks running around who are obnoxious about it, but most people understand the accommodations you need to make and that them not hearing you is not due to lack of paying attention.  Because it is not well known, you are uncaring and rude for not recognizing people and if you explain you are often perceived as weird or making excuses.  \n\nWhich is a long way of saying that there is an issue with any camera based solution: If it is an obvious medical device, people do not have the understanding of the condition to recognize it as such.  If it is hidden, there are some privacy concerns that make me seem a little creepy if discovered.\n\nAs far as functionality, how would I know when the wearable camera framed their face?  An iPhone could show the picture, but a remote would have to have some kind of screen.  The retrieval process sounds a little awkward.\n\nI guess the issue if I am going to be taking pictures of people obviously and looking at my phone or be positioning myself to sneak a picture and staring at my phone while talking, either way I will come across as socially awkward and rude.  At that point, it is probably simpler to just ask their name if I am willing to risk offending or fall back on my usual vague conversation where I hunt for clues as to whom they are.  (\"I think I will take my kid to the park this weekend.  Do you have plans?\"  If they have a child, they will probably talk about them which would help narrow things down.  If they do not, they probably do not have a young child.)\n\nI love that you are thinking about problem solving.  It would be awesome if there were some kind of assistive technology or treatment.

I have never been officially diagnosed with Prosopagnosia but pretty much all the signs point straight towards it (like not recognizing people I have sat at a table with for hours when I see them again 5 days later, not recognizing colleges or friends in different environments etc)\n\nI have been drawing portraits since April 2019, first with pencils, now digitally. It helps me combat my face blindness because rather than trying to memorize the face as a whole I look at different aspects of the face and memorize them. Since portraits usually take between 10 and 20 hours, staring at the photograph I am copying for that long is kind of refreshing. It is the only way I can really see differences between faces and even articulate them and it makes me happy. \n\nOne of the things I struggle with is that I cannot draw a person without reference. I have drawn one person for at least 10 times now so I have looked at photographs of him for over 100 hrs and I am still not able to draw him without reference. I would struggle to say what exactly defines his face and makes him look like himself. \n\nHere is an example of my work:\n\n \nThank you for reading! Hey! I am also a painter (oils). That is really amazing work for your age! You have got a great talent.\n\nI do not know about you but I always used to struggle with self portraits. I was painting on big canvases since I was 16 and I had not heard of prosopagnosia, but I always felt like every time I tried to paint myself I was seeing a different person. I found it difficult and not enjoyable, in a different way to painting other people. How do you feel about self portraits? Hey! Thank you so much!\nI do not enjoy drawing self portraits aswell. It is more of a confidence thing because I do not think that I am particularly beautiful and I do not think I would like the result. I would not want to hang a self portrait on my wall. What I like most about drawing is the reaction of the people I have drawn and that just does not happen when you draw yourself. absolutely incredible omg !! really the only thing I am good at drawing is faces.....ironically....but without a reference, anything i draw is a bit yikes haha. its validating to hear other faceblind people enjoy drawing portraits and can do so very successfully!! Aww thank you!\nYeah, I really cannot draw without reference too. Sometimes people complain about me copying a photo is not art but honestly I do not care that much about it. It helps me relax and is somehow comforting! Very beautiful work! I am an artist too and I have noticed I can recognize models better if I have drawn them before. wow! am an artist (digital) as well. i have accepted that i will never be able to draw realism, so i have focused on anime styles instead. props to you for overcoming though!! If you ever want to try it again, I can recommend working incredibly close to a reference picture. People have said that they do not consider copying a photo art but honestly, I do not care. It is what makes me happy. My artistic skills do not fall into the painting/drawing category unfortunately, but eversince I became a fan of G2, I instantly became a huge fan of your artwork as well (although my fave is your drawing of Geralt). I may not know so much about drawing to form an opinion but I love your work \u2764 I am sure you will do amazing things in the future \ud83d\ude0a Thank you, this really means a lot to me.

Does anyone else have this problem and does this sound like Prosopagnosia?\n\nThanks This might be closer to r/aphantasia? I have both, so the lines can be blurry in general Are you sure you are recognizing their faces?\n\nI notice that I rely heavily on other features to do the bulk of the recognition. These would include a combination of their hair, their gestures and gait, where I am seeing them (e.g. I know it is my roommate after a haircut because there would not be someone else with brown hair in my apartment), their body size, what clothing they tend to wear, etc.\n\nOn the whole, I do not have any overt issue recognizing people, despite something about them changing.\n\nOn the other hand, in a controlled setting (such as with the Cambridge face recognition test) where they remove these additional features, it feels impossible. My results tend to be inline with random guessing.\n\nI am not diagnosed with Faceblindness, so maybe I do not have prosopagnosia... I guess my experiences may not be representative of others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an after thought, do you relate to /r/aphantasia at all? I may actually relate to aphantasia! I am almost certain I am recognizing their faces. After looking at that subreddit, particularly this post:  \n\n( \n\nI think I will bring this up to the neurologist! Thank you very much\n\nI also find it funny that people with aphantasia seem to be very good at mathematics, as it is one of the only things in my life that I feel so passionate about. I hope to study mathematics in university. &gt;I also find it funny that people with aphantasia seem to be very good at mathematics\n\nI have never heard this, but this would describe me as well. I have the same, actually! I do not have aphantasia though. Just specific aphantasia of faces. Same I have the same thing.  i think i am same as you. That is me- I struggle to close my eyes and visualize a person (even though I can visualize a blurry picture of that person sometimes). I know what my husband looks like, but after 20 years I would still be in trouble describing him to a sketch artist. \n\nThat being said, I remember a Brain Games episode where they showed 4 sets of eyes, and I could pick out which one belonged to Apollo. I am pretty good at making a Wii/ Switch \"Mii\" character, if I am looking at a bunch of features and choosing one that is closest to real features. So if the sketch artist showed me a book of 40 different noses or mouths I could do it", "Upside down faces Is it easyer to anyone here to recognize upside down faces? I realized this one day as I was watching a 60 minute program where they were trying to explain prosopagnosia and they showed upside down pictures. To my surprise, those I could reconize. Dentist here. I still cannot.\n\n&amp;#x200B; I always thought my recognition relied more on remembering than recognizing, if that made sense.  The updside down faces might help with that. I think I am better than someone without face blindness at recognizing upside down faces, because you have to rely on feature analysis which I always do and most people do not.  I still cannot recognize them with the speed and accuracy I see most people identifying faces. It is not *easier* for me to recognize upside-down faces, but I just took a look at that 60 minutes program, and it was not much harder to recognize them upside-down than when the faces were right-side up.\n\nI am guessing it is because the part of the brain that processes faces in extra detail (for most people :p) has trouble when the face is upside-down? So people without face blindness lose that advantage?\n\nThis seems like it could help people understand what it is like having prosopagnosia... interesting!", "Q: Can recognise but not picture/imagine faces I recognise faces of those around me, in photos and in real life (or movies etc), and if asked what my wife looked like I could describe facts about her features that allow me to get by (lip piercing, colour of hair, etc) but if I close my eyes I cannot imagine people's faces. I can see their shape/build etc in normal detail, I can picture everything else, but not faces. \n\nWhen I dream I always have people in my dream and I know who they are, but I do not really need to picture their faces to do that. In real life I can recognise and read emotions just fine, and I can do the same in my dream but without needing to see their faces (I guess if they are born in my mind I know what their emotion is, like playing chess with yourself?!)\n\nI was wondering if this could be related to prosopagnosia at all, of if any of you recognise this description and can point me in a better direction, please? My first thought was aphantasia but you say you can see a person\u2019s build in better detail so maybe not. Maybe take a look though because being able to recount that an apple is green/red and rounded with a thin stem and bumpy bottom is very different than actually being able to visualize an apple. I was also thinking some form of aphantasia, though I am also admittedly not certain how much people _do_ actually picture people's faces. It is hard to say because everyone does tend to think that the way they perceive the world is the way everyone does, but my experience with art at least is that people cannot actually imagine _anything_ in detail without a good deal of training. Like, ask any random person to draw a face and see what happens. :P But again, I have no idea how the way you try and fail to imagine a face compares to someone else's - you may well be onto something!  how about in your dreams I first learned about prosopagnosia in psych class in college, but did not realize until many years later that I actually had it.  I THOUGHT I was recognizing faces, because I can recognized people I am close to.  Later I realized that I was not actually recognize their face the way people typically do.  I use other clues (and married a funny looking guy honestly!) to recognize people including individual facial features.  \n\nI also have difficulty visualizing anything to some extent, but especially faces.  I can describe things though.  I have difficulty recognizing a lot of people, although I can learn to recognize them - it just my process is not as efficient unless the person is very unique looking.  I always know who people are unless they are strangers in my dreams, but I do not know how I know.  I do not have difficulty recognizing emotions.\n\nI do not know if that is what is going on with you, but you might think how do you know people when you see them?  If your wife changed her hair, got rid of the lip piecing, etc. would you be able to easily recognize her?  (My husband looks like a different person to me when he gets a hair cut and I hate it.)  Do you recognize an average number of people? The best way for me to recognize anyone is by their stride or the way they walk.\n\nWhen I read books, I am watching an HD movie in my head, but without faces. It is literally like the faces are blurred out. I can tell you that X character had a beard or a scar, but I could not tell a police sketch artist what they looked like if that makes sense.", "Master's Thesis Hi everyone,\n\nI just discovered this sub, but I have been dealing with prosopagnosia for most of my life. I developed the disorder as a result of 3 strokes I suffered at 12.\n\nAll these years later, I am finishing up a Master's program at CU Denver in Media Forensics, where we are learning about how to apply forensic techniques to various media types. My thesis is the only remaining hurdle to graduation.\n\nI have been struggling to find a topic for this thesis, as I would like to find something that speaks specifically to me. I keep coming back to the notion of prosopagnosia in relation to deepfake technology. If you are unfamiliar, it is the technology of face swapping that is been permeating the news recently. (\n\nI guess the reason I am mentioning all this is to potentially use this sub as a collective mind to develop a more coherent idea out of this notion. It feels like there is something there, but I cannot quite figure out the exact angle to make it thesis worthy.\n\nAnyway, glad to see a community like this exists. Thanks. Interesting! What do you see as a link between prosopagnosia and deep fake technology? Mostly just the two concepts being vaguely similar. The lack of ability to discern distinct facial structures seems like it could be tied to the artificial swapping of faces somehow. I already cannot tell Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio apart if they are not using their normal accent.\n\nI have been deep faked my whole life. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood must have been a truly traumatizing experience for you then. It is on my list of movies to see.\n\nI do not think it will be an issue when they are in the same movie, but in Django I thought it was Brad Pitt for years. (You will remember he had a southern accent, instead of his normal voice) This is interesting, because Nicholas Cage is one of the few actors I can recognize easily, but here, I cannot AT ALL. (I think it is in part because I recognize people by how they move, and in this case it is someone else's body). \n\nI think using unusual recognition techniques (like body movement) may have some potential in Media Forensics, especially since motion tracking is getting so good. &gt;we are learning about how to apply forensic techniques to various media types\n\nThis makes no sense to me.  Explain it better and I might have a suggestion for you. Maybe something about how all people will feel similar unease to what people with prosopagnosia feel about not knowing who they are looking at? Throw in something about trust or anxiety levels? Is there any correlation between the forensic techniques to analyze a deepfake and strategies people with prosopagnosia use?  (I may have phrased that wrong.  I am pretty ignorant about the topic.)  I think you need to tease out how they are related for you. I do like that idea, though it may be more geared towards the psychology of the matter, rather than the technology. I myself tend to focus on body characteristics, which I believe is a factor in the technology. Good note. Thanks. That does seem like a good correlation, the (for lack of a better term) analog means all of us afflicted types use to identify someone vs. the digital means software might detect a change. It is a pretty broad subject, I realize. A few examples:\n\n\\- Analyzing metadata to reveal information about the origins of a file (photo, audio, video)\n\n\\- Enhancement of low-quality recordings to show a clearer representation of events\n\n\\- Authenticating visual evidence by looking for traces of manipulation (copied areas, deepfake) Hi there. Would you be interested in writing a first-person account about challenges of living and dating with prosopagnosia? I am a journalist and we would, of course, pay you for your piece. Please email me?  Hi,\n\nI am in the same position; writing about prosopagnosia for part of my Masters, having been a 'sufferer' all my life. \n\nI doubt I could help you with the remainder of your programme - I can barely understand what you mean - but if I can offer any help from the UK, you only have to ask,\n\nGlenise", "Should I get a professional diagnosis? If so, how? Hi! Might be a silly question, but I want to ask it anyway.\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that I suffer from mild prosopagnosia.\nBut I am very against self-diagnosis, since everybody gets free healthcare where I live, there is really no reason to NOT get a diagnosis.\n\nBut at the same time, I have no clue on who I should even turn to if I want to get diagnosed with this disorder.\nI am also afraid they will not even take me seriously, since I recognize family members, friends, and even celebrities I keep up with, with no issue. \nProsopagnosia is rare as it is, and I live in a veery small town.\n\nSo should I try to get a diagnosis? If so, how?\nThere is really no form of treatment for it, but at the same time, I do not want to go around saying I have a certain disorder without a second opinion from a medical expert.\nWhat do you guys think? Have you got a professional diagnosis for it? There was not anyone within a thousand miles who could do it officially, for me. So I contacted one of the local universities which had published some studies on it, and they had a couple of postdocs who were working on data collection in that field run me through a couple of standardized tests.\n\nWhile the result was not *technically* \"medically approved\", I do have a writeup showing the results, signed by a bunch of doctors. So... close enough for all practical purposes.\n\nI suspect it might be possible to have a psychologist sign off on a similar process as an official diagnosis. I kind of agree with you on self diagnosis, I am wary of \"collecting\" neuro-diverse conditions that are self diagnosed. I have not pesued a proper diagnosis though because honestly at my age it makes no difference. It would have when I was younger but now I know what I can and cannot do. \n\nMy approach is to state the fact that I am very much worse than average at recognising people. Undeniable. Personally I am sure I am somewhat proso. The available online tests bare this out and a million anecdotes from my life - yesterday I warned up with the wrong cricket team! This is a personal thing, so For me, it is like e.g having a slight limo in my walk because I twisted my ankle earlier in the week. In that, I do not need any doctor to tell me I twisted my ankle or now have a slight limp. I know that already. \n\nI clearly have mild-to-moderate prosopagnosoa, evident simply by living life and seeing how crap I am at recognising faces compared to everyone else :)\n\nE.g if I watch a movie and the main actress gets a hair cut or does her hair halfway through,  I do not know who \"the new girl\" is, until I express confusion to my partner and they clarify:)\n\nI do not see any point in getting a medical diagnosis for mild P.  But if you think there is even a chance it might make you feel better about it, or more comfortable with it, then totally go for it...:)\n\nP.s you are bound to find other people in your community that have it too, if you share your world experience. Hi there. If you can recognize both family, friends and celebrities your case would definitely be mild. The gold standard test for prosopagnosia is Cambridge Face Memory Test. You can take it for free via this link: (  \n\n\nFor an in-depth evaluation you should contact your nearest clinical neuropsychologist (board certified) Try going through your primary care physician and getting a referral from there.  Personally, I found my doctor gives me better recommendations on who to see than the internet.  If they are not responsive or do not know what you are talking about, I would research specialists in your area.  I personally would drive a little if there was someone say 2 hours away who had more experience with prosopagnosia than go to someone 45 minutes away who does not know as much.  Looking for universities who are doing related research might help too.\n\nI do not have an official diagnosis, but participated in a research study that indicated it was definitely an issue.  I gave the paper to the nurse practitioner I usually see, talked to her a little bit about it, and she actually added it to my chart.  I figured that if it is ever an issue with work or anything, I can go get an official diagnosis but have evidence that shows that it is not something I just made up.\n\nShe offered a referral, but I opted out.  I am not a fan of self-diagnosis, but this is the only thing I have ever thought I have had and I think it is something you can recognize by experience to a point.  I sometimes am slow to recognize my son and all online facial recognition tasks are pretty much me randomly guessing, so I am pretty confident in saying I have an issue.  \n\nBUT it is a spectrum, so a mild case could be a diagnosable or it could be lower than average but not cross the threshold.  I think you wanting to get officially tested is a good reason in itself to do so.  If you have not, doing an online test to take with you to your visit may make you feel more confident.  Good luck! I understand your hesitation to self-diagnose, but I think that with prosopagnosia it can make sense to do so. Psychologists who can give you a legal diagnosis are rare, there is no real treatment or cure, and it is not really a \"disability\" in the traditional sense. (Edit to add: I do consider it to be a social disability, but having legal documentation of it will not get you any accommodations or resources in the same way that a more visible disability would).\n\n You are not harming anyone by thinking of yourself in this way and you are not taking anything away from anyone who has a \"proper\" diagnosis.\n\nI do not have a legal diagnosis myself, but I am in the susilo lab study and have consistently scored very low on their face recognition tests (but have scored average on most of their other tests.)\n\nPersonally I am not really interested in having this legally documented, since there is not really any benefit to doing so. I am 100% certain I have this condition based on my test results and experience. If there ever was a reason to make it official I would consider it.\n\nHave you taken any online tests? Here is a link to sign up for the susilo lab test if you are interested: ( &gt; it is not really a \"disability\" in the traditional sense.\n\nHmm. It can definitely affect both work and social interactions. True, what I meant was it is not really something that, if you get legal documentation of it, would give you access to any accommodations or resources. \n\nI personally do consider it to be a social disability. I have participated in some studies with Susilo Lab (( which have identified me as having prosopagnosia. I think I was connected with them after providing my information at ( and agreeing to let them contact me. They did not quite provide a formal diagnosis, but it is good enough for me to feel comfortable telling people I have it.\n\n( \n\nI also would not be surprised if your family and friends were not more understanding of the significance of it to your life than you think. Usually, when I talk to someone without prosopagnosia about it, they are pretty startled by the idea that I cannot picture my family members' faces or even my own. I do not have a professional diagnosis but I have done a couple of research studies where they administered the Cambridge Face Memory Test and the Prosopagnosia Index, which is probably the same thing you would get from a... psychiatrist? neurologist? whomever you would see about it. And they told me my test results, which are well in the prosopagnosic range, so I feel fine saying I have it (in other words, it shut up that little \"what if I am just faking it for attention\" thought). Unless you need a diagnosis for something like accommodations at work or school, I would advise you to look for a research study, either in your area or online! ( often has some listed. Yes--I know that some people have had really negative experiences with people not believing them, accusing them of making it up, etc., but personally I have always had people be sympathetic and curious. (It helps that I have taken the CFMT and scored abysmally!) I once met someone new and mentioned my prosopagnosia, so that she would understand when I failed to recognize her next time we met (lol), and it turned out she was studying neurology and wanted to hear ALL about what it is like to be faceblind! Yes, that is pretty much the experience I have had. Either people have been very understanding right away or curious to hear more! Yes, it is very mild, thankfully so. But I still have issues with it socially, I have huge issues recognising people outside my closest circle.\n\nI will look that up, thank you so much! I am normally against self diagnosis, but prosopagnosia is one of the few cases I think it is acceptable. Given you will not be asking for any accommodations (as there really *isnt* any reasonable accommodations for it) a diagnosis would offer no direct benefit besides confirmation that you have it. Prosopagnosia is also more of the \u201cyou have it or you do not\u201d situations, so I do not see how a diagnosis would confirm anything you did not already know. If you can recognize faces you see often but not ones you only see occasionally, you might want to look into prosopanmesia, prosopagnosia's little cousin. \n Aha! So that is the fancy name for my issue. Thank!", "Number Estimation Is it a prosopagnosia thing to be dang near incapable of estimating the number of people in a room? Like I can give a *very* ballpark answer (for example I am pretty sure there are between 20 and 200 people in assemblies at school, but any more specific than that would be guessing). I am also autistic, so it might be an autism thing, or just a me thing. I have always found it odd, since I am generally good at maths and other number stuff, just this one weird limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone else have this, or could point me towards a reason? 20-200 is within one order of magnitude, that is about as good as most everybody's got with a quick glance. \n\nIf you want precision like, narrowing it down to between 50-60 or between 500-600, that is superman countin' already no one does that easily without (1) experience and/or additional info, or (2) counting. Counting includes segmenting a room and counting high-segment and low-segment and then averaging. Exp/info includes things like, if a manager of a bar knows how many fits into the bar, or a high school teacher knows how many students are in the school and what a filled gym looks like. So between   \n\n\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \n\n\nand\n\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nYou cannot tell me which is 200? between 100 and 200 I might agree with you, but most people can tell these two apart. And I am faceblind if that matters. Personally, this is not something I have trouble with.  I have prosopagnosia but not autism.\n\nI do not feel like I am exceptionally good at estimating large numbers (say 300 vs 400) but I can very easily tell the difference between 20 and 200.  20 is a smallish classroom of people.  200 is an auditorium, but not a full high school gym.  (Well at the school I went to anyway.  High school gym and auditorium size vary quite a bit.)\n\nI am pretty good at estimating groups of children under 30, because I work with kids and usually know how many kids I am in charge of.  It is very rare that I know the number of people in a crowd over 100.  So I would say some of it is experience.  \n\nFrom a learning perspective (although if something is weird with your brain - and presumably you are on this subreddit because something is weird with your brain - you may not learn typically) estimating is learning by most people by trail and error.  So you estimate how big something is, find your are a lot short, then guess too high next time, etc.\n\nAnyway, I wonder if you have not ever paid attention to the size of the group and so do not have any schema for it, or if your brain is working differently processing estimating entirely.  Some experiments you could do on yourself if you were curious:\n\n&gt;Can you estimate other quantities better?  Like at a glance can you tell the difference between 20 and 200 pumpkins or cars or whatever?  Or is it just people?  If it is just people and I had to guess, I would think it might be related to the autism.\n\n&gt;Do you know the size of groups ever or is that something you do not pay attention to?  Count the students in each of your classes.  Then estimate the number of people at the next assembly.  (This could be by looking up school/class size and assuming the majority came, or count one bench that is full and multiply by the number of full benches.)  Do knowing those numbers help you estimate in other situations or are you still just as far off? A fine point right here i feel like this is not a Prosopagnosia thing, but either an autism thing or something else. do you have a psychiatrist you talk to? maybe they can help you narrow down some possibilities.", "Embarrassing Moment Well, I have had an embarrassing proso moment this morning.  A few months ago I got laid of from a job I worked for 11 years.  I worked in a call centre and every single one of us lost our jobs at the same time.  Fortunately, it did not take me too long to find new work and I started my new job around a month ago.  I am working in the same field and knew there were a few others who had gotten employed there recently as well.\n\nCue embarrassing moment... I get a message from someone asking if I remembered him.  I thought for a moment and finally said no, I do not think so... only to find out he worked for the team that was right beside mine and I probably saw him every day for years.\n\nOops!  Fortunately I explained my issue with faces and we both had a bit of a laugh. Hahaha it is fine if people believe you, but sometimes they think its a bad excuse! I hate that \ud83d\ude2d like no I swear I am not being a dick I just really cannot tell who you are outside of the context I am used to seeing you \ud83d\ude2d I once asked the CEO of my company if she was someone else. I know her. We have spoken directly. It is the damn face masks and my face blind ass. I looked like an IDIOT One of the things I really like with work from home is not having to figure out who everyone is around me, especially now that I have got new work.  I am fairly mild so I can recognize all of my direct team members (well, my old team anyway), but anyone else who I did not interact with as often, very much hit and miss.  There is a low grade anxiety there anytime I need to interact with those outside my familiar circle. I also hate when they tell you \"oh, do not worry, I do not usually pay a lot of attention too\". It is not that! I have to pay more attention than the rest of the people! My wife understands it is a real thing. She is witnessed so many situations that confirm I have it. But she still cannot shake the sentiment that not recognizing a friend or acquaintance is unacceptably rude. But that is ok! She is so good at it, and so charming that she carries the weight for our team. One thing to note is that \"remember\" and \"recognize\" are two different things.  \n\nI have had times where I did not recognize someone but after I was given their name and the context of where I knew them from, I was able to remember them.  However, these times were before I learned about prosopagnosia, so I did not really have a good response to give them.", "Something to consider for anyone who feels they have 'mild prosopagnosia'. According to a study by York University human beings can remember between 1,000 and 10,000 faces, with the average person remembering 5,000.  If the idea of remember 1,000 faces (the low end of normal) feels ridiculously unrealistic, your prosopagnosia may be more severe than you think.  \n\nBetween this and some tests I took, I was forced to admit that, despite having good coping mechanisms in everyday life, my actual facial recognition ability is near zero. \n\n(\n\n( Same here, thought I had a mild case because I am okay at coping. Definitely something to consider. This is hilarious and puts it into perspective. The thought of remembering *any* faces is unrealistic to me, let alone 1,000. I can remember my close family and a handful of close friends, but no one else, and of those I can remember I have no idea what their faces look like. I guess I thought it was mild because you hear of people not being able to recognize their own parents/kids/siblings and whatnot. WHAT--1,000 FACES??????? okay yeah maybe it is more than just \"mild\" prosopagnosia haha. It takes me a long time of observation to remember a face, and as I am really bad at eye contact, it turns out I remember actors far more easily than IRL schoolmates of even professors. I do wish I could have a clearer \"scientific\" idea of what I can do, just to learn to cope better. \"Ever wondered why you recognise someone in the street but cannot remember their name?\"\n\nLiterally never happened to me. Never. Not ever. Like others, I used to think my prosopagnosia was \"mild\" because I have some pretty good coping mechanisms in place.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that having prosopagnosia does not mean you are bad at recognizing people, but rather, having prosopagnosia means that you do not use faces to recognize people. I have never had that either, but I have had the complete opposite: \"Ever wonder why someone will address you by name and initiate conversation with you, but you have absolutely no idea who they are until they mention their name and where you know them from?\" I can relate to all of that. What I can add is that I discovered that I can remember people more easily from photographs, so when I decided to put some sort of reference image of my close friends in my head, I looked at a photo of them, just the way we look at photos of celebrities everywhere and they sort of stick in the brain. However, when my friends change their look (e.g. new haircut, aging features) in my head they stay the same as on that photo. Surely people do not even *know* a thousand people? This happened with one of pretty large ($15,000+ per year) and long term (4 years or so) clients. I had absolutely no clue who it was when he said hi to me at a restaurant, until he noticed me confusion and introduced himself again. We laughed and all was well, but still it reminded me that my prosopagnosia effects my business too. I think I have 3. I think it includes things like people you know now, people you knew years ago but would recognize if you ever saw them again, celebrities, \"he used to live down the street from us and I think his name was Dave or Dan or something\"--not just people you would know to speak to. Apparently people remember all these faces! I mean, I have 30ish people I know through work, 150ish family members (JUST aunts/uncles/cousins, not even counting 2nd cousins or more distant\u2014my mom has 76 1st cousins on her mom\u2019s side alone). If I had a SO then there would be their family as well. Church congregation is 200+, with a broader regional group of several times that, and while I do not know most people in it, some of the old folks who have been around forever know almost everyone. I have almost no friends lol but my sister has probably 20+. Teachers, classmates\u2014there were 80 people in my degree cohort plus all the instructors and staff, and my high school cohort was much bigger (I do not remember everyone from high school, but my sister does). I just moved but before I knew at least a couple dozen neighbors. If I were involved in any sports/clubs/groups (I am not), there would be more people. THEN add on all the celebrities and famous people most people can recognize\u2014actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, historical figures. \n\nI think you could easily hit over 1000 if all those were added up. \n\nI am in my early 20\u2019s and am quite introverted, so it is not as though I have even had the lifetime or inclination to accumulate lots of acquaintances. i feel like i am the opposite i am really bad at remembering actors because they change every movie. or like more often i will be like \u201cthat is THIS PERSON! from this and this!\u201d and they are like \u201cwhat? no. not even close. \u201c but they look the same?? True, People IRL might keep their look the same, but what when there are *two* chubby blonde girls with long hair? \n\nIn actors I do tend to pick up certain details of facial features within a couple movies. It is usually the set of the lips, I think. And I probably only remember male actors who is character I am crushing on, lol. oh yeah that is definitely true. i am definitely on a pretty mild side i think but with my family i have learned to be like \u201cthis person looks kind of like this person\u201d even though they are EXACTLY the same in my mind. my sister was like \u201ci mean, they are both white?\u201d but like movies are hard to follow a lot of the time! especially love triangles!! where they are all white and generic!! honestly it feels like i am looking at baskin robins flavors of ice cream but they are all vanilla and none of them have any labels idk if that is a weird comparison hah, yeah. that might be one reason I prefer fantasy/sci fi to romcoms and the like.", "Single person prosopagnosia? Hello,\n\nI was wondering if there is such a thing as exhibiting prosopagnosia only for a specific person. It is as if (almost) every photo I see of this individual is a different person (not completely different, but definitely not the same) even though they could be taken days or months apart. If I look closely, I can identify certain characteristics which are similar in all photos, but that is like saying \"Oh, your nose looks like that actor's\" or something. Any experiences with this? Thanks! I am going to go on a limb and say this is the only instance of which you are conscious. I would bet that if you were to see photos of people with whom you have limited contact, such as a clerk you see at a store twice each month, that you would not recognize them out of context. Also, do you recognize actors who make cameos in movies before they speak and give you a chance to recognize their voice? Ie famous actors who are not advertised as appearing in the movie. Or perhaps old movies which have actors when they were younger, not famous, and not the star of the movie? Thanks for this. I wish it were that clear-cut. I could probably realize that I knew the face from somewhere, but it would take me a while to remember that it was a specific clerk (unless it is someone I have truly looked at). I do indeed recognize actors in cameos, but if they are not extremely popular I strive to remember which movie or series I know them from. These are closer to memory issues (incorrectly or loosely linked information titbits) than prosopagnosia. That is why I find it odd it only happens with one specific person. Perhaps I am just overthinking this. Thanks again! I am often saying \"which one is you?\" when someone shows me a photo of them in a group. especially if the photo is somewhat dated. I can never pick them out because hair, age, clothing, it is all usually too different.", "Spoilers! Face-blindness has led to a lot of TV shows and movies being \"spoiled\" for me.\n\nIt is because I am constantly trying to figure out who characters are. Often, in a dramatic TV show with a continuing storyline, someone starts out as a background character but then becomes more important to the plot in later episodes. My prosopagnosia is such that I can usually remember the leads of a show (they get a lot of screen time, and repeated exposure helps, and I also get to recognize their voices) but I have trouble telling the bit players apart.  Or, I might vaguely know who the actor is from something else, but I cannot quite figure out where or who.\n\nSo I will go to Wikipedia, or the \"Fandom\" wikis set up for the show, to try to figure out who the person is. And, as often as not, I inadvertently come across spoilers - try as I might to not read the whole article about the character, sometimes they give away things in the opening paragraph. Or I might just see \"Status: Deceased\" in the infobox.\n\nI have learned that a character is going to die, or is secretly a traitor, or a Klingon surgically altered to resemble a human, or a time traveler who projected their consciousness into a present-day human - all things I would have preferred to not know until the show itself revealed it at the appropriate time, but that I learned by accident just because I needed clarification on who the character or the actor was.\n\nDoes this happen to you? All the time!! And if I do not do it, then the reveal does not impact me anyways because I cannot recognize who the person is I have gotten to the point where I either ask someone else (the Spouse and Kid are very good at facial recognition), or I have become okay with spoilers.\n\nAlso, I see you, Star Trek Discovery fan. :-) I have mostly inverted it. I like knowing the plot of a thing before I watch it - it helps me to follow along and I can enjoy the performances without having to worry too much about having to remember who is going to be important for something or other. &gt;  a time traveler who projected their consciousness into a present-day human\n\nOK, I am sold, what is the show? Not quite a spoiler but my worst background character non-recognizing was on 30 Rock. There is a season or two where main character Tina Fey has a boyfriend who is a pilot. The pilot appears off and on for the season(s). Eventually my husband asks if I know that the pilot is Brad Pitt. I was clueless. Another amusing miss (but main character not background) was that while watching Games of Thrones I had no clue that Petyr Baelish was  by played by the same actor as Mayor Carcetti from The Wire. Despite having watched The Wire for the second time within a year or so of binging all of Game of Thrones. \"Travelers\", a 3-season Canadian sci-fi thriller on Netflix. Most of the characters, both heroes and villains, are from the future - they project themselves into the bodies of present-day humans who are about to die by violence or accident, avoid the death, then assume that person's identity. But you do not always know which side someone is on, and sometimes a character will switch sides as their consciousness is \"overwritten\" by another traveler.\n\nI am currently binging this series, and that is what prompted this post. A few days ago I was looking up a background character that suddenly got a lot more air time than before, when I found out  (via reading the Wiki) that this person was secretly harboring the consciousness of a major villain, several episodes before that would have been properly revealed. The annoying thing is, I learned this fact the same episode that character was introduced, because I was having a \"should I know who this is?\" moment and went straight to Wikipedia. I was rewatching \"Total Recall\" the other day and did not notice that one of my favorite actors was in it, until seeing his name in the end credits. Dean Norris (Hank from \"Breaking Bad\") has a minor role as a mutant, and I did not spot him at all. (But, to be fair, he was twenty years younger and wearing a facial prosthetic and lots of makeup, so even neurotypical folks might have missed it). Hmmm not really, I mostly avoid live action TV. Also, I have more trouble with real life people than people on screen. I think it might be because it is a flat image? I can remember a photo of someone better than their face.\n\nBut let me tell you, I am on the struggle bus when I watch Marvel movies. I can recognize Tony Stark, Captain America, and Thor, but when they started adding MORE middle aged white guys????? Bruh. I MAD struggled during Infinity War. Too many people. And I cannot tell the few women apart either, so that does not help. Bring it back!  Bring it back! It just happened to me with Mindhunter, to me it seemed like the main character had always a different face. It also happens when I am watching a movie and, say, one of the characters has contact with two different people who kind of look alike, I have to figure out whether she is, say, his wife or his secretary lol. Absolutely! But it also happens without the face recognition problems. I once looked up a very minor character from a series, whom I had recognised, just to find out whether I remembered his story correctly. And then the wiki page said he had to find new employment after  died... It does, on occasion!", "Am I supposed to recognize these mouths? Lol.

None in Los Angeles?", "I suck with movies I notice modern movies are easier, because a lot of the characters tend to have more distinct handles (hairstyle or facial hair, tattoos, jewelry, ethnicity). But sometimes I just get thrown off. It took me two hours to be able to tell Aragorn and Boromir apart in LotR, and the whole trilogy to distinguish Merry and Pippin. Worse, I watched The Greatest Showman and _two_ Spiderman movies (the new ones) before I realized in the credits that Zendaya was in both movies. The plot for the Bourne series and similar movies always loses me because all the characters look the same, wearing the same suits and all. I found the LotR series to be a difficult watch because it was so hard to tell the characters apart!  It is far from the only one, although it was one of the worst for me.  I think one of the reasons I like superhero movies so much is because there is so much variety when it comes to how the characters look and act.  Everyone is a bit of an exaggeration and because the characters are based off of comic books, most of them have a unique look in and out of costume. Watching a movie ended up being the main trigger that lead me to this subreddit.  I was watching one of the newer Star Trek movies, and I just could not follow what was going on, because they all wear matching uniforms.  I legit thought one guy was in two different places at once, and got quite confused.  \n\nAlso, in Avengers: Infinity War, when Cap makes his appearance.  It was supposed to be a big dramatic moment, but I was all \"Dafuq is this guy?\" The worst movie for me is Captain America: Civil War. This was before I knew I had any form of Prosopsgnosia, but when I saw it, my stepbrother was all \"Zimo's plan makes no sense\" but to me at least, it was three different people doing random things but Zimo shows up at the end and does a little talk, so honestly I agreed with him until I watched it on my digital movie platform, which I use because if I pause it, it will circle the person and give me their name. Oh my god same in Infinity War. I recently figured out this is why I prefer cartoons over live action. Cartoon characters always look COMPLETELY different to one another so the plots always make sense. Too funny, OP- Bourne Identity was the exact movie I was watching when I started to realize most people are able to tell others apart! I still do not even know what it was about because I was trying to identify the characters. I have even not recognized my own kids in video. Strange though, I am pretty good with celebrities and pictures. But it takes me a long time of knowing somebody IRL before I can spot reliably. I was even afraid to talk to my best friend when we first met because I could not tell if it was the same person. Now I thank God for gauges! uh.... yes. yes to all of this. its always nice hearing other people say this. i thought i was dumb for so long. and others have treated me like i was dumb. feels so good to have a reason. Why cannot every movie be Castaway? Me too... Aragorn and Boromir were the two Lotr characters I had the most trouble telling apart, and I did not need to tell Merry and Pippin apart so that one did not matter In general, I find action movies harder to follow.  Always made me feel stupid.  Character-driven movies are easier, because even if characters look alike, their personalities are often more distinct than in movies focused on a great plot. Plus each cartoon character almost always wears the same clothing, which helps too Yes! I much prefer animation and long-form live TV series where I can eventually learn the main characters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is been movies where I thought it was one character, until they both appear in the same scene an hour in, and then I am horribly confused.\n\n(I have mild to medium faceblindness, where I learn the faces eventually, but a 90 minute movie is not always enough.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEx Machina is a great movie if you have face blindness because there is only 4 characters, and they all look completely different. That movie is so, so confusing to me.  I still do not understand it.", "What do faces look like in your dreams? I thought I was aware of all the ways prosopagnosia affected me, but I was surprised to find out that some people see detailed faces in their dreams.  People I know may appear in my dreams but they never have faces. What is your experience with dream faces? I do not think I see faces in my dreams? I am not sure tbh Same. I do not think I have ever seen faces. I do not really see anything usually, except with people I know really well I sometimes see their eyes I dream that I see faces but I do not see faces in my dreams, if that makes sense. Like, in the dream, I react as if everyone is fully equipped with a face\u2014it is not like I am dreaming of faceless people\u2014but if I remember visuals from my dreams, the faces are not clear or fixed. That is exactly it, well said. The people appear normal to me but the face is never seen in detail. I do not see faces in my dreams, but I also do not normally notice.\n\nI tried to lucid dream for a little while. I never got very good at it, but one of the few times I succeeded, I realized that I could not see faces in my dream no matter how close I approached. I do not remember dreams often but when I do I can recognize people but cannot remember any faces in particular. I remember hair color and such but I am not sure if they ever had a face Pretty sure I do not see faces, but it is totally obvious who I am talking to. The fact that there is no face does not seem strange... or horrific as it would in real life! Imagine that? I am not really sure.  I have very vivid dreams and remember dreams more often than I do not.  My dreams are much more visual than my thoughts when I am awake.  I feel like in my dreams people have faces and I recognize them, but I am not sure if I just know who they are as part of the dream because it is all in my head or if they do have detailed faces. I do not see faces it is just a blur that I somehow know the identity of. But if there is a specific feature like facial hair or something like that I can see that. Or if they are doing something weird with their mouth. Otherwise, pretty much the same as you. I see faces. I think I actually see them pretty well in my dreams...which is weird...I will start paying more attention to this though. Maybe it is an approximation, or the same experience as real life I do not see faces but my brain knows who they are haha Perfect description! I cannot see faces in my dreams (although with aphantasia, a lot of details do not make it into my dreams, only the most basic things). But the faces thing always stood out to me. I could understand that dreams are weird and not realistic, so I could assume the rest of my dream experiences were just \"normal\". But everyone else always knew the people in their dreams with such certainty, I knew I had to be different from them.\n\nFor me, it varies. Sometimes I just catch brief glimpses of people, like barely passing someone in person and not even looking at their face at all. Sometimes it is a human with a completely blurred-out face, no features or eyes or anything. And then other times, the person I see in my dreams *changes* throughout the dream (but my brain recognizes it as the same person). Like, they morph into another human being; different face, body, clothes, yet it is still supposed to be them. Like how most people will be in a dream, and the scenery suddenly changes. That is what happens to the people in my dreams.\n\nEven when I see my friends in my dreams, it is never actually them. It will just be some completely random person, and my brain just attaches my friend's identity to this stranger. Even in my dreams, sometimes I will stop and think *That is not what they look like*, but since I cannot actually conjure an image of them, it is the closest I am going to get. I only know I have dreamed of someone because of the *feeling* that they were in my dream, instead of actually seeing them. Faces of people I know are usually blurry, I just know who they are. \nBut faces of strangers are sometimes really detailed (which is a bit strange to me, since I cannot \"make up\" new faces whem I am awake).", "Does this face-related illusion work on you?  Yes I could tell the eyes were wrong but the mouth got me. Holy f*ck yes It took me a second but yeah that was weird (\n\nI do not know about 'work'. I could tell that the eyes and mouth were upside-down, but I have seen that illusion before and was half-expecting it.", "Can mild prosopagnosia be improved? I have mild prosopagnosia...recognizing close friends and family is fine, but a casual acquaintance after a haircut is a different story...\n\nDoes anyone know (either from research, or from direct experience) if mild forms of this can be improved with practice? My idea was to have a big quiz/set of flashcards where you are constantly shown different photos of people and you have to remember their names, recognize which ones are the same, etc. And I was hoping that doing this enough would train my brain to get better at memorizing a face.\n\nIf that is likely to work, I am also interested in any apps or websites that help with this. If nothing exists, I actually made a website of my own about 15 years ago for this purpose, but it was one of the first websites I ever made and was pretty rubbish. If it might be useful, I was thinking of reviving it and updating it, but if something is already out there then I would rather just use that. I reckon the flashcards would be a good idea, the brain is like muscle, exercise helps it get stronger! I would say I have a mild version and it feels like it has improved with time. It was at its worst when I was around 18 but now almost 25 and it has improved a lot. I think it is in part having other clues than face (hair, posture, height etc) and just my brain finishing developing (your frontal lobe develops till around 25) This is an active area of research. There is a prominent team of researchers looking into these kinds of questions right now! Check out faceblind.org. You can even reach out and participate in studies. Some studies test whether you can improve your face recognition ability! So it is possible you could be a part of helping the field understand more! I do not know if flash cards of faces would be helpful, but you can focus on learning to recognise people by other means. Try finding out what clues you are already using, and do it more consciously. When I meet someone, I will try to actively memorize some characteristics that are not the face. My main clues are voice, posture/gait and typical facial expressions (of course the latter takes a while to learn). It probably depends on exactly what caused your faceblindness.  For example, if you have physical damage to the fusiform gyrus, probably not?  Unless your brain could reroute around the damage?  I agree with one of the other commenters that it is \\*probably\\* that you get better at associating non-facial clues with faces.  For example, you could get better at memorizing, \"Suzy Quinn is 5ft4 and has a pierced nose\" and \"Jim Bailey is 5ft8 and weighs about 250.\" Thanks for all the responses (sorry for my slow reply). I have signed up with faceblind.org to participate in their studies.\n\nIt definitely feels like there could be ways to improve...I would like to see a whole bunch of similar faces side-by-side and for someone to point out all the differences so that I could train myself to recognize them. As soon as I can put something into words/facts then I have a much better shot at remembering it. But it is hard to look at a face and describe it, other than the obvious changeable stuff like hair colour. I got a lot better when I figured out what was going on, so could be more intentional about learning faces.  It is kind of weird, but I found watching television shows really helpful, because the same people keep coming up.  I got better at using other clues besides context to recognize them.  (I did not watch a lot of TV as a kid or in college, so this was new to me.)  Probably more fun than flashcards.", "Is this the same person showing off their t-shirt collection, or different people?  I had the same thought and had forgotten I was subbed here. I am relieved to know I am not the only one. Why would you ask a group of faceblind people this question? For me they all look different since the hair changes in every shot. Oh you changed your hair??? You must be a different person! My best guess? So we can all suffer together lmao I need answers. Is it in fact the same person? \n\nWe are talking a years difference between each photo which means aging, hair cuts, hair styles, pregnancy, makeup, no makeup, etc.. How the fuck are any of us supposed to tell? I have long suspected I have a mild to moderate case of Prosopagnosia, so a question like this, especially in the context of others afflicted with face blindness, is useful in my figuring out if I have it. I wonder if there is a test online somewhere in the same way you can check if you are in the Spectrum. This is more of an aside, but I do not think spectrumization is the best way to describe prosopagnosia. Spectrumization models work best for groups of comorbid symptoms that occur within the same syndrome but not every individual. Autism and schizophrenia of course being the two most prominent examples. *Every* individual with prosopagnosia *must* be face blind, ex vi termini. While there is some variance in severity, with some having more effective coping strategies and faster memory retrieval than others, I do not think it is varied enough to call a spectrum. It is all the same person, per the title. It is the mans wife over the course of ten years. Thank you for that. So are you saying either I have it or I do not? Sorry I got to go to my canned response for ethical reasons:\n&gt; I cannot accurately or ethically confirm or deny any sort of significance or diagnosis. I am not a professional, you are not my client, this is entirely over the Internet, and I do not know the extent of your concerns. If you have a medical concern you should check with your general practitioner, they can do some rudimentary tests and then if there is greater concern they can recommend you to a specialist. I appreciate that, but I might have worded my response badly. One either has electricity in the house or not. Or maybe a better analogy, a woman is either pregnant or she is not. Quite independently of my condition, I am just asking generally if prosopagnosia is a binary condition that one either has or does not have. I am taking about the condition; not about myself. Ah gotchya! In that case, at least with my knowledge of the condition, it is a black-or-white thing. If there is more considerable variation this would suggest an issue with memory retrieval over facial processing. Thanks. You have aided my understanding. I owe you one.

I was flipping through some pictures of kids from his preschool with him tonight.  It was fun, because he knew most of their names (he has not been going there that long and last time we looked they were all \"kid\") although he got a few wrong for similar looking kids including insisting that a picture of him was another kid.  It made me wonder.\n\nI know prosopagnosia can be heredity, so am watching like crazy to see if signs show up in my son.  (Also for the allergies and ADHD he could get from my husband.)  But it is kind of weird, because - unlike the other things - I do not know typical onset or what it would look like in a child. \n\nAnyone happen to have children who do or do not have face blindness?  What did that look like when they were small? I was actually pretty good at recognizing most kids in the yearbook as a kid, but just because I actually actively memorized how they looked like body and specific face parts. Before I 'learned' to do that I did not have actual friends, because I did not recognize them. Maybe it is something like that and he still confuses some pictures because the features are too similar? Also thank you for looking out for your son, my grandfather and father also have it and nobody thought to check if I would have it to. My son has prosopagnosia, but I did not realize it until we saw a TV show and he did not recognize Marina Sirtis (sp?) because her hair was in a different style. (Even though she has a very distinctive accent.)\n\nI try to help him recognize people from just their voice or the way they move. (We are both really good at recognizing Nicholas Cage and Bill Nighy.)\n\nHe knows we both have it and just try to make note of what we look like today. (It helps that I have purple hair these days, and his hair is down to his waist.) There is no 'H' in Nicolas Cage.\n\nSource:  |  Honestly as a sufferer, do not worry.\n\nMy kid cannot recognise himself half the time because he just does not see himself all that often apart from checking to see if I spiked his hair up in the mirror. Yet he sees the other kids for hours at a time. And he has no issues with recognising anyone else. Just himself.\n\nInterestingly I cannot tell any of the other kids apart, but I recognise my son because I know everything about him. His hair, how he moves, how he walks, how he talks and the expressions he uses. He is the one person I can consistently recognise.\n\nMy wife on the other hand. Not so much. Damn autocorrect! My older son inherited it from my husband. When he was very small he could not tell the difference between men and women and took a long time to learn the difference between \"he\" and \"she.\" Frequently when we were out he would point to random strangers and say \"LOOK it is SO AND SO!\" when it clearly was not - it was just that little girls with long blond hair all look like his friend with long blond hair as far as he is concerned. When he got into grade school we started educating him about how he was going to have to work a little harder than other people at identifying classmates. We realized he was having a hard time finding friends because as soon as he got out onto the playground he could not find anyone he knew, so we asked a teacher to help him identify playmates to accompany onto the playground. He continues to have a hard time with the concept of race and apparently thought he was black for a long time (we are white) because he is tanned.\n\nOne of the up sides is that not being able to recognize anybody worked out in such a way that when he was little, he just assumed we knew EVERYONE, and that literally everyone in the world was a friend. He is a super friendly, outgoing guy who has no problem chatting up complete strangers. We have worked through some friend/bullying issues and now he is got a good group of buddies. I think if a little me could say what signs to watch for, it would be a child who dislikes being left alone with other people,  who dislikes going to new places and who is frequently startled or confused by the reactions of others (due to not being able to read facial expressions). Being a child was not much fun. I remember in particular that I never understood what was expected of me and frequently got it wrong but maybe that is a regular childhood experience. I do not remember when I realised I was bad at faces - I think it was relatively recently. But looking back at when I was a kid, I remember being at playschool (kindergarten?) and being confused about whether a girl had a twin or not. I still have no idea if she had one or not, or whether it was just her sister (or maybe it was someone completely unrelated :)\n\nSo I think it is probably noticeably there from the start! I wonder whether any research has looked into it. I think it would look like confused conversations?!\n\nI hope he has not got it, it gets quite tiring does not it. Only today, I enthusiastically greeted a girl who I always mix up with another girl. I covered for it, but it was a bit embarrassing as it is happened before. Who knows what she must think (probably that I am a rude idiot but what can you do). Perhaps they do not even look alike! But they look alike to me. Honestly, I think he is too young to tell if he has it at all.  If he does, I do not think it is bad as mine, so that is good.  Most little kids have trouble identifying things of all sorts more often than adults.  He definitely can recognize people to an extent.  I just worry a tiny little bit every time he has trouble with recognition of one person. I find kids much easier to recognize than adults.  (I work with kids as a career.)  My son is especially true to this for the reasons you mentioned.  I married a distinctive looking man (not like older attractive man distinctive; like funny looking so he does not look like anyone) so I have never confused him with anyone else either. I remember passing back papers in elementary school, and tactics because it was a really hard task for me.  (Put the ones you do not know to the bottom of the pile and remember the names, so you can scan desks while you do the ones you do know.  When the other kid finishes before you...twice, hand them the bottom half of your papers, because those are the ones you do not know.  Do not look at anyone too much or talk at all, because the teachers will assume you are going slow because you are goofing around.)", "Do not know if I have a light form of prosopagnosia or am just really bad with faces? My entire life, I have always been bad with faces. I remember at around 4 or 5 years old, my mom and I went to the library together. I was looking at some books when I saw a woman who looked similar to my mom and was wearing similar attire. I thought that woman was my mom.\n\nA more recent event. I was at a wedding this summer and a good friend of mine was there. I had not seen him in a month or so, and since then he grew out a goatee. He also pulled his hair back, which he normally does not do, and he was half an inch taller than me because of his dress shoes (normally we stand at the same height.) I did not recognize him at all.\n\nThe thing is, I can recognize faces, especially ones I know well, especially if they are in a state I am used to (e.g. if a face is normally clean shaven, I may have trouble recognizing its bearded version). I can easily recognize good friends of mine. I can picture their faces well too. The closer I am with a person, the easier it is to recognize them. If I just met someone once and saw them a couple days later, chances are, I will not know who they are.\n\nOne defining characteristic of prosopagnosia is that you can not automatically recognize faces.

And other things that normal people do not notice, like forehead area, jaw shape, and the hair sits the same way. And you may find you can recognise people in different ways, other than their face, that sometimes had an advantage.\n\nFor example: I can recognise some people by their gait, they way they walk, so I can recognise someone in the dark on the other side of the road / through the trees when their face is not visible.\n\nLikewise by the sound of their voice.  I can recognise e.g when someone has arrived at a party, when they are not even in the same room, and not visible at all, by recognising voices through the noise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe book \"the man who mistook his wife for a hat\" is an amazing read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\np.s for your friends that do not understand, it can sometimes be helpful to gently remind them that \"recognise\" and \"remember\" are different things.

Will use that in the future. ;) I realized I have really good coping skills when finally learning that \u201cI am really bad with faces\u201d actually had a name. I notice details like teeth, freckles, jewelry, etc. that helps me place them later. \n\nI am really good with names and details which confuses people. Like if someone I do not recognize says hi, I need them to tell me the context of where we met and then I am like \u201coh hi! You are so and so, and your dogs name is Biff and you live on 2nd ave and went to XYZ university. How is your mom doing? She had surgery since we talked.\u201d Then I get reeeeally weird looks like I must be a stalker since my brain just files away details like that and they may or may not remember telling me all that. Yeah I feel you, it makes my life easier when I can tell people, I have prosopagnosia, it is face blindness. Much better than just having people think I am foolish or inattentive or do not care who they are. \n\nJust found this subreddit and am happy I did.", "Inability to recall faces = prosopagnosia? I am not sure if I have prosopagnosia or if I just have a weird way of recalling faces. When I try and remember how some face looks I cannot, it is just a blur of nothing. But if it is someone I know well I can remember what pieces of their face looks like ( how their nose is shaped, what their cheeks look like) and sort if piece together a rough estimate if what their face looks like. I remember people just fine but I identify them by body or walk or voice. \n\nDo I actually have Prosopagnosia or am I just over thinking things? It sounds like it is proso.\nI cannot visualize faces in my mind, I recognize people by everything else but their face, even if they are my family or myself in a mirror...\n\nproso can be more or less severe.\nhave you ever had those issues with faces ? I find it hard to visualise faces of people I do not know very well.   I cannot visualize faces of people I know well. I recognize people who have unique or distinctive features but most people look the same. I also recognize pieces but I am usually wrong. I ask my husband \u201cIs that ___?\u201d  He says I can see (what I am seeing) but no. I am always curious how clearly other people can see faces in their mind/memory.\n\nWhen I try to visualize faces it is sort of a blurry/moving image in my head, even for very close family.\n\n(And I consider myself to have a very mild case of prosopagnosia) I should clarify that I do not have trouble recognizing faces when they are in front of me, just when I am trying to remember them later. I would completely fail to describe someone for a police sketch artist. But I could pick them out of a line up. I am thinking that if I have prosopagnosia it is very mild, like you.\n I have this too!\nIt can be really annoying sometimes but the way I would conquer this is by \u2018piecemeal\u2019 where I try to remember specific features. Pictures help me a lot to be honest too, for certain people I have specific photos that I can remember, to which I then build up their face in my head until I can remember that photo. \n\nIt definitely is more severe at times. I do not really remember what my mum looks like at all - but like you, if they are right in front of me then I would have no problem. For me a large percent of people I have no problem with.  Certain types of people feel \u201cgeneric\u201d to me though and I always struggle with them.  They tend to be like average looking people; or sometimes I just group similar older men together.\n\nThose type of people out context are tough for me. My experience is vert similar to this with people I have seen many times and become familiar with. Although, if someone who I have not seen much of has a photo of them up on the wall, I find that so hard to match the photo to the real life person.", "Can you tell where someone is looking? I have prosopagnosia and I know that all of my friends can tell where I am looking, as if laser pointers were attached to my eyeballs. In contrast I have not the slightest clue where someone might be looking, or if someone is making eye contact / looking at me. \n\nSo my question is, is this a normal part of Face Blindness, or can you people tell where someone is looking despite being prosopagnostic? I can relate to this somewhat. I do not think I pay as much attention to faces, to include eyes, as regular people do.\n\nFor example, if I am in a crowd and am asked who the guy is who is staring at us, I would have to look because I would have no idea who was looking at us, even if I had been looking in that general direction. Everyone else would have noticed the guy staring at us, while I could easily miss it.\n\nBut if they asked me if I know the guy in the cowboy hat (or guy with blue hair, or guy with the blue shirt), I would know who they were talking about without looking.\n\nFacial features are just not as important to us, and facial cues can be easy to miss. See what I noticed is that even when I am actively trying to see where someone is looking, I cannot find out anything that is much more precise than the direction his head is turned. Could you?\n\nAnd Example where I noticed this was when someone is calling on me in a group but does not know (or simply does not use) my name, so they will look at me and expect me to know I am the one they are addressing. I know I have issues with eye contact, and I wonder if this might be a common thread, at least for people with DP.\n\nIf it is a passive situation (like just sitting around), I likely would not notice, but I can follow a person's gaze if I am intentionally looking for it I was born with Prosopagnosia, and I do not think I have problems figuring out where somebody is looking, or where they are otherwise focusing their attention. For instance, I can tell in conversation when somebody is giving me eye contact, or looking at my cleavage/outfit, or when they are looking at my neck (which a guy friend tells me is so that they can see cleavage in their peripheral vision), or even if they are actually paying attention to something else entirely.\n\nI mean, I can only tell these things when I am actually trying to give eye contact myself, but I figured that is how it is for neurotypical people too.  I have not noticed that, but I am also a teacher and it is my job to make sure my students are paying attention, so maybe I am just more focused on that XD;;; That is never been an issue for me, personally.  I can never tell if someone is making eye contact! I was shocked when I discovered that other women can easily tell if a man is looking at their chest instead of their face- I would never notice unless I tried. Yeah, I cannot notice where someone is eyes are looking while also talking to them. Maybe if they talk a lot I can use their monologue asa chance to look at them closely, but otherwise it is too much to pay attention to at once.  If I tried to figure out where someone is looking,  I think I can at least narrow down the part of the room them look over and guess who or what may be interesting there.  I could not do this while speaking myself though. \n\nI heard some public speaker explain how he checks the audience reactions and changes what he says to keep their interest. I was so amazed he could do that from far away,  with a lot of people at once,  and still remember to work in the content of the speech. I have a hard time simultaneously talking and reading a very small group of my family members that I have known 25-30 years! I still have to ask for help if certain people are joking like my sister or stepdad because they are sarcastic and dry, so they have very little emotion. The trick is it rellefant? \n\nI have DP and normal people cant read me too!\n\nit works both ways the thing is does it matter , I have friends who are face blind that CAN read me better , they do not look at face. there are better ways to read people then the face. deep relations with non faceblind people is hard because they cant read you , so they do not know when you feel sad or are happy , you miss the instinct that controls that so it works both ways IMO  face expression of DP people is more neutral , they can only show feelings if you want to and even then they sometimes do not show in a way non faceblind people can read them.\n\nand yes if you look at the eyes you can always see were they look , for non face blind people that is important info because most eye face movement are instinctive but with DB Face blind people they are not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B; Its not strict the face center , were eye movement and emotions reading is done...\n\nit can also easy been don by other centers for moving objects and pattern detection my pattern detection center is way more developed because of my face blindness , so 99% is fixed by detecting peoples patterns that includes eye patterns.\n\n&amp;#x200B; Prosopagnosia still is not completely understood and you are going to get different answers to this based on individual biology.  I am terrible at facial recognition, but absolutely excellent at reading micro-expressions.  I have never had any problem telling where someone was looking.  I guess it depends on the portion of the brain that is not functioning correctly.  An excerpt from a Japanese study in 2014 puts it like this:\n\n \"...the recognition of a person's identity and the recognition of facial  expressions are processed by different cortical and subcortical areas of  the brain. The fusiform gyrus, especially the right fusiform gyrus,  plays an important role in the recognition of identity. The superior  temporal sulcus, amygdala, and medial frontal cortex play important  roles in facial-expression recognition. Both facial recognition and  facial-expression recognition are highly intellectual processes that  involve several regions of the brain. \" Thank you for the detailed comment. It is very helpful!  I did not realise that I could have a lack of face expression.\n\nbut reading this post, this could be an explanation for why people often say to me that I do not show when I am happy with something special they do to me.\n\nhowever, I really feel that they can see it in my face, that I clearly show them what I think but apparently they cannot see it...\n", "When did you realize that you have difficulties recognising faces? I will go first, to give you guys an example.\n\nI have always had trouble recognising faces, but for some reason, that explaination was not on my mind.\nI always thought I am forgetful or even stupid for not remembering people I met just days before.\n\nBut one day, about 6 months ago, I was watching Westworld with my stepdad.\nDo not worry, I will not spoil it!\nThere was this reoccurring character that I had no trouble recognising, but then he changed to a cowboy outfit.\nI thought it was a new character, but he spoke like he was not.\nSo I asked my stepdad who that guy is.\nHe looked very surprised, and explained who it was, and that we had seen the character countless of times before.\nHe asked me \"You must be faceblind, that would explain alot\".\nNever heard of faceblindness before, so I looked it up.\nIt explained EVERYTHING. It was so incredibly fascinating to read about something that has affected me my entire life, without me even knowing about it.\nI would also like to point out that my case is mild. I have no trouble recognising family members, close friends, classmates (after a while). That is probably why I went 20 years of my life without even knowing out it.\n\nSo, what was your \"Aha!\" moment? Looking back, I always had problems. I remember that all my school friends were very short or tall or heavy... the kind that stood out in a crowd. I remember watching Batman ('89) and struggled to tell Robert Wohl from Michael Keaton. \n\nBut I think my defining moment was when my sister in law (husband's side) met my mom at my shower, (but they did not talk), and then 2 months later they recognized each other while out. And I thought they both had some face-recognizing superpower, like how I could remember a phone number I heard once, but with faces. Even in my mid-20's I had a very close friend say that I walked into in event and acted like I never saw her. I realized it when I was close to 30. Like you, I did not discover it myself, a friend realized. \n\nI had always had an inkling something was off but my condition was congenital so I did not know any different. Lack of facial recognition was also mistakenly validated early in my life. I used to wear a hair bow every day when I was in elementary. If I forgot it one day, my music teacher would say \u201cwell miss u/GalacticGrandma I did not even recognize you without your bow!\u201d So that led me to believe that was true of *everyone*. That comment, I later figured out, was a joke/sarcasm.\n\nWe did not find a name for it until mid school. I had a dear friend, Dakota, who was quite precocious. She was reading a book about fascinating brains, and in it there was a test for prosopagnosia. She remembered a day my crush changed his hair and I could not find him, so she had me take the book test. Despite knowing every celebrity in the test, when their hair and eyebrows were taken away I could not identify them. That was a pretty clear indicator that I had it. I was diagnosed a semester later with Asperger\u2019s/ASD, so everything fell into place with that. In high school there were these two blonde girls who I spent MONTHS believing were the same person.  I would regularly reference \"earlier conversations\" with the wrong one, and the one whose name I always got wrong did not like me because, well... I always got her name wrong (but she did not tell me that she was annoyed or why, she was just cold to me). I thought this single person was just forgetful and sometimes crabby.\n\nI was not close to this \"individual,\" and only saw \"her\" maybe a couple times a week.  Weirdly, I DID seen them together occasionally, and knew them as separate people at those times, but if I saw them apart?  I always thought it was the same one of the pair.  I assumed the other one lived further away and was not around as much.\n\nFinally the one who was constantly mis-named blew up at me, and I was like... wait, you are not \"person?\"\n\nOf course I apologized, but that still was not enough to clue me in.  \n\nThen, one day, I commented on how similar they looked to a group of mutual acquaintances.  They were like, \"what are you talking about? Those two look NOTHING alike!  Well, that was baffling, because even though I knew now that they were two people, I still could not tell them apart to save my life.\n\nSo that is how I learned I was bad with faces, and not to trust my eyes to tell people apart.  I also started to avoid using names until I was sure of someone is identity from conversational clues.  Not so coincidentally,  that is also when I started to actually make friends.  I spent my whole childhood not recognizing people, but not knowing I did not recognize them.  I have no idea how I even functioned, but apparently the answer is \"not well.\"\n\nIt was another 10 years before I discovered prosopagnosia existed and that my being bad with faces was not a moral failing that I could surely fix if I just tried harder and paid closer attention. I first had difficulty recognizing people as a child. I could not tell my uncle's(who looked nothing alike) apart. I had to learn to tell them apart by which bedroom they came out of(both lived with my grandparents). \n\nI could not tell my dad from a different uncle. \n\nI learned quickly how to pretend to know people, even family members, and ask who they were later. \n\nI also learned to focus on hair, scent, certain outfit staples etc very young.\n\nAll that said, I did not know I could not recognize faces until I learned what face blindness was. I knew I had trouble knowing who people were, but I always passed it off. Once I was given the language I knew immediately. There was a prosopagnosia quiz that popped up in my feed. I was bored, took it and failed miserably. I laughed and gave it to my SO to try; Figured it was just one of those dorky online quizzes. He tested average. My cousin took it, she got super-recognizer. \n\n\nSo, at this point I am going WTF, how did you two do that? Turns out, the quiz was one of the leggit ones, and after taking a few others I started putting the pieces together. I leggit do not recognize people, but I am *really* good at faking it. My first year out of college, I read something online and was like, \"Wait a second...\" and then failed an online quiz miserably.  I knew about prosopagnosia from college psych, but only had the example of a really extreme case, although I remember not really getting what they were talking about when discussing facial recognition processes.  \n\nLooking back, it made so much make sense.  For example, I have two cousins that I had trouble telling apart that I saw semi-regularly.  I remember not knowing all the kids in my class in elementary, but I never moved.  I have trouble following plots of movies and TV shows.  I have so many times that I used coping mechanisms to pretend to know people to be polite.  I just thought it was normal. Back in grade school teachers liked to have students do their job for them and hand beck graded assignments. I got called on to do it one day, maybe 5th or 6th grade, and just kept flipping through pages trying to figure out who was who. I ended up only handing 2 back (tall kid with glasses, short Neville Longbottom looking kid with glasses) before I gave up and passed the job off on someone else. This was a small school and I would been with the same 15-20 classmates since kindergarten. I could only recognize two of them. \n\nThere was also a time around 7th grade where my mother changed her hair color and I had no clue who she was when she picked me up from school. There were times where I could not distinguish her from my aunt even though I am told they look nothing alike. I have always struggled to recognise people out of their usual setting (school, work, neighbourhood etc) and in movies where say female characters had the same colour hair I often found the plot confusing - which character is which?? My defining moment was one day visiting my married son and a young woman entered the room. She said hello and stared at me expectantly. I was about to introduce myself as my son\u2019s mother but something in her look held me back\u2026..she seemed to know me and waiting on a reaction. In the next moment she said \u201cMum are you surprised to see me?\u201d. It was my daughter visiting from interstate. How does one not recognise their own daughter??!! Kindergarten, not being able to recognise my teachers outside of their specific classrooms. We had a driver to carry us to school and I would have to remember the license plates to avoid just randomly getting in the wrong panel van. \ud83d\ude2c  \n\nBy the time I got to my teens, it was already a well-known fact that I am horrible at faces. My sister has a joke that I could be kidnapped and they would not need to blindfold me or anything. That they could release me and always re-kidnap me later on with no trouble. Hi there - Jonathan here - would you be interested/available to talk about your experiences for a radio show over Zoom? Find it absolutely fascinating Suspected it for a long time but it is usually easy to cover because I have a good memory for voices.\n\nConfirmation: Our preschool would gradually move kids into the next year room: a few hours, a few hours + lunch, then + nap time, etc until a whole day. I pick up early mid change-over week so I went to the new toddler room after collecting the day bag from the infant room.\n\nI could not pick out my child. \n\nI called their name and 5 little ambiguous smiling faces turned to look at me. Still nothing familiar registered. Narrowed my choices by amount and color of hair and finally recalling clothes I had dressed them in.\nRepeat for the first couple full days in this new room and then again changing to 3rd and 4th room. I know I am answering this super late, but oh well. I realized I had difficulty recognizing faces when I ran into my roommate outside our apartment and did not recognize her. She jokingly shoulder bumped me and I stepped out of the way and apologized. It took a good few second of me staring at her blankly while she had an confused expression on her face before I realized it was my roommate and not some stranger. She was a good sport about it though, which was fortunate. When I was a kid I got people at school (with similar hair) mixed up and found it difficult to follow movies because I could not tell whether I would seen anybody before. It was not too bad, but then I got a job hosting kid's birthday parties at a playplace. This means that I would talk to the parents before, then let everyone play on the inflatables, then in the arcade, then bring them into the room for food and cake. The problem was when I would have to go up to the parents to give them the tokens for the arcade. I could never find which of the parents were the party parents. Sometimes I would get lucky and they had weird hair or a strange outfit, and I had no problem. But most of the time they looked like every other parent there. My sister, who worked the same job, thought I must have been overstating the problem or was just not trying. That was when I realized that I really could not remember faces. I started purposely memorizing the exact outfit the person had and that worked most of the time.", "Do I have Prosopagnosia? Hi everyone.

A lot of the guidelines I try to give her are not helpful, and I am wondering if anyone with prosopagnosia can recommend tutorials, tricks, or ways of thinking about makeup that have helped them learn to use makeup. I have no idea but I am following for tips. This is kind of hard for me and generally has to do with the fact that I look different to myself if I wear a lot of makeup. I can walk by a mirror three times on an average day and feel like my face looks slightly different every time and I cannot really put my finger on why. It is probably the angle or maybe micro expressions that I see with a quick glance but it all contributes to a general feeling of not really knowing what I look like. Wearing lots of makeup furthers this uneasy feeling. I would love to have smokey eyes or bright color lipsticks but it really ramps up my feeling of who is this when I look in the mirror which then morphs into does this even look good or am I doing this right. As it is, I tend to prefer a more natural look. I do not wear bright colors because it looks even more foreign to me. Maybe try dialing it back a little and start with tinted glosses instead of lipstick with lip liner or neutral palettes for eyeshadows instead of anything dramatic. I feel this so much! I definitely always look different at every glance. My children do too . It is hard.\n\nI feel like I like make up but I struggle more with dysmorphia when I wear it. I had not even thought of the dysmorphic aspect. That really sucks.  \n\n\nIn my partner's case, it is a little trickier because she is trans. Wearing makeup really helps cue other people to see her as a woman, particularly in the early stages of transition. I wonder if she would have similar problems with the kind of dysmorphia you experience, and if it would be worse than the frustration of being misgendered. She may just have to try it to see.  \n\n\nI got her a bunch of tinted lip glosses and some clear mascara. I figured that making a mistake with those is not as noticeable, and so it will be less scary for her because the stakes are lower.  \n\n\nI recently did some fairly basic makeup for a party for her, and I tried to explain things as I went. I am a big fan of makeup that is not visible, although I have fun with crazy colours and glitter sometimes too. For my partner, though, I am sticking with the idea of makeup that is barely noticeable, but when you are wearing it, people just think you look extra pretty that day.  \n\n\nMy usual spiel is that people tend to find two things attractive or beautiful in makeup: things that exaggerate markers of good health, and things that exaggerate markers of female gender (largely because makeup is currently so gendered in our society). I thought those were reasonable rules of thumb, but it turns out that she does not know what a healthy face looks like, or what features we expect to be more prominent in women than in men, etc.  \n\n\nI have been thinking about abstractions I can make about applying makeup that *would* make sense to her, but first I thought I would look for resources online. There is lots of tutorials on, say, YouTube on how to do various makeup techniques, or how to do makeup for a trans woman. I thought there might be something like that for people with prosopagnosia, but I have not found anything yet. So, I may keep trying different things and see if I find rules that do work for her. If I do, I will be sure to share them here! I think it is so awesome that you are helping your partner out!  I have spent a lifetime scrutinizing my own face which seems hard enough to me and can only imagine how difficult it must be for someone who is also trans. \n\nI tend to think every case of prosopagnosia is a little bit different in how someone experiences it and I can only speak for myself but I think you are on the right track trying to keep it more natural while playing up the pretty.  The dysmorphia is less noticeable to me if I keep closer to how I look naturally. If I wear bright red lipstick, I feel like a clown even though I am pretty sure it looks fine. It is just so striking, it is all I see. \n\nI cannot visualize faces in my mind, not even my own, so it is hard for me to imagine what I would look like trying out new color palettes or techniques. I cannot even follow tutorials very well. I can do stuff like cooking or crafty tutorials but makeup ones always seem like magic to me. I dated a guy in college who was a really talented artist and could draw nearly anything but he really struggled with hands. He told me once that he simply could not visualize them in his mind even if he was staring right at someone is hands. And therefore he found them almost impossible to draw. I think this is some of my struggle with makeup. I cannot imagine how something would look and therefore whether it looks good on me. And I am really sensitive about that so I rarely experiment with new stuff anymore. I have accepted what I think I look like without makeup and then I have a basic makeup look. \n\nI personally do not see faces as a whole. I spend a lot of time looking at individual features some of which I try to use to identify people if the feature is distinctive enough. So maybe start thinking about faces as pieces that make up a whole and work through those individual features with your partner.\n\nI hope you come back and update us!  I am pretty sure there is quite a few people on here, myself included, who would love to have a friend who not only wants to better understand this condition but also wants to use that knowledge to help us all look our best!", "Got my phone stolen and I was not able to recognize the thief I am rather frustrated. My phone got stolen and when the police asked me about who did it I just could go \"???\" because I did not have a clue myself. I faced the thief several times afterwards because it happened in a small town's bus stop and I waited until his bus came back, but I could not tell him apart from the rest of the people in there! I get so heated thinking I might have smiled at him unaware on who he was.\n\nIn the end I have had to buy other mobile phone and the previous one is obviously lost forever now. In these kind of moments prosopagnosia sucks so bad. My worst nightmare is having the police ask me to work with a sketch artist and describe for him some person who I witnessed commit a horrible crime. Me too! I think about this all the time. How I would have to explain that I cannot recognize faces and that even if I did recognize the person in a line up or give a sketch, I would be a horrible witness because any defense attorney would be able to discredit me.\n\nBut if figure I have a way, way above average chance of recognizing someone in a voice lineup. And I could describe the way the person walked with complete precision. Oh hey, I wrote a short story about exactly that scenario!\n  I used to think about that a lot, but then abandoned the idea because it sounded too far-fetched and improbable. Turns out these kind of things also happen in real life.\n\nSigh, prosopagnosia can be a real pain in the butt. This is really well written!\n\nAnd very familiar in a lot of ways haha (not the murder part I promise) Cheers dude, appreciated! Suspect there is a few of us who would hate to be put on the spot like that! Oh yeah haha.\n\nFunnily enough I volunteer for a blindness charity. I drive people to activities and social gatherings.\n\nSounds fine till you remember I have to collect the right person at the end, from a group of at least 20. And they are all blind for real and cannot help xD\n\nReally bad choice on my part. Did not think it through. I work security and I have had to describe a suspect a few times. I let them know I am face blind forthmost. I focus on the things I can remember. Hair, ears, skin tone, clothes, walk, accent/tone. Sometimes there are other things that stand out about them. People think face is the thing that is the only thing police need to identify someone but it is not.\n\nThe thing that gets me is when someone flashes a photo and says if you see this person call the PD. &gt;The thing that gets me is when someone flashes a photo and says if you see this person call the PD.\n\nYeah man, I always think about this when someone goes missing around my area or a suspect of some horrible crime is wanted by the police. It is complicated. My teacher told me I should be one haha that is been a big fear since i was a child lol. \u201ccan you describe the man who attacked you?\u201d \u201cwell\u2026 he was not very nice. he had a face, i guess? and maybe eyes?\u201d", "I cannot for the life of me form some people faces in my mind I can recognize them, even their faces, if i meet them irl, but when for example; i close my eyes. Poof, gone. The interresting thing is, why does that only happen with some people? I find I can eventually memorize a photo, and picture that in my head. That does not help if I run into that person in a place outside of their normal environment. You may be navigating more on the voice than you realize, or some distinctive mannerisms that you are not even truly aware of. I know that voice is my main clue, but I did not know why for multiple decades. \n\nWe all learn to navigate this odd situation in our own way. Knowing what it is helps explain it, and straight up telling the other person that you cannot recognize them without some help is not the worst idea either. I just cant remember faces, but i can see their faces perfectly irl (you get me?) and i just know its them. Pictures and drawings are fine for me too.\n\nI use cues too, didnt really think about it that much, because everything happened subconsciously. I use body types, skin tones, and clothing style. Explains alot why im good at knowing when someone change the things i mention above (creepy power). I am this way also and can only really see someone in a photo. Otherwise I just use context, location, and feature clues. This might sound weird but sometimes I feel like I have met the same handfuls of people over and over again because there are so many times I have noticed certain features that seem to coincide with distinct personalities. Exactly this. I found that my social life got a lot less awkward when I started telling everyone I met about it so that they understood why I would not know who they were the next time I saw them again.\n\nYou get a few people who are a little incredulous at first, but the very next time I do not know who they are when I meet them, they get it. A lot of people are even willing to help out by being sure to speak right away around me or outright tell me who they are. It has made my social life a whole lot easier. Yes, asking people to speak if they see me looking like a stunned fool has helped greatly. Lol. From other people stories, i guess i only have a mild case of proso, because i can atleast form something. Severe would be everyone would look the same, and forgetting everything about their faces. I can remember faces if i have interacted with them. Sometimes i need alot of time or only few interactions. I can live with this. I am probaly just stupid idk I feel this. Like if I know someone well I can often picture a lot of their individual facial features, but I just cannot make my brain see the features together", "Joyce: The spy who recognized my arm - Faceblind Podcast  Hi all, had to delete the old post and repost a corrected link. Hope that does not break any Reddit rules :) Please upvote again if you like this episode. Was a lot of fun to record.", "When I see posts like this where people are trying to defeat facial recognition software, I cannot help but think \"They want to stop me from getting help telling who they are.\" ", "TIL That Dave Franco is not Zach Efron - I thought this was the same dude. I think even for someone with poor facial recognition these two look quite similar.  If they ever appear in a movie together I will be completely lost.  Dave, Zach, if you read this can one of you get a mohawk or something?  Holy crap i thought that wad Zac Efron  IKR!  I am not totally crazy, they are quite similar I still reckon they are the same person and it is a weird government conspiracy to make uss think we are crazy I am onto these illuminaties!   I went through our 3 years of high school thinking two girls were the same person until they called them separately at graduation lollll Uuuuu are not alooooone, I am here with uuuuuuuuu\n\n^That song goes through my mind every time I meet someone else who also sucks at recognizing faces ", "How can one be formally tested/diagnosed? I have always had had difficulty with faces and names growing up. I did not know any of my classmates in school. Did not really think much of it, honestly. Identifying a few important people by distinctive non-facial cues was easy enough. I assumed I was just bad with names and everyone was the same.\n\nBut then I started student teaching. I am really good in front of the class actually teaching and I am a solid lesson planner. However, there were just too many students for me to track, and my co-op teacher confronted me pretty harshly about this fact. I would make flash cards and study seating charts, but no matter what I tried I just could not get it. The stress just added to the already high-stakes nature of my placement, and I seriously considered leaving the field.\n\nSince then I have worked in educational positions that do not require me to be a regular presence in a set group of students' day (read: I do not really need to know a lot of students by name on sight).\n\nBut now there is a job that I want. It is something I have been doing for years and love doing, but it will require more regular interaction with classes on a day to day basis. I am really excited because the position would give me a lot more freedom to actually work with students and impact how the school treats my area of the educational experience.\n\nBut my face blindness is giving me pause -I am worried that the students will think I do not care about them because I cannot remember who they are. I am worried that administration will see me relying on name tags and strict seating charts as a sign that I do not care. So, I do not think I will accept the position as a result.\n\nThis is always a fear for me as I approach any job or any interview. I have never been formally tested, and that makes me feel like it is not something I can easily share in a professional setting with any weight.\n\nI feel like if I could seek a formal diagnosis, I would have the ability to better self-advocate for accommodations rather than coming across as someone who simply does not care.\n\nBut I have been researching this topic for years. There is plenty of online tests and such, but how can I go about seeking a formal diagnosis?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. If you are in the UK, Exeter University had a study, and I know of someone who was diagnosed through them.  United States, unfortunately. Pennsylvania, specifically. I have seen Exeter quite a bit online from searching around for this sort of thing. Start with a neurologist for a diagnosis. \n\nTell your class outright you have trouble with names, do not admit to having trouble with faces. There are great suggestions in this group from teachers who learned incredible ways to cope. \n\nWe need good educators, do not let prosopagnosia prevent you from being yourself. It is not as rare a thing as you would think, I believe everyone knows someone like us. All the best to you. Take a photo of each kid, put their name under it, rearrange a collage of the photos each day depending on where the kids are sitting, use it for reference? I do not know if this would help me.  I have trouble recognizing pictures of my students.  May work for OP though. No idea about a formal diagnosis, but I am a teacher and here is what I have got:\n\nI teach elementary and you sound like secondary, so I think it is easier.  I am quick with names though, so I memorize a seating chart and gradually match it to kids.  For secondary you could have name tags on their desk that they switch out each period.  Let them make and decorate them so they are distinct with personality, allowing you to learn the kid better.  Move seats rarely. Think about your seat arrangements - if you have them already in small groups or a large circle, they will not have to move around the classroom when working on projects.\n\nYou might try subbing.  No one expects you to know names (except little kids but they expect you to know their name when you have never met them.)  Constantly having new kids each day (in assigned seats mostly) helped me get better at recognizing kids.  But again, primarily elementary where you have the same kids each day.  Kids seem more distinct than adults to me, and personality types help me learn kids.\n\nYou do not need a formal diagnosis if your principal is nice.  After being hired, mention to them (in a meeting about other things too) that you struggle with facial recognition.  I agree with telling kids you are bad with names, but not mentioning faces (because they may think that is a license to get away with things.)\n\nI find parents the hardest.  If one drops by unexpectedly and you cannot place them quickly, you can say you need to go to a meeting/appointment immediately, but ask them to email you to schedule a meeting to talk about it.  The first half of the year, I get away with \"Open House is always a blur with all the new faces,\" and ask for their name or child's name...and really hope I have actually met them before. I reread your post, because I was interested, and it sounds like the issue is kids are not feeling that you identify with them individually.  I found it was easier for me to learn to recognize kids when I learned their personality rather than tried to study their face.  Plus just recognizing them is not enough; they want to know you care.\n\nI do not know what age you work with or subject, so this might not be appropriate.   Make a seating chart for each class with the child's name and an identifying physical feature (blue hair, usually wears red coat, glasses - I used my personal abbreviations for this when subbing so no one knew) small in the top of each square.  I write really small, but if you write bigger/have a large class, you may need several pieces of paper.  Make copies of this for each week.\n\nAt the beginning of your class have an entry task for students to do at their seat.  (Either something fun like using an online forum to respond to interesting questions where they can see each other's answers or something high stakes like a quiz.  Basically you need them in their seats fast and for 5-10 minutes.)  \n\nWalk around and talk briefly to students (trying to hit at least 70% of the class each day, and every student at least twice a week.)  Ask them about their day, etc. and jot down a few words to remember their answer.  (Ideally, you will be checking off homework or \"taking notes on their work\" or something to explain the writing. \n But I am really bad at names and am trying to learn you guys works too.)  Then the next time you talk to them, it is written down for you to bring up.  You can also jot academic notes on the seating chart. \n Something like this would help you potentially get to know them as learners and is people.\n\nI am sorry you had such a bad experience initially. I have trouble recognizing someone from a photo also.  It could have been taken 10 minutes ago, but I cannot usually match a person to a photo in any circumstance. I have had to check IDs before, which is scary.  How are you supposed to know it is that person especially when the picture could have been taken years ago and the person could have changed their hair?  Like maybe if I could go feature by feature and look at different angles.  One of my aunts used her sister's ID once (she wanted a drink at a wedding but her purse was up in her hotel room in a large hotel; both were in their 30s-40s) and they thought it was hysterical that they got away with it (she had planned to lie and say they got switched accidentally, and return with her actual ID if she was caught.)  I do not understand how they could have NOT gotten away with it as they have somewhat similar features.  Good thing I do not have to check IDs anymore, I guess.", "Does reading age correlate with prosopagnosia I have been taking a course in behavioral neuroscience and have an theory about my own prosopagnosia. I learned to read flash cards when I was 2, and began reading my own baby books soon thereafter. I have done the proso testing and reviewed a lot of current research. I read words \"holistically\". I never learned to \"sound out\" things until adulthood (mostly with medical terms like prosopagnosia). I am also a terrible speller. I have thought that this was due to learning from flash cards. I wonder if I somehow transferred the holistic ability of non-prosopagnosiacs for facial recognition to reading.  This is not an area that researchers seem to have studied yet to find if there is a correlation.  However, there is a brain imaging study from MIT about how the fusiform gyrus lateralizes by comparing studies of children's fMRIs before and after they learned to read. This also seems to jive with the concept of \"sensitive periods\" in childhood development. I would love to hear from anyone if anything I have written here sounds familiar. I was an early reader too, my parents said I skipped the whole phonics thing and picked up reading and writing before I was two. I also have memories of being the only kid in my preschool class who was able to read. I also have pretty severe prosopagnosia. I never thought the two were linked but that sounds like something worth researching! Thanks for not letting me feel alone! out of curiosity, how is your spelling? I would say above average. I got like, third place in a spelling bee back in middle school Could be related. Also learned to read very early and also have pretty severe prosopagnosia. However, I am generally an excellent speller so I do not think that part is entirely related.\n\nOn the subject of language comprehension in general, I am one of the only software engineers I have ever met in my long career who is completely fluent in all the major compiled programming languages and have a solid working knowledge of many of the major scripting languages. I have suspected that this ability to easily comprehend new grammars and vocabularies was somehow correlated with prosopagnosia as well. I did not know how to read until I was about 10.\n\nI also learnt to read words as a whole instead of sounding out, though scientific or medical terms now as an adult are usually based on smaller words, so breaking them up helps. Very interesting!  I, too, love computer programming languages, though I am definitely not fluent in any. The logic, the order, the details are all somehow comforting.  Thanks for sharing. Maybe there is something to this;  the reading age, at least. I read prosopagnosia as pro-so-pag-nosia. :-)  Apparently, this is called chunking in psychology. It is way to encode information in the brain so it takes up less in working memory.  May I ask, do you have prosopagnosia? I too was an early reader and have prosopagnosia (and aphantasia on top of that). Not currently a great speller but used to be when I was a more avid reader which makes sense because I read books \u201cholistically\u201d as individual words and ideas Have not been professionally diagnosed with it, as it does not impact my life in more than an annoyance kind of way, but I believe so, yes. I understand. \"***suffering*** from facebindness\" does not really make much sense. there is certainly embarrassment, but the only thing that really suffers is our pride. Oh, I do not know.\n\nThere was definitely some suffering one time when I ran into a couple of girls at a club I did not recognize, after having brought them home previously. Very cool! I had to look up aphantasia. That must have been very tough as a kid. Is that just imaginary scenes or does it apply to your memories as well? \n\nDo you have trouble with crossword puzzles? I always preferred soduku to crosswords. I think it might be the holistic processing of words that makes it difficult for me. Might be the spelling thing, though. Oh, wow! There is a lot to unpack there. LOL That is the abridged version :p Interesting theory.  I think one day we should do a really, really big survey on this site about all the weird stuff about us and see what is correlating with prosopagnosia.\n\nI was kind of average to earlish.  I learned to read without difficulty when I started school along with my peers, but not unusually early or particularly well.  It really clicked in second grade and I went from Bernstein Bear chapter books to Anne of Green Gables in a few months.\n\nI also was a whole word reader.  BUT I am in my 30s and phonics were out of style then.  I did not have explicit instruction in them until I was in college.  (I am a teacher.)  Until that point, I only learned spelling by memorization and was awful.  (The flip side of that is my vocabulary is excellent partially from trying to find words I could spell!)  I am a good memorizer, but you really need to learn patterns.  Interestingly, I was good at algebra and finding patterns in math.  Also, I do not have a good ear for languages and misspoke a lot when I was a kid; I do not really hear or read the small parts of words, so much as the whole thing.\n\nOne thing that is kind of interesting (well, to me) and somewhat related is my memories.  I have a fairly good memory for events and a lot of early memories.  My memories from the time before I was reading are all visual.  My memories from after that time are more conceptual.  I do not know if it is a developmental thing in my thinking...or maybe someone bonked me in the head and I do not know it! Beep. Boop. I am a robot.\nHere is a copy of \n\n###(\n\nWas I a good bot? | ( | ( Thanks for the detailed response. First question: Who chooses what to put on the survey? In reading through the threads, there is a lot of unusual things that seem to apply to some, but not others. Migraines, navigational problems, etc. Some comorbidities are included in the research website ( while others, like this one, have not. \n\nI have learned that there are at least 25 brain areas that are involved in facial recognition. Damage to any of them can cause different levels of severity for proso. However, the congenital form, that many of us have, have no associated damage to any of these areas. There is some evidence that the fusiform gyrus is thicker in those with congenital prosopagnosia. The speculation is that because it is thicker, it has fewer connections with the other areas. Or perhaps it is in the neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, or neuromodulaters? It is fiendishly complex.\n\nI think you hit upon the point of my asking with your mention of how your memories changed in quality after learning to read. I have no memories of being unable to read. I do have one about not being able to read cursive and how incredibly frustrating it was.  That memory is purely visual. \n\nBy your response, I suspect that if you had learned to read earlier, all your memories would be more conceptual. It sounds like you transferred your holistic ability to reading like I did. But, I am simply a student and am trying to figure this out like everyone else here. I was taught to read phonetically in 1st grade. My mom says I was 'resistant' to reading for about half the year and then something just seemed to click and after that I read everything I could get my hands on.  I am a fairly quick reader too. \n\nOddly, despite being good at spelling and pronunciation, I have a terrible time telling which syllable is accented even when I am correctly pronouncing a word. Thank you for sharing this. It seems a bit similar to Moe523's response about learning to read in the same time frame as him, but that you both picked it up quickly and advanced quickly. \n\nOnce everything \"clicked\" for you, did that change how you perceive words when reading? Especially because you learned to read phonetically. initially, with your class cohorts. Do you *now* read words holistically?\n\nBefore you could read, are your memories mostly visual, like Moe523's response above, then more conceptual after? \n\nI am curious about your last paragraph, and am not sure I understand what you mean.  Would you mind expanding on that?   An example word and what you experience? I have been bilingual for as long as I can remember. I learned phonetics in 1st grade. I was not great at spelling, and then I was and to my shock won a spelling bee. I have been great with language ever since. I think part of it is the pattern of languages, combined with preferring to read over watching TV. (There are way too many similar faces for TV to be relaxing for me). Interesting topic! I learned to read at 2-3ish without being \u201ctaught\u201d. From what I understand, my parents read to me and I kind of just picked it up. I love reading and go through a book or two per week. I have plenty of time because I cannot follow most TV shows or movies! Great point, zippycrocodile.  We seem to have an affinity for words as a replacement for faces, but that it is *does not* correlate with age of reading.  Perhaps it is Just that when we do learn to read, it changes fundamentally  how we perceive the world, from visual imagery to conceptual descriptors. This is also super interesting. I wonder if early, self-taught readers do that because they prefer words to faces. Do you have any memories from before being able to read and were they visual? Early reader here, but never had spelling issues. I was imagining a multipart process.  (I do not know who is doing this.)  \n\nThe first would be really open ended information collection from people who identify as having face blindness.  Like tell me what your strengths and weaknesses are in this specific area, as well as mining the subreddit for previous questions.  Off the top of my head specific areas would include things like physical abilities, language, academic proficiency, aspects of identity, etc. as the person sees their ability compared to peers.\n\nThat would be compiled and streamlined to a rather long check-if-this-may-apply-to-you with the participant identifying if they are diagnosed with proso, think they have it, or think they are average with facial recognition.  I would leave of age, gender identity, and other demographic info for now.  \n\nThis rather unscientific information would be scanned for correlations with face blindness.  I assume most of them would be the result of lack of proper scientific procedure or random correlations that do not mean anything or only occur in this sample, but there might be some things that jump out as worth further (more formal) study.  Or just to talk about.\n\nI find how the brain works very interesting and it is especially fun to learn about things that relate to my personal make-up, because then I can see it more clearly, so to speak.  It is kind of like having a wound.  If it is my own injury, I can poke at it and examine it to see how it is healing, but other people usually would not want me to do that. I am a teacher (although third grade, so most of my kids come to me reading fluently) but kids struggling with reading and working very hard to sound out word phonetically for a period of time and then it suddenly clicking and coming together is how most kids learn to read.  If you have a graph it will be flat for awhile and then have big jumps up.  (Now you may have been especially stuck and then had an especially big jump compared to others.  But the jump is normal.) Unlikely. But autism may have proso, dyslexia, mutism and more as a comorbidity as well as hyperlexia. A more likely correlation. Perhapsanxiety could have a correlation too. I did not learn to read till I was six and am an excellent speller and have prosopagnosia I do not. Actually, one of my first memories is learning how to write my name! That happened at a pretty average age (4ish). But the memory is more the feeling/accomplishment of the task, not so much visual. I was also an early reader and I am a pretty bad speller! I have mild/moderate prosopagnosia. Memories, imagination, all of it unfortunately. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I can only \u201csee\u201d in my mind when I am dreaming but that is not super frequent/they are always super boring or (lame) nightmares/I cannot often remember them. It is likewise interesting because I am a very creative person but have never been able to create something more than a very vague and elementary version of whatever my aim was from nothing, v hard unless I am looking at the inspo in real time. \n\nIt is fair to mention I cannot remember if I struggled as much when I was younger than like 12 or 13 (10ish years ago) when I read a lot but I think I enjoyed word puzzles at the time. My memory is shit from fibromyalgia brain these days lol. I definitely prefer sudoku over crosswords now because I have a really hard time not mussing up the overlap from SP. Hallelujah for spell check embedded in work emails too I have not had any reading issues, always voraciously took in books as a kid.\n\nOne thing interesting to me though is that when doing some basic math, I sometimes have sounds associated with them a bit and it seems to make things very fast. Maybe some audio processing making up for visual. I also learned to read at a ridiculously early age (untaught--just picked it up from being read to) and have developmental prosopagnosia.\n\nHowever, I am actually a really good speller. I have a very strong mind's eye for words. When I hear someone speaking, I can 'see' their words, like mental subtitles. So if I know a word at all, I know how to spell it.\n\nThis is a really interesting question! I would love to see it addressed in research. Again, that is very cool, and super interesting. I read in another thread about how our dreams differ from non-prosos who dream, and was amazed at how proso's describe it with analogies and descriptions very accurately.    Also, thanks for letting me know about the crosswords, versus soduku preference.  I loved \"word find\" puzzles, where you would circle the words in a large grid of letters. I could always recognize them and \"see the words holistically so they kind of jumped out at me. That is super cool. Might be helpful sometimes. Thanks for including this. Do you tend to read words holistically? This clicking, you mentioned, where it all seems to just come together, I wonder if that might be associated with how our recognition neurons in the fusiform gyrus laterize when we learn to read and those \"reading neurons\" migrate to a different area that seems to be hard-wired for reading. Even though we have not been reading long enough that a specialized reading area should have been able to evolve.  This is the study that kind of clinched this idea for me, in association with a lot of other research: \n\nneuronsandsynapses.wordpress.com/category/fusiform-gyrus/ Ok, that an interesting theory, too! I do not know if you have ever watched Sherlock from the BBC and still on netflix. They show Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock and as sort of seeing subtitles around people like he perceived people as surrounded by words that describe them.  Not sure if that is exactly like us, but I do try to recognize people by their word descriptions in my mind. That sounds reasonable.  I teach slightly older kids, so I am really not up on the science of learning to read.  (Meaning learning to put letters together to understand stuff, typically between 4-7.  There is a lot more to it, but I am talking about the actually learning to read part itself.) Technically I still read phonetically, but I process the words so quickly it might appear holistic. \n\nMy visual memory has never been great, but not at the level of aphantasia. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn accented or stressed syllable is the one that is emphasized more/most in a word.  If I over-emphasize each syllable in turn, I can sometimes figure it out, but if I just say the word normally, I cannot tell.\n\nFor instance: Is it PRO-nounce or pro-NOUNCE?\n\nOC-ca-sion-al-ly, oc-CA-sion-al-ly, oc-ca-SION-al-ly, oc-ca-sion-AL-ly, oc-ca-sion-al-LY I have honestly never thought about it. Probably? I take in the word-shape, auto-prematch it to the most likely result, assume that, run a quick internal sense check to see if it matches, then move on to the next word, and only go back later if the followup actual-letter-check picks up some kind of discrepancy. Sounds like this is something worth researching, at the very least. I really appreciate everyone jumping in on both sides of my question. Also, helpful to realize that the spelling and reading do not seem to go together. Must be different brain areas. \n\nI am also considering that prosopagnosia is more of a symptom of many possible things, rather than a disorder in and of itself. The way each of us perceives things differently from each other, but together we consistently differ from how normal people seem to see faces as a whole. \n\nThis has been super helpful, especially in reducing my feelings of isolation.  Thank you, all. i was able to read books before i was three and also never sounded out things, still dont. i have moderately severe faceblindness. Hopping into this old thread: I tend to learn people that way too, describing them by words. There was a club I met with recently where I was new to the group, I going through the group saying people's names to make sure I remembered them, and I got someone is name mixed up with someone else, to which the guy said, \"Haha, no, that is the *other* tall white guy with glasses.\"\n\nAnd I thought, *Wow, he unintentionally summed up how I think of people until I learn to ACTUALLY recognize them after a few meetings.* (I am fairly fortunate with my faceblindness in that I CAN often eventually recognize most people, but it takes time.)\n\nTo answer your thread's question, I am told I learned to read fairly early, and I have always been an above average speller -- I have often gotten high ranks in school spelling bees, and actually even got third place in an adult citywide spelling bee. I tend to recognize words by shape, like where different letters poke above or below the \"middle ground body\" of a word and what letters seem \"pointy\" or round, altering the silhouette. (I can be pretty good at puzzling out blurred or far away words.)", "New Here, too I am 56yo female. About 6 years ago I learned that, while my ovetall IQ is 122, my ability to recognize faces was 71% and that mental retardation was 70% on that particular test. At the time I did not know that I was any different than other people. I just learned about proso 3 days ago and in a way I feel relieved that there is not only a name and explanation for it but that there are others like me.  I can recognize family faces at the very instant I see them but I cannot turn around and describe my own Dad to an artist to draw. And I cannot hold his face in my memory though I can hold an image of a physical photo of him in my mind more than his actual face.  I work in the front office of a very busy vet office and only a few of the clients do I recognize when they come in. Those few usually have a \u201cstory\u201d attached to them and that is how it seems to stick in my memory. More the story not the face. I am very interested in finding out about any type of software or App that helps us retrain our brains...as much as it is possible. Or maybe it would be better to say that it could train me to use new coping skills that include actually looking at faces as identifiers? I avoid looking at faces much less trying to discern similarities or differences in them. But I would like to learn how! Welcome! Nice to meet you!\n\nI do not know of any software or apps like what you described... maybe someone else on here does!\n\nYour experience is not unique. Every one of us who was born this way had that \"wha?\" moment when we found out that our brains worked differently. Mine was talking with a friend about how unrealistic scenes were in movies with police lineups \"Nobody could actually do that\". We got into a friendly argument about it, she called in other friends to weigh in, and I realized that something was off. Some time later, I learned about Prosopagnosia on some TV show (either Brain Games or Weird World).\n\nAnyway, if I hear of a software or app like what you described, I will remember to share it here. Thank you! I look forward to something being created for us soon!!! Hi MishIk, welcome. \n\nThinking about what you have said ... I am not going to retrain my brain because I am not sure that I can or even if I really need to. I am happy to be aware of my imperfection so I can do things to lessen its negative impact on my life. I have read and learned some g level coping skills here in this thread that help me.\n\nI would be interested/skeptical of any program that claims to retrain our brain to counteract prosopagnosia. It seems that not enough is known about the how and why of it yet and very few academics are studying it.\n\n You sound like you are close to the same level I am at.  I can remember people just fine, in terms of their life stories and every detail, but I cant recognize them out of context.  I wont recognize coworkers out of work, or even housemates on occasion, it is HIGHLY contextualy related.\n\n I have never been officially diagnosed, but I have developed coping strategies.  I recognize people more by their voices and mannerisms, and walks than anything else.  Also, since I figured this out , on new jobs or meeting new people, I straight up tell them and mention it. \"Sorry, I have some faceblindness, so it will take me longer than It should to remember you by seeing you.\"  I am at the point in my life I dont give a shit, and am happy to understand why the hell I dont know who I am talking to. That gave me a giggle. I tell my husband if somebody changes their hair I have met a new friend!  \n\nI appreciate your reply. You sound more confident than me at this point. It is so new to me I still feel quite sheepish. Though, I will have to start saying something soon or I may alienate clients at work!", "My husband just sent this to me and I just had to share! I laughed a lot. He was by my side during all 8 seasons of Game of Thrones, so he understands how confusing men with beards can be to me ", "Suddenly realized I cannot find a difference between these two HIMYM actresses and it is really bothering me After listening to an NPR review of a new show Cristin Milioti is in, I realized I just absolutely... cannot.... tell the difference between her face and that of another main character played by Alyson Hannigan when they were both on the show How I Met Your Mother.  I set up two browser tabs to do an A/B test on myself, and it is really creeping me out the extent to which I cannot find differences that my brain can latch onto.\n\n(I am trying real hard not to run afoul of Rule 4 here, so instead of making this a \"DAE\" question or linking their pictures (not hard to Google), I am making the post about how it makes me feel to discover this.)\n\nWhat is strange is I do not remember having difficulty telling them apart years ago when I was watching them on HIMYM (although I have always had trouble with faces).\n\nAt the risk of also running too close to rule #2, I want to also vent annoyance at online tests of prosopagnosia that use famous faces.  Since I also have photographic memory I do pretty well on those, but I feel it is because I am using a different part of my brain.  I am not remembering \"the face,\" I am remembering, \"the image\" (of the face).  I could just as easily be differentiating pictures of classic cars by subtle model-year differences in the placement of marker lights.\n\nIn fact my unsubstantiated personal theory is my photographic memory and unnecessary importance of details is connected to my trouble with faces.  (Perhaps I have an atypical form prosopagnosia.)  I read or heard an interview where Oliver Sacks described his face-blindness as every new angle seems like a \"different face.\"  That is how it is for me.\n\nAnd it is not limited to faces either.  So attuned to details is my memory that if I am commuting home from work and one detail is out of place - a tree cut down, building remodeled, etc., I am suddenly overcome with a feeling of \"this is not it\" i.e. that I have gotten lost, taken a wrong turn, which ironically leads to me getting lost in reality when I try to find my way back.  (As for why not just ignore that feeling - the problem is that state is indistinguishable from when I have ACTUALLY taken a wrong turn, and I am seeing things which both look familiar and unfamiliar remixed in different ways.)\n\nA similar problem happens to me with faces.  I recognize faces by the details, but then some detail might change (or I see the face from a different angle) and I am struck with a strong feeling of \"this is not the same face.\"  It makes it hard to interact socially because I am never 100% sure the person I am talking to is who I think, only at best 80-90% sure.\n\nTying this back to the original point of this post - for some reason between those two HIMYM actresses, I cannot find reliable details that both distinguish their faces for me and remain constant... To your credit, I just looked at pics of them and I never realized it but they do look similar in a way To me it is cristin milioti and Krysten Ritter. Both have confusing spellings of Kristen as their names and star in sci fi shows about obsessive former romantic partners, and their faces are just the same to me. I know krysten Ritter is tall though and cristin milioti is tiny but facially they look identical somehow. They do look a bit alike, but *years* of watching Buffy makes it so that I can recognise Alyson.  \nChristin just looks... generic. Like \"female actor\" and that is about all I could tell you about her. No idea what else she is been in.\n\n&gt;  I am not remembering \"the face,\" I am remembering, \"the image\" (of the face).\n\nEven the ones that use non-famous subjects, if you can keep the image in your mind, or even just a detail about the person (like a mole or something), then you are going to score higher on it than you should. If the problem with the tests you have been taking is the use of famous faces, then I would recommend the Cambridge prosopagnosia test. I filled in a form first in which indicated enough that testing me might be worthwhile, and then I was emailed the links for three different sections of the test. The first two sections focused on faces while the third focused of 3-d modeled cars. \n\nWith the face portions of the test the photos were likely taken specifically for the test. I have forgotten the exact details of the test, but it does have you pick out faces from a different angle than you have seen them, and even ends up obscuring the faces at some point. As for the cars, they were created using software, so they are all the exact same colour and lack number plates.\n\nSorry if anything I wrote does not make sense, it is 2am and I ought to sleep I took that and they told me I do not have faceblindness but did very poorly at identifying faces and cars. Apparently my scores indicate atomistic memory, which is common in autistics (I am diagnosed). Most NTs are holistic how they recall faces but I tend to pick a detail or two along with voice, clothing style or body mannerisms. \n\nSo I am also susceptible to not recognizing people I have known over a decade if they suddenly change facial hair, hair style, or very uncharacteristic clothing. I usually just act friendly but vague until I can tell it is really someone I know. Relating to your comments on commutes, my parents cut down the tree in front after it was hit by lightening. It is been at least 6 months but I still have a hard time recognizing their house! The tree in front was a bit like a person with a beauty mark so I have to slowly look at their cars then the house becomes apparent to me. I have driven by and only realized I am too close to the end of the street and drive back! I kind of know what you are talking about in terms of pictures.  I can remember a specific image...but the person's face does not really look like that to me, because they move around, so I cannot use that except to match the image to the same image.  I do not have a great visual memory in the first place, so if I am not really interested in a picture (say of a random famous person) I am probably not going to remember it.\n\nI score better on the Famous Faces test than others.  (Although I still completely bomb it.)  You can kind of tell the age of the photograph, plus you can look at the age of the person when they took it and their gender/race.  Plus, you can usually tell why the person is famous by how they look.  I am not really sure exactly what, but photos of actors usually look different than photos of politicians, for example.  Then you use all of that to get to a sample of who would be famous enough that everyone would recognize them in that pool and pick the most famous one.  Even if I do not know what the person looks like to start with, I can sometimes figure it out by looking at the age and style of the photo and the demographics of the person.", "Guess who  Saw this picture earlier, and even though his name was right next to it I could not for the life of me see the resemblance. \n\nIt is Mel Gibson. I had to ask my roommate who it was.  I still say that recognizing faces is some sort of black magic voodoo..... wow that is Mel? He is looking good with a beard. I had to go and look at other pictures of him and I still do not see it. This is a game I have no chance of winning. Something about the shape of the eyes and area around them. I honestly did not recognize anything else, but something about the eyes (or maybe the shape of the eyebrows) rang a bell. Took way too long to make the connection, though. Han solo with a beard!\n\nEdit: Was not even close. I was going to guess Tom Hanks. Anyone else see it? A little?\n\nMel Gibson is not even on my list of guessable people, anyway. I was about to say it looks like a weird George Clooney... Which is a very offensive way to say it o\\_O Oh, I thought it was George Lucas.", "Research study to better characterize and improve face processing in prosopagnosia Hi Prosopagnosia group! My name is Dr. Joe DeGutis and my lab has been ( We are starting two new NIH-funded prosopagnosia studies aimed at better understanding face perception and memory mechanisms underlying face recognition deficits. Specifically, we are investigating how these deficits vary amongst people with prosopagnosia (e.g., do subtypes of prosopagnosia exist?) and potential treatment approaches. We recently found that prosopagnosics have specific ( that ( and (\n\nThe first study involves an intensive \\~3-hour session of performing online face/object computer tests and questionnaires, with the goal of characterizing individual differences in face perception and memory abilities.

Thank you!", "Questions for people with Prosopagnosia Hello all,\n\nSorry if this is inappropriate or offensive in any way.  I am a want to-be writer (fiction), and a couple of years ago I stumbled upon a Cracked article about prosopagnosia and found it very interesting.  I have since started writing a book where my protagonist has it.  I have some very specific questions regarding some situations that he faces and my online research can only get me so far.  I was hoping to be able to exchange emails/messages with someone that I can model my character after.\n\nAlternatively, I can post the questions here for for anybody/everybody to respond to.\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide. Pretty much everybody here is comfortable answering questions publicly asked. Many of the members of this subreddit are the significant others of people with Prosopagnosia, but there are still many people here who have it themselves. Ask away.  I am happy to answer questions, publicly or privately. Happy to help\\~ I would love to see a book like that so ask away \\^.\\^ Ditto I would be happy to answer any questions as well. I am sure we can all pitch in. Prosopagnosia is not the same for everybody as well, there is varying degrees!  Ask publicly!  I am curious to hear how other people answer.  I have a pretty mild version of this I think and like hearing how wide the spectrum is. I agree with most of the comments. Asking publicly might help you more! I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. There is quite the spectrum, so you should get a good sample. I would be happy to answer publicly or privately.  Happy to answer, publicly or privately. You guys are awesome - thank you for the replies and the willingness to be open and help me out.\n\nSince a lot of you have asked, I am going to post the questions here.  For those that volunteered to help me out privately, I may try to get in touch with more detailed questions, or questions that arise from the answers I get here.  So, on to my questions.  I apologize if some of these are obvious:\n\n1) I understand that some with prosopagnosia do not recognize their own face.  So what happens when you (A) purposely look in the mirror and (B) just pass a mirror in a store or something?  What I mean by what happens is what sort of emotions/feelings do you get?  Like, if you are home and go to the bathroom and look in the mirror I assume you know it is you if you are out in public or at a bar and glance in the mirror?  I would imagine that it can be disconcerting, at least for a brief period.\n\n2) I know that people with prosopagnosia use other means of identifying people - facial hair, gait, voice, etc.  Would smell be one?  Like if someone always wore the same perfume or cologne, would that help you identify them?\n\n3) How often do you use \"temporary\" clues to help identify someone, and what are those?  For example, suppose meeting a group of people in a restaurant or bar.  You talk to a few people, then leave to use the restroom.  When you come back, there is one specific person you want to talk to - how would you recognize that person?   Would it be something like \"tall, beard, red shirt, jeans with holes in the knees\"?  \n\n4) Related to 3) above, do you think that in general, you pay more attention to details than an average person?  Not just in people, but overall?\n\n5) Regarding the clues you use to identify someone - I imagine that they have a short \"shelf life\" since people can change pretty quickly.  How long are you comfortable going between seeing someone and still feel like you will not have an issue picking them out if you are meeting at a bar or restaurant?  If you are on the phone with a friend and are planning on meeting someplace, will you ask them what they will be wearing, where they will be sitting (specifically), etc.?\n\n6)  Do you find people physically attractive or unattractive?  Or does everyone sort of look the same?\n\n7)  When I think of someone close to me - my wife, my mom, my brother - I have very clear pictures of them in my head.  Not just of how they look now, but how they have looked throughout the years.  If I think of a specific event in my life that involved my mom, for instance, I can picture what she looked like at that point.  When you think of someone close, what do you picture?  And is it always the same, or does it change?\n\nI think that is it for now.  Thanks again for helping me out. Okay, here goes. \n\n1. A. When I look in the mirror purposefully I am expecting to see myself, so I know it is my face I am looking at. Usually I do not like looking in mirrors unless I have a reason to, because it is weird to look at myself. Also, I know what to look for in my reflection, like my nose or glasses or bags under my eyes.\nB. When I pass full-body mirrors at stores, I recognize my body shape and go \"whoa that person looks like someone I know-oh, it is me, whoops\"\n\n\n2. I have a good olfactory memory, so I do have a compendium of smells in my mind. The problem with that is that I do not have a good reason to be so close to a random person that I can smell them, so this only works with people I am close to and already recognized before smelling them.\n\n3. I work at a mall restaurant, and sometimes I have to go look for a costumer in the crowd who forgot about their food for 20 mins, and I use those small identifiers. \"Looking for number 30,she had a shirt with japanese written on it.\" or blonde with very bright orange glasses or a 70s porn mustache.\n\n4. I do not pay attention to more details than the average person. I have no odea what you were wearing yesterday or if you tried on new makeup. I do notice when I know it is important to remember you, or when you have an obviously identifying thing. Like a mole or scars or something out of the ordinary. Makes perfectly symmetrical people very hard to tell apart!\n\n5. Well, things in the face have a short \"shelf life\", like facial hair or hair or makeup or wrinkles, but I memorize different things about people as I socialize with them more. The body shape is a big one for me, because every person is very unique in body shape, and it makes them easy-ish to spot in a crowd. Of coursw, knowing exactly where to look for friends is very helpful, and they know to wave at me or I will think it is not them and keep looking. How long it takes to recognize someone depends on the person, really. If they have a very \"them\" thing about them, it will be a shorter while than if you have a perfectly average face/body type.\n\n6. Everyone pretty much looks the same. I see a group of people passing by as a flock and not individuals. But, if you point someone out to me, or if I am bored and people-watching, then I can \"evaluate\" them in terms of attractiveness. I have no idea what attractiveness looks like to me, I go on a case by case thing, if they are pretty they will struck my chords.\n\n7. When I reimagine memories, I see people with a sketchy face, like a blank face with that reference cross drawn on it. If I try hard enough, or if it was important to the memory, I will remember their look or other parts of their face. I will always see their body as it was, though, and other details like their voice and smell will be there. Just... Not the face. I know my mom did not have as many grey hairs when I was a kid, and I know that my sister's face used to have the tiniest bit of acne, then it was very smooth and pretty, then it started to gain little wrinkles from smiling and frowning and age. I remember my deceased dad's eyes very well, as well as his lips when he was relaxed, and his teeth when he laughed. But I do not know what their faces look like as a whole.\n\n\nDang, that was long. Hope it was helpful. It was really cool to answer these! Good luck with your book :)  Mirroring what others have said, if you post here or PM me on Reddit, I would be happy to share some info! 1.\tThe few times I have looked closely in a mirror at my own reflection it is a bit of a distancing act. My mirror pep talks are usually directed towards the nebulous \u201cotherness\u201d of the figure in the mirror. I know its me, but I cannot help treat the reflection as distinct from my own experience, if that makes sense.\n\n2.\tThat would be a good one, but it requires fairly close contact. It is far easier for me to recognize people based on hair, gait, and clothing style, in that order. But if the smell is distinctive enough it is a strong indicator. Smell is actually processed by the lambic system, which also deals with emotions and memory formation. It is why a unique smell can really drag you back to a strong memory from long ago.\n\n3.\tI guess it is largely a relative thing. In a small group setting, temporary clues are everything. There is always something that stands out on some metric for everyone. One person is the tallest, one has the bluest top, another is the most energetic of the bunch, etc. So long as the group remains static, it is not to hard to keep everyone in order. But those \u201ctemporary\u201d clues never stop being important. They are used in combination with \u201cpermanent\u201d clues (age, race, gender, etc) to confirm and update my understanding of a person\u2019s appearance. Eventually, years and years of this feedback loop gives me an intricate and deep map of the person\u2019s overall presentation, and the likelihood that I will be able to recognize them shoots up.\n\n4.\tNot really, I actually think I pay *less* attention than most people. I am not going to recognize them anyway, so why bother? I keep a very, very basic description (like race or gender) of people with whom I am interacting in my working memory and clear it out soon after the interaction is over.\n\n5.\tThere is no standard \u201chalf life\u201d of identifying memory. I will recognize my parents or sister anywhere, even after not having seen them in months. But I once confused one of my best friends\u2014a tall, thin, white girl with Italian heritage\u2014with a short and plump Asian woman. That was one of my all-time classics. But I will NEVER ask anyone for identifying information to help me. I have too much damn pride for that. I just trust my ability to accurately assess people\u2019s body language and go \u201chunt\u201d for the people I know; basically I walk through the crowd looking for classic signs of recognition without making eye contact with anyone. The jump of recognition lets me find a friend, and the lack of eye contact gives me plausible deniability if I fail to recognize them.\n\n6.\tActually, not really. I can generally get some feeling if a person looks nice or horrifically ugly, but nothing much beyond that. I can appreciate that one of my female friends (who was recruited as a model for a model for a few years) is really pretty. But I almost never appreciate very attractive people in Hollywood or real life.\n\n7.\tI do not really picture anything. I tend to just remember the way the person makes me feel. If I really try I can hold a brief image of the person in my head, but the harder I try to refine my mental picture of someone the more my brain focuses on specific features at the expense of the whole and the image begins to distort. Broad smiles become obscene, long hair becomes an overpowering brush, etc. It is kind of trippy, tbh.\n\n\nNote: Some of my experiences might be distorted by the fact that I also have schizoid personality disorder. I derive very little emotional reactions from my interactions with others, which I feel is integral to how most people come to recognize strangers. Most of the adaptations I have developed are with the aim of distancing me from others without standing out in any particular way. So my experiences may differ a bit from other people you might hear from\n\nGood luck on your book! If you are interested I would be happy to explain or answer more questions. 1. I once caught a glimpse of myself in a reflection, felt a great deal of affection and identified myself as my younger brother! I always have to double check if it is me in a public bathroom mirror but generally do not look into mirrors because of the feeling of mild surprise is disconcerting on a few different levels. Sometimes I look and it is meh while other times I am panicking asking is that really me?\n\n2. I remember people I have not seen for a long while by the feelings I get as I look at a person who seems to know me and does not know why I do not know them.  If they do not say their name and wander off hurt, I wonder about who they are until I figure it out, it takes months and years sometimes. In the short term I just try to keep in regular contact with my friends and remember something about them that clues me in. It is always something different, sometimes their car, but I have learned not to identify women by their hair. Perfume has never been too helpful to me but if someone gives me a hug before I know who they are something about their natural smell helps me identify them. \n\n3. In a bar situation, if I go to the bathroom I come back hoping no one has moved from where they were when I left so I do not have to panic. \n\n4. My job is dependant on attention to detail and I love what I do. I am known for noticing a lot of things that others do not. It is frustrating that I cannot keep track of faces.\n\n5. Weeks. If I am on the phone setting up a meeting with a friend I will try to figure out what they are wearing and look for the person who seems happy to see me. It is stressful. As I get to know people I learn that they always carry the same purse, or always wear certain jackets in certain weather so try to find the thing that is likely going to be constant and be alert to changes. If I have a picture on my phone I can recognize people, as long as they are in the same clothing and using the same facial expression.\n\n6. I find that so few people are completely unattractive, almost everyone has something beautiful about their physical appearance. I love people and am mostly interested in how they are, and do not judge their appearance. \n\n7.  When I think of my longtime husband I think in feelings, I do not picture him at all and every morning I feel mildly pleasantly surprised by his appearance. When I remember our life I picture us the way we are now doing what we did then.  \n\nThank you for the questions and good luck with your book!\n\n\n The questions I asked already were taken from my notes, but as I get responses and move along with the story, I am sure I am going to have additional questions - when I do, I am going to come here &amp; post them.  A few more that came to mind overnight:\n\n8) Do you purposely avoid situations where their will be a lot of unknown people?  Thinking of my company Christmas party, for example - seeing people that work in different divisions but I only see them once a year, or spouses/dates of co-workers.  I would imagine that would be tough.  If so, do you actively avoid these, or just on certain occasions?\n\n9) This is a big one, and I cannot believe I skipped it originally: how do you feel about your condition?  Is it that, a condition to live with?  Or is it more/less?  Do any of you consider it a disability?  Is it a nuisance or more?  On the flip side, are there any benefits/positives to having it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks again!    8. I do not avoid events with many people but I can certainly create complete havoc in my life by doing so if I run into someone I know and ruin their day. This makes it hard to force myself to go to things sometimes and when I do get to my destination I am anxious. At the end of the event I leave as quickly as possible. Company Christmas parties are the best because I can identify people more quickly, figure out how to identify them for the rest of the party and make fewer recognition mistakes throughout. Sometimes something about their date becomes my cue.\n\n9. It is terrible. Without meaning to I can hurt the feelings of people I love just by going to the mall by myself. Some people conclude I am mentally ill or deficient, other times I have been labeled a snob, many people I have shared years of friendship with will not even talk to me any more. I am constantly having to apologize and trying to explain myself and more often than not my apologies and explanations are not accepted I think because of how long it takes me to match the face to the person. This gives me low level, constant grief and I am often asked why I look sad. It is like a disability because if I always have someone with me who can remind me of who people are I do okay and present myself as I truly am. \n\nThere are not any positives. I did not even know I had this problem until I reached middle age, had been away from my hometown for a few years and then came back by myself. It was as if a nuclear bomb had gone off and vaporized everyone I used to know. No matter where I went I could not find a familiar face. I started getting paranoid because every once in a while a complete stranger would say something to me and acted like they knew me so I started keeping my head down. Then I started encountering strangers who looked and acted deeply hurt by me. If they told me their name their face would confuse me and it would take a while to remember who they are. It slowly started to dawn on me that my recognition problems extend to people I love and have known for ages, not just people I have not seen in a while who are distant friends of the family.  Now I try to explain when I meet a new person that I do have facial recognition problems and just hope I do not lose another potential friend. Looking back I can see I have had this problem all my life and that I have hurt many good people. \n\n Good luck with your writing.  Here is what I can contribute.\n1) I can generally recognize myself in a mirror, but it may take a moment.  I do not love mirrors in general, but I also usually know where they are.  I am sure I sometimes miss a mirror and see my reflection without noticing, but it does not worry me too much. \n In non-social situations (like airports) I do not pay much attention to other people in general.  I do specifically remember being in one of those god awful hotel ballrooms with a mirrored wall.  It was 25 years ago and I still remember how it took me by surprise.  At the time, though, I did not have the words for face blindness.  It was simply uncanny.\n2) I can recognize people by odor, but I do not usually stand close enough to someone for that to be a factor.  It is far too intimate.  I could ID my husband in a dark room with 20 other people in it, though.\n3) I have learned a neat trick recently.  For work, I am often in a room with 5-8 strangers over the course of a few days.  After we exchange business cards I lay them out on the table in front of me in the order that people are sitting.  When people leave the room they usually sit down in the same place at the conference table because their laptop and papers are already there, or just through habit and territoriality.  I expect that people who are bad with names do the same.\nOther short term cues would be clothing or distinctive features.  Fortunately, I have a really good memory for details.  If I know that I will need to identify someone short term, say, over the course of a few days for a series of business meetings, I will just memorize haircuts, distinctive features, and makeup.\n4)  Absolutely yes.  I work as an auditor, by the way.  Details are my paycheck.\n5)  This is going to be highly variable.  I really do not feel confident about meeting people out of context. \n Or even sometimes, with context.  Here are a couple of examples on both extremes.\na) I was at the transit station on my way home from work when I noticed a really attractive, well dressed young man sitting at the bus bay.  I thought, \"damn, that is a good looking guy,\" and was startled a few moments later when I realized that it was my boyfriend of 5 years.  He was at the bus stop because he was going home to the apartment we shared, but our commute schedules NEVER overlapped.   I simply was not expecting to see him.\nb) I had not seen my brother in several years and he made plans to visit me.  He also brought along two of his friends because they wanted to see the city where I was living.  I knew he was going to knock on my door, but when they arrived, I did not immediately recognize which one was my brother until he spoke.  They were all tall, white 20-something guys.  Short brown hair.  Totally generic non-ugly but not particularly attractive either.  The really embarrassing part?  The two friends were identical twins.   \n6)  Absolutely.  And apparently, I am pretty consistent in my taste (see anecdote 5.a, lol).  I do find individual features like noses or eyebrows or upper lips attractive without regard to the entire face.  Maybe that is not normal.\n7)  Sort of, but not really.  I have memories, but they are more like a photograph of a photograph.  They are very static - and to be honest, they are probably based on a photo that I saw once and can recall.  People also look completely different to me from different angles, or if they have a weird or atypical expression on their face.  The experience of memory is more like the experience of a moment frozen in time.  It is difficult to bring up a memory of a face.  Without a reference photo, sometimes it is just an assemblage a features that I have a hard time connecting. 8)  Absolutely I do.  Socializing in general is very tiresome for me.  I have mentioned my job before, but it is sort of a big deal for me because I am required to travel to other companies and meet with strangers for one or two days.  That is sort of a huge challenge.\n\n9) It feels like other people have a superpower that no one talks about.  That no one tells you about.  It is something that is not very relatable to most people. \n\nI guess the only positive is that I am really good at describing people.  That is sort of funny, really.  For example, I have a new coworker and she is still getting to know people in the other departments.  When she asks \"which guy is Steve?\" I can usually give her a pretty good description of hair/body/where he sits in the office or who he usually socializes with. 6. Yes, I find people attractive and unattractive.  But I would struggle to remember what they looked like afterwards and would not recognise them until after a few meetings, unless they had a particularly distinctive feature/s.\n\n7. If I try to picture someone, I will picture a photograph of them.  If I try thinking of a specific memory I will remember the scene and possibly voices/sounds, but not the faces of the people there. The faces are sort of...blurred.  \n\n8. I try to avoid that sort of thing, but that is just because I hate enforced \"fun\".  :-p What used to be more nerve-wracking was meeting up with friends, like meeting a newish acquaintance for a gig or something.  Now I just warn new people I am face-blind and it feels much less awkward.  \n\n9. I do not mind.  I was happy to find out face blindness was an actual \"thing\" with a proper name (I was around 30, friend played 999 - which, incidentally, is a TERRIBLE depiction of prosopagnosia).  Like most people, I have developed coping mechanisms to get by with only sometimes appearing spacey and I do not feel it is hindered me in any way; I definitely do not think it is a disability.\n\nIt means that things like the Thatcher effect do not affect me, and I seem to be better than most people at recognising people by their gait/voice/whatever.  Also seem better at recognising animals I have met and telling characters apart in manga/anime/cartoons.  \n\n Prosopagnosia is different for everyone, but here are my experiences.\n\n1. I almost always know it is me, because I am expecting it to be me, because I know I am looking in a mirror.  I have had that, \"who is that guy?\" experience more than once though when looking into a mirror that I did not know was there.   \n2. Smell could absolutely help me recognize someone.  Usually you hear a voice first, though, and that is helpful.  I recognized someone from their bad breath once though.\n3. Shirt color.  I use that A LOT.  Facial hair or a hat is a dead give-away.  If neither of those are any help, shirt color.\n4. It is really hard to answer that.  If I am in a situation where I am supposed to remember people, I am on high alert.  Other than that I have always assumed I paid attention worse than other people.  That may just be a result of the guilt I have felt most of my life for not recognizing people and not knowing why.\n5. I suspect my form is milder than many others as I will occasionally recognize (might not be the right word...not sure if I am really recognizing them or just quickly figuring out who they are) people if they are in the context I was expecting to find them.  So if I know someone really well and they are are in the place I expected to see them I may know who they are.  Other than that I am really good at reading micro-expressions so I may see recognition on their face and figure it out.  I usually go places with my wife though, and when I do, I always wait for her to make the first moves.  It is genuinely terrifying and embarrassing when I bump into someone I should know and I see them recognize me and I have to quick figure stuff out based on the conversation.  I have has some really embarrasing conversations where I made a mistaken ID and just carried on the conversation.  I also find that when I really am trying to memorize an individual, I do better if I memorize the silhouette of their head, shoulders, and upper torso.  Recently I introduced myself to a girl I have known for three years and it was embarrassing enough that I really tried to impress her on my memory.  Thinking back now, I just get a shape with big hair, kind of big shoulders, medium torso.  I can see those features in my mind. It is almost like I can remember the space they took up, but not them.\n6. That is an excellent question.  I absolutely see attractiveness or otherwise in other people.  How strange.  I have never thought about it.  I see a face as a face, I just have a really hard time remembering it the second I look away.\n7. This is the hardest thing to make sensible to another person.  I can honestly tell you I cannot picture my parents faces right now.  I can describe them.  I could tell you my dad is bald with a ruddy complexion and...um...a nose.  I cannot call up a picture of him, though.  I started to say it was like how in a dream you do not really see anyone's face but you just know who they are...but I just now am realizing that might not be universal.  \n\nAgain, for others it might be different, but for me recognition is not so cut and dry.  You know how supposedly we all have a huge blank spot in our vision but our brain fills it in with what it expects to see?  You know how you are hearing 20 different sounds at this moment, but your brain really typically passes on the ones that matter?  Brains do a lot with what they have and I really cannot tell the difference between recognizing someone, and just quickly figuring out who they are.  When I finally know who someone is, I look at their features and it is like \"of course that is who they are!\".  I completely recognize them.  But once their appearance gets reset I am confused again.  Brains are weird.   \n\n8) I think I do purposely avoid situations where  their will be a lot of unknown people.  I did not realize why I hated big groups for most of my life because I did not know anything about prosopagnosia.   I secretly thought I was really dumb in a very specific way, or just self involved.  Even though I now know better, I still carry a lot of embarrassment and surprisingly, a lot of guilt for not recognizing people.  I really try to dissuade my wife from inviting more that 5 or 6 people over for any event.  I did not put all together until later in life.  \n\n9) I would not call it a disability, but it does suck, because no matter what you tell people they just are not going to understand it.  I only recently have told a few people about it and I almost always regret it.  I was recently told, \"that is a made up disease from a TV show, you do not have that.\"  I get it.  \"I see faces, but I do not actually recognize them\" is a nonsensical sounding statement.  I am always learning things about it, though.  I am really good at catching and reading micro-expressions...like scary good.  Like, I have-been-accused-of-mind-readingly good.  I kind of assumed that this might be a commonality among people with this condition.  I figured, if you are not seeing the face as such, maybe you are not distracted from the little things the face is communicating.  From what I am reading,though, this is not necessarily true. I am a pretty empathetic and intuitive person otherwise, so maybe it has nothing to do with the condition.  If that is truly unrelated than I cannot think of much of an up-side.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the way, feel free to PM me anytime about it.  It is not often you can really discuss this with folks because they just do not get it. Interesting you say that about photographs.  I can come much closer to picturing a photo of someone than I can of actually picturing them.  I have wondered if others experienced that as well. Funny to hear you say that about your boyfriend.  I almost always know who my wife is, but there have been a few occasions where I have been checking out a girl I thought was kind of hot, only to realize after a minute it was my wife in a spot I did not expect her.   1 A) When I look in the mirror and know that that is what I am doing, I immediately identify myself because of what I am wearing, my hair, my freckles, etc. I am looking for it, and expecting it, so I inherently know that it is me even if I do not recognise my face. \nB) Once I actually approached myself in a store mirror because I looked confused and lost, and since I was confused and lost and this \u2018other person\u2019 looked the same, I thought we might be able to help each other. I realised before hitting the mirror, but not before being giggled at by another lady. It really depends on what I am reading from myself at the time. I am rather expressionless, so as a result other people tend to read what they are feeling in my expressions, and that is what I do, too. If I am scared, I will see a scared woman and I would likely still feel scared but somewhat comforted that I am not alone. If I am happy, I will see a happy woman. It is not THAT disconcerting because I am also rather generic in shape, size and colouring for my geographical area. I look like everyone else, to me. The only clues I have is what I am wearing. I generally dress a little quirky (perhaps as a need to identify myself? Who knows), but if I have just finished work, I am like every other woman working in an office.\n\nAs an anecdote; I recognise my smile, because of my teeth. So, expected or unexpected, if I am smiling, I will recognise myself.\n\n2 I generally do not rely on smell because that sometimes involves sniffing people which could be weird. However, for some reason, I have got my mum identified by smell. She does not wear perfume, and it is not the smell of sweat or anything like that. It just smells like \u2018mum\u2019 when I think of it, and it is a unique smell that I have only ever smelt from her and her bed. Sometimes I can smell her scent if she is lingered at her desk chair or something for a few hours, too. Smells are important to me, but personally I do not tend to use them as the sole basis of identifying someone (except for the example of my mum).\n\n3 I try not to use temporary markers, but will if I must. I tend to rely on hairstyles because they are unlikely to change rapidly in the space of a couple of minutes/hours/days. But yes, my description is usually something like \u2018male, taller than me, thin, pale, freckles, etc\u2019 or I may focus on an outfit if it is particularly eye-catching in that moment - like at work, if someone is wearing a green suit when everyone else is wearing blue or black, or if someone is wearing a certain necklace, etc.\n\n4 My strongest basis for comparison is my best friend and my family, who all admit to occasionally not noticing little things. I am generally hyper aware, but I do not know if that is because of my face blindness or because of some personality trait. I have met people without face blindness that appear to be just as observant.\n\n5 This is a little more complicated. I tend to attract myself to people with more stable characteristics, like scars, moles, an odd cluster of freckles, a disability, etc. Even a distant uni friend of mine is likely forever recognisable to me by her odd walk because her calf muscles are poorly developed. I also tend to recognise people by their walk and their voice, meaning that I am better at recognising them the further they are from me. I will recognise people from all kinds of things - including recognising my best friend by her collar bones. To the point where I felt she looked very similar to another woman who had similar collar bones (but in reality looked 0 like her - they were not even the same race). Despite being able to recognise people from disabilities, I cannot always recognise people because of their race. What I mean is, some times even if it is \u2018obvious\u2019 that someone is Chinese, for example, if they are pale enough I might \u2018tag\u2019 them as white. If a white person tans very dark when in the sun too long, I might \u2018tag\u2019 them as black, or mixed race. The most awkward time I did this was at uni, when I realised that my friend was Chinese for the first time. She had introduced herself with her Western name and she had spent the previous year in England so she sounded pretty British to me. She was also quite pale, so I just thought she was white. It does not mean much to me, because beyond generally having pale skin, I do not know what being white looks like, but it got awkward when I was trying to find her and described her as white. The person trying to help me was REALLY confused when we eventually found her, and she corrected my mistake. Anyway, people are rarely so perfectly average that they have nothing long-term to stick to. Celebrities are a mystery to me, however. They are all pretty much one of five people, to me. So, if I am meeting a friend, they tend to have something I can pick them by. I cannot think of an instance where they have not. Furthermore, people tend to pull a certain expression when they recognise someone they know. This is what I look for whenever I lock eyes with someone.\n\n6 I do not find faces very attractive, no. Bodies, I have preferences, but not faces. I have recently discovered that I struggle to recognise the differences between a male and female face (and have to rely on assumptions, like make up = female, facial hair = male kind of stuff), so that might be the driving force. I do like eyes, however, but I like all eyes. I find eyes stunning and usually use them as an identifier too. Not EVERYONE looks the same to me, but basically all brunettes with a \u2018masculine\u2019 face will look the same, all light-toned people will look the same, or at least alike, etc, so it is a bit boring. I am more interested in unique features, which would likely be \u2018unattractive\u2019 to others, like gummy smiles, crooked teeth, facial scar, etc.\n\n7 I actually struggle to picture anything, which i assume is related to a mild case of aphanasia as well. However, if I imagine something with my eyes open, it is a little easier to picture, but it is more like outlined shadows than anything of substance. I instinctively recognise people, however. If I \u2018imagine\u2019 my mum, it is more like an after image, a vague imprint of what her basic shape looks like now. Never what she looked like before. It changes whenever she does, so with haircuts and whatnot. But I will know that I am trying to picture my mum, and I will know that she is doing whatever I am imagining her to be doing. This is the same for anything, including celebrities and my animals. I will remember sounds, and smells flawlessly, however, as well as an emotional \u2018map\u2019 of how I feel when I am around them. I do not know why, but it always seems more important to me to remember how they made me feel, Whilst all other features may eventually be forgotten.\n\nGood luck! And if you have any other questions, I do not mind answering. Hope I was not too late for you. 8 No. I am an introvert, so social situations do drain me, but I do not avoid them because of my face blindness, I generally avoid them because I cannot be bothered associating with people at that moment. When among groups of strangers, I do not feel pressured into recognising them, so I am a little more comforted. \n\n9 I consider it a nuisance, but not a disability (though I suppose technically it very much is). I have other conditions that I feel are more problematic than not recognising what people look like. I only recently learned of this condition, and honestly it is only helped me understand myself. Would I give t up if I could? 100% Sometimes the reality hits a bit, and I realise that I will not be able to recognise people if I see them in an accident on TV, or if I had to pick up a loved one, I might not recognise them. I cannot recognise my own mum, and could not even when I was a child. Passing this condition on is something that I would not consider doing, either. My mum struggles with recognising faces, though she is faaaaaar better than I am, but I still experienced some of the problems that came with having your parent not recognise who you are. It was only worse when coupled with the fact that I can always recognise her, too. It is sad. It is just very, very sad. I could not do that to myself or my kid, because it fucking sucked. \n\nPositives... I am very good at recognising people from far away. VERY good. I will recognise you coming over the horizon before you recognise me. Another positive is that when I met my idol, I did not go all weird or fangirl because I could not recognise her until after we had a good conversation! I wanted to make sure to thank everyone again for their willingness to help me, and for sharing some pretty intimate and personal details of the condition.    I cannot begin to describe how helpful this will be, not only in gaining a better understanding of prosopagnosia in general but how someone might react in different situations they will encounter in my book.  I am going to be able to use a lot of what was shared for my character.\n\nAs I get further along in my writing, I may come back here to ask some more specific questions.  \n\nThanks again!\n\n&amp;#x200B; 1- Not an issue for me;\n2- I use smell hints all the time but I just realize I do it with the question you asked; usually people do not change smell;\n3- same as others : clothes, hair etc\n4- sure am good at details but I have to pay attention\n5- long time clues I use : teeth; ears, hands, very helpful\n6- no people do not all look the same, I can see good looking ones. For the first about 5 years with my husband I was every time happy to see how beautiful my man is every time I see him after a short time, like a new one.\n7- when I close my eyes I do not remember any faces, not even mine\n\nSorry for my English not really good. Hey I just found this sub but in case it is useful:\n\n1. It is not really emotional. The other day I thought someone was coming towards me and it was my reflection in a mirror, and I just found it funny. Mildly embarrassing if someone catches you. I am bi and sometimes I find my reflection attractive in a way I do not think straight non-prospagnosics would.\n\n2. Smell could be, but visuals are easier to spot across a room. I do not recall any time I have associated a person with a smell. Maybe they are not distinctive enough.\n\n3. Exactly, this is spot on.\n\n4. Maybe?\n\n5. I hate meeting people at a restaurant. I want to ask friends where they will be sitting, but either I am too anxious to ask or I get something vague like \"on the right\". I use facts to rule out groups (wrong amount of people?) or suggest possible groups (someone tall enough to be my friend?) and then catch their eyes until someone reacts like they know me. Time does not make a huge difference, except for similarity of hairstyle or clothes.\n\n6. People are definitely attractive or unattractive, and the same person can be more/less attractive in different clothes/lighting/make up etc. \n\n7. I cannot really picture faces, I would imagine someone with their body shape and hairstyle.\n\n8. Sometimes, yes. It is quite anxiety provoking. I generally try to act genial and friendly so that it does not matter whether I knew the person before.\n\n9. It is a big nuisance. It makes you anxious about ordinary events. It is definitely awkward socially and it can make you seem unfriendly, which is terrible for your career. That is probably the thing I hate most, that I cannot do networking properly and that I am missing out on knowing who each person is and building those crucial relationships. It is frustrating for watching movies, since all the young white men with short brown hair look the same. I genuinely feel sad each Christmas when my friends are talking about Love Actually, because that is something I will never be able to properly experience. On the plus side, I once stumbled into a relationship when someone started talking to me, I did not know if I already knew them so I was friendly, they took this as a sign of interest and were friendly back, I thought they must be a good friend of mine and we kept chatting.

Chidi is the only one who I realized what was up but everyone else it just looks like they used warp and shrink tool on photoshop reallt badly (ie just on the face not on the hair or neck). They took their faces and put a filter on them so they are still their own faces. But they have shrunk them a bit to look like kid faces.

Sounds like a slightly milder version of what I have: prosopagnosia.  People all look the same to me, except faces that are radically different.  Those are fascinating, endlessly fascinating, because they are so unique.  I cannot recall them to my mind's eye, though. \n\nCan you picture a thing, like your favorite mug or pen or whatever?  Clearly?  Now try doing the same thing with a face you \"should\" know.  Is it different? This sounds very similar to me.  I just cannot remember faces very well.  If someone has a very distinctive feature I might remember that feature, but I mostly cannot picture or visualize faces.  If I am around someone ling enough and often enough I will eventually be able to recognition them, but it tends to take much longer than most others.  Even those I eventually learn to recognize I cannot really visualize.  Faces in my mind\u2019s eye are kind of a fuzzy blur with maybe a hair colour or style or a distinct piercing thrown in there. &gt;Sounds like a slightly milder version of what I have: prosopagnosia\n\nReally?

I wear glasses, and can recognize myself, and that is it. bruh this is crazy i just found out about prosopagnosia today i thought i was the only one Welcome!  Here is a phrase I have found useful: \"I am faceblind.  Where have we met before?\" I can only recognize my hair and how depressed I look. It sucks. Sometimes I get depersonalization or someshit and I do not recognize myself in the mirror but on average, I know what I look like. Unfortunately. I can tell it is me in a recent photo, but in older ones I really need context clues or process of elimination. I dyed my hair purple and am taller than 92% of the people on earth. (Not sure of that statistic, I will come back and edit if necessary.) This helps me identify myself in pictures. I can remember what I look like in so far as I couch it in language: I have long blonde hair that goes to my butt, I have got glasses that are slightly too big for my eyes but not too big, and people say I have got an impressively large nose. There is also a couple small divots near my ears where my bone conductors are almost implanted, to the degree that my head feels wrong if I take them off. My eyes are sorta green. I have twenty-eight teeth remaining, and I have lips.\n\nAside from that, I have absolutely no idea. And it is really goddamn weird. I feel like a look like a lot of different people.  Kind of like I have more than one face.  I know what all the me's look like though.\n\nI occasionally have trouble identifying if it is me or a family member in photos.  Not often, but not rarely.  That part is kind of weird to me. i am the complete opposite i feel like no one looks like me I could probably tell if it was me in a photo. Maybe.\n\nI actually drew myself once, in charcoals. It was obviously me, but even after having drawn all my own features, I could not have sat down and done it again without a mirror. It takes me a few days to recognise myself in the mirror if I have my hair cut. I can recognise myself in photos if they are familiar and I know I am there, eg the ones I keep in the house, but not in other photos. I have blue eyes, long brown hair and a nose that has been broken.\n\nUm. \n\nYeah that is it.\n\nShit like this makes me nervous if I ever have to do a police sketch. \n\n\n\"Well officer, they had hair and eyebrows.\"\n\n\"Can you be more specific?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately no.\" Kind of?  I hate seeing myself in photos because it gives me a weird feeling of disconnect (and because I never look good...), but seeing myself in the mirror does not bother me nearly as much.\n\nThat said, I can kind of remember what my school photo that my parents display looks like, so I concentrate on that image if I need to recall my own face without looking in a mirror.  I could not describe it beyond a few very obvious features, though. That reminds me of when I was supposed to meet someone I only knew from online in a restaurant. I said, \"I am face blind and will not be able to know who you are.\"\n\nShe said, \"Oh, you will recognize me.\"\n\nI felt a little frustrated and said, \"No, you do not understand, I have trouble remembering faces.\"\n\nAnd she said, \"Trust me, that will not be a problem. You will definitely know it is me.\"\n\nExasperated, I said, \"How?\"\n\nShe laughed and said, \"I am 4'8\"!\"\n\nI knew it was her the minute I saw her! I tried making myself in The Sims, and besides the obvious things like body shape, eye colour, hair colour, I had no idea about eye shape or position, nose type, mouth shape, or any of the other details. That is convenient.  At least I think so.  Fortunately I am unique enough looking that I do not confuse myself with random people, just family members with very similar features and coloring. I do not have epicanthic folds and that is all I got. I do the same thing. If I am meeting someone in a professional environment who I know I will see again I just lay it out. \"Hi, I am faceblind, I may not recognise you next time we meet. Please just come up to me and remind me who you are.\" I still get shocked whenever I change my hairstyle, cut my hair, or change my makeup. \nEven when I see myself in pictures is weird because I do not feel like that is me. \nI always feel like my appearance changes a lot, but people say I look the same.\nIT SUCKS I do not have a clue as well. I cannot recognize myself in group photos, I sometimes do not get that I see my reflection and not another person when I look in a windowpane... I kind of know what my hair looks like and I know that I wear glasses but apart from that, I am clueless. Nope. I can recognize myself in a mirror when I know I am in front of one. I absolutely hate pictures of myself, primarily because its just overwhelming. I rarely actually recognize myself, especially if the photos are more than 5 years old. I cant picture my face but I sort of know what I look like. I mean I know I am very pale and have a mole on my neck and thin eyebrows and hazel eyes and attached earlobes. But that is how I remember everyone else anyways. I memorize specific features about people. So I tend to know whether a persons earlobe is detached or not and what piercings they have and any birthmarks lol. Distinct wrinkles also help. Probably would creep people out a bit if they knew that is what I look for on them. Actually I should add I cant recognize myself in photos very well. If someone even looks slightly similar it could be me for all I know \ud83d\ude02 I know who I am when I look in the mirror or take a picture of just myself but I have a hard time figuring out who I am in group photos and videos unless I recognize my clothes or nobody else in the picture physically resembles me", "From the 60 Minutes Archive: Face Blindness  This came up in my YouTube feed. I remember seeing it in 2012. It is interesting to see how many people do not use any tricks to \"recognize\" people, and how many people use the same tricks I do. (And my heart breaks for the little boy, because I do not think they are teaching him helpful coping strategies.)\n\nThought other people might be interested, if you have not already seen it.", "The moment you knew for sure? So, being mildly or developmentally face blind is funny, because you are not sure if it is face blindness, or if it is in your head. But at some point, you know for sure. \n\nFor me, people would often say, 'oh hey, I saw you, was like, 'hey' and you just kept walking.' Finally a friend who knew about face blindness said something. I blew it off for a long time. Then I realized lots of people were telling me this same story. But I knew for sure when I walked out of a restaurant before my dad. I was expecting him to be right behind me. He walks through the door, and I did not recognize him for several seconds. He said something, then I snapped out of it. \n\nThat is when I knew. \n\nWhen did you know? ", "If I stare at someone is face long enough, it starts to look like someone else...anyone else? When I stare at someone is face long enough, say on TV or something, their face transforms slowly as if their features are not glued down to their face... Eventually they look like someone else if I stare at them long enough.\n\nAnyone else ever experience this?  I do not experience this but I have talked with a prosopagnosia researcher before and she described something similar in some people with the condition! Yeah, kind of.  It is not so much like their face is melting as that different features come into prominence in my mind.  Since my brain is running on features not whole picture, it can completely change their face.  At least, that is what I think is happening in my head. Oh, I pretty much recognize people by them looking like other people I remember.  Like there is a generic face they kind of match. I would describe it the same way. Because you focus on other parts of the face it starts overshadowing the rest therefore making the entire face look/feel different.  Yea that is a good way to explain it. For me it feels like their face is slowly warping into somekne else but in reality I am probssbly just focusing more on their eyes or nose or whatever.  Yea it is crazy. I could be watching a movie with Brad Pitt. If you told me he was actually Johnny Depp and not Brad Pitt, I could look at his face long enough and he syarts looking like Johnny Depp....and I believe it too. It is really weird. ", "Omg I think I belong to this sub I do not think I am totally blind in terms of facial recognition, but I am not good.\n\nI can meet/be introduced to someone and have a conversation with them.\n\nIf I run into them randomly a week later, I will have no idea wtf they are.\n\nAt that point I will fake recognizing them and then wrack my brain for who they are.\n\nI usually can after a few minutes but it is soo awkward.\n\nToday I saw someone I have only met a handful of times over the course of 3 years but had one on one interactions with. I could not recognize her even though she obviously recognized me.  Like wtf?  Why am I like this. I do not have it but have the same issue. I used to work as a contractor and could talk to a customer for 5/10 min and an hour later could not pick them out of a two guy lineup. Prosopagnosia dudes cannot seem to recognize best friends after a haircut, so I feel that with me it is a similar issue but not prognosis. Also I have little desire to remember faces usually and do not generally focus at people when speaking with them, I focus on the information and answers. I tend to try to focus on faces like, \u201cplease let me remember this person by tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThose kind of details slip through my hands like sand no matter how hard I try. Why do you think you do not have prosopagnosia?  It comes in different levels of severity and you give a good example of it with your story about customers. Are you sure you would recognise your best friend if he had a different haircut or wore a hat? It is tough to come to terms with the realisation that there are some things that prosopagnosic people just cant do. It feels better once you can put them behind you and focus on what you can do well. We are usually very good at recognising voices, body shape and gait. Too much to write down. Short answer: around age 30 it seems like my brain subconsciously stopped caring to remember new faces as much, along with forgetting certain mundane words maybe a few other things. Proper nouns, directions, certain social behaviors have always been something I do not pay much attention to and it feels like that.\n\nAfter reading about prosopagnosia several things do not really add up to anything like a sure diagnosis, but it does seem like my brain does not feel like wasting energy making these new neural connections. (Forgetting mundane words is the weird one, it feels different than the others)\n\nI realize it could be something like associative prosopagnosia with some vascular cause due to lifestyle changes around that time but I kind of doubt it. Have you talked to a doctor about this? Because those other symptoms you mentioned worry me. Have you taken any of the assessments available online? For instance: \n\nThe examples you gave could easily be from someone in the average range. I agree, you should see a doctor.", "Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture.  At this point, I feel like everybody else is just messing with us. I agree! One time I found a picture of Keanu Reeves and another guy side by side and thought they were the same person until my fiance pointed out that they \"look nothing alike\". Now, I can tell you with great certainty that was complete bs, I looked back and forth between the photos and could not see how he saw two separate people. I knew I was bad with faces but that is the day I lost faith in even side by side pictures. I once mistook keanu reeves for ben affleck and was so frustrated trying to find that meme of a guy with a tired face holding a cigarette on a balcony remember that one time there was a robbery  at a store that looked just like him too I have no idea who that is supposed to be. I can tell they are different people because of the hair line... they are different people right? I think they took a different actor's face and photoshopped it onto the first actor's head. Got a non-prosopagnosic friend to confirm, this is what they did. That took me awhile to figure out.", "Are there any faces you will never forget? There was a party back in 1982 where a guy kicked a cat. His face is one of just a few that I cannot ever unremember, in minute detail. I can also picture his face in my mind. Another part of my brain kicks in so I can remember faces of evil??  The closest thing I have got to a face I will remember is the color scheme of the face of the Begal I had growing up. \n\nI can remember my dad's unique laugh, the feeling of leaning on him, his smell, his \"fashion sense\", but his face is beyond me.\n\nI have mistaken people for my significant others in the past, and I have literally not recognized them right after a radical hair cut or style change. \n\nI grew up with this though, so it is not terribly sad for me.   There is one i wash i could forget  \n\ntrump  lol", "We are in good company! ", "Prosopagnosia really sucks. I got a new neighbor and we clicked well.  She was always happy to talk and hang out. Sometime this week I took a walk and she was walking toward me but I did not acknowledge her since I did not recognize it was her. Later, I realized it was her based on her clothes. She did not acknowledge me either but I think she was initially taken aback that I did not say hi to her. Now, she is clearly mad at me and will not answer the door.. I do not have her number so otherwise I would text why I did not recognize her. So for now, I will lay off the issue .. if I happen to see her, then I can explain.\n\nI am just posting because  I realize how prosopagnosia can destroy social connections. It is not the act of doing something, but rather not doing something ***\u2014*** and it happens in an instant. It is like a silent, destructive force I did not realize existed. This is really the first time I realized it is negative consequences, but I realize how many hundreds of other social interactions prosopagnosia has shaped. I only realized in the last year I had it after stumbling on it online. It is also a good way to let other people know they might be face blind!  I always link the celebrity test, and I have had several people go, \"Wait, there are people who pass this?\" I saw her in person and I helped her clean the snow off her car and I explained it How did she respond when you explained yourself ? Her reaction was that she thought I just had a lot on my mind. I think she was hurt by me not recognizing her but my explanation cleared it up. We talk a lot again now", "Advantages of Face Blindness The other day I had to call into a Zoom staff meeting from my phone.  (Audio, no video.)  I am a teacher at a school with about 30 teachers and about 20 support staff.  The principal put us in breakout rooms.  My coworkers were shocked that I could identify everyone in our group by voice alone.  I am pretty sure it is thanks to not recognizing people's faces all the time.  Some of the people I had worked with more closely, but the one that I rarely see looks exactly like someone else in the building and her voice is the only way I can reliably tell them apart.  So, yay, I guess? I used to be able to do this as well, including the ability to think whatever I wanted in their voice. I used to pretend they were insulting me. I am not sure why, but I thought it was hilarious. that is amazing. have you always known you are good at picking up voices?\n\nI do not have that fallback gift, it seems. I might be a little more sensitive to names (text), but got nothing when it comes to alternative audio or visual cues. I totally get that \"So, yay, I guess?\" bit... lol  \n\n\nI find I am also quite good at recognizing people from afar. Little more time to pick up on their gestures and walking style, etc. I am really good at recognizing people from the back. People always make jokes that I am looking at their butts for recognition but it is their shoulders, stance, and gait that I recognize. I did not think I was particularly good at recognizing voices.  I watch a lot of TV while doing something or playing games, so maybe I got better than I used to be. I use their stance, hairstyle and some of my acquaintances have special auras.", "Explaining Yourself I have had prosopagnosia since I was a kid. 3 consecutive concussions at age 7 will do that to ya. \n\nApparently my brain makes up for it by being good at memorizing other things. As long as I recognize your hair, height, or other distinguishing features I likely remember your name and every conversation we have ever had. \n\nI can remember almost every word of songs I have heard twice. Including ones I have not heard since elementary school. \n\nI started working at an office job 5 months ago. The people I work with are distinct enough that in the office I have no problem knowing who they are. \n\nBut if I see them at the store, even a few minutes after I just said goodnight to them at work, I have no idea who they are. \n\nI have explained prosopagnosia to anyone who is asked, but I still get disbelief. \n\n\"But you remembered everyone is names so quickly! And where they sit! You remembered that I cannot drink milk, even though I only told you that once 3 months ago! You know more song lyrics than anyone I have ever met! And you are saying you cannot remember my face?\"\n\nNope. Could not pick you out of a lineup if I tried. Faces to us are kind of like fingerprints to regular people.  They can see a fingerprint, spot the whirls and splits and stuff, but they would not be able to tell you who it belongs to based on just that print alone.  \n\nYeah, you know that so-and-so sits at that desk over there, and has a peanut allergy, but it is getting to 'this fingerprint (face) belongs to so-and-so' that is the hard part. I would try approaching it a little differently. I tell people I cannot *recognize* faces and no one's questioned that (I am in Mensa and no one's like BUT YOURE IN MENSA!). That is not the same as not being able to remember faces. Not technically. I agree that the result is the same, but it is not like you see someone is features and then just forget them later. You do not really ever see them to begin with. My ability to recognize people by their faces is about equivalent to your ability to recognize people by their voices. You will recognize close friends and family easily, other voices will sound familiar but you will have to think about where you know it from for a while and some you just have no clue despite having met them a few minutes ago.  &gt;3 consecutive concussions at age 7 will do that to ya. \n\nThat is rough but I am envious that you have a reason why. I was just born with the gift of prosopagnosia, which makes it very difficult to explain. \n I really struggled with this for a long time! I have finally settled on something that works for me.\n\nI explain that I have a \"facial recognition processing disorder.\" This seems to strike the right balance between sounding official and giving enough of the right kind of information that they can immediately begin wrapping their head around it.\n\nIf they want more, I explain that I see human faces the way they see dolphin faces. I can certainly SEE them, and, with the right combination of unusual features and/or long familiarity, I may begin to recognize individual people. But I ask them to imagine going to an aquarium that has a small group of dolphins in a tank. Then they go to another aquarium that has dozens in the tank, and someone tells them that one of the dolphins was at the other aquarium when you were there.\n\nCould they pick out which one? Call it by name?\n\nWhat if they one day encountered it in the wild? Would they recognize it and remember where they knew it from?\n\nMaybe it is even a dolphin they interacted with. They will remember the interaction, maybe have warm feelings about that dolphin, but they still probably cannot pick it out from a crowd.\n\nThis works for me. But I still have embarrassing moments on a regular basis. I think that is just going to come with the territory. I think there is a huge gap in how face recognisers use language compared to the minority of us. They will use \"remembering name\" for the entire overlay from knowing the social context to detailing an exact person and pulling up some file of shared social history. In a blink of an eye or less. Not intimidating at all or anything.....  \nJust teach them the difference through some talk about context. Go slow they are stupid - seriously, not saying to be mean, they do lack all experience in how all this works when you recognise most of them with \"manual gear\" on.  \nTell them the office is your meta context, but walking up to you randomly at railroad station leaves you with a lot bigger stack to comb through with lot less cues.   \n\n\nYou can make it safer for you ahead of time. I have done this by telling everyone I cannot recognise people without context (or walking style), and while I do not think they can perceive how this plays out in real life, when it does i can refer back to the time we talked about this. I can say that is it right here, and bless their unaware souls I will still have to ask who are you. It is just least hard path to have a reference for failing to recognise them, done in the moment I knew who they are. If people humiliate you for not knowing who they are, the stranger(s) in front of you are your loved ones who are probably experiencing your lack of recognition for them like babies in those awful still face experiments.    \n\n\nThey need social recognition, you need the context at first. It is painful but it is ok. Personally i fake it most of the initial eye contact moments, when i recognise someone recognises me (THAT WE CAN DO BETTER THAN AVERAGE! because they are not aware of that pupil-shape-shift etc). Worst i could do if i mismatched that, would be I smiled to an actual stranger accidentally. Might even make their day. You will never know.  That is a really clever explanation, I like it.

Lucky to have coping mechanisms that seem pretty good Yeah, that is the attitude we need.  mine is only 2", "Jokes for coping Finally realized I have mild prosopagnosia this last year.

", "School Mayhem In college, I had physics lecture, a 30 minute break, and then chem lab. I had partners for both, which I was incredibly grateful for.\n\nA week after the chem lab final, though, my physics partner asked how that final went, and in my confusion, I asked how he knew I took chem lab this semester.\n\nHe shot me an utterly betrayed look and that is when I Knew that I messed up. a full semester in the same two classes back to back and I never made the connection that he was my partner in both.\n\nHas anyone else completely ruined someone is day like this? Because I think I really ruined his day. He refused to talk to me after that. I had this happen all the time in high school. It sucked when I had partners in a class, because a lot of kids then we are into the 'scene' look (I am from the US) so their hair tended to look the same. That or they dyed their hair bottle blond, and...all looked the same. \n\nSo many times I got confused as to who my partners were, I knew they were confused and offended. It also did not help that I had no idea what was wrong with me, just that SOMETHING was. It happened too when teachers and classmate would see me in stores and say hi. Even if I knew them well, I would often have no clue who they were. You could always see the look of confused offence on their faces. :(\n\nOne of the worst ones was one time, still before I knew what was up with me, my parents and I were looking at a scrap book. Usually I can tell by context, but there were a couple photos that did not help much. My mom has lost a lot of weight over the years, and looks like a completely different person. Which is normal for people to think even when they are 'normal', but it is obviously a whole new level for me.\n\n  I asked who the person was standing next to me, and my mom started crying because she thought I was implying I did not know who she was because she had been so fat most of my childhood (she really was not THAT big, but her face used to be very round) that that is all I thought of her now. And she thought I just did not value my childhood enough to remember. I had no idea how to explain that no, mom, I do this with everyone. I have had so much trouble with this every time I did a group project I would mention that I was face blind and would not always recognize people, sorry in advance. \"Group project\" is actually shorthand for \"I really, really hope my group chose the same table this time because otherwise I am going to sit down with the wrong group.\" I think I break my mom's heart too, since she does not show me photo albums anymore, but I have never even been able to recognize my siblings or myself in pictures. I tend to avoid going through family pics as a result. It is a little demoralizing to not be able to recognize myself or family, tbh.\n\nI sincerely hope you have been able to explain the situation to your mom, though. This is not related to prosopagnosia, but I never met my dad before I was around 7, and a few days after he moved back in with us, I remember asking my mom when the weird guy in our house was going to leave. This made her cry and I did not learn why until a few days later, when my older sister told me that was my own dad. It is not... a good feeling, to accidentally make your mom feel like she had failed as a parent.", "This one got me today. \n\nIt is Rey from the latest three Star Wars movies. I have seen all in the cinema, all 3 in one sitting when the third came out, and several times subsequently. Just could not recognise her.\n\nIt got me wondering whether that was because she looks like generic white woman No.1. Nothing distinctive about her. That is reflected in her rather tepid personality and the fact that a lot of fans did not bond with her, maybe?\n\nI wonder whether we would make more interesting casting choices if we were involved, out of need to make characters distinctive? It took me a minute, and I only recognized her with the help of the classic Star Wars style background. When I saw one of them in the theater, I constantly lost track of who she was and had to ask my date to help identify when she (and a few others) came on screen. I have great difficulty recognizing her as well. Her features, acting, mannerisms and voice are too \u201cgeneric\u201d for me to latch onto anything distinct enough to help consistently recognize her. I can recognize her in this image by context. It is a very Star Warsy setting, and I can recognize Kylo Ren as the blurry guy behind her. So here I have no problem.\n\n\nThat being said, I once saw a meme were a jerk mocks a girl wearing a Star Wars shirt saying she probably does not know the franchise well. Since the meme was clearly framed to show how stupid the guy doing the mocking was by not recognizing the girl's connection with Star Was I tought to myself \"Well, it has to be Rey, and he is not recognizing the main character in the new movies.\"\n\nLater a friend told me it was Natalie Portman.", "Jobs and a social degree. I consider myself a mild case. I have problems telling people apart, but after some exposure I will start to recognise individual features, and can tell people apart. If they are no close friends or close family, and I have not seen them in a few months or longer, I will upon passing notice something familiar about them but will not be to  recognise their face / associate it with the context of where I know them from. I graduated with a social degree. I blisfully forgot about the times I did not recognise my patients when they were sitting in the hospital hallway instead of their labeled rooms at my internship, the times I could't tell apart the kids in a class I volunteered with (hello chaos), and so on. I now have a job interview lined up for some kind of group facility, and remembering previous experiences I think it might be hell. Anyone else dealing with social jobs? How do you go about it?\nI was thinking of studying a list of patient pictures and names if those are available.. (Due to legal issues I would have to do this at work however.) Good luck with the new job. I hope your picture list helps you. Dentist here. Going on 4 years of my own practice. More mild case. I literally have just adapted to always being nice and saying hello to everyone. I try to memorize aspects of people but the  6 months later it is gone . My wife and I have code words so she knows to introduce herself to anyone we run into if I do not say the other persons name first. A couple times a year I will have a semi embarrassing episode but no one ever talk about it. My staff knows that I never know who it is. When patients walk in I ask for birthdates sometimes so that I can figure out who is in front of me. I have always hoped it would get better as when I was a kid I was really good with faces and names. I actually still have a pretty good memory of peoples names from 20 years ago , it is just the last 15 my names and faces bank is limited. I moved back to my hometown as it is small and I run into a lot of people I grew up with.  Overall I am amazed at how seldom I have embarrassing times of not identifying someone I see all the time That is lucky your partner is so into helping you. My wife mostly just gets annoyed with me. She knows its a thing, but she still struggles with seeing it as anything but being rude. She is not entirely wrong to be annoyed with me...one time at a standing-room-only rock show I did put my arms around the wrong blonde girl.... Fortunately my job is no longer customer facing and she is such a warm, caring person that she naturally makes everyone in our social life feel known, and so I can be a bit more aloof.   \n\n\nI cannot imagine being a dentist, only seeing people once every six months. That is rough. I had a hard enough time when I was teaching and saw the same kids every day.  Hey! Welcome to the sub!\n\nI was a barista for a while, and while I really loved the job, there were a lot of regulars who I uhhhhh did not always recognize when I should.\n\nI just tried to be super friendly to everyone and hope for the best. I am pretty good with voices, so once they started talking it was a lot easier to figure out who they were. I was *very* upfront with my face recognition issues, with both my coworkers and some of the nice regular customers. Having supportive coworkers can make a huge difference: one coworker made an effort to use the customer's name when I was on register so I knew who they were :')\n\nHopefully studying their pictures and names helps - it certainly could not hurt. Even if you cannot get their faces down, just having their names memorized will be hugely helpful! Good luck with the new job! I have taught two university courses (about 35 students in each class) and it was very challenging learning my students' names. I did not know about face blindness at the time but knew I had a hard time learning names... Before the first day of class, I tried to find pictures of all of my students (via university sources or Facebook, etc) and had a digital folder of the photos that I reviewed with their names. On the first day of class, I tried to write a desk map of where all the students sat (students rarely move much after the first day). I reviewed the photos and names a lot, but... Ultimately... I remembered the names of the really involved students (asked/answered questions, etc) but it was honestly hard to remember many others, unless their clothes /hair/body shape, etc was distinct somehow. So... Yes, it is quite challenging. I am about to start a new social job and I am already taking lots of notes on the different people/interactions I have met/had, and will add in photos to go with the notes. So that is my plan! I am a psychologist, 30 years experience. Since I learned the name of my problem thanks to the 2010 Oliver Sachs article \nI have found it helpful to just explain to clients my issue. The vast majority of people still never heard of it. But I explain that if I do not recognize then, I am not intentionally ignoring them and that they should never take it personally, that I just was born with this brain damage. I would love to store photos on my phone of my clients, but it would breach confidentiality. Plus, I do not really think memorizing their pictures would really help, because I just cannot encode the info. But if I was about to see a client and had the photo right before, I might do a better job of figuring out which person to bring back to my office from the waiting room. Having the front desk receptionist point in the right direction has helped a lot. Many many many awkward moments and many hurt feelings, but I have survived, have a thriving practice, and have learned to have lots of grace with myself. \n\n Thank you, this was really helpful to me. ", "Is this prosopagnosia? Hello mates! I recently heard of this illness (I do not think it is an illness but I do not know the correct word, I am French by the way...), and I am wondering if I have it. Since childhood I have always recognized people mainly thanks to their haircut, clothes, body shape, voice, or the place (I did not know once if the man in front of me was my theatre teacher I had for eight years or not because he was not where I expected him to be)... Last time I did not recognize my dad who had cut his beard, even if I saw him the day before.\nMost of the time when people talk to me I look at their mouth instead of their eyes, and I often stare at my face in the mirror because I feel like I do not fully know it.\nBut I am not sure this is prosopagnosia because I probably have depression, a lack of focusing, and hypervigilance (I see and hear everything, and especially potential dangers, but cannot fully focus on \"details\")\nDo you think I might have this?\nThank you for reading, and have a nice day. Welcome to the group! This is proso", "Dreams of Faces How do you perceive faces in dreams? I feel like I usually do not. If a friend is in my dream  I just somehow know who it is.\n\nIt is almost like I do not really look at people\u2019s faces in my dreams. My dreams often include a lot of talking with people, walking together etc, so a lot of the time I am probably next to them instead of in front of them.\n\nOr maybe I just do not remember the faces afterwards (ha, imagine that). Like a vague sketch of a face. It is marked where the eyes, nose, and mouth should be, but there is no detail. That is also how faces appear in my memories.\n\nEdit: I also cannot look directly at the person\u2019s face. I do not see faces.

It is like you have a bearely img that make you guess what/who is there, but you are not really seeing the thing/person.\nThat is how I see faces in dreams or when I am trying to imagine a person, and it is impossible to me to 'make focus' on the face In my dreams, I always know who people are supposed to be, so usually they have a generic nondescript face but their voice and mannerisms are correct. \n\nI think sometimes the generic face changes for each character within my dreams, including myself, because sometimes it will develop different, more memorable features (like piercings or facial features comically too large for a human head) during the dream, and I will realize there has been a change, but it is hard to notice and/or track. I am not a very visual thinker when I am awake.  I can \"see\" what something in my head looks like, but with effort.  Something like a chart with different colors would be easy to visualize, but a face would  be pretty much impossible - too many details - although I can visualize, for example, the nose of someone I know very well.  It is hard though - kind of like I am drawing it in my head.  \n\nWhen I am thinking in general, it is more I just know things.  I am a very verbal learner and process things verbally.  When I think in my head it feels like talking, except often way faster.  Some thoughts are sort of \"tagged\" with a feeling, but I do not think in pictures unless I consciously try to.  I do not visualize when I am reading.\n\n(Interestingly enough all my early memories, before I learned to read fluently, are mostly visual.  I have more early memories than average. I do not know if there is something that happened in my brain when I started reading a lot or if it was just a coincidence with mental development.)\n\nMy dream are more visual.  I remember dreams, sometimes vividly, when I wake up more days than not and always have.  I FEEL like I recognize people's faces when I am dreaming, but I can never picture the faces when I wake up.  If I try, I cannot picture any part of their face.  So my dream facial memory is worse than my waking facial memory, but my dream visual memory of everything else is better than my waking visual memory overall.\n\nI do not know if I see and recognize their faces in my dream, or it is just I know who they are, so imagine that I can see their faces.  I can recognize people that I am close to most of the time without thinking about it.  (Well, partially because I tend to seek out situations with a more static group of people and I form relationships easier with people that stand out appearance wise.)  \n\nI have wondered before if I actually see people's faces when I am asleep and then cannot \"redraw\" them when I am awake or if I just see a blur but it seems normal in my dream. I do not see faces, in my dreams I see people like from the chin down or with blurred faces until there is a very close person making their iconic expression (for example my boyfriend smiles really wide and cute and his eyes kind of sparkle - his face in my dream is blurred until he smiles)", "Prosopagnosia awareness ribbon? I was going to make a post about how soon after meeting someone should I tell them about prosopagnosia, thinking that inevitably a situation will come up where I do not recognize them and end up looking like a snob.\n\nThat suddenly got me to thinking what if instead of that awkward conversation there was a Prosopagnosia awareness ribbon you could wear, if people recognized it they would know, if not it would be a good way to start the conversation. Yeah, no. That sounds like a really cool idea! Mind if I use it as well? I do not know that it exists yet, I feel like as a community we would have to come up with a standard for it if there is any hope of bringing awareness to it and actually having someone actually remember it as opposed to a long forgotten conversation like I had with my coworkers once. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but I am curious what your reasoning is.  Is it the ribbon idea you do not like or you do not necessarily want others to know what you deal with on a daily basis? Not the person you are replying to, but why do you think having a special ribbon is less awkward than a quick \"just to let you know, I am crap at recognising faces\" conversation?  It seems to me that a ribbon would be more awkward, because then you would have to explain that you are wearing the ribbon...because you have trouble recognising faces.\n\nI just tell most people I meet I have prosopagnosia straight away.  It is not a big deal and I would rather do my own talking than make a fuss with a ribbon and make people feel like it is some awful condition they \\*should\\* be aware of. The ribbon. \n\nBased on long experience, I am very circumspect about who and when I discuss prosopagnosia.   I tell people that 'I am very bad at recognizing faces'.  Then I make an effort to take an interest in them, learn about their stories, make a careful study of non-facial traits that I will recognize, and learn and use their name.  It is my responsibility to make the compensating effort.  People that can recognize faces match the face to the name and they are done.  I recognize voices, gaits, body types etc..\n\nTalking with people about proso is not a simple conversation, and if you try to rush through it, or have the conversation prematurely, it can backfire in any number of ways.  I have had the extended conversation with family, close friends, serious romantic partners, and a select few other people, for example my boss.   Prosopagnosia is an awkward conversation, but I do not think that it is common enough - or well understood enough for us to take the easy way out.  Personally, I would love a button or ribbon that says, \"please do not approach me without prior warning or identification.\" The condition is just too uncommonly recognized.  (hell, my spell checker flags it as Not a Word.)\n\nI will explain to friends or coworkers that I will be working with on a daily basis.  But it is a selective process and depends on the person.  It is easy if it is a new coworker because they do not know everyone in the office and you can work it into conversation. The conversation usually goes, \"that guy who just walked by - did I meet him earlier?\"  Me:  \"I am really not the right person to ask.  I should tell you sooner rather than later.  I am face blind.  I have walked right past my own mother without recognizing her.\"  (insert your own anecdote.  the crazier/funnier the better).\n\nClose friends still sometimes forget.  It is hard for people who possess superpowers (seeing/remembering faces instantly and without effort!  What!?!) to understand that this is not universal. Yeah I was thinking of just trying to do something simple as a conversation starter at least. Like \"I am faceblind\" (that is something I would definitely pin on my bag since I am pretty open about it already). I know other people have had bad experiences with sharing, but for me my bad experiences stopped when I realized it was A Thing and there is a reason I can give people for why I do not know who they are.  I have not had much luck with telling people I am faceblind. I went through a phase of trying but sometimes they acted like they had misheard me, or they would say \"I am bad with names too\" which just infuriates me, so I do not bother any more. I do admire another face blind person I heard of who used to wear a T shirt saying \"do I know you?\".  I do like the idea, I wish there was a way to be understood without a long, awkward explanation. no it would make you a target for getting robbed  bad idea", "Anyone else's face blindness coupled with inability to memorize environments?  Although I am 90 legally blind I CAN see well enough to go out alone, I work as an illustrator, play video games. My inability to recognize faces has nothing to do with my poor eyesight but I do use my eyesight as an excuse because most people do not understand face blindness at all here. I can see people well enough when they come up to me, notice even tiny details on their faces and such but my brain cannot identify the face, it just sort of sorts all faces in several categories and that is that. \n\n But what really makes moving around difficult is my inability to navigate environments, I have little to no sense of direction and I have a hard time using milestones and understanding just where I am in an environment. I am not completely helpless but I cannot find the most efficient route or if something changes in a familiar environment, including lighting I get confused and do not recognize it. I have read that face blindness can sometimes be coupled with a disorder like this as well and I guess I have it.\n\n When I was a kid I used to play outside A LOT, all the other kids would quickly and efficiently find routes or just follow a regular path like everybody else, I would get super confused and start climbing obstacles and such to get to where they are. To them I probably just seemed like I was having fun and messing about, but in my mind I was doing it because I did not know how else to get to where they are, especially if they were all running and quickly figuring out where to go next and such. I do not know if it is related or not, but I have a TERRIBLE sense of direction.  I could get lost trying to find my way out of a paper bag.  I know the main roads of my town well enough, but I get completely lost if I leave the \"well known path\".  I just kind of assumed that a lot of people were like that, and it was relatively normal. I have heard it is related! Wish I remembered why exactly lol I cannot even remember where did I read about it. Yes, absolutely. I lived in my last two cities for a year each and never bothered to even try to learn how to get around as I knew it would not be worth the extensive effort if I would be moving to another city after a year or two. Now that I am settled for a while I am making the effort. After four months of living here, I have been able to learn my neighborhood, mostly. I have not started learning how to get to stores that require driving yet, because that is going to take a very long time and a lot of hard work. I have worked to recognize my neighbors, the property manager, and my neighborhood, though. It is such a strange condition\nI think it all boils down to pattern recognition, we lack facial recognition alright but I think we probably lack general pattern recognition too.\nAs I said I am BIG into gaming and love video games more than anything, but patterns I often do not quite catch on to as easily as other gamers do. I have gotten lost on my way back home on a route I take a billion times when going out with friends, tho my poor eyesight had a little to do with it, my inability to get back on my own was definitely due to my face blindness thing or whatever, at 35 I had to have my mom find me and pick me up, no biggie I was circling around the neighborhood ffs\nI was not drunk or anything, I do not drink, I was out with friends, went back home as usual, took a wrong turn and BAM that was it :)\n\nWe did not stress over it tho, it is not like anything could have happened to me worst case scenario I would have caught a cab Yes -- I have often thought it may be related, but the studies I am aware of are not looking into it (that I know of).\n\nI use GPS for far longer than most people. When I get a new job, I use GPS for weeks going to and from work. \n\nIn large buildings, I have trouble finding where I am going and navigating back. (Like, finding your doctor in a larger office with many suites and practices, or finding the right door to go out to get to your car when leaving a mall). \n\nI absolutely believe it is related... or I have another disorder. Similar to facial blindness, a lot of people say they are \"bad with directions\" but do not realize the severity I am talking about. No. I only have mild peosopagnosia, but I have no problem navigating at all. In the time before car gps systems I usially was the dedicated mao reader of the family, because I had the best sense of direction. Lack of sense of direction (topographagnosia is one name for it I think) is correlated strongly with face blindness, I understand.  It is not something I personally struggle with, so I cannot speak to it, but I read about it commonly in face blindness literature.  I am not great at it either - never can tell you which way is north, not good at giving people directions, poor spatial awareness - but I can find my way about okay. I am actually pretty good at mental mapping but I am terrible at trying to find my way in a strange place and I use GPS way more than most. Yep, after I make 2 or 3 turns, I cannot point to the direction I originally came from, and every time they do road construction, I miss my exits. My dad is the same way. That is interesting, because I am very much the opposite.\n\nIf I have been in someone is house one time I can recall the details of room and furniture arrangement almost perfectly, even years later.  (It is a fun party trick).\n\nSame with maps.  If I have been somewhere once, I can usually find it again - even if I am getting there from another direction.  This skill is getting worse with age, though. Yes! Well, slightly less severe than your problem I think. I know the centre of my hometown very well (although I have always hated people asking me for directions, perhaps I need to \u2018be there\u2019 to know my way or something...) and I think I can almost always think of the fastest route from A to B.\n\nBut I lived in Budapest for 3 years, and by the end of the 3 years my partner was still laughing at me for exiting a local shop in the complete wrong direction every time. I am mildly face and place (\" geographic agnosia\") blind. At college I kept a map of campus and relied on building directories often. I can get lost in my own neighborhood or where I grew up, which is not far away. It seems like it can take years before my brain connects areas I know even if I am literally driving through the same places. I mesmerize specific routes or use GPS. Glad that does not stress you.  I used to get bad anxiety when lost.  Now I pull over and study Google maps. Sometimes it keeps taking me through a confusing area so I will just find a \"long way round\" that avoids whatever is hard for me. I am the same. I even drove to my company's new office the Sunday before we moved in to get the route down. And even though my favorite book store was only a block away I did not realize I would moved to that area for another month! Hmm, I have thought about this and for me I think my brain just prioritizes things differently than NT people. I am an Aspie (ASD) and I have worked in customer service in retail and a call center, I have done QA, and now I am a paralegal.  Memorization and pattern recognition are a part of all jobs. \n\nIf I make an effort to memorize something then I can and will do it well until I no longer need the information. I just have to consciously decide to do that or the person or place is like a peripheral part of my memory. That is amazing! I call it \"map brain.\"  Neurologists probably call it \"autism spectrum.\" I have all of the same problems, no maps in my head, go by landmarks etc. But there have been times when I am driving along on my normal routes and suddenly I have no idea where I am, or which direction I am heading if I am on the freeway. I have to wait until I see a sign with the names of the exits before I get any clues. It is very disconcerting. I have learned one thing at least.. if I am in a restaurant and have to leave the table and go to the restroom, I make sure to turn around and see where I will need to go to return. If I am with other people, I also have to make sure I know what color shirt too or I never see them. People can wave their hands in the air and say, over here!, But I still will not see them. I had this yesterday - I was walking along in a familiar place and I suddenly did not recognise anything around me! I just kept walking and looking until I saw something to re-ground me and then everything falls back into place.", "Facebook I got a notification about a recommended friend and recognized the name, but not the image of the person. I looked the person up anyway, then almost exited out of the page because I did not know them, but stopped because I recognized one of them. I kept scrolling and came across several selfies with a woman matching the description of my friend and then some that I knew was my friend. Apparently, they were the same person. It took me several minutes of comparing pictures before I realized the key difference: glasses. I recognized my friend if she was wearing glasses, but cannot 'see' her in the pictures without. \n\nWell. Now I know that if we ever meet up, I have to make sure she is wearing her glasses.", "Telling pets apart but not people A while ago my boyfriend, his mom and I had a discussion about our cats, we have five and 3 were mine.\n\nI have a pair of twin kitties, and due to that they look extremely similar, my boyfriend has two boys that look similar but do have a fair few differences.\n\nI can very easily tell my kitties apart, one has stripes on her tail, she has a near silent purr and is thinner than her sister. My boyfriend's mom has so much trouble telling the twins apart without their collars (I do not like giving my cats collars bc they are inside cats).\n\nShe does not have prosopagnosia, I do. Boyfriend and I talked about how I have to notice minute differences in people in order for me to try to recognize someone. We found it pretty hilarious that he recognizes faces but does not recognize details, and I am the opposite! Dude same! Once recognised an all-white dog on the beach that I follow on instagram, and a week later failed to recognise my own face in a picture at work. I totally get this Bruh I can recognize my cats outside at night based on like, just body shape and posture. It is soooooo much easier to tell cats apart than humans. They have so many more \"little details\".", "Netflix Films and Accessibility to People with Faceblindness So, as you all have already discovered, film is not often the easiest of mediums to follow for people with prosopagnosia, as most celebrities just... look the same. Things get especially challenging in films in which all the characters are uniformed, the same gender, or have similar haircuts (usually war movies, some sci fi.) The resulting confusion of trying to tell people apart oftentimes slows down the film, and decreases enjoyment.\n\nAlthough I have found Netflix to be *particularly* bad about this, I unexpectedly rewatched a film that stood out to me from a few years ago, called Hardcore Henry. It is a pretty cheesy film that I frankly enjoy, even if it has its vices, but I realized it has some huge points in its favor:\n\n* Pretty much every time an important character comes on screen, whether we have seen them before or not, they will be announced by name. (This fits into the plot as well, for the most part, which I love.)\n* The important characters all have really distinct outfits and haircuts. No spoilers, but clones play a large part into this film, and even the clones are easily identifiable through these means.\n\nThe... corny, over the top drama actually plays really well into helping me identify characters, as they are all wearing bold, unique, showy outfits, and because the main story takes place over the course of a day, very few of the characters change wardrobes, and if they do, they have a particular color theme they stick to, which is nice.\n\nI was wondering if people had any experiences similar, with films that were particularly accessible :) I have had an easier time with Hardcore Henry than most other films I have watched.\n\n(I think a counter example is when I watched the Netflix Daredevil show when it came out, and every character wore grey, looked, talked, and acted the same way. The color grading was very dark, and 2/3 lead characters - Karen and Matthew - look like literally EVERY other Hollywood actor, and it was kind of difficult for those reasons, though not the worst I have seen.) I found that I enjoy TV shows way more than movies.  After a two hour movie, I still cannot recognize similar characters, so I would have to rewatch it a bunch of times to truly follow it or make my husband tell me whom everyone is.  It takes me multiple seasons to learn important characters on a TV show, but at least there is a different plot every episode, and after you learn them, in some genres you are pretty much set. On Amazon Video, if you pause the film it says what characters and actors are currently on screen. This is useful! It is so nice! yes! other streaming services, take note! how to get away with murder! whenever they reveal someone is identity or show them in a dramatic scene or place they are not expected to be (hardest time for me to recognize who that character is) they do a series of flashbacks showing who that character is in their normal context so i am able to place them! it is super helpful Oh nice!", "I genuinely cannot tell which is which  i thought the one on the left was from Parks and Rec, and i am still not convinced she is not They are the same person They look like the same person with different makeup to me Exactly what I wanted to say.. Did not even notice the different eyes color at first (now at least I am pretty confident they are not only one.. Even if my brain is on fire) They are not according to my non face blind wife I can, but I really like these witherspoon Carry is the one on the right, she wears heavier makeup than Reese. She had an horrendous accident that scarred her face which is likely why she wears a lot more now than she used too, but she has always been a bit heavy with it. She is gorgeous is my point! If I had that complexion and looked that good all I would be wearing is sunscreen!! Ha! And I hope I do not offend anyone here, as I do not struggle with faces, I am thankfully quite good with them, names on the other hand, that is a much different story!  But hubby does have trouble with facial recognition and I discovered this sub and fell down a rabbit hole! Just wanted to thank you all for being so open, I have learned so much and find it fascinating whilst also recognizing how difficult this must make your lives. So, thank you!", "Two of the exact same gif stacked on top of each other  I am honestly quite mind-blown at the original thread. *Everyone* seems to be able to make out some sort of difference between those two faces.\n\nI have been staring at this for a long time. The bottom one looks slightly older and his forehead might be slightly wider, but that is all I can say about it with the side-by-side comparison... Besides the wrinkles I honestly do not see a difference. Yes! I was trying to figure out what was so interesting about this gif. Still do not see it... I hate, hate, hate these.  The bottom one looks different.  Are they different people?  Are they the same people?  Can we just label them? Each facial feature is slightly different. The eyebrows are different, the pattern of wrinkles around the eyes, the amount of five-of the clock shadow, the exact shapes of the nose and mouth. Wow, that is incredible. Took me forever to realize that not only is that 2 separate actors, but the top one is supposedly Jim Carrey?!? And I thought he was one of those guys I could recognize anywhere... I assumed the bottom one was Jim Carrey :/ I have no clue. I see Jim Carrey and that guy from Lord of the Rings. Oddly, I had less trouble with this than I thought I would. So I joined this sub because I was not sure why I was so bad with names and faces, and while I am still not great, I obviously am not all the way facially blind, but maybe weaker than the average person. This is kind of a trick, because it is a deep fake. Obviously they have the same hairlines and stuff, but I also think sometimes the filter messes up and switches around their eyebrows and wrinkles and stuff for a second. There is a few big differences I can see that make the two faces distinct from each other. One is their chins, Jack Nicholson\u2019s chin is kind of seperate from his jowls, while Jim Carey\u2019s face is like one solid line from his chin. Also look at the area next to their eyes. Jim has a much thicker area next to his eyes that makes his face a little softer than Nicholson\u2019s. They also have different shapes noses. Also, part of Jack Nicholson\u2019s look is his five o clock shadow. Jim Carey is clean shaven here", "\u201aOne of those documentary subject\u2018s that grab a hold on you for the rest of your life\u2018 Ruth Somalo, Programmer at DOC NYC about LOST IN FACE, a documentary about faceblind Carlotta by neuroscientist and film maker Valentin Riedl. watch online in the US till Nov 19 ", "Based on true stories. \"Hey! you look exactly like !\"\n\n\"Lol you are crazy.

You get better responses from people when you use their names, and you respond better when people use your name.

Which means that when I think of that person,  B's face just pops up instead.\n\nedit: Which is weird is that when I do say that person A looks a lot like person B, everybody disagrees. Yes, I do that too! I have never been able to explain how it works for me. I use Pinterest for fandom stuff and also for hairstyle inspiration. Because of the hairstyle inspiration, I get a lot of suggested pins that are women with chin-length brown hair. But because of the fandom stuff, I am primed to expect photos of actors--that is the \"context clue\" I have got. So I am CONSTANTLY mistaking these random hair models for, specifically, the actress Jenna Coleman. I can usually work it out if I stop and look (sometimes because I know Coleman's individual features pretty well, sometimes just because it is obviously a hair post and not a fandom post), but when I am just scrolling, they always get processed in my mind as her.", "just wondering if this is a me thing or an us thing photos/videos where the face is only slightly altered (like, *every* tik tok for example, or face tune) really make me feel uncomfortable. like, the smooth skin, faux freckles, or fox eyes just make my brain scream \u201cthat is not people-shaped\u201d. i worry i sound like someone just complaining about unrealistic beauty standards but there is something about it that makes me go \u201ci may not know faces, but i know that are not a real one\u201d\n\nanyways, how do you all feel about this stuff? Uncanny valley? My first thought too. that is what i was initially thinking, but no one else seems to be as unnerved as i am about it which makes me wonder if it is also a prosopagnisia thing I think people who see faces accept a lot more \"what i see is real\" than us. Even boring acceptable filters are a big no to me, but a lot of people cannot identify the filters are even happening. same here, but it might be more of a \"old fart\" and \"unfashionable\" thing :| It would not surprise me if different people had different uncanny-ness trigger levels. I do not have that issue, but sometime while scrolling, a cosplayer that I follow will be wearing something new and I will not know who it is at first. I seem to have a higher threshold for the uncanny valley, where exaggerated facial features do not really bother me. \n\nE.g., my roommate would complain about the exaggerated eyes in the Alita movie, but it did not bother me at all Mmm. And, admittedly,  the CGI eyes there were pretty much specifically designed to evoke the Valley, just a little bit.\n\nThe actual thresholds can no doubt be altered in individuals, too. I imagine that medical students, for instance, get theirs rather substantially reset over the course of their education. Aw man, I wish more people commented on this thread. I am an outlier in a lot of stuff, really gravitating toward novel things (for one example, I really like autotuned music and theremin use just because they are not things you hear often/they are not things you can hear outside artificial circumstances), so face filters I just find interesting and odd. No discomfort or anything.\n\nTo go with what people have said about Alita (only seen trailers, unfortunately), I will admit my first reaction was a big kneejerk \"NOPE,\" but after seeing a bit more of it I wanted to overanalyze the stylization and see how I would feel after watching the whole movie lol.", "Has prosopagnosia caused you to be harassed in public? Cw: sexual harassment\n\nHas anyone else experienced seeing someone in public looking at you like they want to approach you so you think \"oh I must know that person. Better not look rude\" so you smile and wave at them but SIKE! Turns out they were a stranger and now they are following you, cat calling you and sexually harassing you? Because its happened to me a few times and its turned me even more into an introvert who does not care who is feelings I hurt. Not precisely that situation, but yes, pretty much.  I do not wave to people (never sure if I know them) but I smile a LOT, and people sometimes take it in a way that I did not mean it.  It was worse when I was younger.  I do not know if I have toned down the volume of my smile or I am just not as attractive.  (I am in my mid-30s.)  I am pretty good at shutting people down before they get too far, so it is not as bad with men who are just misreading my signals or -more when I was younger - thinking they can take advantage, but with people who have trouble with social cues it is hard. Yea I use to do that until I just hated people as a whole. Not exactly people but rather interacting with them is what I hate. Now when I go out in public for work I do not smile at all and keep my eyes downcast. I only smile if I see someone smile at me so I am not rude and that seems to work the best. It is just easier to not look at anyone at all unless I have to really. I am sure it does not help but I almost seem destined for harassment. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I am autistic, have mild prosoagnosia, I am a redhead and busty. \n\nIt is like a perfect storm of social unawareness mixed with traits some men fetishize. I used to attract abusive or stalkery types, but thankfully I have great friends who helped me. \n\nI have also gotten better as I have matured at picking up red flags and compensating in public settings with strangers. I have also developed a bitchy aura I can deploy when I want to be left alone. It works with most reasonable people and I am just very direct with creeps until they get the point. (And they probably notice a few of my friends are military guys, so that helps). Yeah, I have had this happen. I have taken to not smiling until the person actually approaches me, that way, if I know them, they can say hi. If I do not, then they usually will not approach.\n\nIf someone is like, \"Why did not you acknowledge that you saw me the other day turtle?\", I always say I was not sure if that was them, or I was not feeling well and did not want to talk (I have an autoimmune disease so that works). Do you mind sharing some of these instances for reference? I do not go out much\u2014yes, even before this quarantine thing\u2014which makes me less prone to being in these situations, but I am eventually going to go out more to do more *basic* lifestyle things, so it would be very helpful to know some of your tactics in such situations. I think the worst one for me was when I was 17 and working at the mall. I had a male coworker that I knew his hair style and build of his frame and I knew he usually closed with me. I did not know what car he drove though. I was walking through the parking lot and I saw a man driving by and looking at me and he looked similar to my coworker. So I just smiled and gave a quick wave and the man did a u turn and started following me down the parking lot sexually harassing me so I had to run through the lot to get away. Its horrible because I have always looked very young and people still think I am only 18 today! (I am in my mid 20's) so yeah 17 year old me could have easily looked like a 14 or 15 year old to that man Not sexual at first, but it did escalate to that. It happened in my school earlier this year. During recess, I would be constantly followed around by a bunch of guys (4-5). They would approach me and ask me weird questions that involved my sexuality, demeanor, etc. but in a rather hostile and condescending tone. Even though I was late to realize their true sinister intentions, I still managed to shut them down in a defensive tone. \n\nThe thing was that I could not remember their faces, but I had remembered that there was a bald guy, so I would start looking frantically for a sizable group of guys. It was a rather bad experience; I was filled with terror and panic every time a group of guys would pass by me.\n\nFor a good period of time, they would stopped bothering me, though in one incident one of them tried groping me from behind\u2014I was sure it was someone from that group. I felt incredibly helpless that moment, not knowing who it is. I did come up with ways to remember them by, especially the bald dude and those who hung out with him. \n\nI wonder how many more times incidents like these would happen in the future, as I could be in a much larger place and not figure out who did what to me. The main thing is facial reactions and body language.  These are extremely effective (at least for me) for people who either think the behavior is wanted or think the behavior is tolerated.  It is had to say what I do exactly and I think it is situation specific, but here is the best I have:\n\n*Initially act surprised: Widen eyes, slightly open mouth, and lean upper body away.  All very subtle, but the leaning away is important - open mouth and wide eyes can convey sexual interest.  It is like, \"Yikes!  That was weird.\"  This should be very fast.\n\n*If they continue, change it to disgust.  Think, \"yuck.\"  Mouth closed, head goes back, eyebrows do something, nose flares, lip may pull back to one side very slightly\n\n*Follow with a slight teacher look if needed; intensify if they do not back off: This is like \"What do you THINK you are doing?\" with your face.  Raise eye brows, eye contact, assertive posture.\n\n*After one of those work, look away from the person, blank look on your face, and go about your business.  Basically like \"Now I am pretending you are not here and leave me alone.\"\n\nAll of those things (except the teacher look) are very fast.  Also, I am a woman and live in the United States, so some things may be gender or region specific.\n\nNow, these do not work on people who cannot read facial expressions or who are harassing you for the purpose of making you uncomfortable.  In that case, I would be direct.  \"Please stop,\" or \"You are making me uncomfortable,\" are good if you are not sure it is intentional.  It will slightly embarrass you both probably, but if it is unintentional, you are telling them clearly.  \n\nIf the person is harassing you after that, it is not you or face blindness.  It is them wanting to harass someone.  In that situation, you may need to get away to feel safe.  I would not hesitate to report it to any applicable parties or ask someone for help.  If it is safe, loudly describing what they are doing and telling them to stop if there are bystanders can work.  Basically the stuff anyone would do.\n\nI kind of feel if I am overly friendly (because I am not sure if I know the person) and someone takes that as interest and acts accordingly, (what that means is situation specific, and some things are never okay,) that is more of a misunderstanding and there is no fault, but it is my job to clear it up.  Once I have given social clues indicating that I am not interested, if they continue, then that is them behaving inappropriately. I completely feel you. I think I may sit somewhere on the spectrum myself but I have never been formally diagnosed. \nI am hispanic and I have had a big butt since I was in elementary school so I have had my history of boys staring and making comments about my body for almost 20 years now.....and I totally know the fetishization frustration. That Manic Pixie Dreamgirl \"you are not like other girls\" BS. Its so freaking annoying!!!! That Is horrible and I am so sorry it happened to you. I really wish it were addressed more about how this condition really contributes to anxiety in these situations. It sucks to feel so helpless. This is why it is so important to have a close friend group to help in public places. I have not been able to go out at all this past year (not corona related) because I moved to a new city and I do not have a friend to go out with me and help me so I would rather stay home I also look very young for my age.  The worst was when I was subbing in an elementary school (wearing typical work clothes and heels) when I was 22, and a para thought I was an 11 year old student; people at the time usually thought I was 15-16 though, which was still annoying.  Now I probably look like I am in my mid- to late 20s, which is fine.  (I am mid 30s.)\n\nI got that kind of stuff a lot in my late teens and early twenties, when most people placed me at 12-15 if I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.  Fortunately, I was old enough to deal with it, but it means these guys are running around doing that to actual little girls and some who are younger but look older.  The frequency of that kind of thing decreased when I started looking over 18 which is super creepy. I have gone through my cycles of shaving off my hair and growing it back again. I noticed when I had more masculine hair and dressed more masculine, I was not getting harassed or comments on my appearance as much as when my hair was past my shoulders. I am growing my hair out again right now (its right at my shoulders) and I am already starting to notice an up pick in comments on my appearance. I really wish I could be a genderless blob TBH Thank you so much for your detailed response. I may or may not have actually done the facial expressions while reading them just to illustrate a little bit. I will be certainly using those tactics for sure. I have mostly recovered, but what I worry about is what if this exact incident recurred in the future where I am far from my family or something. I do think that I could be as introverted as I am right now next 5 years or so; I feel much safer staying inside and minimizing face-to-face encounters with other people. \n\nMost people around me feel quite upset with the quarantine thing, but I feel quite the opposite. Sure, it sucks that most commuting services have been put off, but I still feel much better staying inside and not dealing with the stress of going outside, socializing, etc. It can be quite tiring, honestly. That does not surprise me.  (Stupid, but consistent with how people act often in my observation.)  I have long hair, look very feminine (I am a woman,) look young for my age, and am usually described as very innocent looking.  The annoying part of that is people are very condescending.  I have to come on pretty strong to get people to listen to me in new situations.  The pro is I can get away with a lot, and people do not think I am up to anything bad...but I am not usually trying to do bad things in the first place.  Once I get to know people, it completely changes how they react to me.\n\nPeople who know me slightly almost always describe me as \"sweet.\"  To be fair, I do care about people and do not actually try to cause harm, but I am pretty sure that is mainly based on my appearance.  People who know me well always respond, \"Sweet and evil.\"  It is interesting, because this has been true since I was in my early teens and those exact two words have been used in every setting I am in by people who have never met each other.  I would not use either word to describe myself. I was trying making faces trying to describe them while I was typing it and my husband walked into the room and was like, \"WHAT are you doing?\"  I experimented with some things when I was younger, but have not really thought about it since, so it is not like I am consciously trying to repel people anymore. I am sorry that you had to deal with that.  \n\nI am very extroverted and am reasonably competent socially.  I have some level of social anxiety, which - until I knew about face blindness - confused me.  In the best case you are accidentally rude to people and in the worse case you have situations like yours.\n\nI too am just fine with the everyone staying home.  I generally try to limit my social interactions to situations where I can recognize people (or at least like church where I can be vaguely friendly to everyone and my husband helps manage socializing.)  Now I literally have no situations where I have to recognize people and cannot. Haha. That is really sweet! I am glad you have gotten past that stage. It is temporarily bliss we are living in right now. It must be great having a partner/friend/relative who will help you know who is whom.  I accidentally introduced myself twice to the same person at a multi-day event, and she decided to repeatedly harass me for it. I became very cold towards all young blonde women for the remainder of the event because any of them could be her.", "I have participated in a few research studies on prosno; I highly recommend that you folks do likewise! There is a few universities around the world that have groups that do studies on prosopagnosia. Since there are not a lot of us around, (as far as I know,) I thought I would share a link to encourage all of you to consider signing up to participate, for science! \n\nNote that **I am not affiliated in any way with the groups/organizations doing this research**, but I have participated in a couple of studies they have done, and I can vouch for the fact that they are legit, and affiliated with reputable universities. \n\nThe link is here: \n\nIt is a form that you fill out, and then all you have to do is keep an eye on your email inbox; you will get emails from researchers once in a while asking you to participate in their studies. \n\nSo far, I have only participated in studies that involved exercises that you complete at your computer (matching faces and such). Each time took me about an hour. They send you a summary of your results some time afterwards, so it is also a neat way to find out more about yourself. Apparently my facial recognition ability is in the lowest 10% of the population, go figure. \n\nAlso, there is occasionally some small monetary compensation; I have gotten an Amazon gift card before. \n\nAnyway, it is a small time commitment, but I definitely think it is worthwhile! ", "How do you deal with the \u201coh I have that too, I am terrible at remembering people\u201dwhen you tell someone you are face blind? \nI find it really frustrating and invalidating when people respond this way- I usually say, \u201coh so you would not recognize your best friend of 15 years if you ran in to them at a random truck stop on the side of the road? Or your sister-in-law who started working at the same company as you but your brother forgot to tell you?\u201d\n\nIt is really hard for me- I find my prosopagnosia to be a real disability that has had profound social consequences and I do not know how to respond to people who do not believe me or say \u201coh yeah me too\u201d. I just tell them I have prosopagnosia rather than saying face blind. It leads to \"oh what is that\" then you say face blindness, but it starts with the context of an actual condition so people are way less likely to be like \"I have that too!\" unless they actually do, of course. Eh, I know it is a spectrum, it is not the sort of thing that you either have or do not and that is it, some people have it much more severely than others but it is still real. And there is no point getting into competitions with people about whether your problems are worse than theirs. Plus, lots of people actually have it and just did not know it was a real thing so they always just said they were terrible at remembering people. I do not mind the folks who are also bad with faces.  Heck, we all learned about prosopagnosia for the first time at some point and recognized ourselves in the description.  Could be they are as bad with faces as I am, and I did not know it was a thing until my late 20s.\n\nIt is the \"same, because I forget NAMES\" that occasionally gets on my nerves. Like, \"bitch, if you meet someone,  you know who they are, the circumstances of your meeting, and whether they are someone you like or hate, but you forgot their name so, sure, it is exactly the same.\"\n\nI just remind myself, though, that it is human nature to seek connection via commonality.   They are listening and trying to relate, so I try to take it in the good-hearted sense it was intended. I do not even use the term 'face blind' anymore. I say prosopagnosia, and then explain that it is a neurological disorder that prevents me from remembering peoples faces. So far so good. I usually say \u201cI have a facial recognition disorder/condition\u201d because that gets people to take it seriously In addition to Prosopagnosia, I also have Tourettes. When I tell someone I have Tourettes, many peoples' first reaction is \"oh hah! Fuck damn shit cunt!\" That...that is so unbelievably offensive to me. I do not make fun of people in wheelchairs, people with stutters or people with invisible disabilities. If you said you were an alcoholic, I would never even fathom pretending to stumble around drunkenly to make fun of you.\n\nWhen I say I am face-blind and people say they are too, I always try to educate and explain that mine is so bad that I have gotten into strangers' cars, forgotten bunks full of people and kissed the wrong person. It bothers me, but if they are trying to empathize and not belittle my disability, I am okay with trying to educate them. Almost everyone I teach about prosopagnosia says \"Wow, I had no idea that was a thing!\" My response is generally along the lines of: \u201cNo, it is not quite the same. When I was a baby part of my brain did not form right. This area is called the fusiform face area. This area is in charge of recognizing human faces. Because mine is not quite right, I recognize people based on their hair and other semantic knowledge, but I can seldom look at someone and recognize them. I hardly recognize my own face.\u201d That is human beings in a nutshell. \n\n\"I am introverted/extroverted | allergic to ___ | have ADHD| get migraines | mania and or depression | have anxiety | am OCD | am on the spectrum | have a reading disability | have dyscalculia .....\" \n\n\"Oh yeah ME TOO.\"\n\nEven infertility, for some people. NO, Sam, your 3 months off the pill without success before you conceived twins is not infertility.\n\nOr in extreme cases, \"my child died\" -- \"OMG I am so sad too, my cat died\". \n\nAbout the only thing they will not respond reflexively like that to, are erectile dysfunction, eating disorder, drug addiction, maybe a few more that are heavily socially stigmatized. \n\nYou cannot convince them. Just mentally make a note and be done with them. Yeah, that is annoying.  I usually hear the \"bad with names too,\" thing.  I am excellent with names.  I am a teacher and when I was subbing, I could memorize the names of 20 desks and their personalities by lunch.  Did not do me any good when they got in line though.\n\nI have two replies:\n\n1. Mental eye roll and ignore it.  And then engage no further with the person on this subject.\n\n2. Give them an example.  My new favorite is, \"I do not always recognize my son in pictures.\"  (I can usually figure it out, but there is a kid that looks kind of like him at preschool.  I think the more extreme example helps them get it.) &gt;I. When I tell someone I have Tourettes, many peoples' first reaction is \"oh hah! Fuck damn shit cunt!\" That...that is so unbelievably offensive to me. \n\nThat kind of stupid reaction happens surrounding a lot of conditions.\n\nIts almost universal that colourblind people will get the \"what colour is this, what colour is that\" thing when they identify that they are colourblind. There was a kid on my nephew\u2019s soccer team that looked vaguely similar to him. I would tell them apart based on their shoes. I tell them, \"I used to think the same thing, but then I took this quiz online and found out I was face blind.\"  So I try to see if they have the same issue and just the wrong name for it. Ooh this is a good one I agree 100%. I always think it is someone else who just realized it was not normal. Do u have a link to this quiz? The Celebrity one is probably fastest.  Here you go: ( Is there a word for someone who does forget names like we forget faces? I have a good friend who truly does forget names in a bad way. She even sometimes has a hard time remembering her husband\u2019s name, or best friend.", "Anyone have absolute pitch? My husband, who has prosopagnosia, also has ( He is really into music, and he also seems to take a lot more pleasure and interest in everyday sounds than I do. He notices things like birds singing or machines making strange noises a lot more than I do.\n\nI have not seen any evidence that the two things are connected, but we have both wondered if there is any chance the mental resources that \"should have\" been devoted to identifying faces somehow got rerouted to identifying pitches.\n\nAnyone else? Absolutely not for me. I am awful with music.  I do not have absolute pitch but I have always been able to reproduce any note after I hear it. Within my range of course.  Unfortunately, my singing quality is garbage. This has led many people to say that I am perfectly in tune but it does not sound so good. Lol.  I have no musical talent whatsoever, however, I DO tend to use voice as one of my primary ways of identifying people. I do, but it is probably more related to the fact that both my parents are musicians My husband's family is relatively musical, too. He thinks a lot of pitch awareness is based on how much opportunity you have to learn it when you are very young.", "Same hair same person (Johnson in the picture, queen of England mixing him up with Trump) ", "How to Get Tested I feel awkward trying to explain to people that I am not just 'bad with faces', when I do not have anything, other than stories, to back up my claim I probably have prosopagnosia. I have done a tiny bit of google search, but I keep coming up with UK web pages with expired links. \nCan I just go to my doctor and ask to be tested? Is there another way? I am not okay with travelling to the UK (I am in the US) to be tested, at least at this time. \nAlso, have you guys been tested, or are you identifying as having it without being tested first? This one is working:  If you hang out in like FB groups about it occasionally people will post research studies that they are conducting / link to online tests. Do not have any atm, sadly I dont know how things work in the US but from reading in other faceblind groups you can ask your doctor about an appointment at a neurology department. There are some around the country that specialise in FB but I should think there is enough info out there for any clinic to see you. There are also sites where you can self test for free such as      I have never been tested but my doctor who diagnosed me with asperger's agreed that I seem to have mild prosopagnosia and geographic agnosia. I do not see the point in a formal diagnosis, but if it will help you (as getting my asperger's diagnosis helped me), then go for it. \n\nI have done online tests but they never seem well thought out. For example the photos are different shades that almost seem like IG filters were applied. So even though I may not recall the specific person the blue tint of the photo stood out. Or they had people with wildly different hair, glasses, moles, freckles, or other markers that I would remember. Most also had very few POC so again I would recall the one Asian guy simply for that fact. However if you would given me photos of 10 people with similar demographics or obscured their hair and removed glasses then I would get very confused. \n\nI have had trouble recognizing friends who changed hair, clothing and facial hair often until they spoke. And I once thought my first cousin was at the airport too but then I heard the lady speak and it was the wrong regional accent. When I used to online date I had to look at the photo on my phone right at the meeting place so I could find them and I would warn them I may have trouble so they knew to approach me first. I also confuse actors in a movie (I thought two women in the last Mission Impossible just were one lady wearing wigs until they were in a scene together), or do not even realize an unfamiliar actor is playing (long lost) twins until the story makes it obvious by someone confusing them. Things like that make me confident enough that I know I have a problem but I already have figured out workarounds in my life so a diagnosis would not be money well spent for me. The page has not been updated in three years. No idea if the relevant research would still be ongoing. No, but it is still a test you can take if you are curious about your result. \n\nDartmouth, Harvard, and University of London periodically look for research subjects.  They do an in depth battery of screening tests before they select you as a research subject.  The research studies often involve spending time in a MRI machine (magnetic resonance imaging) where they take images of your brain while you take various tests (there is a a screen inside the MRI machine).  This can give you a very solid diagnosis and insight into your difficulties, so it is worthwhile because it will help you truly admit to yourself that you have proso (its easy to lapse into denial).\n\nHaving a solid diagnosis is interesting, but from my first hand experience, it is useless (and maybe even counter-productive) to try to use it to convince family and friends to take your prosopagnosia seriously.  The usual response is 'yeah, I have trouble recognizing faces too.'  It might be useful if you are seeking 'reasonable accommodation' from an employer under the ADA, though I do not know if proso is officially recognized as a disability in the USA.\n\nPeople who are close to you, who know you very well, and who have spent a lot of time with you, may start to take your proso seriously once you have heart to heart talks with them about awkward and embarrassing experiences that have led to hurt feelings and misunderstandings.   It is really not worth bring up with casual acquaintances.  It is a good idea to make it an ongoing conversation with anyone who you are trying to have a romantic relationship with.  It takes more than one conversation.  This is especially important if you also have (in addition to proso) an inability to read emotions in people's faces (a common co-morbidity for people with proso). I think I have heard about a place in Boston that does screening I have not been tested but I usually just explain to people with an example. I have them close their eyes and tell them to think about close relatives, people that live with and the like. When I tell them I cannot do that at all they understand very quickly. I tell them I do not know what my wife looks like, or even myself. That usually does the trick. I self-identified and then got tested which confirmed my self-assessment.\n\nI got tested by filling out the ( \"contact us\" form.  Then filling out the follow up form.  And then waiting for them to contact me about a research project, and when they did contact me I completed an online test and sometime after that they sent me test results by email.  The whole process took a little while (more than a few months but probably less than a year), so adjust your expectations to avoid disappointment. I think this is something that you kind of can self diagnosis yourself with.  I found explaining to people to be often unsuccessful.  Part of it may be my social skills are decent and I am pretty damn good at coping, so people I am close to actually cannot tell.  I think if they had noticed I was struggling, it would be easier.\n\nYou can try getting a referral from your doctor to a neurologist and go from there.  I would expect to do some explaining and to hit some dead ends.  I have not done this, because I do not know what good it would do me.  I did get tested through a research study online at one point, but I actually have not found that helpful for convincing people.\n\nWhat works best for me is to have one short, concrete story that is more extreme.  My go to is \"I have trouble telling two of my cousin's apart.  I have seen my cousins at least twice a year since I was an infant.\"  \n\nI have also have had better success saying that \"I have trouble recognizing faces\" than naming it.  In that case, I do not use my extreme example and people seem to accept it a little easier.\n\nBut usually, I just do not tell people, because it is easier.", "I am participating in a study on prosopagnosia for Wellington University.

In no particular order :\n\n1.  Did not recognise my son when he came out of his martial arts class as his hair was sweaty . I genuinely thought there was a new student.\n\n2. Neighbours used to complain to my family that I walked past them in the supermarket without saying hi. (my job at the time )\n\n3. Realised after watching my wedding video that the guy I kept bumping into and not speaking to had been at my wedding.\n\n4. Did not recognise a senior manager who had a hat on when I bumped into him at a another town . His baldy head was how I identified him . \n\n5. A kid in my football team that I coached had a new skin head haircut . I just could not identify him and took half the session for me to work out who he was by a process of elimination.\n\n6. Did not recognise someone from my school . Only realised this at the school reunion when they pretended they did not know me and I worked out why .\n\n7. Guy who was at college with me , pretended he did not know me in a pub . Again I worked out I must have blanked him previously.\n\n8. Getting my wife\u2019s friends mixed up . Two that looked similar to me , used to struggle to tell them apart .\n\n9. A mechanic doing my car knew my name and a lot about me . I could not work out how I knew him . Not till the end that he took off his hat and glasses , did I realise I knew him well .\n\n10.  Was away on a business trip to another country and spent quite a bit of time with a colleague who travelled with me . A few months later I walked into a meeting and there was a guy sat there that I did not recognise . Was not until the end of the meeting when he was speaking that I realised it was the guy and that he now had a beard and that I had treated him like a stranger .\n\nSorry quite long in the end but writing this list down has confirmed to me I think I have it . yeah, that definitely sounds like proso! welcome to our little corner of the internet \ud83d\udc4b Yeah, I think you are right.  I relate to #1 and 6...but all the rest sound pretty normal.\n\n1. My son is in preschool.  They send pictures that sometimes include multiple kids.  I usually recognize my son, but not always.  Once I exclaimed to my husband that another kid had the exact same shirt as our kid (it was an old hand-me-down, not one you would expect all kids to have)...yep, my kid.\n\n6. I refuse to go to high school reunions.  That sounds miserable.  I was recently looking at my elementary school class pictures.  I have a really good memory...I only knew about a third of the kids in my class each year though.  (I remember my class seeming like a big group where you could not possibly learn everyone is names.  I realize now this is not normal.  There were under 30 kids and I went to the same elementary school that did not have a high turnover in population.) Yep. All stories I recognize as my life as well. Plus the introducing myself, and getting a response to the effect of \"Yeah, we met,\" (but it gets me their name anyway).  \n\nIt creates a lot of social anxiety for me, and discomfort with being placed in the position of being expected to know who people are (like co-workers I have worked with for years). The struggle turned me into a hermit for the most part for a long time. But as I get older, give myself a break, and just relax a bit about it, it is easier just say: \"dang, I am really bad with names, the worst. could you remind me?\" \n\nIf it is awkward, oh well.

Or not.\n\nBut yeah, no high school reunions for me either. When you say the rest is normal , is that normal for Prosopagnosia or normal for a the average person?\n\nThe funny bit about not picking up my son was me sitting in the car for a good 10 minutes waiting for him to come out . Normal for prosopagnosia. Phew , it is actually quite a relief . Sounds like Proso!

I would like to get one but I am not sure how.  Should a neurologist be able to help?   And how much did it cost?\n\nEdit: okay, folks. I know you all mean well, but I am not here for validation, nor your opinions on testing, nor your thoughts on diagnosis. I am here because I would like to have answers to the questions I posted.  If you have related issues you want to talk about, please create another post for it.  \n\nIn the mean time, please stay on topic here. Question: what would you GAIN from a diagnosis? Something to wave in front of my parents and maybe some ex-coworkers while singing \"I told you so\" There is nothing to diagnose. There are no good tests. It is kind of like a chronic speeder wanting an official diagnosis of a lead foot.\n\nYou can show them that it is a real thing. It is up to them to believe. So I joined a study they are doing in California where they send me a bunch of online tests. They give an analysis afterwards saying whether or not they think you have prosopagnosia. All of my responses very strongly pointed that way, so I considered it a diagnoses. To those saying why bother, there are a lot of reasons why diagnoses can be helpful. What if someone is a teacher and needs special accommodations so they can keep track of their students? Diagnoses is power and it puts it in your hands. I have never spoken to a neurologist or psychiatrist about it, so I do not know whether they would give a diagnosis, but I *was* tested by a researcher using the Cambridge Face Memory Test. My score on this face memory test was in the bottom 1%. This test can be self-administered online (see the sidebar), but it is possible a professional would administer it if you needed more \u201cofficial\u201d results for some reason. You would have to ask them.\n\nBased on my own experience with faceblindness, I do not think the lead foot is a particularly good analogy. There is no specific neurological difference that makes people speed, and they can choose to learn not to. I cannot choose to remember faces better. (I can choose to learn coping mechanisms that help me recognize people in other ways, but I still will not be actually remembering their actual faces.) Thank you for this response.  I will look into this test. Thanks for this response! I will look into this study! I have an official diagnosis, but I got it when I was very young and therefore do not remember a lot of the details. According to my parents I was tested by a neurologist, and it was covered by insurance. I had a referral for proso tho, so it was a lot cheaper than getting the full neuro test thing Thank you, this is very helpful.  Was the referral given by a regular GP? The referral was, yes Thank you again!  This helps out a ton. I literally emailed Brad Duchane Direct approach!!  Noted!", "How does having prosopagnosia affect your life? ", "Surreal eyebrows Weird today. I know my colleague at work very well but every time I looked at her this morning she looked like her own shape and hair but with a stranger's face.  It is been quite surreal and I couldnt work out what was happening. It turned out she dyed her eyebrows last night, only a shade darker but clearly enough to throw me off. I knew I could not recognise people if they changed their hairstyle but had not previously realised that my recognition skills had such narrow tolerances. Has anyone else experienced this? I work for a daycare and one little white haired 5 year old boy got glasses. I walked into the classroom and said to my co worker \u201cdid we get a new kid?\u201d Then saw the hair and realized who it was, if he had brown hair I would not have known who he was. It is so crazy and annoying Eyebrows are incredibly important for recognition. If a person's eyebrows are photoshopped out of a picture, even people that do not have prosopagnosia can have trouble recognizing them.\n\nHumans are weird \ud83d\udc7d So interesting, I was not aware of this. Thank you. One time my colleague trimmed his beard and came into work after having been in the previous day with a fuller beard. I had this same feeling. I knew it was him but he looked like a completely different person. It was pretty distressing. He did not even shave it all the way off, just trimmed it closer to his face.", "relevant  YES! I feel like I looks so different when I put my hair up in different ways, but other people do not think so? But then what version of my face is my actual face?", "I drew a picture \"I do not know you - The only features I recognise are the features that change\" I am not great at drawing but I think I conveyed my experience pretty well :D ", "Help pls, I honestly do not understand So, I said this on a discord server I am on, because I wanted to know if it was just me, and they led me here. This is what I said:  I the only one who sometimes does not know what a person looks like even though they have seen their face hundreds of time before, but you just cannot understand, and you have somewhat of an idea of what they look like, but then you see a picture of them, and they look nothing like how you remembered? It does not happen with everyone, but just a few certain people. And no matter how many times I look at their face, it is not how I remembered it.' Does that sound like prosopagnosia? If it only happens with a few people, it does not really fit the definition of prosopagnosia, although that does not mean it is not a real experience! It is also possible, however, that you are prosopagnosic and just have good coping mechanisms. In that case this would be happening a lot more than you realize, but you generally make up for it by recognizing people by their hair, gait, voice, mannerisms, etc.\n\nIf you would like to test your facial recognition skills, check out some of the links in the sidebar. I recommend the ( (you must be over 18 for data safety reasons) to test your abilities and the ( to help you determine whether you experience facial difficulties that you might not consciously be aware of.\n\nRegardless of whether what you are experiencing is prosopagnosia, the human brain is fascinating and strange, and I hope you are able to find an answer to your question! aw man i flunked the test It could be. I would have a browse of the thread and see how relatable the experiences are. I think most people would say some faces are worse than others, you can latch on to the distinctive features of a \"weird\" face more easily than someone who is utterly generic (I am looking at you Rey. Or I think I might be). welcome to prosopagnosia! :P\n\n(Insert boilerplate about the reddit cannot diagnose you with anything, etc.; but if you find you fit the criteria, it is fair to call yourself faceblind.)\n\nIn all seriousness, after I got my ridiculously low score on the test, my life actually improved somewhat. I stopped trying to do what I cannot do and started improving my coping mechanisms instead. Turns out I am really good at recognizing voices. Nah I knew for a while I was just hoping for a good score oh haha okay! I was one of those who was like \"surely I am not THAT bad at faces\" until I took the test and, yep, I was THAT bad at faces", "Wow, just discovered this is a thing, feeling kind of validated. There are probably a lot of posts like this, but I just discovered prosopagnosia was a legitimate disorder, and I think I might be somewhere on that spectrum. Usually when I tell people I am \"bad with faces\" they do not take it very seriously, but it is debilitating for me sometimes! I constantly offend people. I never introduce myself to anyone, because whenever I do, it is \"we hung out for three hours yesterday\" or \"I was your lab partner for a year.\" I hate watching movies because I can never follow the plot, because so many of the characters look the same to me (white man with short hair? forget it). I worked retail for a while and constantly embarrassed myself because if a customer left my line of sight and then circled back to me, I had no idea I had just been helping them. \n\nI can recognize my family and super close friends. My family and friends say I have always been bad with faces, but that it is gotten worse in the past few years :( I am 23 years old now, about to get my bachelor's degree. I have Tourette syndrome and a sleep disorder as well (not sure if these are ever related, but just throwing it out there). Have you guys had...similar experiences to mine? Are there some good resources out there? Advice? You have had pretty much the standard experience. At work I just remembered voices. I was nearly 100% with that. \n\nI will also use things I can see. At parties I would sort ppl by some unusual clothes or hair. Then do a mnemonic device - like a lady named Donna carried a Dooney &amp; Bourke purse (which I can spot from a mile lol) so Dooney/Donna. I use whatever mental tricks I can to avoid embarrassing myself. \n\nI stick to watching TV shows where there is few characters and they are all quite different. Otherwise I am just too confused. How people walk (their gait) is a good clue especially when combined with other traits like vocal inflection.  I can recognize some individual's gaits at 100 meters.  Work at recognizing people without using their faces and you will get better at it.  Parties full of random people are hard, so I avoid them.  For a social life, join clubs and learn to recognize their stable core of membership, but be patient because it may take six months or longer to sort out the regulars.   Same exact experience as yours growing up but I discovered it when I was 13. I think the biggest thing that has helped (I have been trying it only the last few months) is that every time you meet someone new, let them know you have face blindness and to please introduce themselves if they see you randomly in the future, or at least be cognizant that you may not remember them and to not be offended. People understand a lot more.  Can totally relate. I never introduce myself in case I already know the person, and I always let people come to me to say hello because I am not sure I know them.\n\nI worked as a receptionist in a hotel and I never knew which clients had just arrived and which ones I had already spent time with.\n\nI often get lost in movies because I cannot recognize a character from a previous scene.\n\nI do not think there is hack, there will always be some embarrassing situation that you cannot act subtlety through.\n\n", "POSTING IS BACK!!!

Men are a godsend because they do not tend to dye their hair. I also look at wrinkles and how tight the skin in their face is. That works well for women who dye their hair and you cannot tell. I have to card anyone under 18 at work, so I generally card everyone unless they are obviously way older. If I mess up and someone gets offended, I usually play it off as they just look young, or that I have to as my job and mean no offense. White/gray hair, and wrinkles around their lips and eyes are a big give-away.\n\nI do find myself really confused sometimes because I cannot figure out someone is gender. I did not realize it could be related to proso. In those cases, I usually look to see if they have obvious breasts or not. I am a girl, so I do not really feel wrong doing that, but I can understand a man might feel uncomfortable. I am not good at judging ages of adults (I am about 95% accurate with kids...but kids have more distinctive behaviors and developmental skills,) but not awful.

Awhile back I realized that I probably loved cartoons as a kid and continue to love manga, anime, books/ebooks, as an adult while not being as interested in live media because I would get frustrated a lot trying to identify characters and it would make it too difficult to follow the story.

I think I know what you are saying. I like to draw but I never even attempt faces. I can draw anything I can see in my mind's eye. I mostly draw animals. I do not visualize well.  I read a lot.

I have always loved reading, and have great reading comprehension, but I do not have any mental picture.

We used to have cookies, but someone arranged the chocolate chips in the shape of a smiley face amd now we cant find them /u/Aceandmace is right, that is it, that is faceblindness. It is a bit of a misnomer but it seems to be the name we are stuck with. Hope getting a name for it feels good! (It did for me.) And welcome! That is an awesome line, I am going to steal that! I have been wondering the same thing.  I have so much trouble describing people, and I hate it when people ask me what someone looks like.  I lost my daughter (who was 7) in a store a few years back.  The store clerks asked me what she looked like, and I could not describe her to save my life.  I was so embarrassed.  I should have just gotten out my phone and showed a picture of her, but I did not think about it.  Thankfully we found her just a few minutes later. That line, that is something that will never leave my mind yeah, especially since I have been working in the arts for quite sometime, and could never figure out why I just could not make faces, but having an explanation is really nice. yeah I am always terrified something like that is going to happen to me, glad to hear it ended up going ok tho That sounds like a typical faceblind experience to me. If you are interested in getting a more concrete answer, there are some tests available online\u2014see the links in the sidebar! I have the same thing! Interesting.  Some of the symptoms totally describe me! neat Do you also get people mixed up really easily? yeah sometimes, I often remember their body language/vocal tendencies, that usually works.", "\u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d since 2010  Trying to see the differences between these faces tickled my prosopagostic brain.

I realised some time ago that I dont like photos with no hair showing. One of the online faceblind tests is an endless series of faces with no hair and I hated it. I think  hair is one of the identifiers I rely on. I can talk to someone all morning but if they turn up 5 minutes later with a hat on or their hair up I have no idea who they are. The dark eyeliner seems clearly to be the same woman but I cannot tell how many others repeat. My usual tricks like eyebrow shape or noses do not help. It seems there are multiple people with similar slender noses. Most are fair haired and the same skin tones. I will have to look up the cast because I am curious if it changed. Hi curious if it changed., I am dad. This picture is giving me a panic attack So how many women are actually in this photo? I can tell Lisa Rinna apart because of her nasty inflated lips.

Not believing this, I went back through the older videos I would watched before to double check. As far as I can tell, the one guy played every role in every video.\n\nI sat there shocked for a long time wrapping my head around the fact that I seem to have it worse than I previously thought.

I am a fan of RuPaul's drag race, but I have to admit I have a really difficult time figuring out what the hell is going on. Not only do I have to memorize a bunch of faces in order to figure out the relationships and drama between the cast, but I have to memorize their faces *twice* so I can match them up in-drag to out-of-drag, and their drag looks keep changing constantly. Fortunately there is a lot of distinct, loud personalities, and my prosopagnosia is relatively mild, but half the time I have no idea what is going on and I am just watching it for the amazing artistry.\n\nJust curious if there are any other constantly-bewildered fans. I am getting a headache just reading that description. That would be so stressful for me to enjoy I think. \n\nEven watching the Great British Bakeoff is tough for me unless they keep saying the contestants' names. Sometimes I would get confused on who made which baked piece when they zoom to the product and do a quick flash of the baker without their name tags. :| I\u2018ve said almost the same thing to my gf -about memorizing everyone twice.\nI usually have better luck learning people by their voice/body type since hair is just not an option for this show lol. Lol! You cannot even use their bodies as cues once they have got heels and padding on. I am so glad Ru introduces them all by name during the runway, and they use the same names in and out of drag. I LOVE Drag Race! I definitely have this issue every time I watch a season for the first time. I watch drag race often as background noise while I am doing other things because it is predictable and something I have repeatedly watched so that definitely helps and I can now tell you just about every moment from the show. I also watch with subtitles which I find incredibly helpful (for any show or movie really). I do not have as much trouble picking out faces in drag and I am thinking it is because it is more painted on and many queens have signature makeup looks (Trixie Mattel for example) , voices or costume styles but yeah out of drag is challenging until I watch a season a few times. I also follow a lot of the queens individually/ have seen them live which I think helps me too. I rewatch as background noise too! Yeah, some of the queens definitely have distinct looks and are easy to pick out, but I still have a really hard time convincing my brain that Brian and Trixie are the same person. The episode of Unhhhh where her and Katya did a \"spa day\" and took off all their makeup totally blew my mind because I could actually see the transition. Haha yeah it is a pretty big difference. I watch a lot of Trixie (Twitch, her YouTube, UNHhhh, her and Katya\u2019s podcast the bald and the beautiful , drag race etc.) so I feel like she is one of the most recognizable for me but I think that is just because of exposure. If you want to watch her actually put all of the makeup on she has makeup tutorials on her YouTube channel.", "Back to school dealing with prosopagnosia.

All those actresses looked like clones too. Yeah, I had some problems sorting out the whos who.  Sitll do It was tough. I got to the 2nd season, went back and started again, and was alright from there. Took me a long long time to figure out those two were twins... Normal people had trouble with it too. Terrible show I had to read the books to keep track That is one of the reasons I like *The Avengers* (the original movie). The characters all look and sound different. Like, you never hear a character speaking and wonder, \"Is that character A or character B?\" I cannot watch *The Flash* for the same reason; everyone on it seems to be in one of two body shapes and I cannot tell if I am looking at two different characters, or the same one with a different hair style. On the other hand, *Arrow* has a nice variety of actors (even if they make up for it by not having a variety in the plot). If you are craving fantasy, *The Magicians* is a series with characters like that, or even *Librarians*.\n\nBut I highly recommend you do not touch *Veronica Mars*. Compared to that show, GOT characters are easy to tell apart. I gave up watching it after the first season exactly because of this. And thought noone else had this problem. and costumes also helps a lot YES. I could only watch it with other people and would warn them ahead of time that I am going to be asking who is who the whole show. there were twice as many characters in that show as I originally thought LOL for sure...all those bearded dudes good riddance, it was a waste of time, the last two seasons were so bad it makes the whole thing not worth it\n\n Same. I gave up after the first season. That happened to me, but with Dark. Yeah watching tv with live actors is really hard...i try to recognize voices when possible.. That sounds like pretty much every ensemble cast TV show I have ever watched. I cannot keep track of everybody. Cop and hospital shows are the worst.  \n\nI have gotten hooked on European TV shows lately (including non-English speaking). They do not cast only beautiful Barbie doll clones in major roles--the people look like REAL people, young, old, fat, thin, pretty, plain. OMG YES same here!

The only way I was able to watch it was by having a friend watch it with me and I would constantly ask him 'wait, which character was that?'. If it were not for his help, I would never have been able to keep any of the characters straight.

Until then, they are either a stranger or a vague memory. When I am watching a movie with someone, I will say, oh that is x from x. My friend will look at me like I am crazy. To me they look like the same person. I know this is probably the wrong one, but I know this is not normal, and it kind of messes up my interactions w customers, so I am sorry, but could I ask for some help? That is exactly what I do. Oh shit that is Renee Zellweger! Wife looks at me like I am crazy and says no that is Wesley Snipes.\n\nAt the time I was completely certain I was right.\n\nThat is face blindness. It does not have to apply to everyone. Although I still do mistake other people for my wife or friends in public.  Nope, sounds like you are in the right place.  That is one of the things my friends make fun of me for, thinking completely different actors look alike because they are dressed similarly or playing the same role or something.  \nI also can recognize people I know without much trouble, but acquaintances who have changed their hair or grown a beard I am never sure its them.  Also bad with remembering names.\n\nI have never been formally evaluated, but I am somewhere on the spectrum with face blindness.  You sound like you are about the same level of recognizing I am more or less.   I too have problems with names, and even people who I know with a new look. Great to know we are not alone. What I have learned from this sub is that: everyone has a slightly different form of the condition. I personally have very little trouble with recognizing people but absolutely no ability to recollect what they look like afterwards... welcome to the sub :) It is not about recognizing or not recognizing, really. It is about *how long* it takes you to recognize someone you know. It is also about *how* you recognize someone you know.\n\nFacial recognition is expected to occur in about 100 thousandths of a second. In other words, \"instantly\". If it takes longer than that, people *can* feel slighted that you did not recognize/notice them. \n\nDepending on the situation, I can recognize my husband \"instantly\". (If I go to bed with my husband, and wake up with a man next to me, my brain knows that it is my husband). \n\nIf we go to the movies and he goes to get us snacks, It will take me several seconds to recognize him. (He is taken off his hat, and there are other people coming into the theater.)\n\nAs for how you recognize someone, sometimes it is their hair. A style, or a color. You may have no problem recognizing this person, but when they change their hair, it takes a moment to recognize them. Maybe you recognize someone by their walk, or their voice. I am really good at \"recognizing\" voices in games or movies. I recognize my son by his hair (it is down to his waist) and the way he walks. \n\nI really wish that website about using rocks as a metaphor for recognizing people when you have prosopagnosia was still up. I used to send people there all the time.\n\nAs for interactions with customers, you have a few options. You can just tell everyone you are face blind and it is nothing personal if you cannot recognize them. This will probably lead to many questions, but people are less insulted.\n\nIf it is important, but short term, like getting an order to the person, take a minute to notice something about them. A necklace, shoes, hair style, eyebrows, etc.\n\nIf it is important, but long term, like a regular customer that comes back and you are expected to know their history with your company, you might want to combine methods 1 and 2 :) Facial recognition occurs instantly??? That is news to me Well, \"instantly\" might have been an overstatement, but I figured that since it happened in less than 100 thousandths of a second it was close enough to \"instantly\" for humans^1. \n\nAnd of course, I am talking about your average person. Not us. Which is why it is news to all of us about how fast other people recognize people :) \n\n^1 Computers, of course, would regard it as a long time, but computers also (right now) take longer recognize people than we do. (We meaning people w/o prosopagnosia.)\n\n^2 \n\n3  You use a lot of the same cues that I do. When I explain my issue to people they always seem surprised that it is not MORE difficult to navigate.

Now I am down an internet worm hole trying to figure out who the blue eyed actor was because I thought it was the main character from the Dead Zone and it is not.

I could read where CC states who was talking, which helped with the FB, and and what they we staying, which helped with the APD.

I am pregnant and I am expecting there is a 50/50 chance my daughter will have it too.\n\nI did not find out until a couple years ago age 29, and it had caused me some awkward times through school; not recognising classmates and teachers etc. \n\nSupposing she does end up having it, I wonder if there are any strategies that would be useful to her. In my experience as an adult I am not sure it helps when you outright say to people \u201csorry I did not recognise you, I have face-blindness\u201d because I do not think most people know it is an actual condition and I am not just making excuses.\n\nI suppose informing her teachers would be helpful. I wonder what difference it would have made for me, knowing i had this problem as a child. Did any of you guys know for sure in childhood? You may already be aware that children with prosopagnosia are commonly misdiagnosed as being autistic.  This is something to watch out for especially when the child is ready for school. Thanks, I was not aware of that I have a large extended family who I did not see that often. When I was young, my mother would drill me about family members by going through an photo album. \n\nPerhaps you can do something like that. If you get ahold of your child's class roster and a previous yearbook, I imagine you could do something similar.\n\nI did not know about Prosopagnosia until my 30s, but just trying to grow up in this world, I naturally found coping mechanisms that worked for me. Perhaps you can learn where she is having issues (what types of people she confuses) and drill specifically those problem areas I do not really have any new suggestions for you but my mom and myself both have it and I just had a daughter two months ago. How I have been trying to maybe help her *not* get it (note, I have **no** idea if this will work or not) is by making sure I stare her in the face A LOT even though it is not really a natural thing for me. I also get her to look at lots of other people's faces. Whenever she is a bit older and can understand I am also going to try the online facial recognition games with her to further help develop the ability. Wear somethings like earings, headbands, hairpins, neckbands... anything to describe yourself. Your child have to recognize his family members first. At school, tell teachers about this problem. Play games about recognizing people in different ways. An actor playing different roles? Try closing your eyes, just listen to the voice and see if you can recognize them.\n\nMy son and I can both recognize Bill Nighy because of his voice and his hands. (His ring and pinky fingers are permanently curled.)\n\nOf course, it is only a game while it is fun :) Stop before it gets frustrating :)  If your daughter is face blind it will be an enormous help to her to know what she is dealing with and the sort of challenges she might face and a few ideas for dealing with it. With that knowledge she will feel confident in developing recognition strategies. Back that up with support from school, friends and family and she will be well ahead. I did not find out I was face blind until I was nearly 50 and spent most of my childhood trying to understand what I kept getting wrong.", "help during lunch i was looking around the cafeteria because i was bored. i started to stare at someone and she stared back. i did not realise that she was an acquaintance who a year older than me. she had tied her hair up which she usually didnt and after i realised i felt so bad and embarrassed. we dont have the best relationship so im worried this would make it worse. what should i do should i apologise? i was thinking of doing that just now but i will be seeing her up close and i thought it would make it more awkward. haha just me overthinking over something i cant control I would not mention it. You were just mindlessly staring into nothing and happened to look in her direction, most people can relate to doing that sometimes. Just either ignore it, or use this as an excuse to break the ice. Like \"hey I was just looking around the cafeteria you looked different with your hair up. I did not recognize you; sorry for staring.\" I also want to say if you are not open about your proso start being. This will help misunderstandings of you being stand offish and\\or rude. My life has gotten better once I started unapologetically telling people, \"Look, I have face blindness and I have no idea who you are\". How often are you going to be seeing this person?  What kind of relationship do you want to have with her?  Is she part of a friends circle that you are in or work in the same place you do?", "Introducing myself. Tips for coping? I was happy to discover this sub yesterday. I have known I have had prosopagnosia for several years, since a friend mentioned he had it. Like most faceblind people, previous to that I thought I was just bad with faces. \n\nI would describe my condition as mild to moderate. I recognize people I know well, but do not recognize acquaintances. I am more likely to recognize people when they are in situations I expect them to be in. I did have one memorable incident when I failed to recognize my own wife when I walked in on her in the kitchen. We would been married about 20 years then! It was only a moment and I did not say anything but it was pretty weird, for me at least. \n\nHow do you cope? How do you learn to recognize other people? I use a lot of coping mechanisms that I have learned are common among faceblind people. I recognize walking styles, and voices, and prominent features, and clothing. I think I need to be more conscious and deliberate about that, and not try to force myself to recognize faces, when I just do not have that skill. A colorblind person is never going to learn to see colors, no matter how hard she tries, but she can use workarounds to make sure her clothes match and she looks good when she leaves the house.\n\nA few years ago I learned a new tip when encountering someone you believe to be a stranger. Do not say, \u201cGood to meet you.\u201d Say, \u201cGood to see you,\u201d instead. \n\nMy job takes me to a lot of professional conferences. I do not it is coincidental that I have chosen a career where people often wear name badges. \n\nWhat other tips do you have to recognize people and social keep situations flowing?\n\nDespite my prosopagnosia, I think I am actually above average at remembering people. Not HUGELY above average \u2014 I am no prodigy \u2014 but once I \u201cclick\u201d and remember that I already know someone, I am more likely than most people to remember what that person and I previously talked about. \n\nHere is a slightly funny story that my fellow faceblind people might sympathize with: I took a renewed interest in my face blindness following an incident Monday. My wife and I went out of town for Thanksgiving week and, as we always do when we both travel, we dropped the dog off at a boarding facility. It is the same boarding place we have been using for the dog\u2019s entire, five year life. When I was picking her up Monday, a woman came out from the back room and greeted me by name. We chatted a moment and I said, \u201cI am sorry, I do not remember your name.\u201d \n\nShe instantly got chilly and made a sarcastic remark. I could tell she was hurt I did not remember her, and I felt bad. \n\nSo I cursed my face blindness \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 and read more about it over the next few days. \n\nThen last night I said to my wife, \u201cYou know, I do not think it was my faceblindness that caused me to forget that young woman\u2019s name. I think I just did not remember her.\u201d She just did not make an impression on me. Perfectly nice young woman, and I now feel a little bad that I did not remember her, but we only drop the dog off at this boarding place a couple of times a year and we are always insanely busy and distracted, either getting ready for or returning from a trip. And dropping off your dog at a boarding place is kind of stressful, and picking the dog up is stressful in a different way. And so ANYONE might have forgotten this young woman under those circumstances. Even people with a normal degree of facial recognition might have that problem.\n I am similar to you. \n\nIf I am meeting someone casually I just say \"hi! I am terrible with both names and faces so you might have to introduce yourself to me 20 more times but eventually I will get it\". People seem to like that because it lets them off the hook of having to remember me too. \n\nI have not figured out more formal settings yet.  I just generally let people think I am a space cadet. In reality I pay more attention to my surroundings than other people, but when people are right up next to me and say \"hi!\" I say \"oh, hey! sorry, did not see you there.\" Usually when they start talking to me I can tell who they are. If I cannot, I treat them in a very specific way: overly friendly but not to the point of overstepping boundaries. Like I will ask someone I think is a stranger how their weekend was, or if they are at work I will say \"how is stuff going up there?\" because even if they work on a floor below me it is reasonable for me to forget what floor their office is on (though I should remember their department).  \n\n\nOne person did send me a long facebook message which was actually creepy because of how he responded: he thought I was ignoring him and apologized, saying he was just trying to be friendly and has a daughter my age. In reality I just did not know I knew him (even after getting this message from him I do not remember where I saw him and ignored him, but I imagine it was in the work kitchen). Even though I was kind of creeped out by his response, I told him about my faceblindness and made him feel better, but I am sure I have ignored him a bunch of times since then as well. I do this too!  Pretending to be randomly preoccupied looking at scenery or thinking, and to be slightly startled when someone greets you.  \"Oh!  Sorry, I was day dreaming!  How are you?\"\n\nAnd the whole friendly thing.  I smile a lot.  People think it is me being happy and nice, but I expect I developed the habit as a child, because you never know who you might know!  Definitely the downside is sometimes you can be friendly to the wrong people, who then overshare or act creepy and you have to deal with them.  But most people seem to like the extra friendliness in my area. I am pretty similar to you also.  Before I understood what was going on, I thought I was bad at names.  So I focused more on learning names, and then knew all these names, but not who anyone was.  So then I thought I was being selfish and not really paying attention to people.  I started really focusing on what people are saying, and basically remembered all the details from a casual conversation...but had an even harder time recognizing them, because I did not focus on what they looked like.  And remembering the date that a very casual acquaintance's daughter got a dog three months later makes people uncomfortable.  Making mental notes of people's appearance (not clothes if I will see them another day, although style is okay) helps.\n\nI know some people say they have face blindness.  I do not.  Because it is not commonly known (and when known, often only extreme cases) it has not been helpful.  A few people I told, get it and help me.  Some do not believe me unless I explain in depth.  A lot say, \"Oh I have that too,\" when they clearly do not.  So basically it requires a big long conversation, and my coping skills are usually good enough that it is not worth the trouble for me.\n\nWhat I have found works is to say \"I am really bad at recognizing faces.\" Yep, face blindness often leads to us feeling guilty or awkward.  That man certainly does sound creepy. This does seem to be an example of my theory that faceblindness is not linked to any diminishment of awareness of social cues.  Well, autistic people are more likely to be faceblind, so there is definitely some correlation.  I used to be a teacher, before I knew about face blindness, and it was a special kind of hell. \n\nI banned baseball caps because, as difficult as it is to recognize folks under normal circumstances, any guy in a baseball cap looks like every single other guy ever in the history of the world in a baseball cap.\n\nAnd still, I struggled. It was embarrassing and detrimental to my students, because I could not accurately give them participation grades, because I did not know who was who. And if they had to give speeches, goodness help me, I could only hope they would included their name on the paperwork they handed in at the beginning.\n\nI am SO GLAD to know what is wrong with me now!\n\nAnd now, I am really bold about it. When I meet someone for the first time, if time permits, I just right away say, \"Hey, I know this is weird, but I have a facial recognition processing disorder called prosopagnosia. It means that while I will remember you and our conversations, I will not be able to recognize your face later.\"\n\nPeople are generally very kind about it, and usually ask a bunch of follow-up questions.\n\nOn other occasions, when someone I know greets me in public without telling me their name, I will say, right away before the conversation gets going, \"I am so sorry. I have a facial recognition processing disorder. Can you please tell me who you are?\"\n\nThen, when they tell me their name, I will effusively greet them and tell them something I remember from our last conversation, or otherwise signal to them that I KNOW them, I just did not recognize them.\n\nThis has been effective for me. If I were a teacher now (and, in fact, I am starting to teach some classes again later this winter), I would simply require name tags and explain my reason.\n\nRegarding getting better at recognizing... I mean, I can try to memorize people's facial features, and I certainly rely on a lot of contextual clues, but in the end, I am just never going to be good at recognizing faces, no matter how hard I work at it. I have decided to reserve my energy for things I AM good at... and just explain myself when this particular thing crops up. Excellent tips. However, I am not so keen on saying \"I have a facial recognition processing disorder called prosopagnosia.\" I do not want to label myself as mentally disabled! No one has indicated a diminished opinion of me as a result of this, but everyone has different comfort levels. Maybe I ought to just suck it up and do it. :) \"I am hit-or-miss recognizing faces. It is a neurological condition called 'prosopagnosia' or 'face blindness.'\" That does not seem so bad.  You do what is comfortable for you. :) Play around with it until you find something that works and that feels right to you. Sounds from your later comment like you have found something you are happy with for now.\n\nI definitely find it is easier to function when I am up front with folks, but everyone is preferences are different. You do you. :) I just go with \"sorry, Ive got some face blindness\" \"or \" damned faceblindness, sorry\"   if anyone notices anything, and explain if they ask.  I have never been formally tested, but I fit all the descriptions I can see.  I can learn what people look like, but it takes a while, and is very context heavy until I know someone really well, even then it can be iffy.  It helps that I am usually a bit of a goofball anyway. Can I ask if you have ever handed out something like a business card explaining Prosopagnosia?  I have tried this \u201cup front bold approach\u201d that you have described, but it generally leads to so many questions and sometimes feels that the listener does not believe it. Like it is too crazy to be true. \nI would  Appreciate any ideas you have. Thank you.  I know what you mean about feeling that people do not believe it. I do get that feeling sometimes, or they laugh it off like, \"Oh, yeah, I am bad at names,\" which indicates they do not understand that I really, really will not actually recognize them at all.\n\nFor me, the specific words, \"I have a facial recognition processing disorder\" seems to break that pattern. For whatever reason, that specific combination just seems to \"work\"\u2013people respond with a sort of \"Oh, I see!\" that feels like they really understand.\n\nAnd then, yes, they ask the questions. ALL OF THE QUESTIONS. lol.\n\nI have a blog entry I wrote some time ago about my personal experience, that I refer people to if they really want to know details. Otherwise, I just try to field the basic questions and move on as best we can. It helps to start asking them questions about themselves. Nobody loves anything as much as talking about themselves, lol.\n\nA card explaining it would be an interesting experiment. Maybe that would really work to help folks take it seriously, and reduce the explaining. Might especially be good for introverted folks who would rather NOT talk about it (I actually do not mind talking about it). \n\nIf it had a nice, official look (like maybe something official from the face blindness institute?), it also would help folks take it seriously. I would be very interested if you decide to pursue something like that... or perhaps it is worth mentioning to the folks at faceblind.org, that they might create something like that.", "I *think* I get the joke....

I have taken some of those online tests and I fail pretty miserably at recognizing faces that i really should recognize... I think Keanu Reeves and Queen Elizabeth, Richard Nixon and Ronald Regan were the only famous people I recognized correctly in one of those \"mask all the hair etc so you just see their face\" tests... and Keanu Reeves I only got right because I said fully half the men looked like Keanu Reeves to me, so I lucked out on the actual one...   \n\n\nI can tell my mom from pictures taken of her during my lifetime even over the years as she aged and her hair changed, but i literally can not pick her out of a lineup in her school / dance pictures .. my own mom... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is my experience in a nutshell, what is yours? I encounter the same situations.\n\nI decided to try to find informations the day I realised I did not recognize myself in my mirror. I was in front of it, so I knew it was me but I told myself \"I did not remember I had this face\". I felt like it was an other person that looked at me. Really bad experience !\n\nAt this time I thought I was schizophrenic...\nmy researches on the internet about \"not recognizing my own face\" made me find articles about famous persons who have prosopagnosia.\nAnd after having put a name on my disorder, I could find articles and books about it and understand better what I have been through.\n\nThe problem is that in France, I cannot find anything about it and I really need to learn more about it.\n\nThe reason I want to talk to people who live the same is that, if I was first released to \u0137now, now I realised that sometimes it really makes me feel sad.\n\nThe harder for me it is I cannot visualise faces of people  in my mind, and so, I cannot even visualise the face of the person I love to keep him in my mind...\nOf course there are lots of other situations prosopagnosia makes my life uncomfortable, but at this time this is what bother me the most.\n oops... !\nSorry I have not posted at the right place...

I am sorry for you, but I am also glad that I am not the only one in this case.\nAs I said people around me does not realise what it is like and they do not understand.\nSome of them even told me that it was unkind to say that... And how \"bad\" is your prosopagnosia ? I only recognise people I am close to and have seen a lot up close for a long time. I am also pretty good at actors when I see them a lot but I could never recognise them outside. The other a famous youtuber walked by me and I could not tell Welcome! My face blindness probably is not as bad as some, but I think my coping skills keep me from truly feeling how bad it is. If someone changes their hair or beard or puts on a hat, I have a hard time unless I know them really well. I recently spent half an episode of a show I watch often (Father Brown) not connecting the \"disheveled fugitive\" to the police inspector in the flashbacks. His hairline was different. That is all.  It is nice to meet you! I am new here as well, I was hoping to find a community online. I just figured out I was prosopagnosic this past March.\n\nI am a native English speaker; I did study French a little in school. I think your writing is clear and concise. It is impressive to have those skills :) thank you for the compliment !\n\nI hope it will help us to share our experiences with proso, because even people around us seem to believe us, they do not really understand what it is like and sometimes I feel like they think that I am exaggerating...\nAnd you, how bad is yours ? I agree with you, I am always worried that people will think I am making up or exaggerating my condition to get attention. When really, I would prefer not to have these awkward conversations at all. That is why speaking to a researcher was so important to me, because it felt like proof that my prosopagnosia was real (although when I look at all the evidence, it is very obviously real.)\n\nI am not aware of a scale to which I can compare my own experience, but I think my prosopagnosia is moderate. It does not interfere with my life too much, but I definitely have trouble identifying people and sometimes avoid initiating social interactions because I am scared of making a mistake. For most people, if I get to know them well over an extended period of time, I can learn their face. Some people are too bland, though \\^\\^' ASk them if they would think it was unkind to expect someone in a wheelchair to dance?  Or asking a blind person if they liked the color of thier shirt.

I am pretty sure I have a mild form of prosopagnosia. I have to meet/hang out with someone like ten times to actually be able to recognize their face. And then I am always still second guessing myself when I see them in a different setting, different hairstyle, etc.\n\nI am also TERRIBLE at recognizing certain items. For instance, types of cars. I have ridden in my friends' cars thousands of times, but I still would not be able to single them out. I usually use cues like color, general suv/sedan size, and license plate letters and numbers to figure it out.\n\nSame goes for houses. I have to force myself to try to notice the set up of the driveway and house and what the front door color is to be able to remember the house. I also use cues such as the number on the address to make sure I am walking inside of houses I have been to before.\n\nAnybody else? Do I have a different disorder entirely? Cars and houses are a disaster. They make so many boring, identical ones. Nah, that is all standard prosopagnosia shit. We all suck at cars and houses. I believe there *are* types of agnosia that apply to multiple categories of things. But I have the same symptoms you describe\u2014I often get the wrong house or the wrong car\u2014and I do not have prosopagnosia or any other type of agnosia, as far as I know.\n\nMy husband (who has prosopagnosia) says that \"all men's dress shoes\" or \"all suits\" look the same, and he sometimes kind of blames it on the prosopagnosia. Personally, I think it is just that he is not interested in clothes or shoes. People have a better memory for things they have detailed knowledge of. I think that because he has prosopagnosia, he sometimes imagines that *all* categories of things\u2014not just faces\u2014have secret features he cannot access that make them really easy for other people to tell apart. A specific deficit I have noticed is having no sense of directional orientation inside a building. For instance, I have no idea which door to exit; I tend to take the nearest exit and walk around the building to my car, while my friends ask \"why did not you take the much closer exit?\" And most people seem able to point in the general direction of, say, Washington or the Pacific Ocean, while I am basically guessing.\n\nI am curious if other prosopagnosia people have this problem or if it is just me. I have prosopagnosia and aphantasia (no mental images) but I can remember houses (because I remember them spatially) and vehicles based off of their license plate numbers (but cannot remember the shapes or colors or other visual cues). My theory just from how my brain ridiculousness is and my mom's is (she has prosopagnosia too) is that it is more of a grey area/spectrum, depending where your deficits are you may not see faces, images, colors, etc. but some others might. I do not know how to explain it.  I do not have an official diagnosis. I tend to score in line with prosopagnosia scores when taking the \"quizzes\" I have taken so far.    I do tend to get better recognizing people over time, so I guess I might not have it, so take my comment with a grain of salt. (I mostly rely on hair or general profile, mannerisms when recognizing people)\n\nI have heard the \"difficulty with directions\" a lot, so I think there is probably some correlation.\n\nFor myself, I am the exact opposite way. I have a fantastic sense of direction, and I can almost always remember directions if I have traveled the path once or twice.", "Remembering Voices So I have seen people post here that photographs are very important to them, because they cannot remember faces of loved ones.  I do not feel like that.  I cannot remember faces of loved ones and I LIKE photographs, but they are not really important to me.  Faces just do not have the same significance to me that some people have; a lot of people seem to describe them as like the essence or core of a person's being, and I just do not experience the world like that.\n\nBUT when I am remembering someone, I can hear their voice in my head.  I guess I \"visualize\" the voices of loved ones not their faces?  My sister died a couple of years ago, and imagining her voice is far more meaningful to me than trying to imagine or look at her picture.  I do not have a particularly good ear for sound in general, but I seem to have adapted a pretty good ear for people's voices probably because of the proso.  I wonder if it is the same for other people. I love pictures, but like you, they do not help on the facial side of things. Sometimes, I cannot recognize the people in those pictures... though I \"should\" be able to. I recognize people's voices, but more than that, I recognize their \"aura\" if you will. Not colours or anything, but their maneurisms and silent ways that transform a room, make people feel, how they would react to a situation. My grandfather was calm, strong, stubborn, yet vulnerable. More than anything, you could feel the care he had for everyone in a room. I may struggle to remember faces, but I can remember his \"aura\" as though I saw him yesterday. And to me, that is far more important and comforting than a face, simply because that is my reality. When I see a picture of him, that is what is evoqued, too. Yeah, people just feel like themselves.  It is a combination of who they act and who they are.  I guess I connect it more with their voice than their face.", "Today I asked a stranger if I could go home with him So for context my brother and I work in the same warehouse and sometimes carpool together since we usually have similar shifts on the weekends. I am also hard of hearing and he knows a few signs/I am shy so I stick around my brother a lot. Also I was raised calling him \u201cbrother\u201d so I say \u201chey bro\u201d or just \u201cbrother\u201d to get his attention sometimes.\n\nWell we got separated when we walked into work but ended up next to each other in the queue line to get our assigned stations for the day and I thought that was cool since it never works out that way. I was excitedly talking/signing to him as the line was slow and we chatted for a minute or two until the line moved. A few minutes later I thought, \u2018oh I should double check that I can get a ride back home with him after work since we are off at different times.\u2019 So I turned around and asked \u201cHey bro can I go home with you tonight?\u201d He gave me the most perplexed look and I tried to sign \u2018go home\u2019 while asking again and he looked really confused and then muttered something. I got closer and then heard what I assumed was \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nI felt confused but figured maybe something came up so I said ok and figured I would just double check on my break when I could text him. Well I got to the front and got my assignment but when I turned back around to head to the door I realised that the man who would been standing behind me in line looked just like my brother but in completely different clothes, like baggier and a different style. We gave each other the strangest look as I walked away and all I could think was \u2018did I not notice my brother wearing that? Wtf?\u2019 I got to my station and about an hour later my \u201cbrother\u201d walked by in the same clothes and we stared at each other the whole time. I kept thinking, \u2018ok did I piss off my bro or something? What in the hell is happening?\u2019\n\nThen it clicked. That is not my brother. I messaged him on my break and he said he would been standing behind me in line but they would pulled him aside part way through to give him a different assignment, I just had not noticed (probably cuz I cannot hear shit lol). So I had talked to him at the beginning, that was indeed my brother. But after that? I just asked a complete stranger if I could go home with him. Now my brother will not stop sending me gifs congratulating me on my \u201cgame\u201d lol Ahaha I am so sorry that you have to deal with this but it is also quite the story!!!! Thanks for sharing. Makes me feel better about all of my faux pas. This is one of the funniest prosopagnosia faux pas I have heard. I hope you can shrug it off. I have to ask are you a man or a woman? I am a 25yo girl if that helps you imagine the ridiculousness of it all WOW :D  hahaha! Thanks for sharing!! that is definitely something that fits on /r/TIFU\n\nI think most children have gone through the \"hold a stranger's hand thinking they are mom/dad\" thing once or twice. But only we get to experience that as adults hahaha \n\nDid you go back to explain to the stranger? No because I do not know what he looks like lol. Although I did ask my bro that if he finds a guy that kind of looks like him to tell the guy that his little sister is just a weirdo with some face blindness and he said he was going to tell everyone because it was hilarious so there is that, got to love older brothers haha Omg I just saw the meme posted and was going to post it here. But its still you hahaha.\n\nDid I just have username prosopagnosia!?  Hahaha so funny! Such a great story. Do you also have some other embarrassing moment because of Prosopagnosia? Oh too many to count, I am just an all around an awkward person, and having brain damage really amplified it by like x10. There was that time pre-covid where my brother and I (he is my safety so we really do just stick together) went to my favourite huge bookstore and I was SO excited. I found this enormous rare book on a top shelf and I wanted to show him so I turned around to touch his arm and get his attention, glancing at him momentarily. \n\nDid not understand why my brother was suddenly so startled by my frantic pointing at this cool book and I got in his personal space to explain how important it was that the store had it in stock because it meant we could read a 100 year old book and that was super neat. The stranger did not really agree and when my brother walked out of an aisle and called over to me, the man and I looked at each other and the guy walked away. I kind of just stood there and definitely should have said sorry or explained but it was like I was trying to process \u201coh. Oh no. Shit.\u201d  And the guy was gone before I could.", "Trying to understand prosopagnosia I am curious about how prosopagnosia/face blindness works. I have read a bit about it but still cannot really understand it beyond the written explanations, so I thought I would try and educate myself a bit better on the matter by asking people here. My basic understanding so far is that most people with prosopagnosia can still see faces, they just cannot recognise people by their faces and they cannot differentiate between faces (correct me if that is wrong).\n\nSo, I guess the part I am confused about is just to do with what people with prosopagnosia actually perceive with their eyes and how it translates to their brain/memory.\n\nI know that as someone without prosopagnosia, I remember peoples\u2019 faces pretty distinctly and I can visualise them in my mind when I think about that person. So if a person with face blindness looks at someone standing in front of them, do they still see the face exactly as it is, but they just are not able to commit it to memory in a visual way and they cannot use that face to remember a person later on?\n\nThe only thing I can think of that sounds like it might be somewhat similar is what it is like when I am reading a fictional novel and trying to visualise one of the characters. Whenever I read a book, even if the character is given a large amount of detailed physical description, I cannot picture a face in my head. I can visualise isolated traits one at a time (e.g. I can picture their eyes, or their mouth shape), but I cannot for the life of me form a complete face altogether. I can picture buildings, landscapes, animals, made-up creatures and a lot of other aspects of a fictional world in great detail, but I cannot visualise new faces. All I can imagine is their clothes, hair, etc, with their face as a whole being unclear and completely missing from the equation. I know that is not the same as prosopagnosia and I am sure most people do that when reading books. But is that kind of experience similar to how it is for people with prosopagnosia when trying to remember or visualise faces in their mind that they have seen in real life, or is it completely different?\n\nThank you :) Whenever I try to picture the face of someone I know, its completely blurry (almost like the haunted pictures from the movie The Ring). I use hair, voice, clothing (or typical style), walking style, body shape, and context to identify people. When I am looking at someone I can identify their unique features and sometimes recall them (\"she had really big eyes\" or \"he had very high cheek bones\") but I cannot visualize it in my mind. I can draw faces if I am looking right at them, but the moment I look away I could not continue. I can recognize myself from a picture, but I have lost my mom in stores too many times to count when I was a kid. If people change their hair style, I will literally not know who they are and it is very unsettling for me. When I was a teen (before I knew I had facial blindness) I hated videos of myself when I was little because I did not recognize it was me and literally thought everyone was lying about it. Thank you very much, that helps a lot :) I like the tree analogy someone posted a while back.  If you look at a tree, you can see the tree.  You can count the leaves and identify the species and see how the branches fork and everything.  If you are not looking at a tree, you can still describe its basic characteristics and draw a picture of a tree.\n\n But if someone showed you thirty trees in pots, gave them each a name, then shuffled them and asked you which was which, how successful would you be at identifying each individual tree?  And half the trees had been swapped out for new ones and nobody had told you because they assumed you recognize every tree?\n\nAlso, the trees get angry or upset if you fail to immediately know who is who.\n\n Maybe you would know that one had a funny-shaped branch, and another was unusually large or small, but for the most part, the task would be insurmountable, despite your eyes working fine.\n\nThat is face blindness in a nutshell.  Came here to say this, but I was going to use rocks instead of trees. I like your example better. That is a great example. Mine is the same but with pictures of cats- easy to distinguish until you put out a second set of pics in different backgrounds and positions. I can tell my 2 (former) black cats apart . I can easily spot my tuxedo vs. Dad's tux. All brown tabbies do NOT look alike, regardless of the fact that they have similar features.   \n\nIt makes it more personal because they are pets, they have more specific features than a tree would. Radiolab has a great episode on prosopagnosia; it helped me understand myself so much! I highly suggest it. \n\nFor me, I have always described it like walking through a forest path: the first time, each tree you meet chats with you and gives you their name. A few of them have super distinctive features (a giant root, rough / spotted bark) but a lot of them look the same, so you memorize them based on who they are near (yes, I tend to do this. If people hang out together, I will memorize the group of names until I can sort them all out). But then, you walk back through the forest, and the trees get angry/will not let you through if you cannot remember their names. Only problem is they keep getting transplanted/changing locations and the path keeps moving around, oh, and some of them lose their leaves (get haircuts) and others drift into the forest...and then one day you are walking down the street and a giant tree in the sidewalk expects you to know it, and you are like, what the heck who are you...\n\nYeah. Life's confusing. Like I remember people based on their hair color and the context. If I know you at work and I see you at the beach--not going to recognize you. Recently, I did a three-hour-long engagement photo session with a couple, and then tried to introduce myself to the guy at an event. He was so confused and I seriously felt like I would never seen him before. \n\nAnother point here is that for a lot of us, our directionality and navigational skills are screwed up! It is the same area of the brain. I have to work really hard to figure out and keep track of where I am. I know how to use a map and how to navigate new places -- It is more not \"recognizing\" where I am, if that makes sense. I will be a few streets away from my house and feel utterly lost, like I have never seen this street before, until I pull out Google and navigate to a landmark. \n&gt;Whenever I read a book, even if the character is given a large amount of detailed physical description, I cannot picture a face in my head.\n\nI know this is a complete aside, but reading that reminds me of ( which I also experience (in addition to a certain amount of prosopagnosia).\n\nI have always wondered how much overlap there is in other people. Like another commenter, I also have aphantasia, so I never picture anything in general, let alone faces.\n\nMy prospagnosia is probably on the milder end, as I can recognise most people I see if I see them often enough, but it tends to take a while, like a few weeks/months of regular contact, and I tend not to be able to recognise them if I have not seen them for a while.\n\nIf I see their faces, I can probably describe them like I would with any other objects\u2014the issue is with making the connection between that description and the physical appearance. I can end up remembering a string of facts about a person like a phone number if I really tried, but it just does not come that naturally.\n\nThe details of a person\u2019s face is just way too much to process, especially with conscious effort, although as I have mentioned, I get enough of the overall picture to recognise people that I am close with after a long period of time. I would not be able to describe what my parents look like to you because until right now when I am writing this comment, I have never actively tried to make those descriptions about them, but I will recognise them when I see them. I imagine that people with severe prospagnosia are kind of like that too, but they do not eventually start to recognise people like I do over the course of months. For anyone looking for the Radiolab episode:\n\n ( I can recognize people eventually, it just takes me much much longer, and its usually tied into a gestalt of who they are, unless I know them really well.  Like I can recognize family and friends no problem, but well known co-workers out of the office?  Nope.  I tend to use everything BUT the face to identify people, hair, walk, voice, location, etc etc and the face is the last thing I remember. My experience is often having to use social to look up what my friends and family look like if I have not seen them recently. Everyone in my memory looks generic. When asked to describe someone I will inadvertently sound sarcastic by saying things like \"uh he had a nose and two eyes and-\" because any featured beyond that are not logged. Hearing how police sketch artists can accurately capture someone is appearance is mind-boggling. In short, I would say everyone looks like generic stick figures. I like to use gorillas in my example. It is easier to understand I think because they also have faces that can be just as unique as human faces, but most people could not tell them apart. Aside-ish: I ran into a guy today who I had not seen in a couple years. He recognized me immediately, I Did not recognize him in the least until he spoke and I immediately recognized his voice. I do not suppose he has changed much, he is just a normal looking guy. \n\nIf you do not have blue hair or facial tattoos, I have difficulty recognizing people by face. Voice, manner of dress, way of walking... that is how I recognize people. This is a bit like me, but when I try to picture faces of people I am really close with, I can sort of only visualize small parts of their face at a time. It is hard for me to like visualize the entire face. The only way I can is if sort of zoom \"out\" and then it will flash in my brain for about a second and disappear. Where did you read that navigational skills are the same part of the brain? I have nav issues too and suspected this a bit but do not think I saw any good reports on it. I think Oliver Sacks mentioned it in an interview.  \n\n(I have navigational issues too.) Funny story as an example (sorry, I am on mobile):\n\nWhen I was in college, I witnessed a theft. Literally the only witness that actually faced the thief (yeah... not the win they thought it was). At the time, I had absolutely NO idea I was face blind. I wait for the cops, and about 45minutes later an officer joins me and asks a few routine questions:\n\n\n*what did he look like?*\n\"Tall, thin, white, wearing a hoody and carrying a backpack over his shoulder.\"\n\n\nTurns out, not entirely what he was after, so he tries again.\n\n*ok, what else?*\n\n\"Ugh, white t-shirt, blue coat, jeans, blonde, short hair.\"\n\n\nCue WTF look. So now, he is thinking maybe I am not a witness.\n\n\n*where did he go? What path did he take?*\n\n\"He entered through the cafeterias main door. He walked with a long gait straight through to the staff door like he knew where he was going. I assumed he worked there. He was in the room for less than 5 minutes, but at least 2 minutes. He exited the room and put his hoody up. I heard the staff shout about a wallet which is when the thief and I both locked eyes. He then booked it outside, through the main door. He was calm until he realized he had been seen.\"\n\n\nSo now he is convinced. He asks me for more descriptions, but that is all I had. He was confused. I was confused by his confusion. It was a whole thing. He asked me how old the suspect was, I said I dont know, \"I am not good with that stuff\". He asked me to guess how old he (the officer) was. I obviously got that wrong based on his exasperated look. He went off to find a camera. I was not contacted again. (I could tell you in 10-20 year increments, nothing more precise).\n\n\nNow I understand that he was asking for what the thief's face looked like. To this day, I could not tell you. But to me, my description was on point. I provided details that were key and relevant and detailed... to anyone that does not see faces. He wanted details that would allow him to identify the person based on their face, but we did not speak the same language as it were.  I can see the emotions flash across faces, read body language more effectively and quickly than most, but I cannot describe that face. I would not even know where to start.\n\n\nTldr: Truly, the worst person to describe a suspect in a random crime. When you look at pictures of a dog (or a cat) (of the same breed), are you able to tell, just by looking at the face, that this is your friend's dog vs that famous acting dog etc? You can still perceive the face, but you do not automatically process it in an identifying way. I cannot remember where I first read it, but I  googled \"prosopagnosia navigation\" and found these: \n\n(\n\n(\n\n\"Other deficits from damage to adjacent structures . . . Topographic disorientation, a disorder in which subjects get lost in familiar surroundings, is commonly reported with acquired prosopagnosia. A recent review found mention of topographic difficulty in 29% of 147 cases.( One possible explanation is the close proximity of the parahippocampal place area,( an area activated when viewing scenes, to the fusiform face area (FFA),( which is activated by viewing faces. In developmental prosopagnosia, there are anecdotal reports of both impaired( and preserved( navigational abilities. A recent study found that most patients with acquired prosopagnosia, regardless of lesion location, were impaired in scene and landmark recognition, while those with occipitotemporal lesions were also impaired in the ability to form cognitive maps,( and either deficit was rare in developmental prosopagnosia. \" I think the assumption there though is that prosopagnosia is from brain damage. I have never been in an accident or had any significant head trauma though. Maybe just different forms of it. &gt;So if a person with face blindness looks at someone standing in front of  them, do they still see the face exactly as it is, but they just are  not able to commit it to memory in a visual way and they cannot use that  face to remember a person later on?\n\nThis is exactly it. It is not a problem with vision or perception, it is a problem with memory. I perceive the exact same thing as anyone else with normal vision, I just cannot remember it or recognize it later. \n\nI see that other people have made some analogies already, but imagine you went to the zoo and saw 4 giraffes. If you went to the zoo again the next month and saw 5 giraffes, would you be able to identify which one you had not seen last time? Would you notice if they had all been replaced with different ones? &gt;Also, the trees get angry or upset if you fail to immediately know who is who.\n\n\\^this, so much this\n\n\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude06 Ah, gotcha. Mine's from head trauma. Who knows - maybe my mom dropped me on my head as a kid and will not tell me :) I genuinely thought the whole \"police sketch artist\" thing was just a fictional trope until I learned I was faceblind. I would do some reading of Oliver Sacks - he is written on it in a very digestible way. It has nothing to do with visualization. Some people are good at visualizing things in their mind, some are not, regardless of whether they can recognize faces.\n\nImagine seeing 100 dogs of the same breed. They all look slightly different. You can see them perfectly well. You can describe them perfectly well. But can you recognize them without fail one by one, every time, even after seeing them every day for many weeks? Maybe you can pick one or two out based on something odd like the one with the white left ear or the one with the missing tail that always comes up to you first, but that is it. They all look the same, not literally the same, but they do not look different enough to know which is which.\n\nIt is just like that. You can tell the difference between people, you can describe their faces, you can see them perfectly well. But that is simply not enough to know which one of the thousands of people you have met in your life it is with 100% certainty. So many people have brown hair, brown eyes, a beard, glasses and a slightly square face. You probably know 20 such people. You can narrow it down to the 4 that work in your office but still, that is a 75% chance of getting it wrong. I think your idea of not being able to picture faces from descriptions of characters in novels is probably similar to what prosopagnosiacs experience in real life. Personally, I think that those detailed character descriptions in novels ***help*** me to picture them in a \"holistic\" way that I would not if I had seen them in real life.", "A face blind meetup would be great because we could all agree to wear name tags and KEEP THEM ON, but also, you know, no one would ever be certain who was who And if someone got robbed, the police would get frustrated with our attempts to describe the suspect Nice try, robber! I like the idea.  Especially how it would not get awkward to be obviously checking the tags. I have been a volunteer summer camp counselor at a sleepaway camp where **everyone** has to wear their nametags all the time, and it is *paradise* for my little faceblind heart. If I see a camper without their nametag, I can tell them to go back to their cabin to get their nametag. (More than once, I have said this to some of the campers *from my own cabin*, but, well, I simply cannot recognize them!). \n\nIt is absolutely amazing. A conference for faceblind folks would be amazing because we would all keep our nametags on at all times! Well, Officer, the robber was the guy who was not wearing a name tag, duh. \n\nHe was tall, had a crew cut, a black and yellow striped sweater, and black jeans. Just do not ask me to identify him in a police lineup or ask me to describe his face to a sketch artist... I do the same, but unfortunately we only wear the nametags for a couple of days at the start of the camp.

Took me ages to pick up on that too I remember reading that in a kids magazine at the time. Never saw the resemblance. The amount of metaphor and symbolism in film that requires understanding and detecting changes in faces is astonishing. Honestly, that is when I feel the most disabled at a systemic level for prosopagnosia. The Wizard of Oz is also the gatekeeper of the Emerald City. Wooow just looked that up. In stills with the same lighting I can tell, but on the ship his hat made his eyes so sunken looking. I always thought it was a different person. I was today years old when i learned this Woooah! I will have to look that up. I did notice the witch was the lady who stole the dog. I believe someone told me the companions are also Dorothy's relatives but the makeup and props are too obscuring. Yes, that is all true. The actor who plays the Wizard is also Professor Marvel in Kansas and the Carriage Driver in the Emerald City. Listen to their voices as a clue. By the way, the Lion, Tin Man, and Scarecrow are not the relatives, they are the farmhands. In other words, Aunty Them and Uncle Henry are not in Oz, but Hunk, Zeke, and Hickory are the Lion, the Tin Man, and Scarecrow. Ohhhh okay I forgot about the farmhands. Thanks! If it makes it any better, I cannot tell either and I do not have prosopagnosia. I have stared at this for ten minutes and cannot see it at all. I am sure the angle does not help When I stare at their noses and look really carefully and analyze it like a regular 3D shape and calculate the angles and curves in my head.... I still do not see the resemblance. o3o WHAT At the same time though, I have found that at some points in my life I have almost been at a strange advantage. For instance, there were 2 sisters I knew that went to church with my family and I liked them. They had slightly different mannerisms and used slightly different slang so that is how I could tell them apart. The funny thing is, nobody introduced them to me as \u201cthe twins\u201d I just knew them as the family from church and that they were sisters. It was not until my sister mentioned the twins that I was confused. Nobody understood my uncanny superpower to be able to tell twins apart lol, but when it comes to coworkers that I do not have an actual relationship with? I can work with them for 5 years and still not really know who is who lol Also he plays Lucius Malefoy in Harry Potter and the one that really blew me away when I looked him up was he is Captain Lorca in the first season of Star Trek Discovery. WTF. This guy has to many faces Yeah, there are weird things that I am better at, probably because my compensation strategies are more effective in a few cases. Like twins.

I am shocked enough to reach out to you, her husband.\" Husband says, \"yes, that would seem unusual to you, here is an explanation that 100% explains it.\" Friend says, \"No, I reject your factual explanation and instead will cling to my confusion and displeasure because ____.\" \n\nI do not know how to fill in that blank because I simply cannot imagine why a person would choose to stay upset and reject a reasonable explanation. Are they just looking for drama in their lives? Do they not want to admit they would never heard of something like faceblindness? Do they just want to be a victim?\n\nPeople are saying friend should watch videos or read up on faceblindness. But she will not.

Neither can most witnesses.  Witnesses suck.  Look for distinguishing marks, tattoos, scars, remember their clothes, etc. I am always simultaneously stunned and struck by the hilarious accuracy of how this is depicted on TV and film.  Fun fact: Before I was diagnosed, I had a guy break into my house, and I saw him.  I tried to remember clothing, but they really wanted me to make a facial match.  I even did a police sketch.  It did not go well.  If it happened again today, I would do my best, but I would tell them about the prosopagnosia, and explain that I would not be able to make a positive ID. It is funny you brought this up! I was watching a show about one of these reconstructive artists and it made me realize that I could not even describe my own Dad, Mom or even my children accurately.  I hate it! I once encountered a van with a business logo driving erratically in the middle of the night. I called the company to complain. The company said the van was stolen. They did not seem very excited that I found it, so I figured it was their standard answer when they suspect their employee was driving drunk.\n\nI am not one to call the police, but since they said it was stolen, and I figured they were lying, I decided to call their bluff. I called the police.\n\nTurns out the vehicle was stolen. I only saw the driver briefly, but I was asked to do a photo lineup.\n\nI failed spectacularly. This happened long before I had heard of facial blindness. Yeppp. I would never be called as a witness. I would start out every questioning with \u201ctake my representation with a grain of salt..\u201d", "Are these the same person?  Yes Whether they look identical or not, those motions are so complex that no person could recreate it with 100% accuracy like that.

Lol, this sort of thing happens so often! I work in a clinic and literally checked in a coworker yesterday. They were not in uniform and I did not realize they were the same person I see every day. That was pretty much what it was like when my mom 'surprised' me with a visit from my aunt.  I legit had NO IDEA who this person was, and had to act surprised to see her.  Eventually, my mom mentioned her name, and I was actually able to interact with her like a normal person. &gt;.&lt; As someone just visiting this sub with no idea what it is, the mods should pin this post. Yeah, sometimes I have conversations not like this.

He was nice about it and gently told me who it was because he knows i have a hard time with faces. I do not have much more to add to this, just the fact that mild prosopagnosia is annoying and embarrassing and as someone who feels they cannot claim it as their excuse for being unable to recognize friends immediately at bars it is very frustrating. My hubby is so used to me asking who is who in shows by now, I feel you. \n\nIf you watch shows on Prime, whenever you pause it it tells you who is in the scene. GAME CHANGER. WOW I did not know that! Cool! Oh yeah, amazing! It is a good secret trick, haha. I just poke my husband and he tells me who people are pretty much on auto pilot.  We have been married 10 years and dated 5 before that.  Unfortunately, he has not yet been successfully trained to slip clues into conversations about who people are when we are out in public.\n\nWhy cannot you claim it for not recognizing people? That is precious I love that, good for you for having a SO that helps you out! My boyfriend is really great about helping me out as well, and we use a lot of personal facts (which I am usually very good at remembering) paired with clothing articles when they are too many new people around. \n\nI guess I kind of feel like since it is not very severe it is rude for me to claim I have issues; once I see someone frequently enough in a variety of context I am like 95% good except for an occasional \u201cran into each other at the grocery store and was not expecting to see you and therefore stared at this waving person like an confused jerk for 10 seconds\u201d, which just does not feel significant enough to be considered a real problem ya know?

I do not like it... Every angle looks like a different person, so I am going to assume it is just one. Here to ask the same question- is this one person and they are just playing with the light or one of those face morph things- I am not finding this fun at all. I also assume it is one.  Do people without face blindness not get confused by this? My mom does not have prosopagnosia so I showed this to her, and she said it is little confusing but she can tell that it is the same person.

I worked in a restaurant and my boyfriend (not at the time) worked in the kitchen most of the time but would also sometimes work as a server. When he was working in the kitchen he would wear a hat and when on the floor he would not. I feel so bad because we talked a lot and got to know eachother when he was serving, and then I acted like I did not know him while he was in the kitchen. This went on for a few weeks before I finally realized. We still joke about it today. Oh yeah, and at that same job there were two different women that I could not tell apart no matter how much I tried. They had the same hairstyles and everything. You better believe I embarassed myself a few times by calling them the wrong name worked with two guys who had similar hair, build, and height. seriously had to ask one of my other coworkers who I was working with bc U seriously could not tell them apart. d'oh! :) if our significant others ever wanted to just disappear and avoid us, they do not even have to move away hahaha Haha, I just did not know his name at all", "Prospagnosia Radio show Hi folks, \n\nI am new to Reddit - came across this community because I am looking for human stories about how prosopagnosia has affected people.  I already have the science section recorded, just now looking for some illustrations or stories of how the condition has affected people's lives. Is this something anyone here might be able to help me with? I find that there is an interesting overlap between people who cannot remember faces and people who cannot remember names.\n\nDid you look into that aspect of it? In terms of research, Steven Fry (British broadcasting personality) has done a documentary as he is affected. It was on radio 4 , I think \"the curious case of Rutherford and fry\" is the program. Interesting.\n\nA scroll through the forum will give you an idea of what to expect, suggest you contact users before using stories obviously. \n\nI am happy to talk but I am at the mild end of the spectrum - have endless annecdotes about not recognising actors I have seen a gazillion times before. Also some anxiety in social situations as a result. Suspect others would be more interesting than my stories though. I would help. There is the classic stories of not recognizing my son when I pick him up from school or not recognizing my husband when he sits down next to me in the theater. But there are a couple that are funnier. \n\nLike the time I was lost and followed someone that I hoped was my dad in order to be not lost. Or the time I discovered my husband had gone grey over the years, but I did not know it. Long before I knew prosopagnosia was a medical condition, back when did everything to hide my inability to recognize people, I dated a guy who declared himself my seeing-face helper.  \n\nWhenever we were out together and bumped into someone we knew,  he would greet them, then turn to me and say \"you remember so-and-so, from .\" I would take over from there.  \"Of course! How have you been?\"\n\nFor that brief period of my life, I got a sense of how it must feel to recognize people normally.  It was the first and last time in my life where I did not live in a world perpetually populated by strangers.\n\nWhat really struck me is how VERY often we crossed paths with acquaintances.  We lived in a big city, and I just assumed the strangers I passed were an ever-changing stream of tourists.  I must have snubbed countless people without ever realizing it.\n\nI have been trying to think of a comparable experience in the other direction, where others may get a sense of what prosopagnosia is like, and the best I have come up with is a Halloween block party where everyone is in costume.  How do you know who is who?  How do you know if you are looking at a friend, enemy, or total stranger?\n\nObviously you can generally work it out via other means, but it takes more effort than usual... and on Halloween, everybody is understanding, perhaps even amused, when you do not know who they are. Something that is not always mentioned in scientific descriptions is, that while failure to recognize familiar people is the most common result of prosopagnosia, it is also possible to have a false positive recognition.  You can have an emotional feeling that you 100% know who someone is and be completely wrong in your identification. \n\nThis recognition feeling is not affected by logic or rational thought either.  I 'recognized' another man as my deceased uncle at my uncle's funeral.  It was pretty upsetting (especially since it was before I knew I had prosopagnosia).", "Short story about Prosopagnosia  It is a work of fiction but the emotions are real if exaggerated.

Makes it worthwhile! \n\nCould you identify with it to any extend or is it over-exaggerated Only yesterday a friend said I would inspired their idea for a short story, after I commented that my worst nightmare is to witness a crime, because of my prosopagnosia meaning I would be utterly incapable of helping with identifying the perpetrator.\n\nReally engaging storytelling. Thanks for sharing. I could to an extent. I have les truble  recognizing people I see on a daily basis. But it was realy nice to read a storry where the characters are discribed by 'tags'. And the storry itself was entertaining as wel. Thank you so much! Having written the story I started researching the topic more and found that there is at least one published novel on the subject \"Dead Blind\". It is a good book! I suspect this is a common anxiety for us. Basically, if we are ever in an identity parade, someone is getting away with it... I am going to have to look up that book, thanks for the recommendation. \n\nWe are all inured to the regular anxieties and have our coping mechanisms. So we become immune to the daily trials and tribulations. \n\nBut even giving a witness statement, let alone talking to a sketch artist!\n\nYeah, it was...

I seem to get lost where ever I go. I need the GPS or I will get lost even in my own area. My friends are shocked that I do not even recognize my own street.\n\nI do not know how people can drive and not get lost with out a GPS. The homes all look the same unless there are some very different design differences.\n\nThe landmarks are not going in my brain like it should or I am blind to small differences like type of door, type of window, door frame, fence, shutters, type of roof is it black or brown , so on but the people that do not have prosopagnosia are picking up on these small differences or some thing.\n\nIt so bad I cannot even recognize my own street. I have to look at street name to see that I am on my street. I have read that this is a condition related to prosopagnosia.  A quick google search says it is developmental topographical disorientation, but I feel like I remember reading a different word earlier. I have heard of some cross correlation between prosipagna and getting lost, same for ADD.  I tend to be fine at finding my way home, but not to new places without a map.  I HATE it when people give me directions, give me a goddamn map and a cross street otherwise I am getting lost.  THis was in the days before GPS and google, now GET OFF MY LAWN\n\nIf all the houses look the same, you may have a more general recognition function problem in a ddition to or instead of face blindness. I have advanced ability to orient myself in the world. My perfectly face reading friends have no ability to drive and have cake me from a town over to help them get home. \n\nI think learning patterns outside of prosopagnosia to help detect people helps detect lots of really practical things too that normal people do not train for. \n\nUse paper maps. You will learn real fast without a self orienting GPS shouting directions at you in real time. Orientating is totally fine for me.\n\nI do not see non-driving related things, like what is on a billboard, but that is because I do not need to pay attention to the ad. \nI also do not bother looking for other driver's faces, like to see if they are waiting at a stop sign or whatever, like you are supposed to. Instead I can see subtle movements in the handling of the vehicle, like the angle of the wheel, where in the lane the vehicle is driving, etc. which let me know what they are going to do before they do it more than looking to their face would.\n\nBut pure directions is fine. I can even tell where I am on a map and what direction is north, and how to get back to where we started even if we are taking trails that we did not take on the way in, just based on what direction their pointing and the curve of the land they are on.  \nBut I am also good with general spatial stuff, like knowing if a couch will fit through a doorway.\n\nSo I would go with faces and places are not always linked, but might be depending on how you recognise things otherwise. i have a some difficultys recognicing places and paths/directions but nothing even close to what you describe. Repeated active exposure (1-2 years driving for the way to school, the 4 years before i was old enough to drive do not count) is eventually enough for me to recognice places. I have also got a pretty shonky sense of direction and have read that the two are linked. \n\nThe only thing I have been \"officially\" diagnosed with was dyspraxia way back when I was a kid. That also is linked with poor sense of direction. I am wondering about a proso-dyspraxia overlap? Yes it is linked with prosopagnosia. My sense of direction is TERRIBLE. It not so much direction or if I am going north or south. It is I do not recognize the landmarks. The homes all look the same.\n\nI think people who really good at recognizing detail say this in their mind, drive down this street and make a right when you see a house with this type of window, with border trim that is brown, with this type of door, and a fence that white with this type of fence and these types of trim around the door and these steps and  so on. Where my mind is not picking up on that small detail so all the homes look the same. Unless the differences are really big. I think prosopagnosia may be related. If the brain is having trouble picking up on small detail.\n\nI was in a Arab country and well there are different races of Arabs this one race look like clones. There face looks all the same the only difference is some people are fatter and the face looks fatter and some people are less fat and face looks less puffy.\n\nTake these Arabs.\n\n\n\nOr this one.\n\n\nAnd going by is the face puffy or not is the person fat or not is not good idea. If the person changes weight you will not recognize the parson.\n\nMay be the brain is having hard time picking up on small detail that other people pick up.\n. Personally no. I would say I have a better grasp of direction than most people. Not at all. I think my sense of direction (although not necessarily my ability to memorize places) is well above average. My prosopagnosia is mild to moderate. Just last week, I listened to a Fresh Air podcast where Terri Gross interviewed Jad Abumrad (from Radiolab) and they were talking about a person who has what they described as 'faceblindness, but with locations'.  I cannot remember all of the details, but they did discuss the biology that causes this.  Might be worth a listen! Not for me. I am actually pretty good at.", "Do you think it affects how you are attracted to people? I think I am more interested in people with distinctive features, and more attracted to things that are not about appearance at all.\n\nI can see when someone is attractive of course, but unique features can be just as attractive to me as traditionally beautiful ones. Yes 100%!! I find \u201cconventionally attractive\u201d people so bland and I have trouble telling them apart. Like all those famous blond white male actors look the same to me. I am definitely more likely to be attracted to someone with distinctive features. My eyes tend to just gloss over people otherwise haha Yup. I experience the same thing - people with conventionally plain faces sometimes look beautiful to me. Yes. I think ppl are attractive and then the second time I see them they look really different to me. I am asexual but find myself drawn to partners that are very eccentric. Like I do not find anyone in particular attractive but I would not mind being with someone if I love them and I usually pick people who stand out significantly in a crowd Somewhat. I have noticed that people with bad personalities attractiveness become tainted and less so.\n\nAverage is not ugly, it is not bad at all actually. I definitely am more attracted to people who stand out. I do like 'conventionally attractive' as well but they have to be extremely attractive which I guess is another idiosyncrasy. Yes! That is so true Im right there with you. I am definitely more attracted to people with unique features. Absolutely and even in a positive way. I am much more attracted to personality than looks. It is easier to remember! Absolutely.  Every time I see an actress I do not recognize and think \"damn\", it is always Alison Brie. There are a lot more factors (compatibility, personality, interests) that go into choice of real-life partners, so I think celebrity crushes are a good test of what you are attracted to \u201call else being equal.\u201d And I definitely have a \u201ctype\u201d that overlaps but does not really align with \u201cconventionally attractive.\u201d I also really like an attractive voice, which might have something to do with proso. I cannot even recognize most of the popular actors or celebrities Omg I did not have a type with celebrities at all ha. Completely random. I say \u201cdid\u201d because I have just realised it is very rare that I am attracted to a celebrity now as an adult, unless I know a lot about them, or their character maybe. So it is actually not about looks at all. Nope. In fact I took part in a faceblind study years ago and the test is when it clicked for me that I def had it. They showed celebrity faces - but *just* the faces. The hair and clothes were erased.\n\nI failed to recognise all sorts of celebrities, and I labelled Kevin Spacey (who I used to like a lot) as Leonard Cohen. I also realised I am worse with women\u2019s faces. So one funny thing - the only celebrities I have ever found sexually attractive are really close to my age.  (Literally no more than 12 months younger and no more than 24 months older.)  Like ever in my life.  \n\nThey have no other significant common features.  (Like they are all male, because I am a straight female, and other people would consider them good looking, but that is true for most celebrities.) \n I have rewatched things when I saw that the actor was good looking, but was not attracted to them at the time, again when I was the same age as the actor at time of filming and been attracted.  But also I have rewatched things where I thought the actor was hot in my 20s and now I am like, eh.\n\nI have never been able to guess people's age anywhere close to accurately, so I have no idea what is going on there. Yes, definitely.  But I also make friends with mostly unique looking people.  I think that conventionally attractive people (unless they are like stunningly gorgeous) are harder to tell apart.  I cannot imagine sleeping with someone I could not recognize 10 minutes later!  Also, it is hard to get to know someone is personality if you keep thinking two people are the same person or one person is two separate people.\n\nThis is especially true when you are younger and youthful health compensate for various things (plus what our standards of beauty are especially for women) making a higher proportion of people conventionally beautiful.  As I get older I am finding good looking people stand out more.  When I was in my teens and early twenties, I was always noticeably the most attractive of my good friends in different settings.  (I did not realize this at the time, but looking back at pictures, I wondered if it was like an ego thing, but they just felt like awesome people I wanted to be with...and then I learned I was face blind, and they are all super easy to recognize.)  That is definitely not true anymore, because the more attractive people are starting to stand out. \n\nI think the person's personality, intelligence, interests, and overall me clicking with them are incredibly important in attraction to me.  I am attracted to my husband.  He is not conventionally good-looking, but extremely easy to recognize, and we became friends very easily when we first met and can still stay up hours talking after being together almost 20 years.\n\nWe met on one occasion in college and then he asked to sit with me at breakfast one day.  I probably would have been a lot colder toward him, except he is kind of funny looking, so I recognized him right away and knew that we were acquainted.  And then when I saw him again, I knew that he was the person who loved to read a lot of the same books I did, so I knew I wanted to talk to him.  I know there were other guys I had good conversations with, but I do not remember seeing any of them repetitively...and I am pretty sure I did now that I think about it. Ha! That is funny and really specific.\nIn opposition, even though I have almost exclusively dated people my own age, I am generally only attracted to older celebrities. Ha! I have a height thing too but for me it is  because I am tall for a woman, and I want them to be taller than me for whatever reason.\n\nThat sucks about those comments, but I totally relate. I am so much more attracted to unique individual features, or personality than anything else. I am a little late to this, but yes. Both in terms of friendships and romance, I think it makes a difference.\n\nI tend to make friends/connections with people I can recognize multiple times. Obviously, that is easier if they are distinctive. Of my friends from my first year of undergrad, one had died her hair bright red, one was Indian, and one happened to be a model (so in hindsight, I basically just found the most distinctive looking nice people in each class). The same applies to people I am attracted to.\n\nAdditionally, I rarely feel attracted to people I cannot recognize. It would be strange to be hitting on someone I had hit on or dated or knew before or should have known was in a relationship without realizing it. It is not a conscious decision. There is just a shroud of mystery about whether I know people and until it is resolved and I learn to recognize them, I would not think of them as potential romantic interests. \n\nThe whole phenomenon also makes me less assertive to start with and more reliant on others to start a friendship and maybe reach out to me the first several times.\n\nSo take someone conventionally attractive, add some distinctive feature(s), give them an understanding attitude about me not recognizing them perfectly initially, make them assertive enough to make the first few moves towards friendship, and they probably will capture my interest either as a friend, a romantic interest, or just someone I am drawn to because I can recognize them. Absolutely, I have been told I go for rather average/ugly partners. I have been told my first boyfriend looked like a bulldog LOL. I tend to prefer the less fashionable type since they are more consistent looks wise. However people with really distinct features, like scars through their eyebrows, can make me weak in the knees. \ud83e\udd24", "I think I might have just informed someone they might have face blindness. Not sure how I feel about that. I belong to a group filled with people with non-verbal learning disorder. Personally, I have aphantasia. \n\nOne member went into being unable to remember faces and names, and using accessories to identify people. A few others responded in agreement. So, I brought up face blindness, and linked a test. I feel like I might have just caused great distress for a few of them. Was it right of me to inform them just so they would finally know why everything felt a bit off? It is difficult to say without knowing the person involved but faceblindness is slowly becoming more talked about, including on tv, so sooner or later it would come to their notice. You might have pre-empted this but you are the best person to do so as you know how to explain it and where they can find more information. I was very relieved when I discovered that I had faceblindness and had not just been failing to pay attention for48 years. I hope they feel better for it too. Yeah, I am aware of it. I have no idea what it must be like to have. I think telling them was totally the right thing to do!\n\nPersonally, knowing this is a \u2018real thing\u2019 and not just me being distracted / lazy is *very* reassuring. Maybe they will feel distress in the short-term, but if they are anything like me, having a name for this condition is going to help explain a lot about their lives and reassure them that they are not alone. Maybe they will even find this sub and participate ;) It is good to learn about but also kind of a shock for most people who did not realize other people get it Frankly, I felt so much better when I figured it out.  I am pretty social aware and thought I was being a jerk, because I knew that I was supposed to know who people were.  I thought I just was not paying attention, so starting hyper-focusing on what people were saying.  As a result, I remembered who they were LESS and remembered every single detail about what they said.  Which then I realized was creepy, so I was trying to pretend I did not know some things...it all was very confusing.  It was a huge relief when I realized that my brain was just working differently and I was not a horrible, self-centered person.  I was not unhappy at all even temporarily, because I already knew what was wrong; I just did not know I was not causing it. \n\nEveryone may not have the same experience, but hiding facts from people because it might make them feel bad is probably not needed.  (I mean you do not need to throw things at people that are likely to hurt their feelings, but this is a pretty relevant fact to their life and you do not know if they will be upset or happy.)  \n\nAlso, imagine someone was Deaf or color blind and no one ever told them that most other people perceive the world differently, because it might make them feel bad.  I think that would be unkind.  If someone knew that I might be face blind before I did, but never told me about it, I would probably be rather angry with them, because not knowing caused me pain.\n\nSo in my opinion, you were right. I also have non-verbal learning disorder and prosopagnosia. I think I read that there may be a conection between those 2. Not sure where I read it and if it was proven or just suspision. Just thought it was intresting.", "Prosopagnosia movie \"Faces in the Crowd\" (from a new poster) Hello all :)  \n\n\nI am starting the movie \"Faces in the Crowd\" tonight -- it is a thriller that relies on the face blindness of the main character as a plot device for her entanglement the crimes of a serial killer. I was really interested in how face blindness might be  visually represented to a neurotypical audience, so I tracked the film down on Hulu. Has anyone else watched it? What did you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the way, it is nice to meet everyone. I am excited to finally become involved on here. I realized I was face blind this spring after a period of correspondence with Brad Duchaine, a professor of neuroscience and one of the small collection of researchers studying prosopagnosia. (I got his contact information from ( It is a pretty basic website, but the people behind it are excellent.) A little about me: I am a graduate student in genetics, I love reading, I love dancing, the last thing I watched was Brooklyn 99, the last thing I ate was chocolate. I am hoping to find some people I can talk to openly about the weird experiences one has being prosopagnosic. I love my friends, but they do not quite get it, you know?  \n\n\nThanks for reading! I definitely watched this a while back, and the whole gimmick was completely lost on me. I am going to assume they swapped actors, or had the same actor for some parts? But I mean, I really could not tell! You are right! They would swap actors between encounters to give the impression that the main character was perceiving a new and unfamiliar face each time. Sometimes it got extreme enough that I would laugh; I am prosopagnosic, but I still know what a mustache is. Other times.....it completely went over my head, and while I understood from the context that it was supposed to be a new face, I would have accepted it as the original. I am watching this movie as I type. 15 minutes in, the explanation of Prosopagnosia is basically the *opposite* of how I experience it. It is not \"every time I see a face it is like I have never seen it before.\" It is more like \"every face I see looks almost exactly like every other face I have seen.\" I really liked this movie because I think it can help others to understand a little what it is like not to recognize people.\n\nbut this is not what proso exactly is for me...\nsometimes I recognize people and one day I do not...\nsometimes I recognize someone, and finally it is a person I never met, so I do not go toward people, I wait for them to come to me...\nI do not recognize people if they do not wear their glasses or if they had a beard and do not have it anymore and vice-versa, or sometimes  if they just  change their haircut...\nsometimes I do not recognize myself in the mirror but I do not see another person, it is really strange but I cannot explain what I feel...\n\nbut I think it is really hard to know how to show that on screen, and I would not know how to do it...\n That is so interesting! I definitely experience something closer to what the film suggests. It would be amazing if there was a better way to share subjective consciousness, but I guess we just have to do our best to communicate \\^\\^ I can relate to what you are describing! The feeling of unfamiliarity is not constant, in fact being around someone all the time greatly reduces the number of instances when I find their appearance uncanny. Moments of confusion usually stem from changes to a person's appearance, me seeing a friend after being apart from them for a while, or me trying to find someone in a new context (like meeting a classmate in an airport). And I always see the face in the mirror as me, but sometimes I am like, who is that ugly bih... \\^\\^  \n\n\nI cannot really think of a better way to make a movie about prosopagnosia, at least without altering the memories of the audience. Blurring or otherwise concealing the character's faces would be strange and unsettling for a neurotypical person, and that is not my experience of proso at all -- I have always been prosopagnosic and the way I perceive things feels normal and fine. What a great intro, thanks for writing. Movies confuse me, I avoid them. Unless Jim Carey is involved, then I find it funny. \n Thank you \\^\\^\n\nI am glad you have some comedies to enjoy. I used to think I did not like watching movies, especially by myself, but now I realize that may be due to the proso. In order not to mix up the characters, I need there to be a limited but distinct cast. Watching television series can be easier because I get exposed to the characters repeatedly. But best of all are cartoons and anime. Characters typically wear the same outfits and have exaggerated physical features that make distinguishing them very easy. (Also, I may be a bit childlike \\^\\^')", "Is this relatable? Hey, \n\nI only recently discovered that this is a thing. I always thought I just did not care enough to remember faces, and other people were regularly mad at me for not remembering them. I could walk past friends, confuse my own family members, could never recognize someone i had only seen on pictures and yeah nothing was worse than friends changing haircuts. On a lighter note, i never understood how people were able to score well on photo quizes or how the hell people were able to make facial composites of someone they had only seen once.\n\nI am glad its not really my fault and i have a language now to understand all of this and to explain it to other people. Because people care, people hate it when you remember their name or their face which they see as \"you do not care even a thing about me or the nice time we had\". People do not understand how I remember everything except their face.  Haha yeah I think that is how most people who have always had it feel~ I watch a ton of crime shows and I am always like how did they describe this person they saw for a split second and how did someone else draw them?? I hope knowing that it is not your fault will help you and welcome to the community ^.^ Right?  If police asked me what someone looked like... Uh, he probably had a nose, and eyes.... thank you! Very much! I was thinking about when I was younger (all the way through high school), I would get excited about something and want to talk about it, so I would bring it up in conversation pretty often. \n\nOnly I would not remember who I had already told, so my peers would get frustrated, chide me for telling them the same thing over and over.\n\nI am starting to wonder if this might have been caused by my failing to associate the conversation with the person (presumably from proso). I am wondering if this might be a common occurrence among others. Police sketch artists are absolutely unfathomable to me. Like, I understand intellectually that other people are seeing identifiable facial features, and I have accepted that they can use these features to recognize people later, but both sides of an interaction with a sketch artist might as well be science fiction as far as I am concerned.  Interesting. I have this too but linked it to my memory haha. Maybe were just more focused on the what part than the who part, maybe it is related.", "Having Prosopagnosia and also trouble recognizing places? I realized I have Prosopagnosia when I learned it is not normal to have trouble recognizing people. Some days ago I walked by a friend in an empty hallway and they did not say anything at that moment. I remember walking by and seeing a person in the hallway (where I do not usually meet them) but when they later asked me why I did not greet them, I realized something was off. I thought I was bad at faces but this happens a lot, especially when I see people in a place where I usually do not see them. I am really good recognizing voices so I usually wait for people to greet me first. I never greet anyone first because I am never really sure it is them unless I hear them talk. I never realized this before.\n\nAnother thing that I struggle with is recognizing places. My parents were shocked to learn I still use my phone gps to get to the market. They keep bugging me to just \u201cremember.\u201d I have a pretty good memory for facts and information but cannot differentiate places well. I have been living in the same place for six years and there is a market 8 minutes away I go to often. However, I cant easily get there. It is the suburbs and it is all houses and parks. No store signs and stuff in the way. I can memorize what I need to do (when to turn and how many blocks) but cannot remember by looking at the places in the path. I could get there by memorizing the directions but places seem familiar but I cannot quite pinpoint where I am. Unless there is stores with signs that have words on the way, it is really hard to orient myself. This affects my life and gives me anxiety to get lost so I rely on my phone to go places. Is this related to Prosopagnosia? Why did the friend not say hi to you? I think they were trying to see if I would greet them first. They asked me why I did not say hi to them and I told them I did not \u201csee\u201d them. They told me \u201cbut it was just us too\u201d in the hallway. I remember awkwardly by a person in the hallway but I did not recognize them.", "A friend for 2o+ years posted an updated profile pic and I would not be able to pick him out of a crowd Somewhat amusing story. A friend of mine really liked a recent pic taken of him so he updated his profile pic on Facebook... I am just sitting here looking at it and am like \"I genuinely can not tell this is him\" .. I have known this man for over 20 years... I would not be able to pick his face out of a crowd because he changed his facial hair (has had a mustache with or without a goatee on and off for years, but decided to grow a fuller beard .. kind of \"rakish rogue\" type look).  \n\n\nThe new look is quite handsome.. just I ... I was struck by how completely I fail to recognize him. I usually think of myself as having mild prosopagnosia.. but this one is kind of rocking my world. I totally get that! My roommate, who I have known for 20 years, shaved off his beard and mustache and it was unsettling hearing his voice come from a face I could not recognize at all. For me, voices are good... I have no problems recognizing them so for me I can just focus on that and it is \"all good\"  \n\nI mean yeah, when a person is well enough known to me that I have their face 'set' it is a little disconcerting if it changes, but ... well, since I am so used to not recognizing so many faces, it is just a \"getting to know your face again\" thing...  but yeah it is a bit disconcerting and I could see how that might be much more so for others. not every time, but often, I do not recognize people I know if they just take off their glasses... Hahaha. :) I have had that happen, too, and similar things.\n\nTo this day, there is someone whom I used to know (?), with whom I have been friends for a very long time (I think from before Facebook, but, as you will see, I am not sure...), whose name is Sparrow Rose.\n\nAnd I have NO IDEA who she is.\n\nAt some point, she changed her name without notice, and, even though her profile pic remained the same, I have never since been able to tell who the heck she is.\n\nMaybe we were best friends once?\n\nI recently changed my name, but I made sure to give ample notice and to leave my old name as part of my display name for a good long time so folks can get used to the change. \n\nIt is only polite, lol.", "Experiences with face blindness Thought I would share my experiences (in chronological order):    \n \n      \nThe first time I saw Toy Story, I thought Andy and Sid were the same person. I could not understand why Sid was torturing his toys until about 3/4ths way through when I realized they were different characters.      \n       \n         \nI was at a bar with dim lights. I introduced myself to somebody that I hung out with for hours the night before. It was the first time this happened, and my suspicions surmounted.    \n         \nGame of Thrones takes a *lot* of studying to watch.

The Stark boys look like quintuplets.    \n      \nI had been going to a church for close to a year and met up with a guy from there at a restaurant. He always wore a hat. I introduced myself to him this time, because he was not wearing a hat. He is bald.     \n       \nMy wife surprised me at work. I thought she was someone from a different department at first. I got recognition-whiplash really hard on that one.   \n        \nThanks for reading. Maybe you guys can relate? Full disclosure: I have not been diagnosed with prosopagnosia, so there is probable deniability. However, from what I have read, it seems like I might be a good candidate. Your experiences are certainly relatable. One off the top of my head is that whenever my husband ties their hair back I usually have a moment of \"Who is that handsome stranger across the room? ....OH.\" They have a different voice.\n\nI always listen to the voices to differ ceracters if clothes fail.\n\nWere you born with face blindness? of got it later in live? \n\nbecause if that is the case you could need to change routines. I have realized I am really good at recognizing the posture/gait of my friends.  Last weekend we were at a camp, and I could pick out my wife on a patio from several hundred feet because of the way she sits. But I have also attempted to hug the wrong woman at a concert because my wife was on the right and there was another short, blonde women to my left. ask her to paint her face b4 going out with her so you can spot on that.\n\n&amp;#x200B; I think anyone who understands the concept of \"recognition-whiplash\" has some degree of prosopagnosia.   Thanks, RetardPoop! :)", "Chrissy Flanagan: The Faceblind Sausage Queen of Australia - Faceblind Podcast ", "Happy to have stumbled upon this subreddit! Probably the worst time I had with not recognizing faces was when I worked at a bar/nightclub in my university years. People (customers) would come up to me and say, \"Do you remember me?\" Not wanting to hurt their feelings, I was like, \"Of course! You were here last week with your friends!\" (Because people usually go to nightclubs with their friends, and even if I was mistaken about it being last week, they would just be happy to be remembered).\n\nThen I stopped caring, and told them, \"Sorry, you are wearing a different shirt. I have no idea who you are.\" People want to be remembered, but it was exhausting trying to fake like I knew who they were.\n\nI can remember faces, especially after I see them more and more. The more I get to know someone, the better I can remember what they look like. Even years later. But I would be pretty useless in a police sketch, and rely on memorizing other physical traits, like height/weight, distinctive facial features, or how they move.\n\nA couple months ago, I saw a movie with my girlfriend. She is pretty understanding at my lack of ability in recognizing faces, and was really patient each time I asked, \"Is this a new character? Or did she already appear on screen?\" I remember her telling me three different women appeared before one made a second appearance lol\n\nFor some strange reason, I find it easier to remember men's faces than women's. Does anyone else have a gender difference?\n\nJust wanted to get this off my chest. It is so cool coming across this subreddit and realizing I am not as alone as I thought! I think women are easier to identify for me because their appearances tend to be far more varied than men's. They are more likely to make themselves identifiable through their hair, make-up, and clothes, where they have a lot more freedom than men. I have also found that their body types vary more than men's in terms of height, curves, etc. Though on the flipside, women also change their appearance a lot more than men do. \n\nAs far as faces go...I would probably agree that recognising men's faces is slightly easier, probably due to facial hair and generally more...solid features?  Ah, see I see women as looking so alike to each other *because* of the reasons you listed: they are all wearing makeup, they have all got variations on the same hairstyle, and they are all wearing the same clothes, only in different colours. The body types, that is a good point though - there is a lot more variation in that. Hair and clothes are my two big identifying features personally, though I can see your point. On women often wearing similar hair and fashion styles, as a bully victim, I have noticed that many of my female tormentors at school tend to have the same haircuts, make-up, and even eyebrows (obviously following a fashion trend). Being both faceblind and having people styling themselves similarly makes it difficult to identify any specific offenders, especially to teachers, but I have noticed that I have started to automatically steer clear of girls with strong eyebrows, heavy foundation, and straightened hair.   I think part of the problem is Hollywood. I would tend to prefer actresses who all have a certain look. British TV has more variety in appearance \u2013 old wrinkly people, really bad teeth, etc. \n I have not been diagnosed with this condition but I do have difficulty recalling faces. It is slight enough that I did not realize until I was 20 that I had any difficulties, but severe enough that it took me a year to be able to recall my doctor's face in my mind's eye. Anyway, you mentioned how you would be useless in a police sketch, and I wanted to comment that as a kid I could never understand how the police sketch was supposed to work. How are you supposed to describe the facial features of someone you have only seen once? Then again most victims of crimes are not too accurate, and it is complicated further by the sketch artist not being good. See:  I literally laughed out loud when I saw that sketch - it is terrible!\n\nAnd yeah, seeing a person once? I can recall that they have eyes, a nose, a mouth and two ears, but not much more than that if there is nothing remarkable about their features. Yeah I love that sketch lmao. Sometimes I am able to actually recall what certain features of their face look like - thin eyebrows, long nose, etc, but I cannot wrap them into an actual face. What my brain usually does is select a feature or general shape and then fill it in with someone I do know. Due to my doctor's lips, he was Bill Nye for about 5-7 months. I am not sure what exactly led to the realization that I had difficulties, though, since my entire life it has been the same story. At summer camps, some people's faces I never learned, and they are forever in my memory with someone else's face. How I did not realize earlier is a mystery to me - I think I read an article about it online, but the thing is that I have almost zero trouble recognizing people, which is the major symptom of people with prospoganosia. The only time I can recall not recognizing someone is the semester before I realized this issue, a female friend of mine passed directly by me on campus four times. Each time I had looked directly at her (from like 10 feet away too), saw her as just someone else, and went to keep walking. But every time she looked at me puzzled and said my name and I would stare at her like a deer in headlights for a second until I realized who it was! It is like all of the sudden she would appear in someone else's body. I realized that the reason I had trouble is because she constantly changes her hair, fashion, and makeup. When/how did you realize that your brain does not function normally in this area? Ooh, good question. I do not really know. It was more like a gradual realization. You know how some white people say all Asians look the same? That is sort of what it is like for me: people just all look the same, or at least they do at first. I am much better at remembering names than faces because words just \"click\" for me. But it is been there for so long, I have learned ways to compensate for it. Like, when I worked at the bar, I would remember people's mannerisms or if they were good or bad tippers. I am not totally prosopagnosic; I can remember people's faces after a while if I see them often enough. \n\nI would love for my doctor to be Bill Nye lol - did your doctor also wear bowties? Because that would be pretty cool. My roommate freshman year was Chinese and he said the same thing about white girls, to which I agreed with him! I said that I cannot tell blonde white girls apart, and now I understand why - at colleges in the US (at least mine and others like it), there is not that much variation in dress, and if their skin color and hair color are the same, and their bodily measurements are normal, then what else can I discriminate upon to discern someone is identity? I should have realized that it was because strangers' faces basically were not an option lol.\n\nMy doctor wears a normal tie. Something about his lips and eyebrows make him look like Bill Nye to me. And I am not a big fan of Bill Nye but it still would be cool for him to be your doctor - except for the fact that he is not a doctor lol.\n\nInteresting to hear that it was a gradual realization - I bet it is like that for most people that are not all the way on the severe end. You and I unconsciously developed coping techniques (you are more severely affected of course but you still can learn faces) relying on other features, showing how facial recognition/memory is somehow different to other forms of visual memory. It is interesting how the brain evolved to develop such specific functions! For this reason we are very, very different from computers.\n\nquick fun fact: in a sophomore class of mine, there were these 3 blonde girls I could never tell apart. Well, on the last day of class we did group presentations, and, although I am not sure how I came to the realization, it turned out that two of them were identical twins. I think they were in the same presentation forcing this fact to come to light, since then they are standing right next to each other. And if I recall correctly, they were more identical than many twins I have seen. Just goes to show you that a twin vs. an unrelated stranger with the same North Face jacket, Starbucks cup, and hair color look the same in my fuzzy facial memory lol. Blonde white girls - ugh, I know eh? They all look the same! It does not help that they seem to talk the same, too. As I am reading what you wrote and writing back, I am having a thought - I wonder if I have been drawn to \"not normal\" people my whole life (like, the artists, the punks, the geeks, the nerds, the musicians) because they have really distinctive looks and styles (along with marching to the beats of their own drummers). \n\nI kind of wish Oliver Saks was still alive. He wrote so many fascinating things on people's brains and offered so many great insights. \n\nMy mom and I like to have fun with each other: she is amazing at recognizing faces and can even see them in inanimate objects (you know how people see, for example, faces on potatoes?), and I would just shrug and eat the potato.\n\nhaha! that is funny/awesome about the twins! I had a few sets of twins in my high school. Oddly enough, I was able to tell them apart easily. Maybe it is that focus on finding differentiating features, but they always seemed like really distinct people to me, but ones that also really looked like each other.", "Are you bothered by your own face? I do not like to see my face in pictures or in the mirror. I find it off-putting. Does anyone else feel this way? my degree of face blindness is not consistent (which does not really make sense but oh well), so some days I recognize myself in the mirror less than others, and it is definitely disconcerting. Yes. Makes perfect sense; mine is not all that consistent either. Yes! Sometimes I feel like I see myself and it feels familiar sometimes my face does not feel familiar and it throws me. \n\nSeeing my own face makes me uncomfortable. I do not know if it is common with prosopagnosia or if maybe I am ugly lol. No clue Can you describe why it bothers you? ya, it makes me a bit uncomfortable haha. it is like in those movies where the mirror you becomes separate or something if that makes sense. like, i know it is me but it is weird seeing this person staring back that i do not recognize as myself. Yes!! I do not have photos or mirrors (only in bathroom) in my house. People in photos do not look like I remember, I do not look like me. Its disturbing. Yes yes yes Sometimes I think part of my lack of self confidence stems from not having a good idea of what I look like. I have a vague idea, then I see myself in the mirror or pictures and it feels wrong. I feel the same. I have always felt ugly/unattractive. I think it is because my brain is more likely to remember individual traits that stand out (in a bad way), so when I think of myself I think of vague, exaggerated traits It takes a minute to think Mirror before I see some random person there. Sometimes I remind myself there is a long mirror before I go in a room.\n\nMy face also changed a lot so I cant even keep up with current me, and I have not even started aging properly yet. I definitely remember myself more ugly than I am, but then in still pictures I just do not photograph well and it is worse than I thought.  From outside perspectives im actually totally fine i feel like my face has not changed since i was 7 (i am 20 now) and it kind of weirds me out. my friends and people i know say it looks the same, but idk. i also apparently look very much like i did pre-pubescent (but heavier), and still get mistaken for a child. \n\nfunny story: i was home from college during the summer and ran into my neighbor. our conversation:\n\nneighbor: omg hi! how've you been? it is august now so that means back to school for you! what grade are you in?\n\nme: pretty good, thanks, i am going to be a junior. \n\nneighbor: oh how exciting! college applications, prom, graduation, all that is waiting for you! \n\nme: a junior in college? \n\nneighbor: turns red. . . oh! I do not hog it. Everyone is bothered by my face! \ud83d\ude02 I feel the same!!!! \ud83d\ude02 I am not really bothered, but every time I look in the mirror it is like I am seeing my face for the first time. Usually it is not, but every so often I look like a different person to myself in the mirror and it is disconcerting.  (I often look like different people to myself in the mirror, but there are a bunch of usual \"looks\" that I cycle through.  Like maybe about 7 different Mos turn up regularly and they all look like me in my head, but every so often I do not look like any of my usual looks.) Sort of? I avoid looking at faces, often staring at the ground or slightly to the side of the person\u2019s head. It is just mildly uncomfortable for me. My face has never really felt like *me*, either When I look in the mirror I might see one of ~5 different people. Or sometimes it is a stranger. It is kind of an itchy feeling. Like, I know that face. I know I know that face. Who is that face? And it is worse because it is *my* face. (I refuse to look at a mirror that has more than one person in it because of this.) It is just uncomfortable. Yes! Sometimes it is familiar, sometimes a stranger. Sometimes it is someone who looks normal, sometimes they look like a freak show. My prosopagnosia is not severe enough to cause problems with mirrors so I do not mind those, but photos can give me trouble. If I just took a photo like a second ago it is not so bad, but as soon as a bit of time passes, even a few days or so, if I look back at the photo it often does not look like me anymore. It is so bizarre and a little annoying. I really struggle to recognize myself in older photos even if I remember the photo being taken. I definitely am. \n\nEvery time I look in a mirror and I just try to see my face it just disturbs me so much. \n\nLike I see something but is that me? I know it is me but that is strange it is me. I look closer at my face and I feel disconnected and I get this generalized feeling of derealization. And this happens whenever I look closely at any face, but it is worse with my own.\n\nAnd it also bothers me so much that I cannot have an opinion on what I look like. I am so curious on what people see when they look at me. \n\nIn general, I just try to avoid looking at it. Especially in photos or old photos. And whenever I see myself, I feel that I am needing to see something but I just cant. It makes me feel very distressed. Same! Zero photos and only one mirror (only one bathroom in our house). Haha oh no! I also look pretty young at 25. I got asked recently, \"So how old are you? High school?\" and another time, it took like four times insisting on my age before a group believed me. (The second was meeting with some college club-mates for lunch, so it was all good fun.) i can memorize a pic of someone, but if i see them irl, my brain cannot make the connection between person XYZ in the photo and person XYZ irl.  it thinks they are 2 different people. Definitely! I hate seeing pictures and thinking \"is that me or just some other blond dude?\". I usually just look at my face while brushing my teeth and make sure I do not have anything weird on my face in the morning, and then do a cursory glance when washing my hands each time I use the restroom.\n\nMy face only really has bothered my since March 2020 when I started having to do videoconferencing all the time due to Covid-19.", "i think i may have face blindness, but i am not sure. advice to get diagnosis? i did not know face blindness is a thing until recently. i always thought i was just bad at faces and people. \n\ni have massive trouble telling people apart. the other day i could not recognize my professor whose office hours i am always in!!! if i see people in a place other than where i am used to seeing them or have different hair i freak out. \n\nand another time, i did not recognize one of my close friends when she came in a place i normally do not see her. i also had a mental breakdown she dyed her hair red and was wearing a headscarf and therefore was unable to recognize her. \n\ni have had instances where i could not recognize most of my friends. i use all clues other than face to tell someone apart. people are always recognizing me and i cannot tell who anyone is. \"hey! lynnie! remember me? we were in statics, etc together!\" is my worst nightmare. \n\nwhen looking for friends, i memorize something trivial like their hoodie or backpack to recognize them. i avoid people if there is a chance of not being able to recognize\n\ni also cannot picture faces in my head. i feel like i shoulda been diagnosed by now but it was so much easier to hide it when i was little. ex: back in elementary school, the teacher would go (fake names) \u201clynnie, elaine, daphne, and lydia, you four are together.\u201d and daphne, lydia and elaine would find me and go lynnie over here. i could remember there was a daphne, a lydia, and an elaine in my group but i could not keep track which was which.\n\nnow as a 3rd year college student at a huge ass campus, i cannot keep track of so many people. \n\ni watched cartoons explicitly until i was 15 bc i could not tell real life tv show characters apart. \n\nduring the pandemic, masks made no difference in my ability to recognize people. \n\nif you all think i may have it, where do you all suggest going for a diagnosis? and how was getting a diagnosis? Ask your doctor for a neuropsychiatrist testing referral, but tbh based on what you put above I think you can save yourself the copay because it seems pretty clear you have a facial perception issue. As someone who also did not realize until halfway through college, these examples all sound pretty familiar to me. I took two online assessments, both put one through different universities studying this. Prosopagnosia is one of those conditions that is self-diagnosable, but if you want valid proof, find an online assessment. There are varying levels, and it was interesting to find out where I stand, and to learn that its not all in my head. Well, I mean it IS all in my head\u2026but still. Give this a shot:\n\n This is what I did too. Always knew I had problems with faces but the assessments gave it a name and confirmed it was not all in my mind I do not get it, the pictures in that quiz includes an entire head shot including hair, non-neutral background, clothing, jewelry, etc. I had so many non-face-based cues to go off of.\n\nOther tests that I have seen present just the face, and on those I of course do no better than random guessing. Yeah, I did have some help from clothing glasses and hairstyle.  But I also did guess a fair bit as well. Not only that, but having it officially diagnosed does not really do much for you.\n\nIt might open up doors to therapy, but really it is just learning to recognise people by other things, like how they walk, hand gestures, hair style, height, etc.  \nThings that you are probably already doing anyway. College was hard for me too. My friends could turn up anywhere and if I was not expecting them, I did not actively look for them and therefore usually did not see them. They would always come to me. I did not know I had face blindness then. Walking around campus between classes was the hardest for me. \n\nI was compensating in lots of ways like always sitting in the same spot in large lectures (most people will pick a spot and stick with it out of habit) and making acquaintance with the people around me. Or if I had friends in that lecture, I knew who to look for and we still always sat together in the same spot. \n\nI was generally friendly to everyone who came up to me which is also easy to do on large campuses. Do not recommend this approach at the local bars. There I always went with and stayed close to my friends. I am pretty sure most of my friends thought I was the most aloof person ever but you can play a lot off by always \u2018thinking about your next test.\u2019  Good luck and be easy on yourself! Sounds like a classic case to me. Being into animation is a sign too, since cartoons are processed with object-recognition ability and not facial recognition ability. It is pretty common for prosopagnosiacs to prefer animation. \n\nAs for getting tested, you technically can go for a \"legit\" diagnosis as the other commenters stated, but I do not think it is necessary. I signed up to take the test at ( and scored so badly that they asked me to be a participant in their ongoing face blindness study. They occasionally send me tests and pay me in amazon gift cards for taking them. Their initial test also tries to rule out problems with visual processing, which I think is good. Have you read Wikipedia page for face blindness?   \n\n\n(  \n\n\nIt gives you a lot of clues and for me half way through it gave me the confirmation :) I started noticing anecdotally that adults who are especially interested in cartoons (like myself, a friend, and at least one fanartist I follow) seem to have a high chance of being faceblind. Have you found anything other than anecdotal experience that confirms that? I would love to read it if so. I do not know if there is ever been a study on it but I come across that statement in articles sometimes, (\n\nAnecdotally, most adults I know who love cartoons do not have prosopagnosia, but some are neurodivergent in other ways (ADHD, Asperger's, etc.) Ah, thanks for the article! And, yeah, with my friend and myself, there is  ADHD and autism between us, haha; I actually said it was interesting to learn they have face blindness since we met through our love for one cartoon, to which they pointed out face blindness is more common among those who are on the spectrum than in the general population.", "Another \"do I have prosopagnosia\"? post I always identify people by other people by anything other than their face, like their hair, their clothes, or their build. If there is something particularly unique, like a large amount of freckles, I will remember that. But I find it extremely difficult to recognize people by their faces alone. The more I see them, the more I recognize them, but it takes a while. \n\nThe best example of this would be two sisters I knew pretty well. They had similar hair, similar builds, similar everything. But for the first year I knew them I would always mix them up, and could not tell which was which, even when they were standing right beside each other. After a few years I realized that even back then they looked nothing alike, and by then I was able to tell them apart. \n\nI am only asking now because today somebody came to my register at work, and spoke to me, calling me m'am and all that. I could have sworn he was my coworker, because he had a similar build and hair, or lack thereof. I thought he might just be messing with me, but he seemed genuine, and nobody else seemed to recognize him. \n\nSo basically I identify people by any features other than their face, but can learn to recognize and tell them apart over time... A really long time. I can *see* faces, they just usually do not really... register. Like staring at a math problem you do not know how to solve. You see all the pieces, but they do not make any sense.\n\nIf anyone actually reads this, thanks. I have a feeling you probably have Prosopagnosia based on what you said, but you should definitely ask your GP about it before acting on anything.  It certainly sounds like prosopagnosia but do not worry, you are not alone in this. It sounds like you have already built up a number of techniques for recognising people and  it is worth joining discussion sites to find out how others cope. I would also take the other poster's advice and speak to your GP. I probably will not act on anything. It is just nice to have a name for it. I think I can cope with it, I just wanted to put a name to it. Thanks!", "Me, with prosopagnosia: \"That is not social distancing! \"  It took me a few too many minutes to figure it out lol \n\n\"They all look the same!\" That is because they are. I am a dumbass. They are all the same because they all have a beard. More the hair for me. It is a very unique haircut.\n\nAlso, there are 8 of them. I think I would have a harder time both without the cue (from the subreddit and the title) and if there were only 2-3 of them. Then I could believe twins or something Just like that other post in this sub. \n\nI feel like I can now just know that they are probably the same person since the word \"quarantine\" was mentioned in the post, or if it is from a sub intended to poke fun on this quarantine thing, so it is more \"oh I have seen this joke format before\" than \"so if this guy's beard looks like that other dude's, then they must be the same person!\"", "Art and faces When you see art, a painting, drawing etc, of someone you *should know* can you tell who it is?\n\nI was just looking at a coin and wondered if nobody told you who it was, would you realise it was the queen?\n\nWhat about paintings of famous people, are they easier or harder to recognise than a photograph?\n\nIf it is a caricature of someone do you spot the things the artist has *over emphasised* in the actual person (oh yes, they do have a big nose and caterpillar eyebrows), are they things you also notice, even if you cannot readily identify the person?

You walk around an art gallery, could you easily walk round and rough inadvertently seeing the same paintings over and over again without realising? Are paintings, sketches, whatever easier than real faces? The answers to all that will vary from person to person.\n\nI have as good of a chance of recognising a drawer or painting of a person as I would the person if they were standing in front of me.  \nSo people I know well enough (like any of the regular cast from Star Trek, for example) is not an issue.  \nBut if it is a picture of someone other people know, like... I do not know, Ewan McGregor? Yeah. No chance.\n\nCaricatures probably make it easier, since if the person has a defining feature, that feature is going to be the thing I will know their face by, and that is also going to be the thing that the artist exaggerates, so it draws more attention to it \"it is the dude with the eyebrows\" then \"oh, yeah, I know the dude with the eyebrows\" &gt;When you see art, a painting, drawing etc, of someone you should know can you tell who it is?\n\nNo. Not by their face, at least. I guess I could identify them by clothes or hair or things like scars.\n\n&gt;I was just looking at a coin and wondered if nobody told you who it was, would you realise it was the queen?\n\nWhat queen? The English one? I do not think I would, no. Except for her crown, obviously.\n\n&gt;What about paintings of famous people, are they easier or harder to recognise than a photograph?\n\nFamous people sometimes have signature characteristics, like Marilyn Monroe's hair and red lips, which help with identification. But I do not think that the fact that they are famous makes them easier for me to recognize.\n\n&gt;If it is a caricature of someone do you spot the things the artist has over emphasised in the actual person (oh yes, they do have a big nose and caterpillar eyebrows), are they things you also notice, even if you cannot readily identify the person? Are these features the same clues you notice for trying to determine if this is whoever the picture is of?\n\nYes... kind of. I honestly never remember noses. Or lips, or the shape of the eyes. But sometimes I identify people by eye color or beard or other distinguishing feature. I think if I knew the person was known for this particular feature, I could guess the caricature like everybody else, but it would not be because I am remembering this feature on the person's face, but due to the knowledge itself (I mean, I know what a nose is, so I can see the caricature has a huge nose).\n\n&gt;If you see a painting will you recognise it again later? You walk around an art gallery, could you easily walk round and rough inadvertently seeing the same paintings over and over again without realising? Are paintings, sketches, whatever easier than real faces?\n\nDo you mean paintings of faces? I mean, I never had this problem in art galleries. I can see the Monalisa painting anywhere and I know it is Monalisa. I guess if we had a row of painted faces with the same pallete of colors and without hair, I would probably not being able to recognize the faces in another context later, but I could say that this one is different from that one. I think paintings and sketches are easier to remember because they do not change, so I can pick up on things like the colors used. It depends.  If I would recognize them in real life (say by ears or nose that stands out,) I would probably recognize them in artwork.  Paintings, like photographs, add contextual clues too that can sometimes help.  I do not know if they are harder or easier.  You have less to work with (no movement, voice, etc.) but also you can stare longer without being weird.  I think I can recognize that I saw a painting before - although if I spend an afternoon looking at very similar portraits or landscapes or whatever they may start to blend together - but maybe I cannot and just do not know it. mostly the same\n\nonly one difference, and that only in one case\n\nthe caricature of Donald Trump, but it emphasises the hair", "Do face-blind people experience pareidolia? Hi! This may be a silly question, but I am curious if face-blind people experience pareidolia the same way other people do. Ie, do you naturally see faces in inanimate objects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nAs an example, in this image I cannot help but see this house as looking like a worried face. I know the \"face\" is just an effect of the arrangement of windows, but without even meaning to my brain interprets it as a face.\n\nNote: This is not research or anything, just curious about people's experiences! In general, yes. Yup Yes, sometimes.  Face blind people recognize faces as faces easily, they just have trouble identifying which face goes with which person, so I would reason that it would not affect pareidolia. Yes, faceblindness does not mean that you cannot see there is a face. You certainly know you are looking at a face.\n\nI just do not always know that the face is a friend, or a stranger, or even maybe my own.\n\nSo maybe it is possible I would wonder for a second why my face is in a piece of toast, before I realise it is not me! Yep What prompted this question is hearing from people who said they have trouble looking at a face as a whole, so I was not sure if that meant the brain is treating faces as just an assembly of shapes, and therefore might be less overactive in identifying faces in objects. But it also makes sense that people would be able to easily recognize that it is a face, but then attaching more detail / identity is where the issue arises ! &gt; Face blind people recognize faces as faces easily, they just have trouble identifying which face goes with which person,\n\nThat is it exactly. When I was a small child I would fall asleep looking at my popcorn ceiling. Faces would float in and out of my perception. It was terrifying. I had the same problem with wood grain patterns or really any randomly textured surface.\nI grew out of it eventually but I am still faceblind. Yeah, faces look like faces to me, not a random assembly of shapes.  My brain just does not naturally combine the shapes that are unique into something I can remember to recognize that face again.\n\nSome of how much this occurs may have to do with how the person visualizes things and thinks about the world.  My mom is an artist and sees pictures in everything.  Apparently certain eggs \"need\" mountains painted on them or do not \"feel\" like they could have a dolphin on them or \"look\" like they should have a flower.  I see an egg and can think about what pictures would work considering the size and color...but it is an egg. With me, I do not see have on everything, but I see things on everything. A piece of broken toe is shaped like a sitting cat or looks like a tree or a sitting dog out head of an elephant or a leading out of water dolfin. I make things out of random shaped. Broken pottery triangle pieces make sailboats or Angel fish, a couple pieces suddenly make a house. I usually have fun but often can be overwhelming and I just want to get a break from being so keenly visual  part of bipolar hypomania I now know I recognize when colors get so vivid, and nature scenes everywhereI are beautiful, like a calendar. Noticing what features of new cars are starting to show up. Do not know if I explained that well... oh yes. \n\nIt is a little like, a toddler can recognize which animals at the aquarium are fish, and which ones are rocks or jellyfish. They just do not know which particular species of fish they are called. If they are really weird, or if they know clown fish, they can point those out, but otherwise they are just fish. \n\nOr if you go whale watching, you would go, \"yup that is a whale\", and not \"Yup that is S302 her her calf last sighted 3 years ago.\" I do.\nPeople with prosopagnosia are able to see faces. I can look at someone and I clearly see that he/she has a face, I see theiy have blue/brown/green/whatever eyes, I see the shape of their nose, their hair colour, the shape of their lips, shade of their skin, if they have glasses or not. But as soon there is another same-eye-colour person with same-colour hair, similar nose shape etc, they become hard to differ. Or if the person with glasses takes their glasses off and I do not see that moment, I am wondering who is it? I do not recognize the face without glasses, it changes, and I am just not sure. But I see there is a face. \n:) &lt;- i see it as a face too, even though there is no nose and other face features. I do sometimes, but not as much as most people. Often times somebody has to point it out for me to see it.\n\nAlso fun fact: face recognition is used to identify cars, which explains why I always lose my car in parking lots. I can see the house in the above picture.  But the whole \"Man on the moon\" thing?  I literally thought it was just a turn of phrase until someone told me otherwise.  I do not Get how people can look at the moon and see a face. I do. I frequently see electrical sockets as faces, and I also see geometrical figures and symbols in the tree branches outside my window. One time I had a pareidolic quasi-hallucination in which I stared at a pattern of light and shadow on the wall, and it gradually shaped itself into a face. I... still cannot see a face in the moon.\n\n...\n\nIs that *another* of those things that I thought was just a trope but it is actually because I am faceblind? Maybe!  I do not know!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is like my, \"What do you mean Bills O'Reilley and Murray are different people?  I thought he just had a career change.\" Yes we do \nAnd someone please give that poor house a hug", "Prosopagnosia and Movies/TV? Has proso ever influenced any of your viewing preferences or choices?\n\n\nWhen I was a little kid, long before I even knew face blindness was a thing, I had a bizarre, almost superstitious aversion to live action movies and TV. I would only watch cartoons. Nothing else. This went on until I was 6-7 or so. Now I think I avoided live action media because I could not tell the characters apart.\n\n\nNow, I do better, but I hate movies mainly populated by white guys with crew cuts. Without the hair/skin tone cues, it is extremely difficult to tell them apart and thus follow the story.  I pursue movies and TV with diverse casts in part to support diversity for its own sake and in part because a diverse cast is exponentially easier to tell apart. \n\n\nEven though it is not very racially diverse, Breaking Bad, for example, made me very happy. Every single character was physically distinguished in some way. There was the middle aged white guy with facial hair and glasses; the young white guy with stubble, distinct tattoos, and a knit cap; the slim black guy with glasses; the bald clean shaven stocky white guy... Etc. Even the two main female characters had different hair colors. It was great.\n\n\nAlso, in reference to another specific show... The clones in Orphan Black look like legitimately different people to me. I can see a resemblance, but with the different hair, makeup and clothing styles, I could have been easily convinced that they were all played by different actresses...", "My face blindness is embarrassing \u2013 but it tells me a lot about other people  Nice article!

I was at a work site I only go to a few times a year. I was getting set up to work but needed some help from a regular to get tools and stuff. So I am standing there, lost because the two guys I know best are both out that day. Suddenly, I hear John's distinctive laugh from across the floor. I am so happy he is there, I go over and say \"John?\" No response at first and I say less confidently \"are you John?\"\n\nImmediately pissed off reaction, the guy says incredulously, \"you think I look like John?\" And I try to say no, I heard your laugh and it sounded just like his, and that did not help the situation at all. I speeded away saying sorry over my shoulder and feeling like shit.\n\nYeah, he thought it was some racist thing, like I think all black people look the same. Similar build as John, maybe slightly bigger, full body work suit and N95, my face blindness is not extreme but I had no chance.\n\nI went to the other side of the facility where John often works and looked around different workstations. Eventually found a guy that had a high probability of being John and just stood there not saying anything, waiting for John to recognize me first... or pass on if it was not him.

I probably passed the guy I annoyed on the floor or in the hallway later but did not recognize him, so he really thinks I am and ass because I just blew by him without saying anything.", "Could aphantasia have something to do with it? So I just found out \u2018aphantasia\u2019 is the name of a condition where people cannot properly visualize or see things in their mind. I did not realize that when people say \u2018imagine\u2019, they actually mean that you see vivid and clear pictures in your mind. Apparently many people can vividly imagine and actually see pictures when they \u2018imagine \u2018 something, some as clear as a dream or real life. \n\nIs there anyone here who does not have problems visualizing things in their minds? Whenever I imagine a face, I just see fading glimpses of a gray blob with things like hair shape and desaturated colors. I do not have a problem with visualisation, in fact I have a snap shot like memory of a photo I took with a friend at Christmas, I can see my jacket and it is buttons and the way my friends dress fell and the back ground...and our faces, all as if I was looking at the picture. However this is the most recent memory of either of our faces I have despite putting on makeup this morning.\n\nIt seems to me that people without prosopagnosia can remember peoples faces without having to \u2018photograph\u2019 them in their head, as if it is a automatic recognition thing. From this I assumed that facial recognition and visual memory is stored differently. It would be interesting to see if there was someone with aphantasia but not prosopagnosia. No, I do not have aphantasia either. I have been curious about this but this community is not active enough to get a good sample size. I definitely have prosopagnosia and I am pretty certain I have some form of aphantasia. I am very curious if there is a correlation.\n\nI do not even have a gray blob in my mind. Just the concept that something ought to be there. \"Think of a ball.\" \"Ok, I know what a ball is. It is a round thing. I have the idea of a ball but I cannot see it i my mind's eye.\"\n\nI wish we could fast forward 20 years into studying prosopagnosia. I know the tests out there are currently looking for a link with autism. I would love to see where the research community stands as more research is conducted. That is interesting because I am Autistic. It is even more interesting to me because I am not! Based on all of the studies I have participated in, they are definitely looking for the link between autism and prosopagnosia. That is really neat that they found some correlation. As someone without it though, I am waiting for the next step, which explains people like me (without autism) and how it developed! Most people with prosopagnosia compensate by remembering and recognizing non-face visual characteristics of individuals.  Gait, hair style, glasses, clothing, etc..  A person with aphatasia may not be able to use vision based coping methods.\n\nYou might try to recognize people by their voices.  That works for some people with proso. I do not know if I would qualify for a diagnosis of aphantasia.  I know there are plenty of people even less able to visualize images, but it is certainly difficult for me.  It is like the picture I try to imagine will not hold still.  Almost like I am just glimpsing something through fog, or reflected on rippling water.    I actually can imagine *color* just fine, but not the crisp details of objects:  I have no trouble visualizing \"red,\" but \"red apple\" is pretty tough!  (And if I try to 'zoom in' to see any detail on the very vague mental image of an apple - a leaf, say -  I lose the rest of it.)      \n\nWhen I try to imagine faces, it is worse. usually, it is pretty much what you described:  a blob with something vaguely hair-shaped attached.  Or, nothing at all.  \n\nFor some reason, though, I do a bit better if I am trying to remember an existing still photograph, especially if it is one I have seen many times.   I cannot call up a mental image of my parents or even my own face, but if I really focus, I *can* somewhat visualize the existing portraits  of my parents that hang at home, or my own portrait that my mother keeps in her living room.   Still fuzzy and shaky, but lots better than the usual 'blobs.' ...this exactly. I once read a great description by another person who is Face blind. He described how he could be looking at an unknown person, trying to work out who they were, when something would kick in - a slight movement or mannerism or tone of voice - and the face would be redrawn (his word) into something he recognised. I know exactly how that feels - It is like a seismic shift right in front of me and the unknown face reassembles in an instant into one I know. It is subtle and definitely not dramatic like the rearrangement of a Transformer, but it is quite unnerving when it happens. The point I am trying to get to is that I do not know if I recognise that person because I can visualise their face and match them up, or if its something else. I definitely have face blindness.  I cannot recognize people except by features.  I also think I have aphantasia to some extent.  I can visualize simple things with effort.  My visual memory is very poor; I have learned to code things in words to reacall them.\n\nI wonder if there are many paths to prosopagnosia.  For example, someone with aphantasia may not be able to visualize well which makes it hard to remember something that is visual input.  Someone with autism may not look at faces, so they may never get the input. I do not have aphantasia and I am not on the spectrum. I am incredibly near sighted and was un-diagnosed near sighted as a kid for years. (I remember getting glasses in the third grade and being amazed that I could see birds flying in the sky, and see bark and leaves on trees.)  \n\nI always thought my near sightedness was a contributing factor to my face blindness, but my son has it too, and he is not near sighted. I love that description.  Yes!  I have often thought of it as the moment something 'clicks,' but that does not quite cover it.  For me too, it is almost like going from looking at a stranger to suddenly looking at a friend.  \"Redrawn\" - or,  your words, \"a seismic shift - describes it much better. This is another thing I wondered about. I used to wear my glasses only while sitting at the computer, and it was like that for many years, but recently I started wearing them all the time, and that is when I realized I have trouble with faces. I have aphantasia, and no prosopagnosia. I think I subconsciously label faces verbally. As I have an easy time recognizing people.\n\nOne difference I have noticed, possibly from having no imagery, is I can identify similar looking people based on facial structure alone. I have met black people who look like Cersei Lannister with just a palette swap. But, yeah I will always remember a face. Names depend on the novelty and the amount of effort put in to recalling. I just cannot draw very well. Faces are no issue. I do have some social issues since it takes time to remember my day, and conversations end up being rather curt, unless we ate talking about something abstract to monologue about. i came to the realization i have some form of face blindness about three years ago when i realized im a Hugh Jackman fan since swordfish nut didnt know that was him until wolverine. i have seen almost all of his movies and loved them all. back on topic of aphantasia. i have vivid imagination, im a visual learner and great at drawing even drawing faces as long as im looking at that face. i will forget the face and cant even recall who i drew afterwards. thing is my brain was so good at glossing over images i never realized when i visualized anything no matter how detailed or real anything else are a person's face is always formless fog orb. even my own face. to tell the truth this have become increasingly jarring the more i notice it.", "Sometimes prosopagnosia sucks So 99% of the time face blindness does not bother me.  I can go months without noticing that it is affecting me.  (It is, but coping mechanisms are natural, so I am not bothered unless I think about it.)  I can go years without it causing me to feel bad emotionally.  But in this last week, I had TWO things that bugged me.\n\n1. My kid is four.  He went through a quick growth spurt with a lot of changes in his face suddenly.  He does not look like my kid anymore to me.  I know a lot of parents get sad and sentimental about their kids growing up; it is not that.  It is that it takes me a while to learn to recognize faces a little and I suddenly cannot recognize his face at all.\n\n2. I saw someone I like recently whom I have not seen in about a year.  He grew a beard.  He now looks like someone I decidedly do not like.  I never saw the resemblance before, but I kind of cringed every time I looked at him for like an hour before I got used to it. That must honestly suck. :(( So sorry Happy cake day! *hugs* Yay! Thanks Gah, the face changes in young kids.  Especially when picking up from day care.  I used to just take home whichever one ran at me shouting \"daddy\". Yeah, I usually take home the one that runs away and completely ignores me...  In seriousness, he is easy enough to recognize as he has a distinctive personality combined with other features.  It just bugs me when people do not look the way I think they are supposed to.  I hate my husband getting hair cuts even after I nag him to go get his hair cut. Took home a couple of girls from a club/event.  \nMet them the month after at the same event, and did not recognise them.\n\nDid not end well. the worst part is that trying to explain everything will only make it worse I did not know about proso back then either, so there was not anything I knew to explain.", "Anyone else not realize they had face blindness for the longest time? This is my first post here and I wanted to see if I am just particularly slow on the uptake or if this is common. \n\nSo I have always been bad at recognizing people. I assumed it was because I do not make enough eye contact or something. Eventually I can identify specific details (mole, body shape, large nose, tattoos, etc.) and use that to figure out who a person is. Takes a bit but I get there. I thought that is how it works for everyone. Some people are just quicker at it. \n\nI heard of face blindness through Brad Pitt and this movie that was about a chick with prosopagnosia who witnessed a crime. But for some reason I thought face blindness was where you could not even recognize your own reflection. Since I understand how reflections work, I assumed that obviously was not me. \n\nUntil I had to take the test. I have never been so stressed when taking a test as I was with that. I think I started to realize it should not be as difficult as it was. It actually put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. \n\nWhen it was explained to me my diagnosis and what it was (meaning not the mirror thing) I felt kind of dumb for not realizing something was amiss sooner. \n\nAnyone else? Or did you all always know something was not right and I was just *hurr-durr*ing my way through life? Seems like almost everyone here did not realize it until later in life. I just assumed everyone looked at faces the way I did and portrayals in fiction were exaggerated. Plus I have never had a problem identifying family members or celebrities on TV. But the reason is that I identify people using qualities other than facial features. Face blandness as a popular concept is very recent. Even in Academic fields it was only widely known about since the 1980s. I found out about my condition only a few years ago, when I learned of the condition. I realized that was the source of some much social trouble I have had over the years. It seems to be hereditary as my father (75) has it as well. His condition is getting worse with age. All I knew growing up was that I always tried to get to places first when I am meeting someone there, so they have to find me, and not the other way around, because I knew there was a good chance I would not recognize them if they changed part of their appearance. I have always had social anxiety and I think a lot of it was just me suffering from face blindness and not knowing. \n\nI am trying to figure out what to do about it. I am a substitute teacher, so as long as I am only at a school for one day, I will recognize kids by what they are wearing. If I am subbing long-term, I get to know their traits. I thought I was just a narcissistic asshole (still may be true). But for the longest time I could not figure out why I struggled so much with recognizing people, and had no idea until I read about it around probably 18 years old. It took me awhile because my face blindness is not that bad. Like I can recognize myself and close family usually. Multiple decades? I was like 35 Never heard of such a thing until I was in my late 40s. As soon as I stumbled upon it, it struck a chord, and so much of my life became crystal clear.\n\nOnly 2% of the population has it, I suspect 90% of people with it have no clue. The guy who wrote the book on facial blindness did not know he had it until years later. Yup, same\nFor context, I am 25 white guy with curly black hairs from France. Just discovered last month I was faceblind. \nActually discovered by doing tests with friends. My bad score compared to others started search and discussions, and I discovered that no, everybody does not rely on haircut and \"walking style\" (as I describe it).\nIt was actually obvious, just that I never had this idea before. By knowing it, this is like having the clue that explain most of the problem never solved I had in my life. I am 30 and I am only starting to think I have it now. Actually the more I think about it the more obvious it becomes. I always knew I was not great with faces but when I was at school or in university, or at work, there were only ever a relatively small group of people that I interacted with at a time (20 at most), and new people rarely came into the picture. So it was nearly a non-issue.\n\nSure, I never knew which celebrity was which, but so what? I guess I never cared much about celebrities, so I never thought much about it.\n\nBut then I started working in an environment with 100-200 people in the same place, many of whom are different the following day. That was totally different. It took me several weeks before I even dared go up to someone and ask them a question, because I did not know if I am supposed to know that person or not. Names are nearly impossible to remember when you cannot recognize the person anyway. Sure, I know there is a John. But which one is it? Without faces, names are useless.\n\nI developed a technique where I say what I think the person's name is behind their back. If they turn around, I know it is their name. Though often they turn around anyway, and often someone sees me calling someone by the wrong name, so it easily gets awkward.\n\nThis would explain *so much* about my life. I have always had issues getting friendly with people and I feel this has severely limited my social interactions. This goes way deeper than what you would think.\n\nIn a way, the fact that it is hard to explain to people, and that it is such an unheard-of disability makes it a lot worse. People assume you are rude or shy and this makes them less friendly towards you. It is like people automatically start hating you no matter where you go. I am in my thirties and only just learned it is what I have got. \n\nFortunately at work everyone wears name tags. And some people wear the same outfit every day. Those are my favorite people. \n\nI will have to try the name thing. I usually just wait until they talk to me. Voices are my little trick. Honestly I rely on those mostly. \n\nThe analogy I use to explain it is trees. We have all seen them. I tell them to imagine a tree they see every day. Whether it be the one in their yard or on their commute. Now imagine I put it in a lineup with a dozen other trees. Could they pick out *their* tree? Sure you can weed out the ones that are obviously different (like an evergreen vs a coconut tree) but when you get to similar ones or even ones of the same species, well it gets harder. Those tests are nasty. They take away everything that makes it possible to distinguish people for me, they stress me out so much, it is as if they are setting me up to fail deliberately and tell me I am worthless. Yeah, I am very very short sighted but even without my contact lenses I can recognize people by the way they move and their contours! And yeah, the way they walk. Exactly! Like I know this should not be as hard as it is but I just cannot work around it.", "I am 33 and have been dealing with this thing my whole life  I really want to talk about my face blindness, so imma talk about it here even though this sub reddit seems pretty darn dead with only 90 subs...oh well\n\nI am legally blind, but I CAN see people's faces clearly from a normal talking distance, I can even notice all sorts of details. Seeing them however are not enough, my mind will not connect the dots, will not form a pattern and even when it does it is temporary, a simple change in scenery, hairstyle, even clothing can make a face seem brand new to me.\nFortunately my situation is not as severe as some out there, I can recognize a male from a female face, which I have heard some people have a problem with too. If I see faces every day and they do not change drastically I can recognize them sooner, tho a simple change in hair, clothing or scenery CAN render even a very familiar face unrecognizable. Still, faces I see every day and if they are not overly generic do stick for as long as I get exposed to them often enough. I have always learned to recognize people based on body language, voice and such but when the anxiety kicks in those things do not seem to always be enough.\n\nBeing legally blind in this case is a good thing, people understand I cannot see well so they assume me not recognizing them is hey, because Oliver cannot see well so that is that, no biggie. So I use my poor eyesight as an excuse for not recognizing people simply because explaining that I have face blindness to everyone would kind of get annoying and not everyone would understand it. That is not to say I shy away from it, no sir, quite the contrary.\n\nI talk about it openly with people, usually people I have know for a while since dumping it on brand new folk would be kind of weird, tho  I sometimes do it if I feel they might find it interesting or understand it. \n\nUnfortunately, moost people do not seem to understand how difficult it is to live with something like this. Orobably because I am generally a friendly, outgoing guy so they do not see it affecting me poorly and assume it is something a person can deal with even though I try to explain how insanely difficult it can be and how uncomfortable it often makes me feel in certain situations.\n\nI live in Europe, Macedonia and in my country as far as I know there is not anyone who would know how to work with a person who has face blindness. 2003-2006 I was attending a psychology college(here our colleges do not have majors, rather the whole college or faculty as we call  them is dedicated to one subject) and even there the professors could not help me or tell me what was wrong with me. Being outgoing I quickly warmed up to people there, but having 100+ faces whose hairstyles would often change, especially on the girls was a social and psychological shock to me. I knew I could not recognize faces alright, but I never thought much of it during elementary, middle and high school it was just a thing I could not do. However, when I started that college...dang\nI made me shy away from social contact and not want to go to college anymore. I really started avoiding any and all social situations, meeting strangers was not and is not a problem for me, but meeting them for the second time is when the stress and anxieties kick in. \n\nFor years nobody knew what my problem was either, I kept explaining my situation to people, to my professors at that college yet nobody thought of it as a big deal let alone something I should stress over so much.  \nJust from studying at my college and some of the things I learned I came to the conclusion that whatever was happening to me was because I missed some crucial period in my brain's development from my first few months of life since I was born 100% blind and was blind until 8 months due to severe congenital cataracts that could not be safely removed until I believe I turned 8 months or so.\n\nI brought that up with a few of my professors and they just said \"who knows, could be, do not worry about it\"\n\nThe social anxiety that kicked in, my inability to read all those massive books by myself due to my poor vision, the lack of any kind of help from the staff all led to me dropping out of college (do not you all worry i work as an illustrator now and finished a graduated from a design and multimedia college a couple years back and now I am in grad school)\nI am not the type of person who gets depressed, but to say that this whole situation did not bum me out would be a lie, I had this amazing friend back in high school who started the same college back then a year before me and when I could not recognize HER of all people at college several times I knew I was not right in the head and that really got to me. I have had situations and still do where I do not recognize some of my best friends even if they come up to me and talk to me, it can and does get stressful at times.\nIt was so bad for me during those years 2003-2008 or so I grew my hair long just to pretend that I could not see/recognize people because my hair was getting in my face and such as i was walking the hallways of that college. Still I was never a longer, I kept interacting with people, I kept engaging people into conversation BUT I kept acting out, being the class clown, being a troublemaker all to have people think of me as a dumbass so that when I cannot recognize them it would not be that big a deal.\n\nAround 2010 I believe I figured I would see a therapist, by then I had learned what I had, either I read about it online or saw a documentary on Discovery I cannot remember, but I believe I learned what my deal was around 2008...ish maybe? Dunno, do not matter\nEither way the therapist lady helped me sort of cope with it, but even to this day I still shy away from certain social situations where I have to meet people for the second time and such.\nI mean I could be face to face with a person and not recognize them.\n\n2011 I started a design and multimedia college, I quickly warmed up to everyone there and we all became very close, fortunately it was about 30 people give or take in my class so I was able to recognize them so as long as I was seeing them often enough. BUT...I quickly became kind of popular so students from all years younger and older would greet me, talk to me and such, however by then I already decided to tell people I cannot recognize them due to my poor eyesight so that kind of worked out I suppose :) I would tell some what the real issue was, most I would just tell it is because i cannot see squat.\n\nStill, guys, even now I would be lying if I said I am not having a hard time with this.\nIt can get very uncomfortable in quite a few situations.\n", "I have had an experience exactly just like this with my girlfriend. The fact that he had a hat on made me wonder if this woman was face blind. ", "How does he remember?! ", "New shirt, who dis?  Oh yeah, we have all been there. Ahahahahaha Pro tip, only befriend people with wildly a bizarre  fashion sense and you will never lose them What if you *are* the friends with a wildly bizarre fashion sense? Even better!

I would know, all my friends look like goth wizards or confused time travellers I generally look like a tourist or guy fieri without the hair.\n\nMy friends though are generally normal looking i would say, though you do not get many eccentrics in Nebraska!  \n\nI need to find myself some confused time travellers haha lol that sounds wonderfully eccentric. If you are looking for some confused time travellers I recommend getting into the historical costuming community, they are a lovely bunch and very brave with their dressing Being covered in tattoos or having unique features/scars can help too Ah look it is the story of my life! Lmao", "Anything but photo ID\u2019s... I work in a dormitory, so recently we had a flood of students checking out for the summer.  It was stressful, in part because of high demand, but in particular because of moving bins.\n\nTo keep students from taking off with our wheeled moving bins, we hold on to their drivers license/photo id/whatever while they are using them.  Unfortunately, I was solely responsible for returning said cards when the students came back...\n\nYeah, it did not go so well.  Hopefully no one tried to impersonate another student, because I had to just ask their names and hope they were who they said they were. I used to bartend and was 100% useless when it came to ids. So long as the person was the same gender/color as the license they gave me, and that license was over age, they got served. Oh, no kidding.  I have worked with children where I had to check IDs before returning them to the right people.  I was NOT comfortable with the job, but it was before I knew I had prosopagnosia, so I though everyone was like that except like...I do not know, ID checking experts?  Now I would tell my boss that I cannot do that.  I always made excuses for someone else to check if there was something like a custody depute going on, but otherwise if the kid acted like it was the right person and they matched the ID demographically, I assumed it was them.  Too scary. I have two aunts that are very similar looking.  We were at a wedding once that had a cash bar.  Aunt #1 wanted to get a drink, but left her purse upstairs in the hotel room.  (It was a really big hotel, so it would take about 10 minutes to get it.)  They decided to have Aunt #1 try to use Aunt #2's ID.  If they did not accept it, they were going to pretend they accidentally got them mixed up and figured there would not be trouble, because both aunts were in their late 30s.  Apparently, the bartender looked at it slightly longer than normal, but accepted it.  They wondered if he had just assumed a different hair style (their hair is different, but faces very similar...so they are easy to tell apart for me!) or if he could see that she was clearly old enough and did not care.  I never understood how he could tell.", "How bad does it have to be for it to be prosopagnosia? I have known about face blindness for a long time but never would have considered to have it myself. I mean, I recognize my friends and family, so clearly I am not literally blind to faces. But  I do find it really hard to tell people apart and learn their names if I have only have short interactions with them. I may have to meet people 5-10 times and actually spend time talking to them for a long time in order to really recognize them. This causes me to avoid people because I never know if I am supposed to recognize them or not.\n\nI never realized this but it has definitely affected my entire life. Most things in life require basic interactions with people and this makes it terrifying. I have gone 30 years without even realizing this, I just thought I was shy or socially awkward. I am actually just really bad at recognizing people when I do not know them well. And this in turn makes it difficult to know them well... It is like having a disability except you cannot tell anyone because they do not even know it is a thing. I feel like that if it is causing problems in your life then it is a problem. \n\nI would say I have it bad enough that it would be a bad idea to get a job where knowing faces is important, like a security job. There was one time I had to describe someone suspicious to a security guard and I could not get into details. He was just a guy, wearing these clothes. It is also bad enough that it is gotten me into some awkward situations that have embarrassed me horribly. \n\nIt is also bad enough that it makes it difficult to enjoy live action TV shows and movies. Not all of them, but some. I think this is why I enjoy cartoons. \n\nWithin the last couple of years I have nonchalantly mentioned to new people that I have face-blindness that can cause problems and nobody has said anything about it but I do have that to fall back on. \"Remember when I said I have faceblindness? That is why I did not recognize you in the crowd!\" So I think it is worth mentioning to new people you meet, just casually let them know that you have it and do not take it personally if you do not recognize them. There will likely be some people who will get offended and those are the people not worth your time \\*unless you HAVE to interact with them\\*. So there is a technical definition that is like the bottom 4% or something close.  BUT I feel that generally if it is bad enough that affects your daily life (not like that one time you did not recognize someone and it was embarrassing) I think you can describe yourself as having it.\n\nI did not realize what was going on until my mid-twenties.  (I am in my thirties now.)  I did know what prosopagnosia was from college psychology classes but thought it was only the most extreme, just like you.  (Although to be fair, every so often I have trouble recognizing my own child, but I almost always do.)  \n\nI am really social, and I thought I was just being self-centered to not remember people.  I was confused as how I could be clearly extroverted, but hate parties.  I tried to focus on people more, but listening more closely to what they were saying.  I have a very good oral memory, so I started remembering pretty much everything people said...but I am socially aware enough to know that is creepy.  So then I was not knowing who people were OR I was remembering every single detail about them for the last few months.  And I had crazy, complex coping mechanisms.\n\nIt was such a relief to figure out what was going on.  One, it helped me remember people better, because I knew what to do.  Two, it helped me feel better about not knowing people.\n\nI do not recognize people by their whole face, but I recognize them by learning features.  (A suggestion: Do not identify \"John\" as the guy in the blue shirt.  Shirts change.  Work on learning words or if you can visualize simple images to represent different face, nose, etc. types.  Hair is okay, but it changes too.  Although maybe that was just an example.)  I personally find voice, mannerisms, and style most helpful.)\n\nI feel like I am extremely bad at recognizing (I pretty much guess randomly on most facial recognition tests,) but \"high functioning\" as far as daily life, because I have a lot of work arounds.  Sadly, one of them limits my social life; pasting a preoccupied, spacey look on my face in public places, so I do not have to show recognition when seeing people.  A friendly smile and eye contact works too, but can also have some down sides.  (I always wondered why so many socially awkward and downright creepy people initiated long conversations with me.)  I ask generic questions to try to tease out someone is identity.  And I know using people's names is a good practice, but generally I never greet people by name in case I misidentify them. Things like this are on a spectrum. The woman who cannot tell their kid from Adam is an extreme case. I, for example, can absolutely recognize my mom. I lost her once at Disneyland because she was wearing shorts and she never wears shorts but I found her soon enough. For most psychological disorders the definition is something like 'Is it bad enough to effect your daily habits?' 'Has it been going on for more than 6 weeks?' and that is it. I feel bad for socially awkward people with this condition. I can absolutely ask someone a thousand times what their name is idgaf. I also find that if I treat everyone as if we have met before, they will not notice that I have no idea who they are when I do not know who someone is. I do not expect these tactics will work for you, though, and that super sucks I am sorry.", "Faceblind podcast: ep 2 ", "I did not recognize my own mom I went out to lunch with my mom the other day, and she went to the bathroom. She was gone for a while, she later told me she got lost. I could see a woman coming around the corner and she smiled at me but it was not a grin, it was a very enthusiastic smile. I remember being slightly confused or maybe even weirded out, I have had a few of the instances where people literally look like this \"=D\" and I am super confused why they are smiling at me like that - it is always people that know me.\n\nThen all the sudden she is sitting with me. It is my mom. The first thing I said was I did not even recognize you and she said \"why?\"\n\nIt always concerns me there is something really wrong with me when I make a mistake like this I have not the faintest idea what my own mother looks like. Have not seen her for 2.5 years. Also do not know what my wife looks like, and I saw her this morning. I was on a work day trip with  my boss and the owner of the company. We spent 7 hours together in the car, in the restaurant, and in the business meeting. driving home, I was totally confused why this complete stranger was talking to me like I knew him. I awkwardly walked away. And then he followed me out to the car and got in the car with me and it was my boss. \n\n:/ I cannot clearly picture anyone's face in my head.

This is my problem regarding remembering faces.\n\nAfter some exposure, I have no problem recalling their faces even after a long period of time, like remembering an co-worker colleague I come across or something like.\nBut brief exposure or rare exposure to a face and I will not be able to recall it, even if it is a significant exposure, such as a one time stand of let us say if a person robbed be.\n\nAlso prosopagnosia tests focus on recognizing faces using short-term memory, and although I am not great, I do fine in this tests. The problem is long term memory. Sorry.  You will have to keep looking to find yourself a disability. It is a spectrum.  It sounds like you are not fabulous at recognizing faces, but it is not a serious problem for you.  Some recognition problems are normal.  For example, eye witnesses are notoriously bad at recognizing criminals, because of the stress or focusing on something like a gun. I know that is an issue, but I am good at handling stress and I have robbed once by armed people.\nI would be great at recalling details about the whole thing. But not their faces. If you meet someone at a party, will your recognize them five minutes later?  How long does it take you to learn to recognize a new coworker? Oh, also, do you have trouble following plots in movies because you do not recognize characters? No need to downvote him guys, I am also not sure if this is what I have. It say sometimes if it is fast faced with a lot of characters. Like Game of Thrones (which I do not like). I would say I probably will not if you we were just quickly introduced and I had something else in mind. Most of the time I think I would.\nI very rarely attend parties, so I do not really have a large sample size to think about.\n\nWhile working in a position I held my work was pretty crazy sometimes with customers and while I had to go pick up something for one for quite some time I would forget who it was for when I was back if there were a lot of people at the space (it often was full of other people), after I while I made a mental annotation for clothing and/or general characteristics. But I think it only happened because of how crazy paced it was, but it shows to a degree that I am not great at face recognition even for short-term memory.\n\nAbout learning to recognize a coworker, I would say 1-5 days to recognize when on the work (a lot easier while there), depending how close we worked. Outside work, from 2 to 20 days (really depending on the amount of exposure I am getting). So my GUESS would be the you are on the borderline between very mild prosopagnosia and normal but crappy at facial recognition.  For reference, I would say I have moderate to severe face blindness.\n\nThere is no way I would recognize anyone if I met them at a party no matter how closely I paid attention, unless there was something significant about them.  I do not attend parties where I do not know people for this reason.\n\nI work in schools.  Typically I have around 30 coworkers.  Some I see multiple times a day, some I see a couple of times a week.  It takes me several years to learn all of my coworkers.  Again, paying attention only helps if they have something distinctive to help me remember them.\n\nI cannot follow most action movies because they tend to have characters dressed similarly.  I do not like them unless someone sits next to me and tells me who everyone is.  It took me about 3 seasons of Friends to reliably tell the 6 main characters apart. About parties, I would recognize people in situations you described in most cases. \n\nBut if we met at the party and at a much later date (let us say 6 months), there was another party, I would not recognize anyone. Only a tiny chance I would if I talked for hours with someone, but even then, if s/he has a common face, I would not.\n\nI understand that if I have prosopagnosia it would really be a mild case, but since my problem is a lot worse regarding long term memory transition, I am curious if this could be something else.\n\n\nThanks for posting Could be.  Sometimes it is helpful to tease out exactly what is going on with your brain and unless it is something common, that can be hard to do.  I thought I was being a complete jerk and not paying attention to people, and it was helpful to know A.) I was not, and B.) What to look for to recognize them.  Sometimes it does not really help anything, but rarely is harmful. Are you sure it is actually the face you are recognizing? Most people with developmental proso will use a number of cues to recognize people. Hair, voice, body shape, gait...etc. I rarely have issues recognizing people out of context. Sometimes, I can recognize someone I have seen only once (usually that person was insanely rude before). \n\nI was caught on a panel that used celebrity faces I would otherwise recognize but with no hair, makeup, color, neck, or facial expression. Occasionally, I doubt my proso then at some point something happens. Recognition is like an unconscious sum of a million little parts for me. Their basic facial structure is just not one of them. I also use other cues, but I am using the face to recognize. For example, that Jim Carrey and Jack Nicholson gif, I can easily tell them apart, of course they look alike there, but I had no difficulty seeing it was two different persons and even without knowing I was almost sure the other person was Jim Carrey... Examples: My son watched all of Terminator: Salvation thinking the two main characters were one person. \nCary Grant and James Mason in North by Northwest, same person to him.\nThe new actress who played The Oracle in the third Matrix, same exact woman as the previous actress to him. (It is not)\nThe ex-husband on Veep is Adrien Brody for him. (It is not)\nOcean's 12 had all new actors from Ocean's 11. (It did not) \n\nAnd in real life he does not recognize people out of context, like a teacher at the store, our neighbor somewhere else, his friend's mom at the store, etc. \n\nIf other people notice it and it really gets in the way of functioning at the same level as everyone else it is probably prosopagnosia.", "What if I do not recognise my kid? So this may sound silly but I am terrified I will not recognise my future kids because of face blindness.\n\nAm I worrying for nothing. How do you deal with face blindness as a parent?\n\nI just keep imagining arriving at kindergarten or school and not knowing which kid is mine.\n\nSometimes I am almost tempted not to have kids because I am terrified. I fear if I ever have twins lol Maybe just keep note of what they are wearing that day when you drop them off. I forgot to mention I live in the UK and most schools have uniforms :(. What about the color of their backpack? I can imagine it causing problems, but of course something that is going to make a big difference is being open with your kid about your face blindness. They will learn to live with it, they can come to you when they notice that you are trying to find them in a crowd but cannot recognize them etc etc. Use any one of a number of coping mechanisms. Are you able to recognise family members or your partner (if applicable)? Milder prosopagnosia can sometimes be mitigated to a degree with constant exposure to a person, or at least make them easier to recognise even if you could not draw a picture of them from memory. I am faceblind and I have a 16 yr old son. I remember him pretty well because I see him every day. There have been times when I have struggled to pick him out of a crowd, but I find him because I know the shape of his body and the way he moves. Many times I have failed to identify him in photographs. It does bother me when that happens, but I can deal with it. Do not be afraid. Expect to have occasional problems, and be prepared to handle them. So what if you do? I did not recognize my own kid in my own house because she had her hair back in a ponytail.\n\nThere are far more important things to worry about. It will not be a problem. You will know them by other clues I am a teacher and have a two year old.  I guess it depends on how severe your prosopagnosia is, how unique looking your kid is, and how good you are at using other cues.  Some things that make you feel better:\n\n1. I find it way easier to tell kids apart than adults.  First, kids two years apart are usually completely easy to tell apart because the age difference is obvious.  Second, kids personalities stand out more than adults.  But maybe that is just me.\n\n2. Until your child is older, you have quite a bit of control and influence in their appearance.  Dress your kid in clothes that are unique.  (I do not mean make your kindergartner wear weird clothes, but shop for comfortable clothes that your kid likes or that blend in with normal fashion that are handmade or from an obscure online store.  That way no other kids are likely to be wearing the exact shirt you send your kid to school in.)  You can also pick hair-dos that are slightly different than the norm.  (Again, unless your child wants it, I would avoid anything that made them look completely different from their peers, but you can make it a little different.)\n\n3. You can tell your kid and the adults that work with your child the concern.  This can help for things like pick up. \n\n4. You may not recognize your child easily at a soccer game or school performance (so sit by someone who knows your face blind and will point them out) but most things with kids are pretty structured.  Your kid will be in a certain place at a certain time.  Often the kids they spend time with are the same, so you can start recognizing other kids too.\n\nSo the school pick up issue: I work in schools.  Someone will probably walk your child to a pick up location if they do not take the bus.  Your child will look for you there.  (You can wear something brightly colored that stands out.  Tell them to wave when they see you.) Your child will be dressed in the same outfit that you picked that morning.  You can go to the adult and say, \"I am here to pick up Child's Name.\"  You can also come slightly late (like on time, but not early,) and most of the kindergarteners will already be picked up.  If you ever need to pick your kid up early, they will call them to come down to the office to you.  Exact policies vary by school, but pick up is pretty controlled these days.  I think this situation is pretty easy to manage.\n\nTotally have kids if you want to and think you will be a good parent.  You will have some problems with face blindness, but there are ways to cope.  And all parents have some type of issue. I usually recognise the way they walk or dress and it helps that my wife is Asian. But even then, I frequently cannot tell people apart even if one person is Asian and the other white or Arabic. my mum is faceblind and she has four kids. sometimes she just cycle thru names until someone responds. there have been some (failed) attempts to develop completely different styles to stand out, but we are all managing just fine regardless.\n\nsince you are concerned abt uniforms, you could try adding distinct clips or beads to the hair if long, or hair dye (or those temporary colourful hair gels), or giving your child jewelry or stickers or a temporary tattoo,, or you could just wait until they start talking and you would be able to pick them out by their voice. Has it ever happened that you could not recognize your son and had to ask for help? How did people react? That is really helpful, thanks :).  \n\n\nI used to volunteer in a school in Korea and was in charge of dozens of kids. I did not know I was face blind back then and do not actually remember having any problem. I did fail to recognize people sometimes but nobody cared. I think this is one of many cases when fear is likely to hurt me more than reality. Occasionally when he was younger in a school or daycare situation, a teacher or aide would see me searching and find him and hand him over to me, but that is just part of every day life in those jobs. I never saw any negative judgement from them. I still get myself wrong in some yearbook photos from when I was a kid. Nowadays, it is much easier because I have a beard etc. I sometimes confuse my fianc\u00e9e with her mom, or cannot recognize her when she sends a picture of her with a friend of hers. That is no problem. You will spend like everyday with your kid. Mabey try and tell your kid about it and ask him/her to do something unique if you see him/her.

So I am (34f) an undiagnosed prosopagnoia, but I am sure (since my sisters and mother are the same), that I have some form of face blindness. I suffered trauma in my past, but when I flashback \nor try to remember, I do not remember their faces. \nI worry I will not recognise them if I passed them on the street. \n\nHowever, in dreams, their features are clearer, to the point where I can recall feeling a \"wow, I recognise you\" kind of feeling in my dream. Then when I wake up, I do not remember them again, neither dream or memory.\n\nI work in retail and often have customers approach me with an affectionate or friendly smile, which means I have obviously dealt with them in the past and switch on my fake \"hello, it is you again\" face.\n\nIts exhausting and sometimes stressful. Does anyone else experience the same thing in dreams? In my dreams, nobody has a face. I recognise close family and friends in real life, and I am better with static 2D faces (photos) than with 3D (real life, but also on TV). In my memories, there are not faces either unless I am remembering photographs. I have a photographic memory but only of still frames, if that makes sense. \n\nThe while thing fascinates me. Do you see faces in your memories? No not at all. Not even myself. I can remember what dress I wore to a wedding, from my memory of looking at myself in a mirror, but cannot remember my own face. I do not recognise myself in photos either.\nWeirdly, there is another post regarding recognition of dogs, and I have found (maybe because I am dog-mad) that I recognise dogs I have previously met.

I do not recognise myself in photos either.\nWeirdly, there is another post regarding recognition of dogs, and I have found (maybe because I am dog-mad) that I recognise dogs I have previously met. I get a small surprise every time I look in a mirror. I could not pick my own face out of a lineup. And I remember my wedding dress perfectly, 19 years later (I am 38 - I got married at 18. Still married. But he cut his very curly hair very short during our engagement and it threw me for a real loop. I did not know about face blindness back then.)\n\nFunny about dogs.

I do not always recognise family and friends, not even in photos, but I can still 'see' the pages of a chemistry text book that I studied 45 years ago.

I have started this thread due to a problem I currently have that would probably interest you, and while I doubt what I have in my mind would be of help to you guys, it is been bugging me for hours to share it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Recently, I have seen Brew's video on youtube about Prosopagnosia , and it talked about the condition and how a woman Zoe Hunn managed to recognize the face of a mime after some features just jumped out to her during one of his shows. This did not cure her condition but made her be able to recognize one face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis event made question what I knew of Prosopagnosia and took up valuable time I could have spent studying but it would not leave my mind no matter what so off I went into the rabbit hole of overthinking things that will ultimately prove useless. It would not be the first this happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs such I came up with a theory that I would like the help of those with this condition in order to prove or disprove it. What theory that is one might ask? Well this will take some explaining and while you might be familiar with the theory itself or at least the details please just hear me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight, we all know that the condition is caused by the part of our brain that is responsible for identifying faces not working properly, but the parts of the brain that are responsible for identifying objects are separated and work mostly independently.\n\nThis combined with the aforementioned case made me wonder if we could somehow trick the part s of the brain responsible for identifying objects to take up the slack of those parts responsible for identifying faces.\n\nSo yes my theory is basically ' Part of our brain is not functioning properly, can we trick other parts to pick up the slack, at least partially?'\n\nAs such I came up with several, I guess you could call them, exercises, to see if this is possible.\n\n1. I would like those without this affliction and look on your face and pick the most distinctive feature of your face, it might be eyebrows, your nose or your eyes. Once you have done that I would like you to apply make-up so that you enhance that particular feature as much as possible, even if looks ridiculous. If possible try to do this to several features at once if possible or just try to do it to  one after another if it does not elicit any reaction from the other person. The purpose of this is to trick the brain into registering only a specific part of one face and trick it into categorizing it as an object, thus hopefully forcing the brain into remembering it. Hopefully with this the brain will recognize the feature(s) you have picked both while under make-up and after it is removed.\n\nYou may also try to erase some of your face features to accentuate others with make up. ***(Please for the love of god do not do anything permanent to your face(s))***\n\nThis idea was inspired directly by Brew's video on the matter and what I understood of it but it does seem like an interesting thing to to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n 2. Now the second attempt is also related to make-up but in this case instead of trying to accentuate one of your features, you add others, specifically inhuman ones. Make yourself look like a werewolf/cat etc. Basically in this you add features, trough make up that make your face look, well not like a human face, but like something inhuman, if not alien. For this I  would like you guys to try and do it in two different ways, \n\nFirst I would like you try and do it for half your faces, while the other half remains untouched.  This is because I think that if it is done to only half the face( or a smaller/ bigger part if you want to mix it up) the brain will not see the whole picture as a face but as an object and allow to brain to remember both the inhuman part and the normal part. hopefully leading to the person remembering the entire face and not just some prominent feature of said face\n\nSecondly, as you might have guessed, is to apply this on the entire face or at least most of it, while leaving one or two of your features untouched (eyebrows, lips , etc). This should hopefully help the mind remember one or two features of a face.\n\nI got this idea from reading a story( I think it was a fanfic I red some months ago or something) in which the protagonist had something similar to this condition if not exactly the same . While the protagonist could distinguish alien faces could not distinguish human faces. I am not sure if this would apply as while I tried to find anything on the subject of those having this condition being able to identify non-human faces(dogs,cats, etc) I have found little information that would confirm or deny it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Third and the idea that just came up to me while writing this, is to take your phone and apply various filters and/or effects to your camera as you take pictures and show them to the one with Prosopagnosia and see if any of those filters modify the image enough that the brain recognizes it.\n\n I have little hope of this actually doing anything, well less hope than any of the other tricks but well, it is something and probably requires the least amount of time and resources to put into action.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Fourth and last is slight a modification of my first idea, the basic principle and the way it works is different however. All you need to put into application is to find a mask, be it a geisha mask or something similar that when shown two different examples of said mask the one with the condition can tell the differences between two slightly different examples. Once such a mask is found, you will need make up again, in order to make your face as similar to what the mask looked like and then if the one you are showing to can see it disperse the make up and reapply it again only thinner or perhaps not on the entire face and leave one or two of your prominent features without make up on them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post and possibly insensitive nature of it but this idea has just come to me and when it happens I either get the urge to write it down and/or share it and this time the idea just would not let me not share. Sorry if this offended you guys/girls but it just would not stop bugging me until I wrote it. Before you start writing and/or doing anything of what I have said above, I would like to say that I am not a doctor, or hold a significant amount of knowledge in anything even related to medicine. The words above are a rambling idea of mine that would not leave me until I shared it and I have absolutely no expectations of the 'tricks' I gave above doing anything but wasting one's time and or making you waste some time.\n\nI have had such ideas in the past and shared some of them on different platforms and accounts and they rarely got any results or even acknowledgement(positive one at least). Do not treat this as if it were medical advice or even the advice of someone with deep knowledge of the subject as I posses neither in this particular instance. From what I can tell,  a lot of what you are describing are tricks and coping skills I have picked up naturally.  The only way I recognize people is by focusing on one aspect of their face. People that are very generic looking (no blemishes,  \"average\" facial features) are really hard to recognize.\n\nI had a hard time completely understanding what you were getting at on the above so I would like to clarify.  Are you saying we should train our brains out of face blindness? Our brains have s lot of plasticity and room for growth,  but I would really surprised if we do not already make up for it in some way.  Ever since I have realized I am face blind it is gotten easier to recognize people because I know what to look for. So as the person in question that the article is written about, it is a ton of absolute blocks, for a start. I can recognise distinctly different things, like Robert de niros mole. Since I got into facial expressions, my hit rate is pretty good for recognition. Like the way someone smiles, or specific ways people use their facial muscles. That guy was just really distinctive - I 'recognise' my mate with a brightly colored weave, but also I spent way too long staring at someone else with the same colour hair thinking it was her.", "do you keep up with celebrities/actors/comedians? i always had trouble remembering them and recently attributed this to face blindness. through middle school and high school friends found me \u201cout of touch\u201d for not knowing the names of many actors/musicians/etc. i was curious to see how many others also had this experience growing up.\n\n( I cannot be bothered with any social media or entertainment news specifically because I have no idea who all of those people are. I cannot bring myself to care about all that information when I cannot connect in any way with the people in the photos. I have enough trouble remembering people IRL, there is no point in me trying to remember celebrities. There are some actors that I like, but a lot of them I cannot recognize if they change their look too much (Johnny Depp is an example. Love him but cannot recognize him because he changes his look so much for every role). I also think a lot of celebrities look the same and I cannot tell the difference (Daniel Radcliffe and Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and Cameron Diaz, Chris Pine and Chris Pratt, etc.) \n\nTbh I think it is annoying when people keep talking about celebrities. Especially when I am watching movies with friends, and they recognize an actor from somewhere else and have to have a whole conversation about what other movies and shows that actor has been in. Just watch the movie! I watched a lot of movies growing up so certain faces will stick out to me more than others, but rarely immediately. Same goes for other celebrities- if I am exposed to them a ton through various forms of media their faces will be a little less alien to me with time. I spend a lot of my time on the internet so that could contribute to exposure as well. Certain celebrities faces have even helped me with recognizing other people in my day to day life, even if only a little.\n\nWith most celebrities, however, I tend to focus on their names and the art they produce more than their faces. For example, I am less focused on what an artist like Vince Staples looks like because it scarcely impacts the art he makes. I doubt I would recognize him in public, but that is not really a necessary skill for most people. From a very young age, I could never keep track of celebrities that people around me were talking about. I could not recognise actors on screen, people on magazine covers, or any of that. Conversations with me about famous people pretty much began and ended with, \"Oh, I did not notice.\" I can recognise actors I like from their voices. 0 interest in celebrity 'news' though. For a long time I thought people just straight up memorized who is in every movie. I could not imagine just watching a movie and recognizing the actor. Recognizing a character from scene to scene is hard enough, let alone their actor in a different story altogether!\n\nI have never cared enough to put any effort into keeping track of famous people. It just does not matter at all and I have never had a problem with that. Maybe \"many\" is relative though? I have never kept up with celebrities. I honestly cannot see the point. I feel like I might be in a different boat than many here. Of celebrities I like, I can be pretty good at recognizing them; might take me a bit to learn to tell similar ones apart, but yeah. But I am still very much \"This just... is not interesting enough to me / It feels a bit rude. Let them live their lives\" for the most part. (I might read more about stuff I hear on occasion, but it is not my usual topic of interest.)", "Do I have it? I have recently found out about prosopagnosia, but because I only know what I see, and not what other people see, I cannot tell if I am just \"bad with faces\" compared to everyone else, or if there is something more...\n\nMaybe someone who has it can better \"diagnosis\" me by seeing if our experiences are similar.\n\nI do not know how to \"diagnosis\" myself, but it seems like my experiences are similar to other people with prosopragnisa.\n\nI do not think I have a severe form of it. Maybe a mild form of it.\n\nHere is some of my experiences that makes me think I have it. I do not know, maybe I am just bad with faces, or maybe I just takes time for me to process/identify a person, or maybe I cannot REMEMBER the person. It is confusing...\n\nAnyways:\n\n1. There is SO MANY times were people would come up to me, recognizing me immediately, while I have NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE OR HOW THEY KNOW ME. Especially if we meet somewhere we usually do not me (Ex. if I met someone from school, and meet them in a supermarket, I cannot recognize them immediately). \n\nI kind of just smile (while trying to figure out who they are) while they approach me. It takes a while to process who they are. Usually, it is by their posture or voice. \n\nIn fact, that is how a lot of my interactions with people goes whenever I meet them somewhere unexpected. \n\nThey recognize me, while I awkwardly pretend to know them for a few minutes, until they act in a certain way that lets me identify them.\n\nI cannot tell you how many times this happens, and I feel really bad because they know who I am, but I have no idea who they are! \n\nOther examples:\n- My roommate (who usually have long hair) usually dresses in skirts was wearing her work clothes and had her hair up. She greeted me and for a solid 2 minutes, I was trying to figure out who she was even though she was right in front of me. \n- My dad sent me a picture of me. I asked him why he sent me a picture of a random girl. He said that is me. (the picture was taken a while ago though).\n- I bumped into my friend in the supermarket. She recognized me. It took me a while to process who she was. (she talks in a specific way. \"heeEEEEYYYYyyy\" She has an upwards inflection when she talks. Easy to identify :P ) I known her for more than eight years.\n\n2. I do not identify people by their faces, but by their clothes, posture, etc. If I ever get asked to do a police sketch, sorry, I cannot tell you any details on the face. Clothing, height, hair length, hair color, is fine, but face? They have eyes, nose, and a mouth. \n\n3. It seems as though people can identify celebrities easily on TV. I have a harder time doing it.\n\n I cannot tell if because celebrities tend to look alike, since people tend to joke about it (ex. Katy Perry and Zoey Deschanelor) what. This is usually when comparing actor/actress in two different movies they are in. \n- Example: \n1. Dad: \"Hey, it is Angelina Jolie\"\nMe: \"THAT IS ANGELINA JOLIE?!\"\nDad: \"Yeah, do not you recognize her?\"\n\n2. Friend *looking at a picture*: \"It is Arnold Schwarzenegger!\"\nMe: (thinks she is kidding because he is not dressed like how he is in the Terminator, until I compared the two pic of him in another picture) \n\n3. I was not able to recognize Robin Williams, Jennifer Aniston, Johnny Depp (it is easier to recognize him if he is in his pirate outfit lol. I actually did not know he was in the avengers), Scarlett Johanson (avengers vs lucy. The hair color throws me off), Emma Stone (red hair vs blonde hair), Tom Cruise, Jennifer Lawrence (blonde vs brunette).\n\nOn the other hand, I do not pay attention to celebrities, but it is really amazing to me when people can point out celebrities in a movie, while to me, they seem like a new actor/actress. \n\nGenuinely, if a well-known celebrities was walking down the street, wearing casual clothes, I am most likely not going to recognize them.\n\n3. I cannot \"remember\" faces.\nIt seems like I can see faces just fine. I do not see a face-less person, but I cannot seem to remember them. If someone told me to draw a portrait someone (even if it is someone I am close to), I will struggle with it.\n\nSome people seem to easily recognize people and describe them by their faces, and I am left wondering \"HOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?!\"\n\nIt is mostly the recollection of the face I have difficulty with. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``\n\nI am sorry if this is long, repetitive, and hard to read. I am a little confused. I do not know what other people see so it is hard to compare my perspective with theirs, and I do not know if I am just 'bad with faces', and I feel like a shitty person whenever people recognize me but I do not know who they are. \n\nps. sorry about the format. I am not too familiar with the reddit format.\n\n\n\n", "New to group I am really happy I found this group! In high school I started realizing that I do not recognize faces out of context, ie if I saw a teacher or classmate outside of school I would struggle to realize that is was them. Sometimes I would even see someone who looked similar to my mom and I would have to look at things like clothes or shoes to see if it was her.  \n\nNow I am a dog groomer with my own business, and typically I only have dogs for an hour, but when the owners return to pickup, a lot of the time I have to ask them who they are there for. \n\nI feel super embarrassed sometimes because someone I have only met once or twice will recognize me, but I have literally asked them for their name as if I had never met them. Welcome! In my experience, telling people upfront that I am \"bad with faces\" and might not recognize them if I see them again cuts down on the embarrassment of having to explain it *after* I have not recognized them.

I have noticed over the years that I tend to look in the mirror a lot because I am never totally certain what I am going to see, and I am curious. Sometimes I look the way I expect, and I am satisfied, but often I do not look the way I think I will - which is a feeling that gets weirder the longer I look at myself.\n\nI am not even sure I can picture my own face in my head, so how do I know what I am expecting to look like?\n\nThe disconnect gets especially strong when I go camping for a long time and look in the mirror after not seeing myself for days/weeks. I know it is me, but it is uncomfortably like looking at a stranger.\n\nSo yeah... how well do you recognize yourself? How do you feel when you look in the mirror, or at past pictures of yourself? I do not, everytime I look in the mirror it is kind of I do not remember I have this face...\nsometimes the weird sensation is stronger than others, sometimes it is just \"I do not remember I have this face\" and sometimes it is like I see a stranger in front of me, and it is a little creepy...\n\nI cannot picture any faces in my mind and this is the hardest to me because I cannot even remember the face of the person I am in love with, we do not live together so I cannot see him everyday  and sometimes we cannot see each other for a long time and that is very hard because I cannot remember his face... I usually do but I also just lost ten pounds and looking in the mirror was a bit startling I cannot picture my face in my head, and when I look in the mirror I just think, \"oh is that what I look like?\"\n\nSometimes I expect to see myself differently and it is like, \"ooh yeah!\" But it is not concerning or anything to me. I thought everyone felt like that, so it is only recent I learned that no, that is not normal lol. I do not recognise myself either, in reflection or in photographs. Some days I realise that I have not even checked my reflection, I am so unaccustomed to not looking in mirrors.\n\nOld photos are odd, unless it is a picture I am familiar with and know it is me then almost totally disconnected from it; there is no memory triggered or associated.\n\nThe most unfortunate thing about my prosopagnosia is that my mom died when I was younger, and I cannot \"picture her\". Compounding this is the fact that all our family photos were destroyed in a flood and there is very few left of her.  I can recognize myself in the mirror and photographs, but I have a hard time making avatars/characters of myself. I never know if they look like me or not.  I also stare at my reflection in the mirror for a long time too, trying to figure out what I really look like. I sometimes compare my mirror face vs my face in photographs because I cannot tell if they actually look the same.\n\nFunny story, my husband showed me a picture of his friend with his girlfriend and I seriously thought his girlfriend was my face swapped onto another person. I was so confused LOL I am like why did your friend do that??

Like I know (or believe) I have certain features and I guess I tend to exaggerate them when I make avatars and everybody tells me it does not look like me when I ask  I have no problem, but then I can remember faces it just takes me much longer to than most people I know it is me in the mirror.  I just feel like I have more than one look.  Mostly I recognize pictures, but sometimes I get confused especially with similar looking family members. &gt; I just feel like I have more than one look\n\n!!!\n\nI definitely feel that - there are like three different ways I expect my face to look. I do not know if I chose them based off of pictures or what, but often my face falls into one of those categories. Glad I am not the only one! Oh yeah, when I lost weight my 'new' face threw me off for a while... I liked what I saw, but it was definitely a transition &gt; I seriously thought his girlfriend was my face swapped onto another person... she has the same hairstyle and similar glasses frames as me\n\nOMG, oh no... that is something would absolutely throw me off! Same hairstyle AND glasses, oof\n\n&gt; honestly cannot even tell myself apart if I am not wearing my glasses\n\nI do not wear glasses, but I used to be a barista and I had a little identity crisis every time I had to put my hair up for work :p So, i can recognize myself in the mirror, but i also have a VERY distinctive appearance (purple hair, large glasses, kind of odd face shape) in pictures, i can recognize child me out of my sisters in the picture, but if there are multiple children of the same basic look (before i started wearing my hair very short) that are not my sisters, it gets difficult. I partially know its me in the mirror because i have an...odd....resting affect, but also get a feeling of \"oh. I have a face\" and an odd sensation of being bothered by it. I describe it as what a vampire would feel like if suddenly they had a reflection. Not necessarily negative, but that my face is an afterthought, something secondary to me. Also, i actually had to do a self portrait in one of my drawing classes, and that involved a lot of staring in the mirror and trying very hard to measure and accurately put down my face. The basic consensus at the critique was that the portrait i produced had an almost fishbowl effect, an odd distortion. I honestly dont really care about my reflection, i mostly just check for facial blemishes, clay or paint on my face, etc. and then move on. I dont even use the mirror for things like arranging my hair or changing out my many piercings, because i literally cannot \"reverse\" the image, i end up moving my hand in the opposite direction of where i wanted to move it if i use the mirror, every time.  Apparently when I was young I spent an excessive amount of time staring in the mirror.  I talked a lot about Mo in the Mirror.  I wonder if it was because I was confused.  (I was a very creative child and made a lot of faces, so it could have just been my personality.) I get this way but I have OSDD and thought it was related to alters with different perceptions of their self image.", "X-post from ELI5 about proso ", "I do not recognise people when their hair is different - is that the same thing?

Yes. I would say that is my main coping mechanism This and voice are the only way I can tell people apart. Change of hair or...voice I guess and I am screwed I know how you feel. Similarly, yesterday, spent all morning with some chap who had a hat on. He came back after lunch not wearing his hat. If he had not been sitting where he was, I would not have realised it was him. (To complicate matters I thought he had lots of hair, because it was sticking out around his hat, but actually he was fairly bald). God it is so tiring this prosopagnosia business.\n\nI benefit from the trend of people dyeing their hair bright and unusual colours, I must admit. Same here. I hate having my hair cut because it takes me a couple of days to recognise myself. I cannot recognise people when they put their hair up or down, or put hats on or off. It is definitely a prosopagnosia thing. That is a common complaint of people that have trouble recognizing faces. If someone changes hair color from blue to red, or even brown to a different shade of brown, puts her hair into a pony tail, shaved his head, etc, I often do not recognize them. My husband tends to let his hair grow out quite long (it is curly) before cutting it very short.  It used to really, really bother me.  Now I recognize both of them as someone I love, so it is only startling.\n\nMy son is two.  I control his hair and he gets frequent cuts, so he always looks like my baby.

People will cut their hair and I will not recognize them.", "I forget about my faceblindness and then I remember and am relieved all over again I first learned about prosnopagnosia about 5 years ago and immediately knew I had it. I was so excited to have an explanation for why I have so many struggles with human interaction. I am a textbook case of someone born with it. I read a memoire by someone who has the condition and it was so relatable.\n\nI did a bunch of research and told my family and many friends, and even some coworkers.\n\nAnd then it just kind of slipped away from my consciousness and I did not think about it.

The ultra skinny and ultra fat kids.\n\nI did TERRIBLY at networking events and never got past first conversations with people. In my early 20s I struggled with alcoholism as I drank to forget the pain of the awkwardness of everyone looking like strangers.

We have been married 6 years and I adore him but I could not recognize him a room full of 20 guys around his height and weight with his haircut. I stare at his face and try to memorize his eye contours and his nose and his smile, but I see pictures of him and I do not recognize them but for the setting.\n\nI am glad I choose to work in a field where human interaction is minimal. It helps.\n\nI am an introvert and like just keeping to myself. But sometimes I wish I could build strong friendships.

However I only seem to have current friends wherever I currently work. Friends of convenience?\n\nI probably have other issues besides face blindness but this one is so formative and such a defining part of who I am.\n\nIt feels weird to know that most other people do not have the hard time I do with people.\n\nBut it feels good to know that I am not the only one. I resonate with this. Especially the part about recognizing your husband. \n\nI cannot begin to guess how many times we have gone to the movies, he takes his hat off and goes to get snacks. While I am waiting for him to get back, some *stranger* starts to sit right next to me. Just as I am about to say, \u201cExcuse me, my husband is sitting there!\u201d I realize it *is* my husband. \n\nNow he says, \u201cIt is me\u201d as walks up to our seats. I often wonder if most of us are introverts! It is funny to me because both my parents are extremely extroverted and could recognize a face, a friend from 20 years ago, etc. not me. I find it *INSANE* that people can do this I am not!\nI just do not recognize any of my friends if we hit the town! I relate with how you recognize gait, body shape, style, hair, etc. that is definitely how I recognize people. I am glad you found our sub! It would be an interesting survey to do! I am definitely an introvert and my non face blind family members are more extroverted for the most part. It may is causation? I was extroverted kid and would suffer greatly and then grew introverted and it makes it tolerable to stop desiring what you cant see or remember.", "Are there varying degrees of prosopagnosia? I am trying to understand if I actually have this or not. I do not have any trouble recognizing my siblings or many of my friends, but I have had other experiences that definitely seem like prosopagnosia. \n\nIt is often difficult to keep up with who characters are in TV and movies. If I have met people only a couple times I will not recognize them, especially if it is in a new/unfamiliar context. I was meeting a very close friend, but he got a haircut and I had to really stare to make sure it was him. I once spent an hour talking to a pair of girls, asked if they knew each other in high school or something, and they pointed out to me that they were identical twins. \n\nIs this prosopagnosia, but to a lesser degree than some cases? There are varying degrees.\n\nSounds to me like you are not at the \u201cmild\u201d end.\n\nYou have probably developed strategies for identifying people that you are not even aware of. Voice, style of dress, gait, etc. I, for example, knew for years that I was far better at identifying people from a distance than everyone else. It Yep, sounds like you have it. Facial recognition is a spectrum so you can have face blindness a little bit or you can be a super recognizer.  It actually sounds like you have a decent bit of difficulty, but good coping mechanisms.  Are you recognizing people because you just know their faces (apparently this is normal) or because of a bunch of features.\n\nI do not have any trouble recognizing the people I am close to.  (But my family has a lot of distinct features and I tend to pick friends that stand out as well.)  I do have trouble recognizing extended family and acquaintances.  If I keep myself to a limited social and work environment, I can learn to recognize everyone in it (in context) but am not really recognizing their faces.  I am recognizing a composite of features including facial features, but also voice, style of clothing, gait, personality markers, and so forth.  So I score in the bottom 10% for people with facial recognition (so 50% would mean a typical person who was not really good but did not have difficulties) - I do not know where I score in that 10%.  Of the people I told, my husband was the only one who noticed that I had difficulty, because I keep having him explain movies to me.  I am assuming I have offended someone at some point by not recognizing them, but people I socialize with regularly do not seem to realize that I have any problems. I have the same experience. I can recognize close friends and family and certain co-workers that I see every day, but remembering a new face takes a while. And I forget faces i know if I have not seen them in a while. People vary greatly in their ability to recognize faces.  By scientific convention,  98% of people can recognize faces better than people who are classified as having Prosopagnosia.  Its a cutoff point set for research purposes.", "Casting 'younger versions' would be a lot easier in a prosopagnosic world.... ", "I do not have Pro but I do relate to a lot of the face blindness stuff in here... I have a bad time watching live action films because I cannot even recognize the people in it unless they have a particularly striking appearance in terms of maybe facial hair, or if a woman, some flamboyant clothes. I could not even recognize a person I was staring at for two hours straight when I saw them the next week. I have accidentally greeted a classmate as if they were new despite seeing them before that day... embarrassing lol. I have a very difficult time recognizing people if they have changed their hair or just lost even a smudge of weight oftentimes... this seems to go double for celebrities or any people I do not personally know. If a certain group of people have similar hair or makeup , it is game over for me lol.\n\nI probably just lean towards pro without having it because I do recognize people that I have known intimately for years. Nonetheless, hello \ud83d\udd90 It is a spectrum, you are just not on the far end Bro, that sounds like Prosopagnosia to me. You just have it mildly. It is a spectrum, man. Oh. Lol, I assumed that the actual diagnosis is a full on \u201ccannot recognize any face no matter what\u201d thing. Nope! If you have frequent trouble recognizing people, and it feels like you struggle with it more than others, you probably have Prosopagnosia. Not often enough considering quarantine has now made me stay with the people I recognize as family and because I am a shy person in general, but yeah, I see what you mean lol. Faces are so tricky Also, are you sure you are recognizing family member's faces?  Because when I heard about prosopagnosia in college, it never occurred to me that I had it, because I could - for example - recognize my sister.  Later, I realized that I was not really using her face.  It was her unique features (nose, hair,) the way she moved, her voice, etc. Hm.. I have never thought about that. I do not really have any way of determining that, but I do believe I recognize her by her facial features .... though I am trying to recall her face in my mind and it is not easy lol. Maybe a little of both Sounds like prosopagnosia to me.  Prosopagnosia is not about whether or not you can recognize people; it is about whether or not you use *faces* to recognize people.  \n\nWhen I first read about prosopagnosia, I thought \"Well, maybe I have that, but maybe not\" but after spending some time on the sub, I realized that I definitely have prosopagnosia, as I do not use faces to recognize people, but I do have some pretty good coping mechanisms in place that help me recognize people I regularly associate with.  \n\nUntil I learned about prosopagnosia, it seemed odd to me that my friends had absolutely no trouble recognizing me if I made a significant change to my appearance (such as not wearing glasses when I normally did, or getting a substantial haircut).  It also seemed a bit odd to me that I would always notice immediately if one of my close friends dyed their hair, until I realized that I use hair as one of my biggest methods to recognize people.\n\nRegardless, welcome to the sub, and I hope you find experiences and information that you can relate to here! Yep my mom got her hair straighten at the salon, did not tell me and called me to meet her at the mall food court. She had to call me on my phone to guide me to the table she was sat at.

Glad to found others who have prosopagnosia. It impacts so much of life. I live in a small town where you run into acquaintances at the grocery store every visit. I compensate by being over friendly, smiling and saying \u201chello\u201d to nearly everyone (it is exhausting), but the alternative is that I do not say hello to someone I actually do know (like a co worker or neighbor) and they get irritated that I failed to say hello as we walked past each other.  It is easier to say hi to everyone, than risk missing someone I do know and having to explain prosopagnosia. \n\nMy biggest fear- I am a new parent &amp; do not usually recognize my child when she is in a crowd of her peers. How might this impact the future. \n\nAlso, are you all so darn frustrated when you actually take a minute to explain it to someone and they say \u201coh ya I am bad with faces &amp; names too\u201d. \n Like it is a seriously a hard thing to live with, right?!  Yes, of course that is frustrating. I have tried recently to explain to people so they might not be offended or even help but you are right, this is too far out of the realm of their experiences. \nI have a daughter and granddaughter. I usually recognized my daughter since I saw so much of her (you will also know her clothes, how she wears her hair that day) My granddaughter was hardest toddler-preschool. I had to pick her up when I only see her about once a month and she could have been any of several kids. Now she is six, a tall string bean missing 3 front teeth. Hard to\nMiss!

Dear Morris I have the same problem and sometimes I pick up my son and he always seem to see me first and in a crowd in is really intensive not that he is not easy recognizable, but I just do not spot him easily.

This question reminded me of when my son was a few months old and went through a couple changes of clothes at daycare. I had to ask a daycare worker which kid was mine when I picked him up because he was wearing someone else's clothes.  It was humiliating and I wish I had a name for it then!! \n\nBut yeah, when they were in band it was the worst.

Similarly, can you tell whether the photo you are looking at shows the person that is standing in front of you when you look both at the photo and the person simultaneously?   \nIs it considerably harder to tell if you look at the photo and then at the person immediately after looking at the photo?\n\nI was wondering how to simulate prosopagnosia  contextually and visually to those that do not have it (I do not have it myself except for the mild case in the past but that is a different story). I know there has been a movie about the quality (learned about it from this subreddit) but do not want to rely on that alone.  \n\n\nStrangely, these simple questions have not surfaced in the multiple articles and threads I have browsed or at least I have missed it somehow. No. I forget the face literally as soon as I stop looking at it. I have seen images of one person's face repeated a hundred times (some art thing) and it takes me a little bit to realize its the same face even with the same hair and positioning and facial expression.\n\nI think my closet metaphor is to show someone a full page of pi's digits, take it away, then ask what the last number on the 17th line was. You know you were looking at numbers but the details are unknown Sometimes, after a game of spot the difference, which I generally only do if I know I should be looking out for someone or something. Photos taken moments apart are much easier to compare than photos taken years apart. Angles, lighting, even expressions make a considerable impact, too. \n\nI have no idea if it is like this for others, but for me, it is a lot of information being presented all at once, which I have to manually break down to guess and sort between what is important and what is not. If a key detail is obscured or changed, I am likely screwed, lol. Not with 100% confidence, no.  Same person, same angle, same lighting but longer hair or different clothes, and I will doubt myself enough to not presume they are the same person. &gt;Can you tell that two different photos show the same person if you look at them both in the same time?\n\nif they are of a stranger, not a chance. \n\nIf they are of a very famous person, it will depend if I have seen these photos before (and therefore my brain has stored a copy of this image and stamped it with the person's name), if I have seen them in this \"role\" before (and therefore metadata stamped). For this reason, I cannot tell Marilyn Monroe from someone playing Marilyn, or the Queen from someone playing the Queen, even if I am looking at comparison images side by side. \n\n&gt;Similarly, can you tell whether the photo you are looking at shows the person that is standing in front of you when you look both at the photo and the person simultaneously?\n\nlike, if I have to check someone is ID, Papers Please style? Low probability of accuracy. It will essentially be a \"probability\" engine: if they have the same scar, same moles, similar features, simliar clothing, or the way they carry themselves. But a determined lookalike will pass the test and I have zero confidence at saying it is NOT the same person if they insist or get upset or point out it is an old photo or hair cut or whatever. \n\n&gt;Is it considerably harder to tell if you look at the photo and then at the person immediately after looking at the photo?\n\nHah! I will be lucky to remember if it was man or woman or child or alien or broom....but this one might be more my ADHD than prosopagnosia.\n\nI will give you another example: my sister and I used to have the same clothing (hand me downs or just easier to buy two identical sets), so if I have not seen a childhood photo before (say, one taken by an uncle), I cannot tell you today if it was of me or my sister. Friends who have several children of the same sex, I also get wrong a lot unless the kids are all together in one place so I can tell big/medium/small. Personally, no, not reliably.  If I were to hold the photo up next to the person, I could not really focus on both at the same time.  I recognize faces by parts not the whole, so I would need to look back and forth between the photo and the person anyway.  \n\nImagine you are trying to ID a plant.  You could hold a photo of a type of plant next to the actual plant and kind of get an idea, but what you would really need to do is look carefully at the leaves in the photo and then the leaves on the plant, and then compare the stem, and so forth. I think the plant metaphor is the one OP should focus on, because it points to a key feature of proso: we use the object recognition part of our brain to identify faces. Some depictions of proso in media have the faces blurred or obscured, so people assume we cannot literally SEE the faces, but this is not the case. When you think of IDing a plant, which has many details and features, and many lookalikes, you get a closer sense of what proso feels like. It feels like trying to figure out if two plants are the same. This ties in very well with what some other people said in the comments: \n\n&gt; Photos taken moments apart are much easier to compare than photos taken years apart.\n\n\\\n\n&gt; a determined lookalike will pass the test and I have zero confidence at saying it is NOT the same\n\nYou really could see very similar comments being made about the reliability of comparing plant photos. Yes, I can recognize someone if I am looking at photos side by side. However, they must look relatively the same in those photos such as having the same hair or height. If it is a side by side of someone when they were younger versus older, I will not be able to tell. Looking at a person after a photo, I will not be able to tell. \n\nThe most common way people simulate the feeling is by cutting an oval of a celebrities face so there hair is not present, then flipping the face upside down. I have no idea if it accurately reflects our condition, given it is the same level of difference for me. Personally I think showing people photos of similar looking animals with one photo being the same animal and having participants try to detect it, is a better way to illustrate it. Unless an animal has a distinct feature humans have a hard time distinguishing them at a glance. Friend shows me a picture of herself with others at a party. My response: \u201cNice! Which one is you?\u201d No, for me looking between a person and a photo of them is exactly the same as looking at multiple photos of the same person and not recognizing them if they have a different haircut or something. They are just different visual images (even if one is in three dimensions right in front of me). It is not really any degree of harder/easier; I just cannot tell at all unless there is a specific trait I can see linking them to make an educated guess, or if I have known them for a long time and the photo is very recent. Even old photos of me look nothing like me and I would not know they are of me unless I recognize the photo. &gt;I was wondering how to simulate prosopagnosia contextually and visually to those that do not have it\n\nShow photos of Gary Oldman. Or any character played by Doug Jones. I watched Legend about the Krays where the same actor plays both kray bros. Had to be told they were the same person. They stand beside each other a lot in the film and I still did not figure it out. This is a great analogy. Thanks a lot - the plant metaphor speaks to me very much. The analogy of cutting out faces' ovals, combined with the plant metaphor given in other comments, really helped me get the idea. Thanks!

How do you interactive with your own face memory? I can not. Not really.   I mean, yeah, if I am looking at a mirror or a photo where I expect to see myself, but otherwise?\n\nOnce at a basketball game,  I got put on the jumbotron briefly.\n\nDid not recognize myself. I have much difficulty picking myself out in pictures. I often ask my wife \"is that me?\" nope. i know its me because logic but i do not recognize that guy Sort of.  I look like different people to me at different times, but I almost always recognize all the faces as mine.  I do not visualize faces, so there is no face memory!  Sometimes I have trouble in a photo I do not remember distinguishing myself from family members who look very similar, but usually I can tell by context without thinking about it. Nope. I am a stranger I have met few people as ugly as I am. Yes, but if I try to picture it in my mind it is pretty blurry/vague.\n\nSame is true for all family members and friends. I do not generally recognize my own face. I have had to ask people who I am in pictures and I have seen myself in the mirror at a department store and thought it was funny that the other person was wearing the same outfit until I figured out it was me.

I totally failed to recognize him (we would been working closely together for about a year and a half at that point) and myself swapped into whatever pop singer it was, and barely noticed any difference even after he explained. I would told him about prosopagnosia before, but I do not think he realized how severe it is until then. the same for me ! Oh that is interesting. I do not know if I have ever seen myself in a face swap. I would want to see if that does anything for my self-recognition. I feel like I have a less severe but definitely extant level of face blindness, but, as far as I am aware, I have always been able to recognize myself. I have that common almost-instinctive reaction of \"I always look for myself first in a photo.\" I do know someone who often takes a second to process themselves in a mirror, though, and ( On Snap chat there is a feature to face swap. My friends were playing with this feature, and they face swapped me with my best friend. Then he showed me the pic and i was very neutral, not recognizing both.

I am a teacher, in an Australian high school. I work in special education and also teach Art.\nI work in a really big school 1,000+ students, who all wear a uniform.\nDistinguishing between a bunch of teenagers all dressed the same is, at times, impossible.\nSometimes I see kids doing the wrong thing, or they give me a hard time, and I cannot do anything about it because I have no freaking idea who they are...

I need kids' styles to help tell them apart!\n\nI feel secondary would be harder where you have more kids - I mostly have the same kids all day, but we rotate or share kids between classes for a few things and it is always hard...no idea who to yell at across the playground!  Also, when I do not recognize my kids 10 years later, I just say that they look so much older (which they do) and they like that.  (I remember them when they say who they are.)  I cannot imagine that works well if you do not recognize high school students 10 years later.\n\nNo useful tips for you, but a lot of sympathy. Name tags.\n\nA) you can ask politely.\n\nB) in the US you have a law that requires simple accommodation for disabilities. Perhaps you have one too?\n\nI think explaining and asking about name tags would probably work. No teacher can remember every student. They already have uniforms, are name tags that much more burdensome? I am getting my teaching degree and that is one of my biggest fears. I am amazed how many face blind people go into teaching. Maybe the profession is a high percentage of the workforce anyway but, since I found out I was face blind over ten years ago and started chatting to other face blind people, I have discovered that a lot of them are in education (me included for a few years). It is guaranteed to be one of the most difficult working environments for us to choose, so why are we not all sitting in lonely booths working on our own? I got bullied in an Australian high school of the same size and was disbelieved because I was unable to identify who did it (I did not know I had prosopagnosia then, I was fairly insulated from it otherwise). I actually never thought about how school uniforms contribute to this because I think they are good otherwise. Interesting point.\n\nI am sorry you have to deal with this. Already so many students to keep in mind, and them just being students, and then lacking an easy way to tell them apart.\n\nI understand you would be pretty hesitant to ask them for their names, and working in special education probably only makes it harder. Tons of sympathy, and respect too - education is really worthy work. I think you are to some extent born social or less social; your experiences can push you one way or another on the spectrum, but are unlikely to change your base orientation.  If you are born social, the cubicle job is not appealing (and still offers awkward interactions.)  People who are face blind and fairly people-oriented seem to often compensate by being overly friendly to everyone.  (People who are less social seem to isolate themselves more.  Both approaches have issues.)  The generic friendliness may increase their desire for more social time making them even more likely to want a career where they interact with people.  And teaching is great compared to sales!  (shudders)\n\nOr possibly teachers are more self-aware of how they learn things as a result of teaching, and are more likely to realize there is a problem.  Or maybe spend more time reading/hearing about various different ways brains can work.  Basically, the same rate of face blindness, but higher rate of realizing it.", "A psychologist's hypothesis of the source of my facial blindness issues I am pretty sure I have had this problem my whole life; relying on objects like glasses, hair, watches and bags to identify others (though I can recognize them if we are close for many weeks, much longer than most people need to learn others \\), not recognizing old friends, and overall just not knowing who I should know.\n\nI have just finished an assessment for ASD, this facial blindness issue being one of the reasons I went for the checkup in the first place. (The others being black/white thinking, almost life-ruining obsessions, some social problems \\, executive function issues, hand-flapping and hair-twirling when young, and some \\ sensory issues including being overwhelmed in crowded, echo-ey and loud areas and dry fingers dragging across paper) \n\nI was told I did not have ASD, due to normal speech patterns, normal back-and-forth conversation, fleeting eye contact while starting which improves over time, and lack of observed sensory issues, repetitive behaviours and echolalia. She believes that social anxiety may fit my description better.\n\nInstead, the psychologist hypothesized that my issues could be due to social anxiety instead. For facial blindness, the hypothesis is that due to not looking at someone else due to anxiety, I was not able to learn their faces well. According to her, it also explains why I recognize people I am close to; since I am more comfortable looking at them, I remember them. This would also mean that I do not actually have facial blindness; just anxiety causing facial-blindness-like symptoms.\n\nDoes anyone else relate to this? I am curious! I am a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

Someone who had known me for multiple decades might possibly pick up on it, but it is far more likely that I would just be thought of as \"slightly stiff/formal\" than actually neurodiverse. Which, in fact, was exactly what happened for the first forty-plus years. Ah, I see! That is very useful info to me. Thank you! Ah, a fellow late-diagnosed individual. Yup. And I have occasionally heard from people who were diagnosed in their seventies or later. There was a psycho-education group especially for let us say late bloomers, I was 25 and by far the youngest, think the oldest I have seen was in their mid-fifties. Cannot say people in their seventies being diagnosed is surprising, over here a lot of people either fly under the radar or just do not want to go for the diagnosis while they are still working, afraid that it will negatively impact their job, even keeping said job. I would believe social anxiety at least exacerbated my face blindness. Yeah, it just makes so much sense, does not it? Anxiety = not looking at faces or people enough = not recognize others. &gt;due to normal speech patterns, normal back-and-forth conversation, fleeting eye contact while starting which improves over time, and lack of observed sensory issues, repetitive behaviours and echolalia\n\nwe have sensory issues - but our speech and conversation is more than normal (though we were kid actors so all those classes helped), eye contact is fine, nothing unusual repetitive behaviours wise. But we are still autistic. There is like 18 other things id argue make one more autistic than the eye contact issue. Plenty of us figured that one out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFair enough. If you were a girl my non expert ass would say that was a bad test for ya.   \nif we met in person id have a much easier time telling if you are or not. I see, thank you so much for your information. I appreciate it. And yes, it definitely is quite hard to tell over the internet. Thanks once again! I suffer from face blindness, but can also recognize people I have had excessive contact with. I believe that I am recognizing features other than their face, namely mannerism, gestures, facial expressions, hair,  personal style, the context/place I am seeing them, speech rhythms, even individual aspects of a face ('I would know that nose anywhere\" or a person's distinctive eyebrows for example). Context is very important. I can recognize a coworker at my workplace, or even near my work, like on a bus I take to work, but will blank them at the mall or a sporting event. I am no doctor, but your psych does not sound like much of one either. Social anxiety does not explain anything except overwhelmed in crowded situations (which is also a sign of ASD). \n\nAspergers is a high functioning autism that technically does not exist anymore (everything is now under one giant autism spectrum umbrella, which annoys me because the symptoms are so different). Aspergers tends to have higher IQ than average autism. Speech rate is not off, but some language issues may persist (understanding idioms, sarcasm, etc), and they do not always get the give and take of conversations (especially children looping back to their favorite topic). People are more likely to fixate on their favorite subjects.\n\nI call BS on the sensory issue subject. As an adult, you are more likely to understand acceptable social norms (moreso with aspergers than standard autism), and know that it is not appropriate to flap your hands or twirl your hair. Instead you find a coping skill. As an adult, you have had 20/ 30/ 40 years to learn them, and sensory overload looks a little different. \n\nI can recognize the people I am close to, but after 21 years I am pretty sure I still cannot describe my husband to a police sketch artist. I do not have social anxiety, except for knowing that I am not going to recognize people. Once I figure out who the person is, I will remember them for the rest of that gathering. If I can tell 2 people apart in a show, I am fine for the rest of that episode. Next week I struggle again. And if a character shows up again after 3-4 weeks off screen, I am in trouble. \n\nIf you do not mind me asking, is there a reason you are pursuing the diagnosis? If it is important to you (and not cost prohibitive), I would look into a second opinion. If you have one nearby, see a neuropsychologist. They are psychs with a great understanding of how the brain (not the mind) works, and will give you a much clearer answer. Good luck. You might want to get a second opinion on the prosopagnosia, and possibly the ASD as well. Not everyone with ASD has every symptom. I am thinking of getting evaluated for it as well even though I do not have the sensory symptoms either. (but I get the obsessions/ fixations plus having prosopagnosia, bad sense of direction and right-left confusion, which are linked with ASD)\n\nI think you are recognizing people you have known longer because you have known them long enough to remember all their features besides the face. I do the same. \n\nI doubt that social anxiety can cause prosopagnosia. People with anxiety can still look at a face for a few seconds and remember it. It does not cause problems with the part of the brain that remembers faces. \n\nIt may be the other way around and you feel anxious because you do not know who people are. I can relate to that. \n\nI am not the best with eye contact either, though I have gotten better over the years. I think it is because I do not read people by their faces anyway so there is not much point in looking at them to me. I do not really pick up micro expressions either, which is probably prosopagnosia related. I read emotions based off of voice mostly. \n\nSource: I am not a psychologist but I am in the susilo lab face blind study. I agree with what everyone else is saying.\n\nMy psych\u2014who is otherwise extremely competent and the only helpful mental health professional I have seen in a decade of therapy (he does both, old fashioned)\u2014rejects my 18 year standing ASD dx because of my substantial trauma history, which is absolutely the origin of many of my symptoms (eg anxiety and the specific unstable upbringing I had can result in sensory aversions and food neophobia). It is not very important to me, tbh, but you should get a second opinion maybe, especially as it will inform the way doctors etc approach you.\n\nMy faceblindness he acknowledges, especially with my spatial agnosia. But I am also very visually impaired and have been since birth, and my object recognition skills are similar to my facial recognition skills, which was studied a bit when I was a kid. Colour, general shape, context, cannot see more or really process it right.\n\nThe difference is I cannot \u2018see\u2019 or coherently remember facial features. Even my closest family members, I can barely remember their whole faces, and I cannot mentally age them. I can barely recognise my brother and my fianc\u00e9e, only my mother tbh and she has some giveaway features. So I think any exacerbation of symptoms is still just an exacerbation of real faceblindness.\n\nSo I do relate both to the process and the complicating factors in determining the origin of a syndrome. I am not sure if I relate to how you experience faceblindness or if you have prosopagnosia.\n\nAt the end of the day, faceblindness is debilitating, regardless of whether it is congenital (?), developmental, or otherwise acquired. Anxiety is very common in Aspies, because we struggle with norms and processing a lot of input, and we tend to get inadequately or wrongly socialised in a way that makes us inhibited and stress. Adults have been noted to learn to compensate for symptoms (eg training self to make eye contact consciously), and this is especially noted in women\u2014female socialisation can result in a different manifestation that often is not understood by clinicians. So it is a tough one. I am seconding (thirding? fourthing?) the recommendation for getting a second opinion on the diagnosis.  I work with children, not adults, and I am a teacher, not a doctor, BUT I have a pretty good idea of what a diagnosis should be due to experience.  What you described is more consistent with behavior of some of my students diagnosed with autism than it is with my students diagnosed with anxiety.  Obviously, someone who actually sees you is better than someone reading a short description over the internet, but I think it would be worth a second look.  Also anxiety and autism are not mutually exclusive.\n\nPersonally, I think my brain was born wired wrong.  Apparently, I spent a lot of time looking at faces as a baby (compared to most babies - I did not look at my hands and I should have, because my coordination is awful.)  I do not have autism or anxiety (although I have some social anxiety symptoms that are clearly the result of prosopagnosia) and am very social.  I always look at people's face...and it does me no good what so ever.  I can recognize close friends and family members, BUT I only make close friends with distinct looking people (not on purpose) and I am not recognizing them by their face as a whole.  I am just really good at putting the parts together.\n\nThat being said, I have wondered about the connection between face blindness and autism being the result of not looking at faces resulting in that area of the brain not developing as well.  I have not heard research about prosopagnosia and anxiety correlating, but there is so little research that it is not surprising.  And it may exist, I just do not know about it yet.\n\nRegardless of how you came by it, if you cannot recognize people to a certain degree, you have face blindness.  You might be able to do an experiment.  Force yourself to look at the face of a couple of people that you know you will be seeing again.  See if you can recognize them in the future.  If you can, I would say no prosopagnosia...although you would benefit from a lot of the same coping mechanisms.  If you cannot learn faces of new people even if your anxiety symptoms are lessened and you start looking at people, I would personally describe that as face blindness, regardless of how you acquired it.  \n\nAlso, you said you struggle to recognize old friends.  If your psychologist's theory was right, would not you have looked at them in the past allowing you to recognize them now?  Just a thought. Is it really true that ASD can present differently in both sexes? Is it less \"apparent\" in girls than boys? 100% true Hi there! Yes, your opinion that social anxiety does not fully explain my problems -- including facial blindness -- is shared by other commentators here, and me as well.\n\n&gt; Speech rate is not off, but some language issues may persist (understanding idioms, sarcasm, etc), and they do not always get the give and take of conversations (especially children looping back to their favorite topic). People are more likely to fixate on their favorite subjects. \n\nWell, the thing is, the report says (and personally I kind of agree with it) that I am basically almost totally normal in the social sense. As you can see from my original post, the problems that got me searching in the first place was things not related to social stuff, like facial recognition, executive function, obsessions, black/white thinking and so on. The only problems that were documented were using quotes to describe emotions, stuttering and anxiety. Personally, I feel like I tend to fixate on subjects but that was not documented.\n\n&gt;As an adult, you are more likely to understand acceptable social norms (moreso with aspergers than standard autism), and know that it is not appropriate to flap your hands or twirl your hair. Instead you find a coping skill. \n\nThat is true.\n\nI am sorry to hear the issues you are experiencing regarding facial blindness. I do not think I have it as bad as that, but right now I am not sure \\^\\^\"\n\n&gt; If you do not mind me asking, is there a reason you are pursuing the diagnosis? \n\nFor a better understanding of self, to understand why I think the way I do and used to do. Next, I cannot really live with a \"maybe\". In addition, my current employment has free healthcare benefits. Finally, either accommodation or help about my facial recognition issue which was causing me real problems.\n\nThanks for commenting! \\^w\\^ And it also is caused by it in my case. Walking into a classroom of kids all dressed in uniforms every day, and not knowing which were my friends without hard work? That was tough. I talked to my therapist about my struggle recognizing faces and he told me that he noticed that I\u2018m literally staring at his eyes while talking. He said that when he\u2018s looking at peoples faces while talking, he does not only look in the eyes but also on all the other features in a face.\n\nI honestly did not know that that was normal. I guess because I am too lazy to even try and memorize a face because I\u2018m just used to not being able to memorize it anyway.\n\nI have anxiety but he never said that that is maybe why I\u2018m bad at remembering faces. Yeah, that is another theory; that I am simply too lazy to try to remember others' faces.", "Does anyone experience dissociative symptoms? I was wondering if there might be a link between dissociation and prosopagnosia.\n\nI thought it might be a lucky fluke that I have trouble with faces and cannot 'see' the person that caused trauma in my memories and thoughts, but lately it seems to be getting worse as I have become more dissociative.\n\nI find I have become a lot more 'is this what you look like??' and losing the face when it is out of sight, to having days where the odd colleague (small team) is almost entirely brand new to me for a day or so. The other day I had a moment where I did not recognise myself which has not happened to me before.\n\nCan anyone weigh in on this? I would love to know if it is just me. Nope. Look into traumogenic condition, prosopagnosia is more something you are born with (or caused by actual brain injury).\n\nDo not wait around about this sort of thing, if you have the possibility of getting actual psych help, DO IT. Knowing what is going wrong is a lot of help in knowing how to cope with it.\n\ngood luck mate. Well, I have been coping for so long I cannot remember what it is like without it or if I even never had it. Usually it is embarrassing or makes it hard to follow films where everyone looks the same.\n\nAs I have become more dissociated I have noticed it gets worse though, I always figured it just stays at the same level of severity I dissociate as well and have PTSD. I am unsure how related it is to pros.\n\nI do support the idea to get therapy if you have not already. It is hard to break the cycle of trauma without help.  I am in therapy because it is getting worse, and I guess with therapy things have to get worse to get better? With all the old stuff coming up its been putting me in weird head spaces and leading to the above \ud83d\ude29 That is normal, it is like cleaning the fridge. You have to take a closer look at all the distasteful stuff to get it thrown out Sounds like it is temporary as you deal with your trauma.  As I have been going back through it, I think it has been here for longer than the trauma because working in retail was a wild ride when I had no idea who I was speaking to and ID'd my own colleagues out of uniform. I was reading up on a few bits and I think it is just working in tandem with what I already have. I have been to see the docs though. I am glad you are getting help but so few docs know about prosopagnosia because there is no treatment for it. It might be best to not even mention it until it becomes a problem you cannot live with. Judging by this group it is a troubling inconvenience rather than anything to really worry about.\n\nI know nothing about dissociation but it seems like a huge problem. I wish you all the best as you find healing. Yeah, I prefaced it with the doctors that on its own it is not really much of a big deal just sometimes embarrassing when I am introducing myself to someone I have already met twice before. The doctor seemed very hung up on the idea of it rather than the getting worse part.\n\nAccording to Dr. Google, being unable to recognise yourself is a part of depersonalisation which is the part I am struggling with currently. I guess it is good to have some kind of answer that it is not actually linked to prosopagnosia but a whole separate part of dissociation but for a second there I was mighty confused because I did not think it was possible for it to get worse. \n\nI feel like I went off on a bit of a stream of consciousness there, sorry! ", "Do you think your facial blindness could apply to anything else? I have never been able to tell cars apart? I am probably reaching on this one, but is it possible? I feel the same way about cars that I do about faces. They honestly all look the same to me. If they did not have the logos, I would have no idea. Not recognizing cars is pretty common for prosopagnosia. I have to look at the plate to know mine.  Object recognition can also be a potential issue for the those with face blindness from what I have heard. With the Cambridge prosopagnosia test I took the third part focused just that using cgi cars. I do not think it is really common, but it is common enough to be tested for in a prosopagnosia test Idk if it is related but I cannot recognise cars. Plus bad memory means I do not even remember what colour my parents' cars are to look for. That is amazing I am learning so much here! Thank you. I finally feel like I found my people haha Lol I think I understand Same here.  I once weirded out a roommate when we were filling out parking forms because I knew his license plate number, and he did not. Ooo I will have to try it. Yeah that seems to make sense at least a little bit. The principal seems basic enough to the condition That is interesting, why do you think you have a bad memory? I am on a proso facebook group there is many of us who struggle with direction, especially north east south west. I do not have an issue with cars other then I am not a car person. I do not personally experience this, but I hear it is common with people with prosopagnosia.  (I am not great at recognizing cars, but I am pretty sure it is because I do not like cars.  I can recognize mine.)  I am guessing something in the brain that processes images is not working as intended. It seems to make sense I mean the basic principals would seem to apply but I will admit I have not dove much into the actual science yet bad bot Thank you, Bigbadaboombig, for voting on Shakespeare-Bot.\n\nThis bot wants to find the best and worst bots on Reddit. (\n\n***\n\n^(Even if I do not reply to your comment, I am still listening for votes. Check the webpage to see if your vote registered!) good bot Yeah it seems to be a sub-disorder among those who have it. I am glad you do not have it but thank you for telling me about the directions you gave me more to research Not cars necessarily (tho I am probably worse than average at that). But for me it is locations. Like I will drive past my own street because it will suddenly just... not feel familiar. I feel so validated right now lol Yeah, it is a thing, though it is not universal. ( is a paper (a literature review) showing that face recognition deficits are associated with object recognition deficits.\n\nI got to participate in a study on this, so I can tell you fwiw that i recognize cars about as well as anyone else (and I kick ass at bicycles apparently). ( is the paper that came out of that one. Might be related, might not. I am also autistic so it could be that. I do not exactly have a bad memory all around; I forget a lot of stuff, and I will not instinctively try to remember things (it took until I was like 17 that I realised that people probably \\*try\\* to memorise where they parked), but I also remember in detail specific events from years before that other people who were present completely forget. What do you mean struggle with objects?\n\nWhat throws me of is when people age.\n\nHere is john travolta now\n\n\n\nHere is what he look like in the past.\n\n\n\nWell he has aged and looks different. So when I look at him it looks like different guy.\n\nCars and planes all look the same,  it requires lots of concentration. I have heard that people use their face recognition ability to recognize cars, so that explains why it is common for prosopagnosiacs to struggle with that. I lose my car in parking lots all the time. I find it helps to have some kind of unique visual indicator on the car. While sometimes that can be a dent, it might also be a window decal or some kind of uncommon paint addition. Or simply small neon stickers on the inside of the glass, only really catching the attention if you know what you are looking for.\n\nOf course, simply knowing the plate is an oldie but goodie. It is not always visible from across the parking lot, though. I am just glad I learned to tell direction both by the position of the sun and shadows, and by semi-subconsciously keeping track of what turns I have made after being in a place with a known directionality.\n\nIt does mean I will tend to refer to internal walls and other fixtures by their cardinal direction, so \"the south wall\" as opposed to \"the wall at the end of the corridor\" or \"the wall with the windows\". It keeps a kind of directional awareness ticking along.\n\nAnd yes, I can still become lost if there are a lot of twists and turns, or it is night or cloudy. I have not learned astronavigation yet. I certainly would not have recognized him. He looks like he is going for the Obadiah Stane look. Yup. I have to look around when I am exiting the car and see if there are any landmarks, shop names, and so on. Fortunately most very large carparks are trending towards having navigational signs or items in them these days. Omg that makes so much sense. I have always done that!! So many wow moments since I joined Yeah pretty much everything I do I rely on visual. I had no idea it was so common for people like me though. So wait why would people with facial blindness struggle with direction? I have thought myself to be dyslexic but now I am really questioning it. I have heard some people say that they have had unusual memories. I am curious to how it ties in. I am going to have to research it. Right!! Lot of OMG moments That is fascinating. I am still learning but everything I have been told reflects me very well. I want to talk to my professors about this paper I will let you know what they say. So if you had not told me that it is John Travolta I would not have known, but side by side I can see it. I had to Google it but your not wrong lol That happened to me like driving at night but honestly I get panic attacks I have always attributed it to that Yeah I often do too. I usually look for a very specific identifier when I park. What frustrates me is when I see like 5 cars with similar colors I have to see the license plates. Sometimes I feel like I can recognize it but I have been wrong Honestly no idea, but apparently it is a thing. Maybe it is something to do with brain circuitry specializing in conceptually tagging things in the visual field. I only recognize them if I hyper focus on vehicles.\nLast year I shopped around for good quality used cars and I spent so much time researching that it was like I unlocked a power of being able to notice certain cars on the road.\n\nIt is been a while though and I am back to being mostly car blind.\nI notice color and shape. (truck vs car) Yes!!! That makes so much sense. My dad and sister would call out all the car models as we drove around as kids, and in sitting there going, \u201cblue car\u2026 black car\u2026 red car\u2026\u201d I mastered cardinal direction real fast. I continue to think NESW indoors too. I use the north printer ect.\n\nCars tho, are all nearly identical blobs. I blame the names staying the same as the cars themselves change across the years. Dont tell me a 4door and a 2 door are the \"same\" car. Or the smooth one is the \"same\" as the one with ridges just because the same company produced it.\nI think its almost backwards to faces. With faces, small variations makes it something completely different. But with cars, massive changes are all the same thing. That is just a failure of marketing I think its almost backwards to faces. With faces, small variations makes it something completely different. But with cars, massive changes are all the same thing. That is more attention vs memory.\nIf you caught on for awhile, its not blocked. You are just not a car nerd. Ok that makes sense! Guess it is just faces that stump me. Could be? I am waiting to hear back from my professors I will let you know what I hear Lol I can see your point. Faces for me though I need a big change I still rely heavily on external things like hair I wonder if it is like when we use hair to identify a person? Haha I was just making a guess but yeah in a way it does. Someone up there said they use license plates my brain light up. I memorize them all the time Maybe \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f yes, through i think that falls more under ( Actually quite the opposite for me. Even by taillights alone I can recognize a wide variety of cars. The main reason is that I am heavily into cars (a large collection of diecast on my shelf, going to car meets weekly, etc etc.). To me cars are very distinctive.\n\nFaces though lack the lines the shapes the style that cars have. When I try to remember faces it is like someone over edited it and made the face all smooth and blurred. I think I can remember the face, but then they walk right by me and I do not know who they are. That is why I use cars to figure out who people are (among other things like style, hair, face width, etc.)", "Alright everyone time to head out ", "I joined this sub yesterday and here is what I have gathered so far.

I have been talking to her long distance while we are home from college for summer break, and I am taking the first steps with her in dealing with the diagnosis, after she got tested for MS (luckily not MS thank god). Luckily I am a huge fucking nerd for neurological diseases and I know a good amount about prosopagnosia, but I am having trouble figuring out how she would have developed it. She suffered no injury, its not MS, and this is nee to her entirely. She says she hopes its a side effect of Zoloft, but I have not spoken to her doctor nor do I know the more specific side effects of Zoloft let alone the less common causes of prosopagnosia. Any help would be greatly appreciated! \n\nSide note- Obviously I hope it is simply a side effect like a form of hallucination, but do not get me wrong, I am not trying to \u201ccure\u201d her to make her any more desirable. -you are a good friend\n\n-this is not the first post I have read here about medication-induced aphantasia.  I think it was Zoloft as well, but not 100% sure. If you search this sub you will find. Is it usually permanently acquired or just a side effect? Did she have COVID? No, not as far as I know Please bear with me here. I took a survey for this and I am asking you the same questions I got asked.\n\n* Has she recently (after you met her but before this came up) gotten some kind of head trauma?\n* Has she recently (after you met her but before this came up) had a high fever?\n* Has her diet suddenly changed?\n* Was there something she *was* doing to manage her depression that she *is not* doing now that she is on medication?\n\nYou do not have to bother giving me answers; that is not why I asked. I asked because the medicine might be a correlation. It is easy to point at the medication and say, \"That is it! That is the culprit!\" when in reality it could be something entirely different that you are *not* looking at. Just a thought. \n\n(On another note; how is your girl friend's hearing? I have noticed that most people have distinct voices; that may help her tell people apart while she is getting used to prosopagnosia.) Do you have any recommended sources on head trauma causing prosopagnosia?\n\nNinja edit: not questioning whether it is possible. On the contrary, this is my situation and I want to read more about it. I do not, actually. Like I said, it was part of a survey I took for prosopagnosia. (Susilo labs were working on a study a couple of years ago, and I signed up for it.) Head trauma was one of the questions they asked, and I figured there must be a reason. ( is their website, if that helps. I have never heard of this before, but anything is possible. \n\nMost people who have prosopagnosia are born with it, but it is possible to acquire it from a brain injury. \n\nSome things to consider (I am not a psychologist/doctor so she should talk to an actual doctor to confirm any of this):\n\n\\- She may have been born with it and not realized it until now. Many of us who were born with it did not realize it until well into our 20s and older. Especially if she grew up in a place where it was easier to remember people (small town, small schools, etc). And then suddenly went to a large college and realized she cannot remember people. \n\n\\- Can vision problems, perception problems and memory problems be ruled out? \n\n\\- Has she had COVID? The Winter 2021 issue of the faceblind newsletter has an article about a woman who developed prosopagnosia after having COVID. It causes a lot of inflammation, including in the brain and can cause neurological problems: (\n\n\\- You said she has not had an injury, but is it possible that she hit her head in some way and did not realize it? Or had some kind of fall without necessarily hitting her head? Even things like that can rattle the brain and cause some damage. Brain damage from head injuries are more common than we think, and they do not always result in obvious signs like concussions or memory loss. \n\nIf it really is the zoloft that is causing it, I personally would try switching meds (obv talk to a doctor about that). Things I know 100%:\n\n- She did not have it until very recently, and I met her before she had it according to her; as in she previously could describe how I looked and now cannot.\n\n- She had a neck injury a long time ago (elementary school) that might be it but that was again, a long time ago and had no brain trauma back then\n\n- She has never tested positive for COVID or COVID antibodies  1. No\n2. No\n3. Not as far as I know\n4. I do not know, the way she describes the antidepressants though makes it seem like she has started using them again recently, and I dont want to probe her on that\n5. Her hearing is unaffected afaik \\&gt;She had a neck injury a long time ago (elementary school) that might beit but that was again, a long time ago and had no brain trauma back then\n\nOkay, I think that can be ruled out. I have only ever heard of people developing proso immediately after a head injury and never years after.\n\n(\n\n\\^ This article lists \"memory problems\" as a serious side effect of zoloft. I was not able to find anything linking it to proso, but anything is possible. I think she should talk to her doctor about it and stop taking it if it is the cause. Hopefully she can get her recognition ability back, I would not wish this condition on anybody.", "Significant more trouble with male faces. For context, I am a woman. All my life I have had difficulty telling what is considered an \"attractive\" male. I only have educated guesses on what is considered attractive by most people.\n\nBut within the past few years, I just really do not recognize men. I have my fair share of problems with women too, I have done the whole not recognizing a woman even though I just met her 20 mins ago, but it is not nearly as bad.\n\nFor a while I just wrote it off as being in a male dominated major. A lot of times, my classes will have 20 guys and maybe 5 or so girls. I figure it is easy to lose a face. I will have men approach me all the time and tell me we have had 3 or 4 classes together, I will have no idea who they are. I will have men try to talk to me about a class, \"i.e what did you think of the homework for x\" - and I have no idea who they are.\n\nI figure this is probably pretty normal. But there is also a lot of trouble with people who I should definitely know.\nI saw my roommate's boyfriend yesterday, and I stared at him wondering if that was him but I was not really sure until he waved at me and I waved back. Now mind you have I see this guy often.\n\nToday I was in the library, and was looking for a computer and there is this guy I see almost every day and am quite cordial with. But the thing is he lives by me, but in this library I really was not sure if that was him. I thought so, the only computer available was next to him so I as I sat down \"I said hey\" - as I said that I just hoped I was not saying hey to a random person. He said hey back but I was not completely sold until I definitely recognized the hat.\n\nNot saying I have this condition, but does anyone else have a lot more trouble with one gender vs the other? I have significantly more trouble with people who have short hair. Like, if there are three white dudes with dark hair and similar build, I will never ever be able to tell them apart without talking to them. At least with long hair, it is more distinctive, because there are more opportunities for their hair to be different. ", "Is This Prosopagnosia? Ok. This will be quite descriptive. I am not entirely sure if I have it or not.\n\nFirstly, I have tried the test (faceblind.org) &amp; stopped after several questions because I do not recall/ remember any actor's/ actress's face from movies so I am forced to say I do not know for every question I did. I saw the answer &amp; \"So Angelina Jolie looked like this? How embarrassing to not know.\" I have seen her in the movies once or twice years back but I do not remember any features nor can I bring to mind how she looks like.\n\nSecondly, I am not sure when I started having this issue but only felt weird when I did part-time in a customer service &amp; forgot everything about this customer except her gender. I only had her name on the order form on hand so I went about the shop, asking every person I came across \"Are you (name)?\". I do not have this issue with people I see daily, like my parents. Although I cannot surface their faces to mind, I can spot them quite accurately in the streets. Same applies to friends/ classmates in a school setting. However, it is after I graduate that I would forget their faces &amp; names because I do not see them daily &amp; I would not recognise them on the streets unless miraculously I have talked to them before &amp; I somehow recognise &amp; also remember their name. I have been told by my parents I am abnormal because people's faces do not just change like they have been through plastic surgery so it should be easy to identify. Back then, I was 16 &amp; did not have coping skills because school setting meant everyone sat in the same seats while friends (cliques) is permanent so I did not have much trouble after the first week with friends.\n\nThirdly, since young, I definitely had the issue of being confused over characters in shows/ movies, especially in Chinese shows where there are clansmen in similar costumes in droves. However, after a few episodes, I will be able to differentiate them well enough to know they are different people/ characters, only in the case where they are individual main characters. No, I still have no idea who is who in the droves of inginificant clansmen. Thus, I think I do not have Prospagnosia?\n\nFourthly, my parents have told me repeatedly to observe people &amp; remember them which I look &amp; recognise, not remember/ imprint them in my mind. I have also been unable to identify how old someone is by their looks. I would look all around the face/ neck (as instructed) &amp; still have no idea what I am supposed to be looking for because it makes no difference to me compared to another person. The difference for me is deep wrinkles like an elderly lady which I would be sure she is elderly because of white hair &amp; wrinkled skin.\n\nI have somehow been able to recognise people in offices because they sit in the same spot after a few days. I would recognise people I talk with often (in the same team/ department) but I would not with people I have talked to once. Only realised this guy sat diagonally to me for close to 4 months in the office after talking to him twice &amp; actually needing to find him for work.\n\nIf it is important to know, I have a hard time finding my way around. I would not be able to remember new routes/ landmarks &amp; would be stuck to Google Maps for a few weeks before I am confident enough to go without it. I have never been able to bring my route to mind if I am at home but after a while, I can recognise that I have to walk right/ left/ wherever to my destination while walking on the path towards my destination.\n\nSo, question is, do I or do I not have it? I am confused because of conflicting(?) descriptions. Sorry for the rant but I do want to know more about myself in order to learn to ease my struggles in social situations. It certainly sounds to me like you do. 100%. Not that I have a sense of \u2018normal\u2019 to compare it to mind you, so I think your parents feeling you have an issue with recognition is a sure sign you do. I was unsure too for many years because it is not something you can go to the doctor about really. I finally \u2018self diagnosed\u2019 after doing those online tests, and being invited to take part in a study in which I came out in a low percentile. That made me confident to say it. Thanks for the comment! I only have my parents to compare it to (the sample size still too small to be sure though). But, yes, I have been told by my parents that I am weird, it is not normal to not remember your boss/ friend/ classmate after a few weeks/ months of not seeing them. I did not look this up till recently because it did not seem (no offense to anyone) like a mental illness of high severity which meant people, like my parents, will not believe me. My parents think I did not put in enough effort &amp; brushed me off on this issue. Still do not have the confidence to say it but I shall start accepting that I do have it &amp; try to cope with it for the rest of my life to the best of my ability. I found recently it helps a lot to tell people. I was supposed to meet some people a couple months ago and I did not know them well, so I messaged them and said \u201chey, I have prosopagnosia which is faceblindness, so if it looks like I come in and do not recognise you, that is why!\u201d. It was a big weight off my shoulders, and they replied saying \u201cok, when we see you, we will wave!\u201d. I am always going to do this now. I see! Maybe I will give it a try! Hopefully they believe me \ud83d\udca6\n\nThank you for sharing your experience! \ud83d\ude0a You probably can recognize your parents by other factors subconsciously. \nEver see your mom in heavy/no makeup or with a new hairstyle and not recognize her for a split second? \nI know I can recognize my family, but only if I am in a place I think they could also be. If they try to surprise me at my university I would walk right past them, unless they started speaking. This definitely helps! Since I started college I got into the habit of just telling everyone I meet \u201cOh yeah, I have a neurological facial recognition disorder, so I probably will not recognize you next time we meet! Just explain that I know you and then I will remember\u201d \nAlthough sometimes they do not explain next time we meet... so I end up \u201cmeeting them for the first time\u201d and explaining my face blindness like 3 times. \n\nI had this experience yesterday, met a friends friend and introduced myself, when we were parting I told them of my face blindness and they responded \u201cI know, this is the third or fourth time we have met\u201d \nWhich earned me some laughs from the rest of the group but because they all know it is an actual disorder and not me being rude there is no hard feelings and no one thinks less of me for it. Ha! I have done similar to friend\u2019s friends too. I must start doing this explanation thing religiously. What I do not like is the assumption that I have forgotten everything about the person, just because I cannot place their face. Once I have placed your face do not worry, I remember our conversations! It is weird, that moment when everything suddenly drops into place the moment you realise who you are talking to. I like to explain it as \u201cfacial dyslexia\u201d it helps people understand that I can remember their actions and conversations just not their physical identity", "can you tell when people are identical twins? Hi, I have known about prosopagnosia for a number of years after reading about Chuck Close, and being a pretty good \nphysiognomist I wonder a lot about the other side of the scale.\nDoes anyone have experience meeting identical twins? can you tell they were twins or do they look like another pair of similar looking people to you? is it easier or harder to tell them apart when not relying on their faces to recognize them? In my (mild) case, I can tell them apart if they are together and I know what to look for. I cannot really store enough memory of their faces to know which one I am talking to when they are alone, but if they are side by side and i have known them a while, it is achievable. The twins I am referring to are a set of brothers I have known for 12 years, so I imagine that is as good as it is going to get for me. I worked with a woman who had an identical twin. I did not know they were identical, but I could not tell them apart, either.\n\nSo they are like everyone else to me. Everyone (#noteveryone) looks alike and yet different. They all look familiar and look like strangers. \n\n(I once accidentally insulted a woman when I asked if the woman in the picture was her. \"No, that is my older sister.\" Long pause. \"You really think she looks like me?\" Thinking quickly, \"No, that is why I asked. You both have red hair, but it did not look like you.\" (Whew, crisis averted!) Kind of on topic, but not actually answering your question (sorry)... \n\n\nI have taught several sets of identical twins, but I have never struggled with telling them apart. I always wondered if it was due to the fact that I do not rely on the facial recognition as a way to identify people, so I am accustomed to other identifying features to distinguish. I find that identical twins do look very similar to me. I am sometimes able to find ways to distinguish between identical twins if I know them well, but for the most part they are just yet another example of very similar looking people in the world.\n\nIdentical twins tend to not only have similar faces, but similar height, body type, skin tone, etc. If their hair styles are very different it can be easy to tell them apart, until one or both changes their hair style. A few years ago I was in the same class as two twin brothers, I did not talk much to them due to being an introvert, it resulted in me never knowing which brother was which, and this until the end of the year, that was very embarassing I work with one identical twin. I already had trouble telling her apart from other coworkers. One day she came in with her twin, and my brain just would not process that they were separate people. I have had this exact experience. So yes and no.\n\nI am about 75% sure that the Property Brothers are identical twins but I genuinely cannot tell. When people present their babies to me and say \"she looks like her mom!\" I have to take them at face value. I do not see the similarities.\n\nOn the other hand, I was friends with a pair of identical twins in middle/high school and despite being identical, I was one of the few people who had no problem telling them apart. When you are relying on non-facial clues to tell people apart, it becomes a lot easier to figure out who is who. Pretty similar to when I meet regular siblings, sometimes even of quite different ages: I cannot tell them apart unless they are standing right next to each other and I can visibly see \"big medium small\". \n\nIf I cannot tell completely different non related people apart, I cannot tell twins apart either. \n\nUntil I get to know them and can rely on voice, tone, personality, clothing, etc. Twins are visible completely uninteresting to me as a result. But you can tell the visitor stranger is more familiar than random unrelated visiting stranger?? I do not understand your question. Are you asking if I can tell the difference between a person I have never met and a person I have met before but cannot place? I think it kind of depends on the rest of the factors that go into how someone with prosopagnosia identifies someone. \n\nThere were two sets of twins in my relatively small high school class. One set I knew since elementary school and at one point was fairly close to - our social circles intersected a little. I can tell the apart pretty easily. Even pictures from when they were little that they post as jokes on Facebook, and even after going years without seeing them. Honestly, I could tell them apart better than two of my current coworkers that sit in my same row and both have light brown hair. \n\nThe other set I met in middle school, and our social circles did not really intersect. I was never able to tell them apart, in the slightest. I tell people I have twin-recognition superpowers because most identical twins I have known wear their hair differently. Their faces look similar, but then again most faces look very similar to me.\n\nI am more likely to mistake a twin for someone who looks similar and has the same haircut, than mix up identical twins with different hairstyles.\n\nRecently my roommate mistook my friend for her twin sister, whom my roommate had met the week before. One of them has long brown hair (natural color) and the other has a medium bob that is dyed blonde, plus one of them is thinner than the other. When I first met them and learned they were twins I asked them if they were identical, since I cannot tell, and they look different to me. Yes. Because often I cannot I can usually tell that they are related, but I need to be looking for it to notice that they are twins. And even then I have to look at them at the same time, side by side. If I am just looking at one of them, I have got no idea what the other\u2019s face looks like for comparison Usually I either recognize someone or I do not. Often I look at a stranger and mistakenly think they are someone I know. But it is pretty rare for me to have the \"I know I have met you before but cannot tell where\" feeling. i CAN tell when two people are identical twins...BUT i mistake a lot of people as being identical twins when they arent I have two sets of identical twin grandsons. I am unable to tell them apart unless they have something different on. Glasses color, shorter hair, different clothes. Those days when they dress alike are maddening! Its frustrating not to be able to tell my grandbabies apart. Is it prospagnosia? I do not know. My daughter has a tough time telling them apart but I dont know if she has prospagnosia or not - we havent discussed that. &gt;I have to take them at face value. I do not see the similarities. \n\nAnd I thought everyone thought the *same* thing? \"Oh, of course. She looks just like her mother\" and not that they *actually* think that they do have some parallel features. &gt;So they are like everyone else to me. Everyone (#noteveryone) looks alike and yet different. They all look familiar and look like strangers.\n\nSums it up pretty well! Sometimes. Other times I am looking between them trying to figure it out. Nope.\n\nA neighbour introduced me to her sister. We spent some time sitting together in the grass. I did not even realise that the sister also lived in my building.\n\nA few days later, I held the door for someone. She thanked me and called me by my name. Now, I only knew my neighbors who had dogs and mostly recognised their dog. She did not have one with her so I had to mentally go through the people I knew who has her corpulence and hair colour. I concluded it must have been the owner of the lovely black lab puppy. The voice matched but something felt off. \n\nI ended up texting the neighbor to ask if it was her I had just met. It was not. It is only when she thanked me for not quite confusing her with her twin sister that I realized they where identical twins. To me they were completely different: one had a dog, the other a baby. Fun fact, on my first day of school, I noticed two boys who were dressed similarly and always staying together, so I concluded they were identical twins. They were not. We did get two identical twins in our class later on, they always wore the same haircut and had identical body shapes, so I figured out they were twins. I have twin aunts. I cannot tell them apart. It is been forty years of working out what one of them is wearing and then that keeping track of them that way. It is not a problem for anyone else in my family except for one of my younger sisters, she is diagnosed officially as face blind, whereas I just suspect I have the same problem. \n\nThey have a tendency to wear the same thing to family events but they always bring a back up outfit and one of them will change as they do not actually like wearing the same thing, and do not do it on purpose. Until they change I can look from one to the other and see they are different but not how and I cannot tell one from the other. \n\nIt is caused some problems over the years as they cannot understand why I cannot tell them apart. In the last ten years they have taken to announcing which one they are whenever they talk to me. I know it is them being sarcastic but I find it useful so do not complain.", "IM SO SORRY BUT I HAD TO SHARE THIS AHAHAHAH ", "Being proactive My friend has MS with lesions on the right side of the brain.  Today was her first experience with prosopagnosia.  Initially she was distraught, but now she is in the \u201cI am going to learn all I can\u201d mode.  I have 2 questions: 1) As a friend and colleague, what is the best thing I can do when I realize she is having an \u201cepisode\u201d?  2) aside from getting her to follow this page what other resources have you found to be helpful?  Thank you.\n\n I have never had an episode as you call it it is just always on. What advice I would give her is to try and focus on things she can recognize. For me it is hair and voice mostly. Pay attention to hair, voice, body shape, etc. I use location context a lot. It works a lot of the time, but is not perfect. If it is becoming an ongoing issue just start explaining to people \"I have face blindness, it does not mean I do not know you but it means I may have a hard time recognizing you without some kind of cue.\"  Thank you As her MS progresses, she imagines it will become more frequent. Thank you for the guidance.  Do you ever recognize by voice? I usually try to find some specific thing about a person that I can remember, like hair style, gait, fashion sense (like one of my friends always wears really hipster/nostalgic t-shirt, or a piece of jewelry they never leave the house with, like a name necklace), or, if they have one, a specific unique feature (really bushy eyebrows, a scar, a well-trimmed beard, etc). With other friends/coworkers/etc, being open about her face blindness will really help. I tell my coworkers, \"I will recognize you at work in my office, but if you see me out on the street, throw me some hints as to who you are because I might not ever figure it out.\" They usually think it is funny or do not really believe me, but I have had full conversations with people I have met out and about and walked away not knowing who they were and just been really vague the whole time... I think random encounters are the hardest time for people with proso because you really have nothing to relate the person to, like \"the woman with a brown ponytail who meets me Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9\" becomes \"a woman with brown hair who is talking to me suddenly.\"  \n\n\nAs their friend, if you are with them, make sure to use names when people walk up to you or enter into conversation\\~ So, instead of being like, \"Oh hey\\~ what is up?\" be like, \"Oh, hey, Melissa\\~ what is up?\" These are really helpful because then your friend will not have to stress or look for markers or wait to hear their voice, whatever. Also, never expect them to introduce someone to you if you see them with someone you do not know. Introduce yourself first so that the new person then introduces themselves back. I have had some rough times when I have been having one of those \"I do not know who you are but I am nodding and smiling and now someone is asking me your name and I am totally called out right now\" moments and when the other person does not know about my face blindness, they get real offended, real fast.  \n\n\nGood luck to your friend! She is lucky to have someone so considerate on her side : ) Thank you so very much for taking the time to help!  Having this information relieves some of the anxiety and makes it all seem a bit more manageable. I do all the tricks, pretend I recognize people that seem to know me, note hair, walking style, voice, etc.\n\nIf people request something as I am walking through the office, I ask them to send me an email so I will remember when I get back to my desk. \n\nIf someone comes up to me desk and asks for something, as soon as they walk away, I ask a co-worker, \"Who was that?\" \n\nBut the one that worked best for me? Just being upfront. I work at a place where a lot of people have tattoos and color their hair every imaginable color. They cut their hair, use extensions. Someone that had a black bob yesterday will come in today with mermaid hair. I also do a lot of training. \n\nSo what I say every time I meet someone (after the general info), \"I am also faceblind. It is nothing personal, I cannot recognize my own son and husband. So when we meet later, I will not recognize you. But if you pretend to know me, I will pretend to know you.\"\n\n Thank you!  I will be passing your suggestions on to my friend. My wife and I have worked out a system where she identifies people early in a conversation.  Sometimes she will even \"introduce\" them to me as if she did not know we knew each other.  It is a real kindness and I really appreciate it because she probably sounds a little crazy sometimes just so I do not feel so embarrassed.  Anything like that I am sure she would find really helpful.    \n Not a suggestion for your friend, but for you.  When you come in contact with her say who you are unless you are positive she knows.  (I am really good at faking that I know people, so unless she greets you by name, I would assume she did not know.)  Also, say other people's names when talking to them in her presence and something about them, so she can place them.  Love it when my husband does that. I have DP, but I know the name only since a couple of years ago...\nbefore I know, it was hard for me because people thought I did not care about them or that I was haugthy.\n\nnow I decided not to hide it.\nso when I first meet someone I tell them that I will not recognize them the next time we meet, sometimes even if it is 5 minutes later...\nsome do not believe me, others think I am weird but at least they know.\n\nso I think it is easier when you say it, people know and it is less embarrassing when you ask them who they are for the second time in the same day...\n\nbut, when I am with my children, they tell me if I know the person(s) or not and who they are.\nit is very helpful, so when you are with your friend do not hesitate to tell her who is around.", "how severe is your prosopagnosia? is yours from birth or from head trauma? how do you cope? multiple questions, yes. looking through this sub i see that some people have more severe prosopagnosia than i do. i have heard that to some faces appear more as a blur. i just cannot remember people. i have said people say \"hi (name)\" and i look at them and have no clue who they are, especially if they are outside any context i can recognize them in. if it is in school or something i might be able to piece together who it is. i do have trouble with shows that have multiple similar looking people (only reason i can tell klinger apart from pierce in M*A*S*H is that klinger always crossdresses). i especially have trouble telling guys apart. girls are easier. i spend more time looking at girls and do not give guys a second glance.\n\ni was born with my prosopagnosia, and i also have aspergers. i did not know about my prosopagnosia until senior year of high school because one of the people on the child study team worked in neurology before and recognized the signs.\n\nsince i am also bad with telling voices apart (i have bad sense memory in general, also no sense of direction), i tend to cope by associating location with people. then hair (which is why it is easier for girls, guy hair tends to look the same and also i do not spend time checking out guys), then things like glasses and really distinct facial features like big nose and zits. the location thing can fail easily though. when i was a kid still playing tee-ball, my grandmother paid an unexpected visit to the game and i had no clue who she was cause i had not activated my compensation senses. the hair can fail as well. when a girl i went to class with dyed her hair, i had no clue who she was all day until she sat down in her assigned spot in gym class. ALSO because i am antisocial in general, i tend to not address people by name anyway. another thing is that old people are easier to recognize. it must be the wrinkles being more distinctive than the average face.\n\n------------------\nyes, i ramble. i have heard that \"literally not able to see a face while looking at it\" is the urban legend/\"well it SOUNDS liek that is what it means so that must be what it means\" misunderstanding of what prosopagnosia is because it is called \"face blindness.\" i have never ever encountered any serious medical literature that supports the idea, only pop culture nonsense. if someone on this board actually has that kind of condition i do not mean to insult you but it just does not jibe with what medical professionals define as prosopagnosia\n\ni have had prosopagnosia as long as i can remember and was diagnosed in middle or early high school because my mom got concerned after i could not find her at a school function because there were too many short white ladies with a pixie cut and i could not tell which one of them was the one who would raised me\n\nnow that i am in my 30s i have gotten extremely good at identifying people through things like how they move and stand and hold themselves, but my #1 identifier is speaking voice. i have learned never to rely on hair because if somebody puts their hair into a ponytail or something between conversations (or, as you noted, dyes/gets a hair cute) i then have to completely relearn how to ID them. better to skip the shitty data altogether for me Face blindness is a poor name. I see faces, clearly. I just do not recognize that I have seen them 5 minutes yes later.  You are so right about hair - I once failed to recognize my own mother after she changed her hair colour. I should probably try focusing less on visual cues.  Best analogy I have heard of is picking out a specific zebra in a herd.  Someone may say \"but that one has a funny shape on his right side\",  but I cannot pick that one out unless I work hard to concentrate and look for it.  Without strict concentration, all zebras look alike. \n\n For me people tend to come into basic types.  The world is full of twins for people I know.   It is really quite disheartening when I finally managed to associate a face and a name, and then to look across the room to find  someone else that looks just like them. I have that \"oh crap, there is two of them\" moment often. \n\nIn the short term, women are easier to identify by their hair. In the long term, not so much if they ever change their hairstyle. \n\nIf I am in a room of people I know I will not see again, I totally give up and go by shirt color.  It is so much less work.   I have learned a lot studying my sons color blindness.  He can see red and green \u2013 they are just confusing   Pink and white are easily confused too. He can see them, they are just not very distinct from each other. \n\nSame with face blindness.  I can see faces \u2013 they are all just very similar.  That is an interesting analogy.  The face as a blur is actually a different neurological disorder. Blanking on the name but it was in one of Oliver sachs books and it was not prosopragnosia. \n\nAlso mine's pretty bad, seemed to happen after a seizure I had at 13 but was too dazed when I came to to question it, and just adapted to knowing people's voices.\n\nWhen I look away from someone I cannot tell you what their face looks like, I cannot form an image in my head. I can tell you their hair color but that is it. Funny thing is I paint a lot of portraits too and I get asked how I am good at that: well one, practice a lot of it, two, I am looking a the person and literally like all painting for anything you are not memorizing details, you are looking at cloudy values and basic form shapes through squinted eyes and from there you can break down individual areas.  How people move, YES. I am over 30 and just learned I have this. Before I just coped by learning how people move and recognizing them by that. Saturday night live shows are KILLER though -.- I end up with a racing heart anytime they do a political skit and I did not know it was that show. Mine is mild. I know I have had carbon monoxide poisoning and I hear that is a possible cause.\n\nWhen I am in a group and we are all wearing athletic gear, it gets even harder to distinguish people.

I thought to myself \u201cshe is adorable\u201d so I turned to look at her and she looked at me at the exact same time. It was then when I realized I was looking at myself in a mirror. All of this happened within a split second but I feel like it boosted my confidence a little. Nice! I think a lot of people would love to see themselves from another person\u2019s perspective. Prosopagnosia perk? Meanwhile when I look in the mirror I get a daily surprise of \u2018holy fuck I am white\u2019 I was looking in the mirror for like 3 minutes today at my eyes because I did not remember what color they were. I get so disoriented when I try to dye my hair back to not purple. In my brain, my hair is purple, has been for 4-5 years. That is now my default description, purple hair, white, very short. Hair color and style is one of the main ways I identify people (wigs are my nightmare). I tried to dye it black and that was a very confusing few months before I changed it back to purple. Constantly seeing myself in the corner of my eye and thinking I am a different person. So confusing. Me in a dress is also equally confusing because I hate dresses and only wear them at church so my parents will leave me alone about it.

Could not make heads or tales of the plot, because there was no way to tell the cast apart. Still hate that movie to this day. \n\nMore recently, saw the movie \"Split\". (**spoilers**)  About half way through the movie I asked my wife: \"....waaaaait- are those the same guy?\"\nShe knows of my FB, but still gave me a funny look. After that point, the movie made a lot more sense. Suddenly went from a cast of 12+ down to 3. \n\nWhat is yours? I had a lot of trouble with Star Trek Beyond.  I have not watched any of the 'new' movies, so the crew was entirely new to me.  The movie itself was good, but there were a lot of parallel plot-lines going, following small/single groups; and lots of switching between them.  I could not follow who was doing what where.  I was really confused when I see the 'same person' with two different groups.  I just completely could not follow the sub-plots at all.  \n\nSo, I was able to follow the major, over-arching, plot, but I feel like I really missed out on the 'meat' of the movie just trying to figure out who was who, and trying to reconcile seeing the 'same' person in two different places. I dislike certain formulaic action movies. The Hero, a white guy with a crew cut, fights the Villain, a white guy with a crew cut, with the help of his Friend, a... White guy with a crew cut. \n\nI like movies with highly diverse casts, partly for representation, partly because diversity helps me tell characters apart.  I would have loved the Godfather if it was not a bunch of older Italian men.  for me i have trouble with \" beautiful\" people in movies, especially women. distinctive men can be in movies, but distinctive women are usually not hired, so there are far fewer. Luckily my wife is supportive (and a super recognizer) so she points things out to me if it is important.  The Prestege. Two guys who look alike that are constantly wearing disguises and different outfits. I was so lost during that movie. I thought that was the whole point of the movie?", "UNSW Face Test? Hello!

I have never heard her acknowledge it but I think it is getting worse with her age.\n\nI am 32 and my partner knows more about my family history (for example) than I do, because when a family friend tells us a story about my late father, he will remember it, and I will not.\n\nI really do not know sometimes whether my partner has an extraordinary memory, or whether I have a problem. But I think maybe it is both. I have a pretty bad memory these days but I put it down to too many concussions!  \nAlways had a recognition problem although I didnt really know it until recently. I have always had a terrible memory. Undiagnosed, but I likely have SDAM. Hmh. I am pretty young so who know what will happen but I think I have pretty good memory I have a bad memory for people. I think it is because memory of people is linked to the memory of their faces. I also have the worst sense of direction, idk if that has something to do with memory or not. But remembering and regurgitating useless facts about things that interest me, that I can do, to the point they my friend call me a robot on a regular basis. I have seen \u2018bad sense of direction\u2019 linked a lot to prosopagnosia. My partner laughs and it can be funny but also stressful that if I walk somewhere (even if it is into a new doctors Office from reception) I cannot find my way back because it looks like a different place from the other direction. Yeah it is linked. (Other linked conditions that I know of are dyslexia, right-left confusion, and asperger's) \n\nI have gotten lost in friends apartment complexes and had to wander around until I found the exit. I am just thankful that GPSs are common now, 12 years ago I would get lost on the way to the grocery store. I am also right-left confused which I have mostly overcome by integrating it into my muscle memory, but I still mix it up sometimes. For me they are unrelated.  Both my mom and I have prosopagnosia and amazing senses of direction.  For example,  you could put me in the middle of a building and ask me which direction my house is and I could point it out. Is it sense of direction you do not have or an inability to recognize landmarks? That is cool. I know my city well and I am very good at figuring out shortcuts. But I lived in another city for 3 years and never learnt to turn the right way after leaving a particular shop. So I really cannot say what the problem is. It is not recognising landmarks it is more about mapping maybe, but I do not understand it. Wow congrats on making gains with the left-right issue. I know right but I do not know left instinctively!\n\nMy life would be so stressful without google maps. I have attention deficit :) not hyperactive so never diagnosed as a child, but I have the inattentive variety. There is nothing wrong with my hearing or even memory encoding, but I have immense trouble with memory retrieval. I have often heard others with Prosopagnosia will compensate with gait or tone of voice or clothing, and I can rarely use any of those :\\ Actually I find i have a better memory then most. Other then faces of course Yes that is just my problem, it is the retrieval. When I am reminded of it in detail I can remember again, although sometimes recollection takes a bit of coaxing. However my mum acts often as if she is never heard the information before.\n\nI am going to look that up - I have never heard of an inattentive version and I have sometimes felt that attention deficit traits appear in my family, but never wanted to \u2018diagnose\u2019 it. I am aware I have not even googled it yet so the word may be misleading but my aunt is so inattentive it is documentary worthy. In fact it is how she lost her job as a nurse... She cannot leave a room without leaving something behind. Another inattentive ADHD-er here. Recently diagnosed, and I have seen so many of the inattentive traits in my mum. Also a nurse, also loses things on a ridiculous basis. The amount of times I have had to help her find her TV remote, or glasses, or keys, or keycard for work, or phone\n\nI have the same trouble with memory retrieval for sure. I used to watch movies with a friend who had a huge collection, he would ask if I would seen a certain movie. I would usually have no idea, but probably not, would not recognise the plot when he described it. Some way in to the movie I would get this deja vu feeling and go \"wait, I think I have seen this?\" although most of the time I would still struggle to remember the majority of the movie so I would just watch the rest of it anyway\n\nAlso I struggled with the plot so much if there is two main characters that look even remotely alike. Two guys with brown hair and no extremely distinct features. Might as well be the same guy, and I spend so much time trying to work out which is which I miss half of the scene I so related to this. oh my, finding the door to leave a doctor office... very good exemple. what about time issues? I struggle with dates. I barely remember what month it is and when dates are throw into a regular conversation, I am immediately lost. At the point that people planning their holidays make me uncortable. I have that so much, my god, I had a baby last year and the amount of dates that were thrown at me for scans, health visits, etc etc (I was high risk so had more than average). My partner made me download this app to store stuff in but I needed to look at a physical calendar to *see* how much actual time existed in between events, if you know what I mean ha.\n\nA date and time goes in one ear and out the other, just like peoples names (and faces). &gt;I am 32 and my partner knows more about my family history (for example) than I do, because when a family friend tells us a story about my late father, he will remember it, and I will not.\n\nSounds a bit like r/SDAM. I have a pretty good memory.  Things like dates and places I have to try to remember, but I do not have trouble memorizing.  (So school test stuff.  I cannot just read it and remember everything.  I have to study, but I do not study as long as most people for the same grade.)  I have an above average memory for events and things people say.  I have a really poor kinestetic memory.  Have to put everything into verbal steps.  My visual memory is mediocre.  I have difficulty remember people if I do not have something to anchor them to.  My students are easy, because they have assigned seats.  People at church not so much, because they move. Yeah my memory is shit. Like sometimes my parents joke around saying that I have worse memory than them and I am still young but it is true. And it is so annoying being forgetful. I try to work around the issue but I rarely succeed and it is ugh For me personally: good to very good sense of direction, and very poor ability for landmarks. Ditto. Not for faces and landmarks (unless they are special), but most other things, yes. Yes, terrible memory, and terrible direction, too. From what I have been reading, the memory is tied to being aphant. (I just found this group. Hi!)\n\nSame. I feel like it is a coping mechanism to overcompensate for the lack of face recognition. When I run into someone and they have to tell me their name, it is not because I do not remember their name, I do not know who they are. If they told me where we would met, I would know their name. Then I tell them what we talked about that day and then they probably think I am weird for remembering such weird details! \n\nI do totally get turned around in buildings though. If I get in an elevator, I have no idea which way I am facing when I get out. My doctors office is in a large medical building surrounded by parking lot. I could never find my car when I would look out. My husband had to point out it is because it is on the other side of the building. I hate haveing to find my car in a crowded parking lot but I have started making a point to remember where i park. Interesting, I have definitely noticed that!\n\nNot sure if it is related to the face blindness, but my dad is also both very bad at recognizing people and has a terrible memory :p I am pretty good with information like random facts / classes, but my precious childhood memories...?\n\nAt least I have my sister! She must have inherited the memory meant for me :p This is me also. I cannot remember much of anything long term. I have only the tiniest snatches of memory of things I am told most people remember well: the births of my kids, my wedding day, anything at all from school, etc. Lots of short term stuff is a problem too. I cannot remember colors. People are so shocked when I cannot say the color of my house. \n\nI have gotten very good at working around this over the years, without even knowing I was doing it. I am an extensive list maker, for example. \n\nI very often remember someone recounting an event instead of the event itself. I have no confidence in anything my brain tells me. \n\n53 now, diagnosed with ADHD when I was 50. Meds help  lots if things, but now I am beginning to wonder if I have something else that made it look like ADHD. \n\nI cannot remember faces. I finally figured that out and it is been so helpful. My wife has learned to pause TV show to explain who the characters are if they are in different clothes. Reading articles about this problem has given me many moments of understanding why I do so many things \u2014 to compensate. \n\nEbooks are a tremendous help. \u201cWho is this character?\u201d I can do a search and reread passages the character was in before. \n\nAs I become more and more aware of the reality of what I know and have been doing massive compensation for, my despair grows. I feel like I have lost 90% of my life and it will never come back. I know that what I do today will mostly be gone not that far in the future. Have you considered (or tried) keeping a diary? I do not do it as much as I should but when there is something that is particularly important to me, like a cool bit of travel, I have taken to quickly writing down everything I remember about the trip. I have a special notebook for it. Well actually I have a few because I always misplace them ha As the years have gone by, my memory is dwindled a lot. I do not remember things like photos I have taken of friends, minor everyday activities, important conversations I have had. I will either not remember it at all or remember it happening but the details get fuzzy. I go through periods of keeping a diary.  It does not last long.  I cannot keep up with the effort.  And then I have found that I never go back to old entries.  Thinking that through, it is likely because there is no trigger that causes me to think, \"I should see what I wrote about that.\"  Maybe if I flipped through old entries I would find it interesting, but honestly I think I would probably just be unhappy that I could not remember more than what I wrote, and mad at myself for not writing more or better things down. &gt;My wife has learned to pause TV show to explain who the characters are if they are in different clothes\n\nThat is so sweet", "Other conditions linked to prosopagnosia? I have recently found out that I also have ( in addition to mild ( prosopagnosia (and being autistic, I mention this as prosopagnosia is often found in those on the autistic spectrum).\n\nThis was really surprising to me because I am a huge daydreamer with a vivid imagination. I am perfectly capable of imagining things without \"seeing\" them in my mind, and it genuinely came as a shock to me that other people could.\n\nNow I am wondering if prosopagnosia, synesthesia and aphantasia are linked - perhaps I struggle with faces because I cannot visualize them? Yet my imagination is unimpaired because my senses overlap? \n\nDoes anyone else have any potentially \"linked\" conditions? \n\n I have wondered about a poor sense of direction... Topographical Agnosia.  About six months ago I made ( about the possible correlation between Prosopagnosia and Asexuality, after somebody in a different sub told me that 70% of attraction comes from the face (I have been later told that this statistic is most likely made up).\n\nI also have lucid dreams, and a pretty bad sense of direction. Yes, I remember we discussed attraction within the post. Interestingly, only today I commented on another post regarding the possibility of asexuality and prosopagnosia being linked.  I am also checking in again with the prosopagnosia/aphantasia/ace trifecta. Can you please elaborate on this? How long have you had topographical agnosia? Do you know what caused it?  I also have aphantasia and have assumed there has to be some correlation. How long have you been aware of your aphantasia and prosopagnosia?\n\nI have known about my prosopagnosia for what feels like my entire life, but it was only after attending a conference where we were asked about what we would visualised by raising our hands, that I realised I was different. The speaker then explained her own aphantasia and I realised that I was the same, but in the minority.  About 5 years ago I learned about prosopagnosia and after reading the description realized that I was on that spectrum.  It was actually a bit of a relief because I thought I was just a special kind of dumb.  Aphantasia was similar in that I just came across the term one day about a year ago and was dumbfounded that people saw pictures.  Spent 15 minutes trying to actually picture a red triangle and could not create an actual mental image.  I started talking to workmates and they thought I was nuts or making it up.  They could not understand how I could think if not in pictures.  Spoke to my parents and they both have aphantasia.  Like you I dream vividly and can dream lucidly if I want ( I think you said that in your original post)  \n\nHonestly I cannot believe people are walking around with movies in their heads.  That must be cool.\n    &gt;Honestly I cannot believe people are walking around with movies in their heads. That must be cool. \n\n**This** is something that I really struggle to comprehend!  I have a pretty strong sense of direction, and I am a great visual thinker, for example: if I read a book I do not see the letters, but a visual movie is playing in my head. Aside from that I am mildly synesthetic (everything had a colour). And to answer it fully, I am not diagnosed as autistic. I knew for a while already that I could not picture faces, but only learned about prosopagnosia about a month ago ( on an askreddit thread ;) ). This \"visual movie\" is really interesting to me as I do not experience this, I love reading but I conceptualise and experience stories.  It is a bit annoying once they make movies of my favourite books. The characters never look like what I imagined them to be, nor do the buildings and landscapes.  Yeah I guess that is a problem. I sometimes have this problem but I imagine it is more likely if you have actually *already* *seen* the movie! Just out of curiosity. Do you think aphantasia  hinders creativity? I do a lot of crafting and before I start I like to imagine and think about how all the parts of the project should look like. I can imagine it would be difficult to picture how exactly you would like to decorate something for example.  I do not think so, I consider myself quite creative and do lots of painting, creating, and crafting. Admittedly I do not always plan on what the finished article will be (now I think about it), whereas my freestyle approach seems to almost scare my sister as she always works with a plan - like you.\nI guess my creations are never quite complete because I like the idea of changing them when the fancy takes me!  Apologies, could only answer quickly this morning.\n\nI am Autistic, with Prosopagnosia, Aphantasia and a degree of Synesthesia, and the TA. I was born with these conditions, though I did not have names for them until I hit burnout, and then had to find out why life had been so difficult for me.\n\nThe TA is annoying. I am not so severe that I get lost in my own house, but I do get lost everywhere else. \n\nIn order to get from a to b, I have to always travel the same route. Also, the journey to somewhere, appears different to the journey back despite it being the same route, so I can never retrace my steps. The GPS has been very life enhancing for me. \n\nIn buildings I often cannot work out where I am, as soon as I turn a corner, I am lost when I try to leave. Familiarity helps a little.\n Firstly, I am sorry you had to go through a hard time to understand your conditions; it can be a tough enough time coming to terms with a single one, let alone discovering multiple issues after a burnout.\n\nSecondly, thank you for sharing your story here. I personally think that it is helpful to hear from other people who experience these conditions, in a way of understanding our own situations.\n\nObviously, as I share many of the same conditions I sympathise and understand, to a degree (this forum shows how different we are in the same condition of prosopagnosia alone). However I did not realise that one could be born with TA. It sounds quite debilitating, I struggle with directions when inside (but am quite good at orienting myself when outdoors) so can only imagine how stressful it must be.  My friend scores about the same as me with faceblindness, but he is autistic. Via experimentation, we have discovered that his issue is more that he doesnt look at faces. I also kind of wonder about not being able to visualize things, but i cant tell if its the same as my faceblindness or if it is my schizotypal personality disorder causing it. I can temporarily visualize things in my head, but when i try to add more things it gets complicated. For example: 4+5 i can do in my head. But then if i try to keep that in my head and multiply by 8 with nowhere to write it down, i tend to just......lose the thought? I am actually an art major, i just write everything down or draw it while i work on it. Im quite good with math as long as i can write it down. I suspect that the two are related because if i try to think of a face in my head, its kind of the same feeling as i get with mental math. Interesting comparison, between you and your friend.\n\nYou reference a personality disorder, have you been officially diagnosed?  I definitely have a poor sense of direction.  RE: synesthesia, I am not sure if it qualifies, but when I multiply in my head I sort of associate a sound to how the numbers interact to get the result.  It is not quite like how I read many people with synesthesia are, but my guess is it might be a super mild variant of it. It definitely sounds like it is on the spectrum of (  Yep. Originally went in actually to be tested for autism (b/c also have sensory processing issues) but came out with a shiny new personality disorder diagnosis, which when i looked it up i thought someone was fucking with me, that is how accurate it is. This one is actually commonly confused with autism if you dont go in for the actual cognitive testing things. No way! Have you found any benefits in having knowledge with your diagnosis, or were you always suspicious?  Ya it is sort of a mix.  It is not like all sound or visual like I have heard some people describe how they do it, but like a bit of sound that almost tips off my brain to then multiply and get the real answer.  Hard to describe. Its been really helpful for my anxiety, because my anxiety is not due to low self esteem (the usual cause of social anxiety) but paranoia. The diagnosis let me and my therapist target that more efficiently. It has provided me with more explanations to my issues than i had prior to diagnosis. I knew SOMETHING was up because i just.....wasnt \"normal\" if that makes sense? I dont have the same social needs and i dont think about things in the same way other people do. I was pretty sure i was autistic, because i tick most of the boxes on a normal symptom list. I thought i was just going to be confirmed, but was surprised. It is nice to have it explained and also helped me research which antidepressants work for people like me, resulting in my current medication which works pretty dang well. It helps to have a name for it, because now i dont get so anxious about performing social things, as i have a reason, if that makes sense. It is comforting. I encourage everyone who has unexplained things going on to get a full psych eval if they can. The only thing i wish they had tested me for was add/adhd, because that would let me try a couple medications i think would help some of the problems i still have, and i think that fits a lot, but im okay letting that go undiagnosed because i deal pretty well with my attention span issues currently. It has brought me.....peace? To know that the schizotypal personality disorder explains most of my issues. &gt;It has brought me.....peace?\n\nI am so happy that you have found peace and comfort. It is nice to hear happy outcomes. \n\nEverything you are saying about not feeling normal makes sense, I think your advice should definitely be heeded by anyone with similar issues with anxiety and \"unexplained things\". \n\n Poor sense of direction is linked to dyscalculia. I have probably got \n1.  Moderate prosopagnosia- I get confused watching many movies, staff without name-tags get misidentified all the time. \n2. Moderate topographical agnosia - I still get lost  in my own smallish town in which I have lived for five years \n3. Some kind of left-right orientation with probably a consequent coordination problem - I have been doing MMA for five years and people who have been doing it for a year are doing better than I am.  I am left handed if that is important. \n\nI am not stupid and I work around things and have only recently started telling people about this (ie telling my intern that I may have difficulty recognising her when I see her). \n\n Thanks for the details. The MMA coordination problem is interesting, as it is another issue commonly linked with autism.\nHave you considered trying to get a diagnosis?  I have a terrible (non-existent) sense of direction and terrible time with maths even though I am overwise very scientific (work in research) I am presuming you have not been assessed, has this always been the case for you?  Only mildly related to the topic, but congrats on telling people about it! I have only recently started doing that (in a new job, where seeing coworkers or regular costumers outside of work would be very common), and it took a lot of forcing myself to do it and weighing of the pros and cons. So, yeah, congrats on doing it, it is good for relationships if people do not just think you are ignoring them  I have got \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nModerate prosopagnosia (I can imagine someone is eyes, but not their whole face, and not their eyes and nose together),\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA terrible sense of direction (the same path seems like a different one when I am returning, or if I am on it at a different time of the day, I have no idea where I parked and honestly, no idea where I am in a building, most of the time)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA mild form of synesthesia maybe? Music (and sounds, to a lesser extent) travel paths in my brain, leaving trails that can be lines, geometric forms or movements. It is weird to explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA very mild form of aphantasia (I can picture something in not too much detail, and I have to be trying. I usually think in text form)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I have always thought they were all linked to my dissociative disorder, but now that I am sort of better from that, I am still going strong on all of the above... I have almost no sense of direction and my math skills are basically nonexistent. &gt;now that I am sort of better\n\nHope you are doing OK?\n\n Apparently these seem to be common to a few of us here.  I am, thank you. I still dissociate but I can lead a life with a job and responsibilities. Up until a year and a half ago, I just dissociated like a lot and had a lost sense of time and self. \n\n\nThanks for worrying :)  I am just glad that you have found a way through, I cannot imagine how difficult disassociation must be to deal with, though it sounds like you are doing an excellent job of handling it now. Do you have any regular counselling or therapy to help?  I tried a couple different therapists, but their concerns were... Concerning to me. One of them only cared about me getting a job and the other wanted to convince me I am a different sexuality than the one I am.\n\nEnded uo bailing both times. What helped in the end was to remove myself from the traumatic stuff that made me dissociate in the first place, coupled with understanding from people in the same situation :)  It is good that you have found a way through and gotten strength from some bad situations, I am sorry you had to go through that.\n\nI would advise you to try again with professional support though, it can be hard to find a decent therapist, but it is worth it is weight in gold when you do.  Yeah, since I have found a job I am thinking about finding a nice professional, because I am sure it would help with a lot of stuff. Thank you for the advise, I hope the rest of your day is awesome  &gt;I hope the rest of your day is awesome \n\nBack'atcha!\n\nGood luck with the hunt for a good professional.  I read that a poor sense of direction is found in all people with developmental prosopagnosia \n\nAlso migraine with aura found in 25 percent I would be a serious outlier if that is the case. I am bisexual with a very high sex drive. Of course in my case 70% of attraction comes from someone is ability to make me laugh and their willingness to loan me books. \n\nTerrible sense of direction though... Can you provide links to any research on this?    The article I sent about migraine is different than what I remembered. I heard about large numbers of people with prosopagnosia having migraine with aura in a science podcast. I will listen to the episode again and see if they do not site the study. The one I sent actually is about a study about impaired recognition of faces as a symptom of migraine. To me that is different. I think I remembered both of those details because they applied to me personally Also here is the podcast where I learned about developmental prosopagnosia \n\n &gt; poor sense of direction is found in all people with developmental prosopagnosia\n\nI am interested also &gt;In contrast, while previous case reports in the literature provide anecdotal evidence that some developmental prosopagnosic subjects may have topographic problems, the results from our cohort with developmental prosopagnosia and a prior one (Duchaine et al., 2005) show that most of these subjects perform normally on tests of topographic-related functions, a conclusion that aligns with recent neuroimaging findings (Gomez et al., 2015). Thus, although there may be heterogeneity and variation in developmental prosopagnosia (Stollhoff et al., 2011), its dominant form may be a more face-selective disorder than acquired prosopagnosia.\n\nThis seems contrary to your original comment?\n\nThanks for posting the link, very interesting reading regarding the difference in those with acquired vs developmental prosopagnosia.  I used to suffer badly with migraine (and aura) too, hence my interest.  IN one of richard feinmans books, I think it was Surely youre joking Mr feynman, he talks about teaching himself to count by hearing the numbers, vs seeing them vs counting by touching his fingers, and how he could keep different counts going on each system in his head, but not two different counts using the same system, if that makes sense.  really interesting reads, great book, brilliant guy. I agree, this is a different tangent but for those migraine-inflicted without prosopagnosia, it is a window into our world!  I think it helps as you get older and stop giving a good damn. ;) Thanks for the recommendation, will look him up.  Perhaps I remembered wrong. Could have been in something else too. I ended up reading a lot about it and do not remember all my sources, sorry. I know Oliver Sacks wrote about it. He also has developmental prosopagnosia and did not realize until he confused one of his brothers for another. He wrote about difficulties navigating as well.  I am pretty sure it was also mentioned in a book I read called Prosopagnosia face blindness explained. By Lindsay something? I found that book interesting, lots of information about differing types and severity. Made me feel like I got off easy. but it had some advice on coping that seemed pretty unhelpful. Like \u201cpay attention to hairstyles and distinctive marks like tattoos \u201c Stuff I imagine all of us have been doing our whole lives. Unless of course we have the kind that is acquired. Maybe it is helpful advice then No worries, the study you linked was a good read anyway. I know I get muddled over citations, I have read so much research.  Nerd problems! I know how you feel! Nerd problems indeed... The struggle is real.  Right I have heard of a lot of things like this.  I think my version of it is suuuper minor but probably somewhat related. Not giving a damn has proven to be a solution to do many problems!  Yesssss this very thing! I am so terrible at mental math too. I can handle single digits and sometimes double, but too many numbers or steps and I just cannot keep the equation in my head.  I chalked up a lot of this stuff to my dissociative and mood disorder as well..  It seems very common for comorbidity to happen with learning disabilities. I have developmental prosopagnosia, dyscalculia, mild auditory processing disorder, inattentive ADD, and cognitive disorder NOS. They later wanted to check me for autism, but I have grown weary of cognitive tests and declined. Throw hypersomnia, bipolar II, and anxiety in the mix and life can be\u2026 disheartening.\n\nThankfully, I have an above average ability in spatial reasoning (my brain works like a holodeck), so this makes the visual arts a fulfilling hobby and career path. Weird that I cannot use this talent to work with faces or numbers though. Do you consider prosopagnosia to be a learning disability?  That is a good question, and one I am admittedly unfamiliar with. A quick and uneducated Google search seems to point to prosopagnosia and learning disabilities both being classified as neurological disorders, but prosopagnosia itself is not a learning disability. Neither is ADHD.\n\nThere also appears to be differences in how the US and UK classify certain learning disabilities, disorders, or difficulties. In the UK the ( defines a learning disability thus:\n\n&gt;A learning disability affects the way a person understands information and how they communicate. This means they can have difficulty:\n\n- understanding new or complex information\n- learning new skills\n- coping independently\n\nThe ( seems to be similar:\n\n&gt;Learning disabilities are neurologically-based processing problems. These processing problems can interfere with learning basic skills such as reading, writing and/or math.  They can also interfere with higher level skills such as organization, time planning, abstract reasoning, long or short term memory and attention.\n\nPersonally I do not consider prosopagnosia itself to be a learning disability, in contrast to dyscalculia, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia etc. \n You are right it is not classified as one, but now that I am thinking about it I am kind of surprised it is not. It is a neurological disorder that interferes with a person\u2019s ability to memorize and utilize information such as politics and social hierarchies. It frequently requires assistance, like a movie spotter, and I have lost job opportunities because of it. That being said, I am just thinking out loud and not arguing for a reclassification. It is a frustrating brain glitch commonly found with other frustrating brain glitches.\n\nAlso, dyspraxia is not classified as a learning disability in the US, but possibly as a \u201cmotor learning disability\u201d outside the states. &gt;I have lost job opportunities because of it.\n\nI am sorry to hear that. That is incredibly frustrating and unfortunate. I am lucky in that I have always been able to get by, albeit with my fair share of embarrassment and unintentional slights or offence.\n\nIt is all very individual and I guess that is part of what inspired my thoughts and OP, and why I asked your opinions.\n\n&gt;Also, dyspraxia is not classified as a learning disability in the US, but possibly as a \u201cmotor learning disability\u201d outside the states.\n\nI cited dyspraxia as a contrast in my example, because I have friends who have really struggled with the physical implications of their dyspraxia, in a way that I have not with any of my conditions. Hence why I consider that to be more of a disability, per se, than prosopagnosia. ", "I got ya homie! ", "New rules for r/Prosopagnosia! Hey everyone!\n\nIn case you have opened this post without reading the title...\n \n*drumroll*\n\n...we are adding more rules! Check out the sidebar for the full list!\n\nThe main changes:\n\n* **No \"Do I have prosopagnosia\" posts?** WE ARE NOT DOCTORS, and we do not live the poster's life, so there is only so much input we can give. Now we have a shiny new widget on the sidebar (and a shiny new addition to the sidebar on old reddit) with links and resources that can help.\n\n* **No pseudoscience:** Prosopagnosia is a facial perception disorder, and there are no verified treatments that have changed the way someone is brain processes faces. Linking peer-reviewed research into prosopagnosia research is great! Telling others that the brain can be \"trained\" into fixing this is false (and a little condescending). ^Incredibly, ^\"just ^paying ^more ^attention ^to ^faces\" ^has not ^cured ^me ^yet ^:p\n\n* **\"Guess Who?\" posts** (DAE these people look the same) are now **only allowed on Fridays!** If the point of your image is \"these people look similar,\" please wait to post it. We do not want to ban these completely if people like them, but we also do not want them to take over the sub.\n\n* Surveys / research requests are allowed, but need mod approval before posting!\n\n* Self promotion is still allowed, but message the moderators first!\n\nHow do you feel about these changes? Is there anything we should change, add, or clarify, either to these rules or the subreddit as a whole? (We do not have a wiki yet, but we are working on it...)\n\nWe want to keep this a high-quality &amp; interesting community, so please let us know what you think :) I guess that none of the above behaviors annoyed me.  So I wonder who they do annoy - and if they do not annoy most of the subscribers, do we need additional rules? The only thing about the \"Guess Who? / They look the same!\" posts that annoys me is when the poster does not say who it is in the comments. \nHi there!\n\nI have had input in the past that users were annoyed with the frequency of \"Guess Who\" posts (and as a reader, I was a little annoyed as well) - limiting them to once a week felt like a good balance of allowing them without having them make up the bulk of the sub.\n\nBanning \"do I have prosopagnosia?\" posts was a little tougher. A lot of similar questions were being posted frequently, and while users here can offer our thoughts, none of us are *actually* qualified to \"diagnose\" someone with face blindness over the internet. I *do* understand that it can be helpful/validating to ask these, and we are open to suggestions on what to do about these!\n\nI have not noticed too much pseudoscience, but I *have* seen some iffy claims on here / on other face blindness forums - especially the idea that with practice, we can learn to recognize faces, which DOES NOT have real scientific backing. (People have suggested this to me a few times in the real world, and sometimes the underlying thought seems to be \"why do not you just try harder?\" which\u2026 is not helpful.)\n\nThe other two have not been serious issues yet, but we wanted to add them to avoid spam / other problems in the future. For the diagnosis posts, I am just an outside observer but I have to say that those Google search results linking to this subreddit helped me a lot in knowing what COULD be facial blindness and what may not be. It was very helpful. Banning those could get rid of those helpful posts. Sorry I am not sure how to word it better. This forum gets so little traffic that more limitations are unnecessary, misguided, and possibly preposterous.\n\nThere are major misunderstandings about this condition, (probably related to the misleading name \u201cfacial blindness \u201c) that we should encourage the misguided questions.\n\nWe can see faces. We are not \u201cblind\u201d, we cannot be equated to \u201ccolor blind\u201d, we simply cannot recall faces.\n\n2% of the population has this thing. I guess that only a few percent of afflicted people have any clue such a thing exists. I am of the opinion that no matter how goofy the questions seem to be, all of us had similar questions when we first suspected we might have facial blindness.\n\nI enjoy the guess who posts. The princess diana one made me laugh hard. I thought it was 4 different people, it took me a while to get the joke.\n\nThe new rules are misguided and I suggest that instead of new rules we need new moderators who have not lost sight of that time they discovered facial blindness was a thing and wondered if they had it. Very much in favor of the rules. The worst thing about this sub is that half the posts are 'do I have this?' or 'I just found out about aphantasia and I have it' It is late and I do not have much to say, but I like the new policies. What is left? Sharing stories/funny face blind moments and nothing else? I would put the \"Do I have pros?\" posts in a sticky but not ban them. Most of us have not been able to find a specialist to formally diagnose this condition. We just recognize ourselves in the symptoms we have experienced for many. Thank you! WHO IS IT, OP?? WHO?! and then we sound like a buncha owls maybe make a flair for \"do I have this?\" and auto-comment that we are not doctors but we can only share our own experiences. So users who do not want to see it can skip the post, but new people could ask because it is a very strange experience to find out maybe one's life long quirk is actually shared by others.\n\neverything else is great :) That is a really good point... I like that a lot!\n\nShould we make it a requirement for the poster to put who it is in the comments? Or if they do not know, they have to say so? You bring up a lot of good points, especially about the misconceptions around face blindness (which, yeah, the name definitely does not help).\n\nI (along with the other mods) really love this subreddit, and we want to do the right thing for the community. This is definitely a smaller subreddit\u2026 and it felt like the \"am I face blind?\" questions *sometimes* overwhelmed other kinds of content. We want to help people who are new to the concept of prosopagnosia while *also* avoiding an abundance of similar questions for users who are subscribed here. Many of the questions being asked already have really good, in-depth answers, which we want to link people to now. (We are also working on a better wiki/FAQ to give better answers to the most common questions.)\n\nI do understand that it can still be helpful (and really validating) to get personal answers to these questions, and we are considering a weekly/monthly sticky where people can ask if they might have face blindness, which could help.\n\nWhat we *really* want to emphasize is that we cannot *technically* diagnose anyone over the internet, so there is only so much help we can give. Just as important, EVERYONE is welcome to participate on this sub, with ANY level of facial recognition issues (and people who do not have it, of course!).\n\n&gt; I enjoy the guess who posts\n\nA lot of people do\u2026 but a lot of people also find them annoying/demoralizing, especially when there are too many of them. Allowing them once a week felt like a healthy balance of both.\n\n&gt; who have not lost sight of that time they discovered facial blindness was a thing and wondered if they had it.\n\nWe know that prosopagnosia is not a well-known condition, and discovering that you have it is often a long and difficult process. For what it is worth, I struggled pretty hard with my face blindness for a long time before discovering that it was an actual disorder - and even after learning about it, accepting that it WAS NOT because I \"was not trying hard enough\" to pay attention to faces.\n\nThe \"no pseudoscience\" rule is partially to combat people saying \"have you practiced harder?\" Currently, research into \"training your brain\" to process faces better has been unsuccessful, but I have heard that idea floating around in real life and in other prosopagnosia groups.\n\nMy answer got a little longer then I intended... but I just want to emphasize that we are thinking through all of these considerations seriously, and we are not trying to throttle the sub! You do not understand the term \u201cdiagnose\u201d.\n\nIf you break your arm and I confirm your suspicion that your arm looks broken, I have not diagnosed you and thus committed the crime of practicing medicine without a license.\n\nIf you look pale and sweaty on a hot day, I am not committing a crime of practicing unlicensed medicine if I tell you to sit in the shade and drink water because you look as though you might suffer heat exhaustion.\n\nIf you cannot follow the characters on Game of Thrones I am not diagnosing you with prosopagnosia by suggesting prosopagnosia as an explanation.\n\nI suspect a majority of doctors call facial blindness pseudoscience in the first place. We are already spreading pseudoscience by talking about this condition in the eyes of many medical professionals. It is possible that medical professionals could petition Reddit to shut us down for suggesting prosopagnosia is anything but pseudoscience.\n\nLet us not pretend that this forum cannot be social and inviting, but must only uphold the highest degree of scientific decorum. Let us not be a tiny subreddit with nazi moderators out to quash any question or conversation they deem \u201cunwoke\u201d or not purely scientific. I am pretty strongly opposed to outright banning 'do I have it?' posts.  I think it is important for people just discovering the condition to be able to share their story and be validated by the community.  This may be their first opportunity to talk about their difficulty recognizing people without being blamed for it (you just do not pay enough attention, you are too self-absorbed, etc.).  I am afraid we may discourage new members from joining if we get rid of these posts. A little late, but I generally agree.\n\nI would think about tweaking the \"Do I have prosopagnosia?\" post rule.  I think there are so few sources of information for this that this that people may not HAVE another place that they can ask that question.  If they go talk to their doctor, there is a solid chance that their doctor has never heard of it.  It is not something you can usually ask your best friend or your smart aunt to get helpful information.  I like the idea of a flair (although you can usually avoid from the title if you do not feel like explaining to another person) and an autoreply (because the reply is pretty much always the same.)  The sidebar stuff is a good addition.\n\nDefinitely agree with the no pseudoscience.  I do not mind people talking about what research they would like to see or commenting about incomplete research.  I also do not mind people commenting on things that have helped them personally.  Someone with no science background and no personal experience suggesting a \"fix\" is not helpful.\n\nThe guess who posts are annoying to me.  My whole life is guess who.  Again, it is simple enough to avoid them, regardless of the rule.  If only allowing posts on Friday does not decrease traffic (and a significant amount of other people do not like them,) you could also try putting them in a megathread.  I thought the suggestion of requiring a comment saying who it is (or if they are the same person or whatever) would be nice...but I just do not look at those anymore.  Also, another place to put a flair.  I sometimes wonder if the people posting/enjoying them actually are face blind.\n\nSurveys and self-promotion rules sound fine.  I have not had an issue with this, but it is nice if any research is run by a mod to check authenticity if possible.\n\nPersonally I enjoy posts that talk about other people's experiences with face blindness and thoughts/information on research.\n\nThanks for all of your hard work!", "Would you all be interested in a prosopagnosia meme subreddit? \n\n( It is about time Please !!!! I would be happy help mod if you end up making one:) It is created! r/prosomemes It is created! r/prosomemes It is created! r/prosomemes Beautiful. I am excited", "We are making an app to help people with Prosopagnosia, and we need you! Hi there! I am part of a team at Imperial College London, working on an app to help spot the signs of prosopagnosia, and provide resources/support to those suffering, or who are worried that they are potentially afflicted.\n\nTo do this, we would love your help! We have loved reading about your experiences on this subreddit, and we want to know a bit more about your experience with the condition, and how we can help produce an app that will actually be used by people just like you.\n\nIf you can answer any of the following questions, you will be helping us enormously!\n\n* How did you find out you had prosopagnosia, or how did you first become aware that you might?\n* What did you do when you first realised that you might have it?\n* What resources did you use to learn about the condition?\n* What contact, if any, have you had with doctors / medical professionals about it?\n* Would speaking to other people with the condition be helpful for you?\n* If no, would it have been helpful to have had someone with the condition to speak to at first?\n* How does the condition affect your day\\-to\\-day life?\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide, and we look forward to helping this community as best we can in return! 1. Watched a new program and thought that it described me\n2. Ask.a few friends how good they are at facel reconnection\n3. Internet \n4 none\n5 no \n6 nope\n\n 1. When I realized I had difficulty recognizing actors in different roles, and when I had a hard time recognizing people out of context (like at the grocery store).  \n\n2. I took some test on the internet where I had to recognize celebrities just by their faces. \n\n3. The internet\n\n4. I had some contact with a researcher in France, but I do not think I am severe enough for his research. I think I am more on the mild/moderate side. \n\n5. Maybe?\n\n6. Possibly\n\n7. Not too much. I rarely see people out of context, but if I am meeting new people, I will tell them I may introduce myself to them all over again at future meetings a couple of times before I recognize that I have met them before.  1. I think I read about it on the internet somewhere and realised that sounds very familiar.\n2. Researched it a bit more.\n3. Any credible-looking articles or websites\n4. None.\n5. I am unsure. I think it could more be funny.\n6. At first as in when I first realised I might have this thing? I do not think so as I was in my twenties already, but I am also not from the UK and am not big on speaking to someone. It would be helpful if it was more well known though since I just randomly stumbled on some material after years of thinking oh wow why cannot I remember anyone.\n7. I tend to introduce myself to the same people a lot, so I think I come off a bit rude sometimes and people think I do not care enough to remember them. Also it affected my job choices somewhat as I do not want to work in a role that would involve constantly meeting new people and having to be able to recognise them. 1 2 &amp; 3. I read a story in the local police blotter about a crime, and the witness could not identify the perpetrator, claiming he had facial blindness. I had never heard of such a thing, I thought it sounded like a load of shit, but my interest was piqued and I looked it up. Damn if it did not sound like me. I was stunned. It described me to a T. I found a test, took it, did not do well. Memories of my life  came flooding back of many instances  of me not recognizing people out of context, or not recognizing actors, or even (dum dum DUMMM) my own children and parents. I had never really considered that was not normal for most people.\n\n4 none\n\n5 no\n\n6 probably not\n\n7 understanding that such a thing exists and that I have it has made me far less socially anxious. Ive always had trepidation of not being able to recognize people, but I never realized I had a fear of not recognizing people. Now that I recognize I have difficulty identifying people life is less stressful. &gt; How did you find out you had prosopagnosia, or how did you first become aware that you might?\n\nI have always been bad with faces. When I was younger, my mother explicitly had to teach me to be better at recognizing people, sat me down with photos and quizzed me on who was who.\n\nWhen did I become aquatinted with the term itself? Only a couple months ago. I saw it mentioned in an /r/askreddit thread, and it led me to this subreddit.\n\n&gt;  What did you do when you first realised that you might have it?\n\nI found some questionaires online (the Cambridge assessment plus some others) to verify, and took them to verify whether it seemed accurate. I also joined this sub and read pretty much its entire history.\n\n&gt; What resources did you use to learn about the condition?\n\nWikipedia, Google Scholar, Google, various websites, this sub.\n\n&gt; What contact, if any, have you had with doctors / medical professionals about it?\n\nNone. \n\nI am not formally diagnosed, but I am pursuing therapy for depression/anxiety, but I will be bringing this up during that meeting.\n\nI am usually fairly against self-diagnosis. On the other hand, it has been useful to understand why I botch so many conversations with people I have not seen in a while. \n\n&gt; Would speaking to other people with the condition be helpful for you?\n\n&gt; If no, would it have been helpful to have had someone with the condition to speak to at first?\n\nNo. Because I grew up like this, it is the only experience that I know. \n\nI need people I interact with to be understanding that I will have issues interacting with them.\n\n&gt; How does the condition affect your day-to-day life?\n\nI am actually really good at recognizing people, but my recognition is tuned toward things that are not the face (a person's build, tattoos, body movements, etc), so it often looks like I am better than I actually am.\n\nI struggle significantly especially when it comes to people I do not know.\n\nThis made working in retail difficult because I lost customers easily. When I meet more than one person at a time, I can look at one person turn around and lose track of which person I am talking to. \n\nI recently had a conversation with someone. I asked them how much experience they had, and I was told \"About 5 years. We have met several times before\". This is unfortunately common. Thanks for responding! Do you find it easy to cope with your symptoms? What would make it easier for you?  How do you think the online test was? We did not think very highly of the celebrity face ones, but it would be good to know what you think!  \n\n\nHow have you found this subreddit as a community? Has something like this been helpful for you?\n\nThanks for replying! Thanks for the response! It is really interesting to hear about the different experiences of people. Your point about \"credible\\-looking\" articles is a good one: our app would also aim to provide a reliable source of information about the condition; do you think this would be something that you might use / have used in the past? That is a really interesting way to have found it out! If it is okay to ask, what has stopped you reaching out to a doctor?\n\nI am really glad that the discovery helped you feel less anxious though! Thank you for responding :\\) Thank you for such a full response!\n\nI am glad you brought up self\\-diagnosis. We found that most of the online tools did not seem particularly transparent with regards to their efficacy, and we were worried about the dangers of self diagnosis. We hope to improve on the diagnosis tools by using some research\\-based techniques we have not seen elsewhere, and also to provide more direct contact with medical professionals where appropriate \\(so that people are not entirely self diagnosing\\).\n\nHow have you found explaining your issues with recognising people, to other people who do not know about the condition? Would it have helped you to have had an easily available resource to show them?\n\nDo you feel like prosopagnosia has contributed at all to your depression/anxiety \\(if it is okay to ask!\\), and if yes, do you think it is a common problem for people with it?\n\nThanks again for your time! Have a great day :\\) Eh, I thought it was alright. Helped me to start figuring it out. \n\nI just found this community a couple of days ago, so I could not really say. Honestly, this photo I found on another subreddit helps explain to people what it is like ID\u2019ing another person. (   You can tell it is Mara Wilson (if you are familiar with the actress), but you use features other than her face to do so. Honestly, some people I have talked to think that is how I see the world all the time. It is hard to explain to other people that I can see normally, I just ID people differently than they do, and it can sometimes be a little difficult. \n\n Pretty easy, most of my friends know so it is not that big of a deal. If everyone never changed there clothing and hairstyle it would be cool, but that is unreasonable A doctor? Why? What is a doctor going to do?\n\nI recognize people by their voice, hair, fashion sense, and mannerisms. \n\nAre you from some backward country with free healthcare for all, so you go see a doctor every time you get a runny nose? What would you expect a doctor to do? You are just being a burden to the system and causing wait times to get even longer. &gt;How did you find out you had prosopagnosia, or how did you first become aware that you might?\n\nBoth my mother and my sister said they have problems telling people apart and that they have to meet a person several times before they can recognize them. I am the same way but did not think it was a big deal until my husband told us we probably had legitimate facial blindness. I looked up the other signs and yep, I have a lot of those too! I had heard of facial blindness, but I thought it always had to be severe, like you did not recognize your own mom.\n\n&gt;What did you do when you first realised that you might have it?\n\nJust laughed because it explained a lot.\n\n&gt;What resources did you use to learn about the condition?\n\nNone.\n\n&gt;What contact, if any, have you had with doctors / medical professionals about it?\n\nNone.\n\n&gt;Would speaking to other people with the condition be helpful for you?\n\nProbably not, but it would be fun.\n\n&gt;If no, would it have been helpful to have had someone with the condition to speak to at first?\n\nProbably not.\n\n&gt;How does the condition affect your day-to-day life?\n\nI often have trouble watching movies and TV because I cannot tell so many characters apart until I have seen them again and again. It is also caused some trouble at work. When I first begin I cannot remember what my boss or specific co-workers look like until quite a bit of time has passed. It is caused more than a few awkward situations. &gt;I am glad you brought up self\\-diagnosis.\n\nI have always found self\\-diagnosis to be a strange topic.\n\nThere are legit issues when people do it. How many people say they have OCD when they do not? ADHD, Bipolar, Anxiety, Depression all have similar symptoms,so a professional touch is NEEDED.\n\nLikewise, there are also some other conditions that are less clear. Do you need a Doctor to tell you that you are colorblind?  Gender Dysphoria is another one.  The trans community has historically had a an issue with doctors Gatekeeping and refusing treatment.\n\nWhere does Proso fall?  Probably closer to the first, imho, which is why I qualified as I did.  I am always open that I could be wrong, but as I said, the experiences here, I do relate to many of them.\n\n&gt;How have you found explaining your issues with recognising people, to other people who do not know about the condition? Would it have helped you to have had an easily available resource to show them?\n\nPrior to applying the term to myself, I have always said that \"I am really bad with faces\" as a way to recover from many gaffs from not recognizing people that I should. I started using the term \"Face Blind\" instead, in effort to convey that I am not actively trying to be rude.\n\nI found issue with it, though, as the term does not carry the same weight for others as it does for me.  When I say Face Blind, I think \"My Brain is wired in a way that this is difficult\", but others think \"You obviously are not\". It unfortunately sounds even more like an excuse.\n\n&gt;Do you feel like prosopagnosia has contributed at all to your depression/anxiety \\(if it is okay to ask!\\), and if yes, do you think it is a common problem for people with it?\n\nThis is a super difficult question, as I do not have a lot of answers.  Like, I only recently realized that my Suicidal Ideation actually was that.\n\nI definitely do think proso \\*plays\\* into issues, but I do not think it is really something that is a primary focus.  \n\nMy issues tend to focus in a couple areas, and 'issues with socialization' is definitely on there.  They tend to be more general things though \\-\\- I talk too much, I have a grating personality, I misread my relationship with  them, They want me around for the work that I do, but they would rather than interact with me more than they have to, whatever.  \nI think my issues with faces might play into not being able to effectively read people's reactions, so I will second guess myself.  \n\nI do know that people get frustrated when I do not recognize them. That plays into people's frustrations with me, but it is only a small part, imo.  \n How did you find out you had prosopagnosia, or how did you first become aware that you might?\n\n~~~ I heard about it on the internet and realized that there was a word for what I had been dealing with \n\nWhat did you do when you first realised that you might have it?\n\n~~~ I made everyone I knew take the Cambridge quiz to see if it was not just me... it was... XD;;;;\n\nWhat resources did you use to learn about the condition?\n\n~~~ I researched different articles and YouTube videos, but there were not many at the time\n\nWhat contact, if any, have you had with doctors / medical professionals about it?\n\n~~~none\n\nWould speaking to other people with the condition be helpful for you?\n\nI think it would be fun... a lot of people tell me it is a made up condition so talking with someone who understood would be nice\n\nHow does the condition affect your day-to-day life?\n\nI am a teacher and it can be really difficult, especially if my students see me outside of the classroom... my husband has a lot of friends and relatives so whenever someone starts talking to me with that \"I know you\" gleam in their eyes, I just try to keep up and pretend I know them... I have had whole conversations and left them thinking, \"who even was that?\" And I will only find out if said person follows up by text or tells my husband  that they ran into me  I do not know about you, but my first thought upon discovering I have a health condition that I know nothing about is to seek the advice of a healthcare professional! Sure, we have free healthcare here in the UK \\(generally considered a good thing, by the way!\\), but I do not think seeking help is burdening the system, unless all you have is indeed a runny nose! Thanks for telling us more about your recognition strategies! self\\-diagnosis\n\nIt is really good to hear such a nuanced position on self\\-diagnosis! I think I feel similarly, which is why I am really keen to try and get some kind of professional touch into this app, as well as some reliable self\\-assessment tools.\n\nsounds even more like an excuse\n\nThat sounds like an absolute pain to put up with! Hopefully we will be able to help provide a canonical source of information, to help raise awareness of the condition with those that do not really follow!\n\nsuper difficult question\n\nThank you for your very full response to what was a harsh question! First, I would like to say that I am really glad you are seeking help for the things you are not happy with in your life; it is an incredibly difficult thing to do, and it is a fantastic way for things to start to get better! I am sorry to hear about how you are struggling, and how prosopagnosia is not exactly helping... Sadly I am not sure I have much to offer, but hopefully this app can go some way to helping people in similar positions to yours cope with the difficulties presented by the condition!\n\nIf you are interested in how we are doing, I have posted an update ( where you can see our progress! We would love to keep getting your feedback and advice! Thanks so much for your response! I am sorry to hear about the difficulties you have had, and I really hope our app will be able to help people just like you! If you are keen to keep an eye on our progress, I have posted an initial update ( Thanks again, and have a great day! Thanks so much for your reply; sorry for taking so long to get back to you \\(We have had a Bank Holiday here in the UK\\).

Oops I missed this! Saw your updated post and linked back.\n\n1) I watched two seasons of a show with my boyfriend (Prison Break) thinking there were three main characters when there were five, or something along those lines.\n2) Took quizzes, thought of things that previously were probably signs of prosopagnosia\n3) The internet, and I participated in that Bell survey\n4) I have mentioned it to a few doctors, including one of my friends. Both a friend and one of the doctors told me they would never seen anyone with it before.\n4) Maybe, I am on here after all.\n5) I would like someone to help me figure out ways to ID people before it gets awkward, which happens pretty frequently.\n6) Did not recognize boyfriend in a suit when I was looking for him; mixed up mom and aunt; ran into coworker in the store and did not know I knew him; cannot watch any shows with lots of similar-looking characters; frequently come across coworkers in the office who I do not realize I know, which is a problem in my specific job; generally just smile at everyone in case I know them and have developed a method of erring on the side of overly-friendly when people on my way into the office ask me how it is going - eg, \"great, was able to spend some time on the patio with the dog this weekend, how about you?\" instead of the typical response I would give to a stranger in the office which is more like \"oh not bad, how are you today?\" 1.  I knew I was bad at remembering people, but my wife started pointing out that I could not tell anybody apart in movies if they had at all similar hair.\n2. Not much.  It is not so extreme and I have figured out ways of hiding it. \n3. Not sure.  I have not done a lot of research.  After reading about it about a decade ago it just described the condition so accurately it was eerie.  Also a bit of a relief.  \n4. None.  \n5. Maybe, not sure.  I am strangely embarrassed by it, so probably.  It is not such a terrible affliction that I feel I am suffering in any way.  I have probably got a pretty mild case.  I just look really dumb from time to time.\n6. Yeah, I think so.  I have never actually spoken to anyone that has it.\n7. Day to day, not so much.  I have to keep asking my wife \"who is that?\" through movies.  I have about 6-10 cases of mistaken identity a year.  I do not really warm up to people until I have been around them a lot.  If I see someone out of context, like I know them from work, but then see them our for dinner or something, I usually have no idea who it is.  Seeing people in the same context is really helpful.       I figured it out on my own in my 20s\n\nThe internet\n\nnone\n\nI tried but i guess i was ignored so i have not talked about it to anyone since.\n\npretty bad life has been a struggle     anxiety issues depression, lack of relationship.\n the best strategy is remembering a persons voice. that works the easiest for me.\n\nI may add I can recognize 2 people on the spot my friend and his mom..  somehow their faces  are able to be processed correctly   but not anyone else.     does not matter if they change anything  i.e her with make up or he changes his hair style  or out of context etc..\nnot his 1/2 brother though.\nThis does mean the Fusiform gyrus is functional but disconnect??\n\nit freaked me out too  I do not feel too much anxiety, stressed  etc around them.\n\nI bet if I was put on one of those brain imaging machine it would light up nicely.  in the Fusiform gyrus area\n\n\n\n\nI did have a bad fall when i was a 8-9yo kid (hit the back of my head hard on the pavement)\n\nI was also hit by a pickup  when I was 14  head first into the steel fender of a  LT pickup(older one  from the 70s)\nhappened while riding my bike..\n\nApparently my grandma had this  But cannot confirm it because she passed away  in 2005\n\n\nThe famous faces tests does not work   for me since I used coping by breaking down their face into smaller pieces  I also cheat with IMDB (to see the cast ) before I watch a movie  I also have their voices remembered as well.\n\nsome TV shows are easy to follow like: \nBig Bang Theory\nTimeless \nBones\nThe Goldbergs\nand many others", "Here are some interesting studies about facial recognition :) (", "Guys...  Dude that is a crazy difference. And yeah he looks like my dad who would definitely do that. No offense. He would be a totally different person :O Took me way too long to figure out the guy on the right has a beard as well. \n\nI wouldnt recognize him without the comparison context :\\ I KNOW right like this picture is my confusion encapsulated!!! xD", "Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, or Sandra Bullock?  I got 50%. I am not even sure who Anne Hathaway is so this list to me was more like Julia Roberts or Anne Hathaway? And I swear they added 3or 4 *other* ladies that did not even look like the 2 that I knew. So I had to do a bunch of guessing. I got 40%. There was like one that I was certain was Sandra Bullock. The rest were absolute guesses. If you had told me that each of those 20 were different women I would have believed you. I think there was 2 or 3 where I was certain it was Julia Roberts for sure. The rest seemed different or I assumed was Sandra Bullock. *edit* Shit just Googled Anne Hathaway. It did not help lol I got 55%. I got most of the Anne ones right, but Sandra and Julia kept confusing me. 60%, which surprised me as I was straight up guessing. I got 90%. They have different jaws and mouths. I notice little things like that rather than the whole face. Lol! Right? I was like, \"okay the blonde one is Anne Hathaway... Or is it? Wait, who is this one with the curly hair? Damn.\" These are not too tough for me.  Julia has large lips and '80s hair.  Anne is prettier (at least to me) and usually has darker and flatter hair.  Sandra fills up the middle ground between the two, and if I have to pick one out of three and cannot tell:  that is probably her.\n\nA decent number of those pictures were guessable just by the decade and fashion/hairstyle. I 95% would this, but for contrast... the first time I watched Orphan Black... I did not initially realise that Cosima was a 4th clone. \n\nHathaway/Roberts/Bullock all have different shaped jaws, which I think is the key to quick identification of them.\n\n(for those unaware, Orphan Black is a show about clones, all of whom are played by the same actress, who does a phenomenal job giving them different physicality and making them seem distinct, but on first viewing I did not realise that a freshly introduced character was another clone.... played by the same actress but with different costume &amp; hairstyle/colour.) I got 50% as well! I am so proud of myself right now! I love this show and really want my bf to watch it with me, but i do not know if he would be really frustrated. If you do not mind me asking, did you have a hard time watching that in terms of getting irritated by how similar people look? Or is it easier because they have to make the clothes, hair, accents, and mannerisms so different? No, mannerisms/hair/clothing/mannerisms are all pretty distinctive..\n\nHere is a (tiny for some reason) ( of the... uh.. primary cast Ehhhhh i got 45%, i had no clue what i am doing. They should have included a \u201cor someone else\u201d? And used all these pictures and I guarantee all of us would have scored much lower. So true!", "Found this amazing game! Cannot wait to play it and be really good at it! /s ", "I was very bad at distinguishing and recognising faces as a child but am now quite good at it. This goes against everything I have read on the subject.... I am fairly sure I genuinely have got better at it and am not just circumventing it using other distinguishing features. Has anyone else found their condition changes over time? after finding out i was faceblind i think i got a lot better at recognizing others. i only found out about the condition a couple years ago and since then I have learned to be more mindful to find identifying things other than facial features Me too - my theory is that I do not have prosopagnosia or anything (but it is fun to lurk here - so relatable) but was mainly hindered by being too shy to actually look at people's faces properly when I was younger, or maybe not putting enough effort in to remember.\n\nThese days I try to use memory tricks like coming up with rhymes: 'Hugh Foughs - huge nose\" or writing down who I have met when I can get a minute. I had not considered that, thank you My day-to-day recognition of people is fine, you would never know anything was wrong with me. \n\nBut I am not recognizing faces -- I am recognizing body shapes, gestures and gaits, common clothing, distinguishing scars or features, etc. and combining them with context to determine who someone is. This all comes together to offer a good amount of reliability where you can change some of the cues, and I can fall back on the others if something changes.\n\nWhen taking an assessment that controls for these factors, my scores become indistinguishable from random guessing.\n\nPractically, where I have most of my problems is when I meet new people. It takes some times (couple weeks to a couple months) until I can build up a \"profile\" that I can start recognizing them.\n\n\\ I have had the same thoughts and here is a little test I came up with.  Close your eyes and try to picture the face of someone you see regularly.  Do you see their face or as you try to see it do you feel like you are getting a dull headache?  The people I talk to that do not have facial blindness can easily visualize the face. Ergh, you are right, I struggle and I do not think other people do. I can picture people's hair easily but I feel like I am running up against a brick wall with pinning down their faces in my mind's eye. I can remember little details like my boyfriend having a slightly round nose tip... but the face does not really come together? It is disconcerting.\n\nOh god you are right, I tried that for five minutes and now I have a headache. I think half the battle is realizing you have a problem, be it prosopagnosia or just shyness and not really paying attention to faces.  That moment for me was close to 20 years ago.  You get pretty good at adapting to the point where you question if you really have it, but inevitably you always have a situation come up that reminds you.  My daughter has it too but luckily I was able to see all those little signs from my childhood and was able to help her realize it at a relatively young age and I think it really helped her out, she is much more comfortable in social situations than I am. That would not work for everyone with prosopagnosia. I can imagine faces if I have been exposed to them enough, but still cannot recognize them out of context. \n\nFor example, I feel like I can imagine Jim Carrey's face, but when somebody posted the Jim Carrey deepfake here a few months ago, I did not recognize him at all. Are you closing your eyes when you try to imagine the face?  I feel like I can kind of imagine his famous alrighty then face with my eyes open, in reality I am seeing his hair and the facial expression but I feel like I cannot see details.  But the big difference is I do not get that dull headache when I try with my eyes open. Eyes open or closed does not make a difference. I might just be imagining really generic facial features with his hair, but I do not know. Or maybe I am remembering very specific photos? I doubt it is accurate. Yeah it certainly is not anything scientific behind it just found it works for myself had a few others to include OP try and it works for them, but certainly does not mean it works for all.  Another possibility might be is your prosopagnosia genetic or caused by brain injury? It is genetic and runs in my family (my mom and uncle have it too) I am assuming you have German heritage?  Mine is genetic that or I was dropped on my head as a baby and so was my daughter.  :) I do have some German/Swiss heritage, is prosopagnosia more common in that gene pool? I recall reading that many moons ago that it was more prominent in the German bloodline which made perfect sense for me.", "This video is so cute it hurts, but, as always, the joke is ever so slightly lost on me  My worlds are colliding Are they supposed to look alike? One of them had curly hair and a funny hairband, and the other was much taller with straight dark hair. Do you follow them?? I just found them the other day through this video and I love them :) I just checked and apparently I follow one of them, and I think I just see a lot of their videos on my explore page.", "I do not know if I am in the right lecture hall. At the front is possibly the professor of this week. In the slides is a photo of the professor. But are these the same? I am just waiting for me colleagues to arrive and recognize me \ud83d\ude02 Well, He had the same slides as I had, so I was in the right place \ud83d\ude02", "How I describe Prosopagnosia to others. I am not sure where I am on the spectrum, but it is certainly not extreme.  I do have a lot of cases of mistaken identity with anyone I have only known a couple of years, or am seeing out of the usual context.  Like a lot of people I only really discovered the problem late in life and I was having a really hard time explaining it to my wife.  When you say \"I see faces, but I do not always SEE faces\" it understandably makes no sense.\n\nI eventually told her this.\n\nYou know how sometimes you will hear the beginning of a song and you know it seems really familiar but you cannot figure out what it is.  Maybe its a different version of the song, or at a different tempo than you are used to.  When the hook or chorus comes on, suddenly you realize what it is!  It is so obvious.  It feels like there is no way you could ever have not recognized it, but still, 5 seconds earlier you could not have named it for a million bucks.  That is how faces are.  I see the face, I see all the details, It even looks familiar but until something happens to make it resolve itself, I am lost.  Once it resolves itself, It is just so obvious who it was the whole time.   That is a good way to describe it. I compare it to having a card index in my head, with ID and photos of all the people I know or have met. The problem lies in matching what I see to one of the cards. Sometimes I can match them straight away, e.g. if they have a distinctive voice or appearance/shape/movement, and other times I walk away having no idea.\n\nAnother faceblind person described the moment of recognition as if the unknown face was suddenly redrawn into one he recognised. I think that is as near perfect a description of what happens for me too, although I find it a little disturbing. That is a way of describing it I have never considered before! Usually I got for the gravel analogy because, for me, it describes what I mostly experience perfectly. I read it somewhere, but cannot remember where though, unfortunately.\n\nMaking everyone you know pieces of gravel in your hands. Up close and compared together in their rightful places, you have got a better chance of making out the individual gravel pieces. This piece is more round, this one is a little lighter, that one has some spotting, etc. Then, drop those pieces on the ground with other gravel pieces, and try to find them. Unless one of the gravel pieces was exceptionally distinct, all the pieces of gravel can be mistaken for each other. Whether you had five years to memorise the gravel piece that signifies your mother, or five minutes, you will still lose it in the pile of other gravel. I saw that analogy in the prosopagnosia horror movie \"faces in the crowd,\" but she did it with stones~ ^.^ it is a great analogy ^.^ It always reminds me of the pictures in The Ring where the cursed people's faces were blurry... some are more blurry than others and some have something so distinctive about them that even a slightly blurred image can be recognizable by that one feature~ \n\n... but then people usually back away in horror XD;;;;; jk jk~ But this is especially true in memories... the longer it is and the less distinctive they are... the more blurry they get   &gt;Another faceblind person described the moment of recognition as if the unknown face was suddenly redrawn into one he recognised. I think that is as near perfect a description of what happens for me too, although I find it a little disturbing.\n\nYes...That! For me, the \"blurriness\" is more of a metaphor than how they actually appear for me.\n\nIt is a weird combination of \"everyone looks like a stranger\" and \"everyone looks familiar\" faces do not matter , they mean noting , I can draw them but no information  or judgement in any way is linked to it its just as important as the 22745130421th grain of sand on the beach.\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; ^(Hi, I am a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)\n\n**\n\n^^( ^^| ^^( ^^| ^^( ^^| ^^(  I like to describe it using trees. Here is basically what I say, verbatim:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So, most people's brains work overtime, and are especially good at noticing \\*and memorizing\\* minute details in faces - things like jaw structure or width between eyes, or the size of somebody is nose. For somebody like me with Prosopagnosia, my brain does not work any extra at noticing or memorizing faces. In fact, I am as good at memorizing and recognizing faces as you are memorizing and recognizing trees.\"  \n\n\n\"If you put a pine tree next to a palm tree, it is pretty easy to tell them apart - or a pine tree covered in snow compared to one that is not... BUT, if you put two pine trees next to one another, telling them apart becomes a game of 'spot the differences'. Hey, this one has a knot on the trunk, or the branches are thinner with this one.\"  \n\n\n\"That is why I generally tell people apart based on their hair style, or their outfit, their body type, or sometimes their voice. So when a movie or TV show features several... I dunno, Caucasian guys with short dark hair, it can be difficult for me to follow.\"  \n\n\nI have had this exact conversation like... I dunno, over a dozen times. I feel like it does a good job of describing what it is like. \"So, most people's brains work overtime, and are especially good at noticing \\*and memorizing\\* minute details in faces \"\n\nits not a conscious thing . people are not aware of it doing it.\n\nit acts more like a separate center like the way you store language in the brain...\n\nthe brain just responds to the face with emotional impulses.\n\n( \n\nexplains how it works.\n\nif it was  conscious there would be much less judging racism etc... it a PRIMATE part of the brain , its not rational configured....\n\n&amp;#x200B; This is an excellent way of describing it!  I have noticed that I have gotten a little better after identifying the problem, but it is because I concentrate on faces and try to memorize and file away the individual features, but it is about as easy as memorizing a specific tree in a forest.", "Acquired Prosopagnosia Hello! In the past couple months, I have noticed that I cannot recognize faces. I meet new people often and can remember details about them, but not their face. Also, I cannot keep track of characters in movies or match up faces of actors to their characters. I did a little research and found out that you can acquire face blindness, but the studies on acquired prosopagnosia (AP) say that it results from brain damage, which I have not had. I am wondering if any of you have AP and if you know of any other way your can get it? Thanks! I do not have ap, but am aware of no other way that you can get it besides your brain being damaged in some way.  Was this a sudden change for you?  Or is it possible that you have always had this difficulty, but recently became aware of it? I have this too and absolutely you can have it without being brain damaged in some way!\n\nIt is called developmental prosopagnosia. \n\n\n\nTake a look into it and make sure to tell people you are close to about it so they can help you out. My SO patiently explains which character is which if I am struggling to follow a TV show ... But also will use people's names quickly if we unexpectedly meet people out so that I do not appear rude.

The focus is to inform people on the condition and talk about how despite how common it is there are little services available for it.

I need to be able to recognize certain people very well, and really, I do when I am around them for an extended period of time, but it is still anxiety inducing. I dread these kinds of situations where I run into people. Location tends to be huge in my ability to recognize, and my social anxiety is already peaked, so I hate that I could be in an awkward social situation at any moment because I cannot recognize people who know me. In fact, I dread being recognized in the same way I dread not recognizing others. But it is so weird, because certain people I recognize all the time... Like people I never talk to but just see out and about. But I cannot recognize a person I have worked with?! Come on, brain!

I cannot exactly forward this to a friend to ask because they would want to know why I am looking at pictures of Hitler lmfao. Do a screenshot of one or two of them only (part of the picture), and ask for who is he I can tell it is the same photo from the lighting and shadows, but if he were to appear in real life in one of these disguises I would have no clue. One of my fears is having to try to pick someone out of a police line up. I definitely see Hitler, Jeffrey Tambour, Howard Stark, Sigmund Freud, Walt Disney, and Richard Nixon. I feel this so deeply! I was robbed at work once and could not give a description of the guy aside from a vest he was wearing almost immediately after it happened! I would break down crying if I had to pick someone from a lineup. In a side by side still picture I can compare images and see feature similarities.

Prosopagnosia already makes memorizing people very difficult, but scrolling through social media these days and seeing an endless parade of doe-eyed barbie dolls with all their characteristic moles, dimples, and wrinkles removed makes it even harder! I would not say it irritates me, but I do get confused when people show those comparison photos. I can make out a difference between the regular face and 100% filtered but the 50% filtered photo looks just like both polar opposites somehow. I do not try to memorise people's faces, and I have a real problem telling those facial features apart in the first place, so not really. (I have trouble seeing specific wrinkles and dimples, I can see moles.) If I were expected to socialise with Snapchat, I would probably be driven nuts by it existing in the first place.\n\nBut I can see why this would be annoying for sure, I just never thought about it. I might be lucky because my loved ones do not really post photos of themselves at all, and the only way I am going to learn their face is by seeing them in person.

I hope that you were able to enjoy your time with her today, I am sure she was thrilled to see you regardless of the time apart. I normally see her everyday and truthfully I probably recognise her more from context than anything else just like with everyone else but its still hard to believe I actually forgot what she looks like.

Very glad to see her again anyway even if she came back in disguise :P I wonder where parents are actually harder to recognise than less familiar faces because they form your default that everyone else is compared to? I have also not recognised my mother, long time back. I guess you dont really need to learn what they look like so much because how many similar looking people are going to be in your house acting like they own the place :P \nI have struggled to find my family in department stores and things before or in crowded rooms but once i have spotted them they look familiar, she didnt even look like someone I maybe sorta knew which was weird. That kind of happens as you get older and see them less but you adapt. I have noticed I re-learn my parents' faces much quicker than new faces. It can be scary watching them grow old, though.

At first, I told people, but then I mostly stopped, because in most cases it was a lot of trouble and it did not help.\n\nFirst you have to explain to people that it is a thing.  Then like seriously a third of the people I tell do not believe me.  (Apparently I am very good at covering for myself; the only person who went right away, \"Oh my gosh!  That is you!\" was my husband.)  And then another half tell me, \"Oh yeah, I have that too.  I am really bad at remembering names.\"  (Fine.  I will pretend it is your name I do not remember next time.)\n\nI have found I have better luck skipping the words face blindness/prosopagnosia and saying, \"I am really bad at facial recognition.\"\n\nWhat works for you? \"I am not very good with faces\" is normally enough.  I have started just saying prospagnosia. Too many people take some negative meaning when I say I am not good with faces. I explain people that I will not recognize them the next time we will meet and they always respond that they are not good at faces too, so I tell them that I do not even recognize my children and even myself and only at this moment they understand that it is a real disorder (but sometimes I think they do not believe me...)\n\n I do not, generally. I have never encountered a situation where I felt it was necessary. I now tell people I meet and like, so if I run into them later they know I will not recognize them, to say hi to me. \u201cI am not good with faces\u201d does not really cut it for me- some people assume if you like them of course you will remember them. If I do explain at all, I explain that I do not recognize even friends. ", "Are you asexual or on the asexual spectrum?  I have just created another post regarding aphantasia as I have recently found out that I have this condition. In answer to your question, I am not asexual at all but I do struggle with visualizing myself - in fact, I would possibly be flagged for body dysmorphia as I struggle so much with this aspect.  Thanks u/brokenstar64 for bringing this thread to my attention!\n\nI am Asexual also, and about six months ago, I made ( about a possible correlation between asexuality and prosopagnosia - lots of good discussion within the post. I have developmental prosopagnosia and have an fabulous sex life with my husband of 29 years. So, no, I am not asexual. ", "Are there degrees of faceblindness? My friend is convinced I am faceblind because I identify faces by features and am rather bad at it, but there are other people I know who clearly have more difficulty than I do. As a child, I basically had thirty prototype faces I would match people against.  I would learn to identify people by variation from those prototypes, but could initially only identify them in contexts where I expected them.  Eventually, as I know someone really well (constant interaction for about six months), I know the face well enough that I can recognize them in a strange context, unless they change their hair.\n\nAs I got older, I learned to create a larger number of prototypes by breaking faces down into features, for example: square face + puffy cheeks + big eyes + brown skin + pixie cut or long face + close-together eyes + high cheeks + brown hair + facial stubble.  Hair changes will still confound me, but weirdly I have a somewhat easier time with facial hair changes.  If someone changes their hair, it looks like they are a completely different person to me. Yet I can sometimes still recognize a man who shaves off his goatee, or goes from stubble to a short beard, if I have already learned to recognize him.\n\nI was diagnosed with autism at 10, and possibly because of this various people who worked with me have suggested that I must be faceblind.  More recently, my friend has been insisting that I must be faceblind because breaking faces down into individual features to recognize them is not how normal people recognize faces.\n\nHowever, this friend and I have a mutual friend who definitely has faceblindness.  She has very obvious undiagnosed autism (every person with an autistic sibling and most autistic people she has met have told her this, but she refuses to get tested out of concerns it will lead to job discrimination). The acquaintance does not have prototype faces or features, cannot learn to recognize people by their faces at all, and cannot even tell whether she finds people attractive.  (She identifies as asexual and heteromantic but it is basically a case of all men are equally attractive until she gets to know them.)\n\nMy father also has pretty obvious undiagnosed autism, which is commented by anyone who has both worked with autistic people and has interacted with him for more than a few minutes.  My father and mother have been divorced about a decade but still see each other a couple times a year, yet my father ran into her recently in a place where he did not expect to see her and completely failed to recognize her until she told him who she was, even though she had not changed her hair.  He also had trouble telling me and my sibling apart as kids, even though my sibling had red hair and freckles.  He only learned to tell us apart when we started choosing our own clothes and favored very different styles.\n\nSo it is clear to me that I do not have faceblindness to the degree that my acquaintance does, or even to the degree that my father does.  My friend bases the assumption that I am faceblind on the way that I process faces: normal people do not identify people by individual features and are not thrown off by people changing their hair.  She says I am faceblind but able to partially compensate for it. But if that is the case, I am able to compensate using features from faces, which my father and my acquaintance both seem unable to do.  \n\nSo basically I am wondering if there are degrees of faceblindness, such some people are able to compensate for not being able to recognize faces holistically by using features from faces, while other people are unable to use any information from faces to recognize people? I would say so.  I consider myself partially facial blind - some people to me are way more difficult to identify when I see them out of context / change their hair / etc.  Others are super easy. There are many degrees of face blindness. I spoke with a researcher once and she described some people who have it so bad they actually cannot see a face without their brain making it look like it is melting, others who cannot recognize their own family, and then the whole spectrum in between. I feel like I still have some type of subconscious face recognition once in a while, but I still cannot picture or remember faces at all, it is mostly just the situation/hair/body shape that give it away for me.  Yes, it is an entire spectrum. Yes it is a spectrum. I have really mild face blindness compared to some and may not even qualify for the official diagnosis, which iirc is the bottom 2%. (I have not gotten tested.) But I still have significant difficulty recognizing faces, even though I can learn to recognize them after a while.  Yes, definitely a spectrum.  &gt;  they actually cannot see a face without their brain making it look like it is melting \n\nWow, like, when they are looking at someone? That must be creepy, right? For me, if I try to remember someone is face it kind of melts away and is out of grasp, but I could not imagine looking at someone and watching their face melt away while I talked to them  I would love to know more about this. Personally, i am terrible with facial features, but not too bad with expressions. So sometimes i recognize obscure actors because i remember something about their facial expression or the feeling it gave me. Like, i recognize sone biy part actor in a movie because i remember that particular look of smug dickishness. Or something. \nBut my dad shaved off hos hair and sent me a picture, and I am like, who is that. I would love to know more about this.

So thank you. :) OMG, you just made my year!", "How good do you think facial memory tests are at determining prosopagnosia? So, I recently took ( and ( Despite having a lot of the usual signs of prosopagnosia (cannot recognize people if they change their hairstyle, sometimes meet the same person twice in different situations and do not realize they are the same person until weeks later (which is especially annoying when the other them has told me something important and then probably thinks I am inconsiderate when I do not know that thing about the other other them), do not recognize myself in childhood photos (children all seem to have the same two or three faces, really), used to mistake strangers for my parents if their clothes were similar, had trouble telling classmates apart if they looked similar), I score within the normal ranges (with scores 41 and 51 respectively) on both tests. \n\nI think a lot of the faces they ask you to memorize (esp. when the faces are computer-generated) have distinct, memorizable features unique to their images (for instance, strong cheekbones, a head like a gumdrop, triangle eyebrows, a glint in their eye when they face left, or a downward-slanted face), and those features make it so that I can remember them. It also helps that they do not have the test-taker identify the faces from angles and lighting conditions aside from what they have already shown. It is also possible that I do not have prosopagnosia and I am just extremely inattentive to my surroundings or something.\n\nWeirdly enough, I took both tests a year or so ago and got much worse results. I have many of the same issues as you irl and I recently tested above average at recognising the faces presented on the test. I think it is mainly due to the testers not actually knowing what it is they are testing for. I mean it is pretty easy to notice differences when your full concentration is focused over 5-10 minutes. The real issue is knowing who is talking to you in different situations from one week to the next. I thought i was doing okay on those tests and the results were that I did really poorly. \n\nI think the one I did tracked response time against normal individuals. So while I able to recognise Marilyn Monroe, I did so slower than most. Yeah, it is easy to remember \"faces left, well-lit, REALLY long chin\" or \"polka dot shirt collar\".  The researchers do not do a very good job with a lot of the setups. A lot of the tests do not test for the actual issue, facial recognition.  If you show a full headshot of famous people and check for recognition, you can use other clues such as a distinctive hairstyle.  If it has cropped out some of the features, but you can find a distinctive shape in the outline of the head or other features, it still does not help.\n\nI feel like a much better test would be some program that would allow you to upload pictures of people you are familiar with (close family and friends, as well as a picture of yourself).  The program would then manipulate the photos by altering the photos slightly by changing facial features, but leaving other features unchanged.  It would then show you a set of photos (all of the same person, one original and the others altered) and have you try to pick out which photo is the actual person's face.  Under the assumption that people without prosopagnosia use the actual face for recognition while people with prosopagnosia rely on other features for recognition, it should provide a much better indication as to whether or not you use the face to recognize people. I find many of them have some real issues with validity. An NT should be able to identify a face regardless of eyebrows, hair, outfit, etc. If the test was made with determining prosopagnosia in mind, none of these features would be present. If the eyebrows are still present, for me, that means I still have my coping strategy and can compensate for face blindness. Due to this, they definitely have some false negatives for prosopagnosia. Whenever I take those tests, I always score well, though I know I struggle with recognizing people. I think the people creating the tests still do not really understand how prosopagnosia works. They will take pictures of the same person with a different shirt in front of the same background, or a bad wig but the same glasses and its obvious they are the same. People with prosopagnosia are not dumb, we use multiple clues to identify people which these tests do not seem to take into consideration. I think both tests do not quite capture everything they need to. The second one I find harder (I thought I was doing really well and that it was easy, but I did awful!) and somewhat interesting, but it seems really hard to develop tests for this. I think in part because 'normal' people already can recognize the face, some researchers think they are removing more details than they actually are. \n\nMemorizing a face based solely on eyebrow shape, eye color, or a distinct nose is different than recognizing the face as a whole. At least from what I have read others do not need to rely on specific features like that for everyone they meet, and hairstyle changes do not make the person unrecognizable. I have no idea how an appropriate test would be structured though. I think that is because they are static faces. For example, I am my case, sometimes (just sometimes) I can imagine a face like a static picture but if I want to imagine that face moving that is imposible to me.\nAlso sometimes I remember the pic I have seen in a socal media but if I try to remember a real situation I had with that person I can not remember his/her face and expressions at all.", "i cant recall my parents face i recognize them when i see them in person. but when i try to remember their face is just fleshy blob on a body. it is the same with all my memories but it never bothered me cus fleshy blobs are all that i have known. after learning about this condition and my parents getting into senior citizen stages, it just makes me really sad somehow. after they pass away, i can only look at pictures to remember them.", "A face does not mean anything but you can see the face and the expressions on it.  but the face make no connection to memory's\n\n&amp;#x200B; Again face blind people can not be influenced by faces :) , they do not mean anything , \n\nso everything based on faces , like social rating , racism , authority , peer pressure is ALL defined by faces , if you are face blind you do not have these issues.\n\nAnd yes I am repeating my self again because this video explains the definition of face blindness in a very simple way..\n\nNOT being able to read emotions is NOT face blindness.\n\nits an other damage.... but not face blindness...\n\nhere some  other recent studies (\n\n   That makes a lot of generalizations, and it is kind of terrible quality as a video.

People with Proso often struggle socially because recognizing others is an important part of the socialization process -- people are slighted if you do not recognize them.\n\nRacism is prejudice based on skin color. You do not need to see someone is face to know what race they are, and that does not stop biases based on that.\n\nCan people who are completely blind experience peer pressure? It is defined through social actions, so I cannot imagine blind individuals would be immune to it.\n\n&gt; Again face blind people can not be influenced by faces :) , they do not mean anything, \n\nFrom the provided link: \"These findings support previous suggestions that DP is a heterogeneous condition\"\n\nBasically that there are variations of face blindness.

This was the first time my prosopagnosia acted up since high school, the last time it acted up was 10th grade, then again in 2018 when I saw my old friend Alex at the grocery store he had to say high to me about 5 times before I could recognize him.

Turned out I had Asperger's. Meh, watcha going to do. I decided no personally.  Partially because it is not common, so not as easy; I might if it were as simple as getting your eyes checked to see if you need glasses.  But mainly, because I did not see any real benefit.  Reasons to get diagnosis:\n\n1. Sometimes it is affirming.  When my husband was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, it explained a lot of things and helped him realize that he was doing well considering not struggling.  I am pretty sure I have prosopagnosia, but my problem is clearly with facial recognition.  I do not need someone to tell me that.\n\n2. Sometimes you get diagnosis to get treatment.  That does not apply here.\n\n3. The last reason is to get accommodations.  I do not need any currently.  I am a teacher though, and going forward I am refusing to check parent's IDs.  I cannot do it right and it is a safety issue, so I do not want to.  This is not currently part of my job, but it would not be far fetched for me to be asked to do that.  My principal would be okay with me trading it with a coworker and I am sure I can find a work around, BUT if ever I have a jerk principal and that responsibility, I would go the route of diagnosis to try to get out of it.  Or I guess if I got a bad evaluation for not recognizing someone.  Both of those are a stretch.\n\nAs a side note, I talked to my primary care physician.  She just made a note on my chart.  Not an official diagnosis, but if there is ever a problem, now I have something that I can reference back to to indicate it is a pre-existing medical issue not just something I am making up to get out of trouble.  Again, I doubt it will come up, but it was easy to do.\n\nOn the names, I have trouble with names, because I need something to anchor the name to in order to learn it, but by the time I recognize someone reliably, I am months past being able to ask for their name.  When I was subbing, I could memorize the names of 20 desks by the end of the day, most of them by lunch.  The kids attached to the desks...not so much. I actually have classic autism and its even very close to aspergers, in fact half the doctors thought I had aspergers when I went to get diagnosed. I like to think that the person who officially made the call just tossed a coin so she could be done with me. Maybe if enough people got diagnosed, it would lead to a \"critical mass\" and more effort would be put into a cure/treatment. Actually, not being able to recognize people from ID's is probably less of a safety concern than it feels like to you.  Most people have never even heard of prosopagnosia and are not going to try to use an ID that shows a picture of someone else.  What we (and everyone else, really) need is training to spot fake ID's based on missing security features or incorrect details.  \n\n(Of course, checking parents' ID's means you would now have a lot of people who expect you to recognize them and know their name and will get offended when you do not, so getting an accommodation still makes sense.) I too have extremely acute hearing (along with prosopagnosia).  I never go anywhere without foam earplugs.  I cannot tolerate the music played in stores.  At home I keep shooting earmuffs handy for watching TV with the family.  Part of the reason I left a job was the piped in Christmas music's speaker was near my desk.  To stay sane I had to listen to white noise through headphone for eight hours a day.  They would not even change to instrumentals.  It was torture. YEp, cant rember names either Man that sucks. I do not have it nearly as bad as you, I can just hear a higher range of frequencies then normal people.

All the stuff that would show I do pay attention when they talk and do care and do not think I am more important: I JUST DO NOT KNOW THEIR FACE!\n\n!Sigh! I have gotten pretty good at asking vague questions to work out who someone is. \n\n\"How is your family?\" is a good one, because they will often use names. \n\nIf they give a vague answer, \"what are you family up to today\". \n\nIf still not mentioning names but you know they have kids, \"How old\u00b4s your kids now?\" (slurred a little because you dont know if singular or plural).  \n\n\nOther angles, \"Hows your job going?\" \"Still living in the same place?\" \n\netc etc \"My kids are a a day older than they were yesterday when you asked...\"", "It is the Clarke Kent and Superman of girlfriends. The only difference is the glasses!  I think it is really funny that there is someone else on both of these subreddits \ud83d\ude02", "Do you enjoy watching movies? What is your favourite genre? I do not like watching movies, especially alone. If I watch something, it is a documentary about planes or ships, so the people do not really matter there. \nI have big issues in recognizing people after they change outfits. Except Morgan Freeman, I can always recognize Morgan Freeman somehow. But anyway, I hate superhero movies the most, I was really unable to tell that Clark Kent and Superman was the same person, I thought it were two different people lmao and every time they show any white man I am like \u201eThis is Superman yeah?\u201d. \nMy boyfriend got used to it and when we are watching a movie together he would notice the clothing changes or when people got dirty faces or different hairstyles, he would stop the movie and explain \u201eThis is the same guy who was wearing that green sweater on the beggining\u201d, \u201eYeah, this guy has a suit on but this is another guy than this John 5 mins ago, his name is Bob, it is the guy from the black car\u201d. I watch cartoon almost exclusively because characters look different from one another and I do not get confuses lol I only enjoy movies with a really fun plot like Tarantino's movies for example. If anything's too normal I will get bored and will not be able to tell the characters apart. Tarantino's movies are also really great to watch because he reuses actors There is actually a movie where the plot is about a woman with prosopagnosia.. \"Faces in the crowd\" I believe it was called.\n\nGeneral plot was woman ( MillaJojovich) witnessed a murder... but with face blindness she could recognise the murderer afterwards, and he knew this.. \n\nThe movie itself was \"ok\" but maybe of interest to the people on this subreddit..\n\nI found it super hard to watch tho! (and my prosopagnosia is just mild-to-moderate) But the movie is set up to kind of simulate face blindness for regular people! That means the had different actors that look very similar (to normal people!) plus had those different-but similar actors wear near identical clothing! Blue shirt, black pants etc...\n\nSo I was confused as hell, because its designed to confuse people without this condition!. Still, it is the only movie about face blindness I know :) and might be worth showing people you care about so they can better understand what it is like to be you... I just watched this with my boyfriend! My prosopagnosia is more mild, so I can still watch movies as long as characters have enough personality traits, clothing/makeup styles, and/or distinct voice or aspect of body; such as a large nose, the only one with brown eyes, the bald one, etc. \n\nSo we were watching the movie, and I was trying to tell him I could only tell when the characters switched by distinct features, like if one of the actor switches was a different height or had a different jaw shape. It was funny because he is just like \"what do you mean? They all are totally different!\" It is interesting just how hard it is to simulate it. \n\nAlso, I was laughing because I rely on his beard to know who he is as well, like in the movie, if I do not hear his voice or cannot see the rest of his body. He shaved one time and scared the hell out of me, by accident. ...same lol. I do not really enjoy watching movies but I watch a lot of anime. HMM I wonder why. I do not really have a favorite genre, but I prefer shows that revolve around like 2 or 3 main characters, but I can tolerate more if their ages and races vary. I have been watching a lot of 80s teen movies recently and I am confused constantly because there is always 7+ main characters who are all white people with the same fashion sense. \n\nI really prefer tv shows. Supernatural is one that I have been watching a lot lately, there is usually only ~3 main characters, and they are all different heights and have distinct hairstyles/colors. They also wear basically the same outfits every episode.", "Faceblind toddler? My niece is two and I think she could also be faceblind. She is very shy and will not approach someone unless she knows them very well, but sometimes she will act like she knows someone who looks vaguely like a family member(she happily played with a boy who was about the same age and build as her brother). She often does not recognize her grandma out of context. She is also showing signs of autism(her speech is very delayed, she is antisocial, and has sensory issues). Idk if it is too early to tell though. I think you should talk to a professional before worrying, she still has a lot of developing to do! Facial recognition can develop very inconsistently (across individuals and over time w/in the same person) definitely seek professional help in determining for sure, even if it is not face-blindness, there is a possibility something else needs addressing (eye-sight, socializing, etc...) so it is best to be sure, especially given that it may take some time/extended observation to get a better idea I got totally freaked out when I was really little because my mom changed her hair color and I lost my shit.  I dont know how old I was. She is soon to be getting speech therapy and be assessed for special needs so I guess we will mention it then I was the kid who did not recognize my teacher outside of school. \n\nI remember being at a store with my mom and being bored and ready to go. My mom was talking to a lady with a similar hairstyle and a similar coat. I went up and hugged the other lady and whined to go because I thought it was my mom, and my mom was standing right there. That was my first memory of being very embarrassed. \n\n40+ years later I first heard of facial blindness and that episode immediately came to mind, along with hundreds of other similar episodes.\n\nThe point that I am not making very well is that the kid will be fine. There is no rush to see a specialist and label the kid. When the kid is much older it might be useful to have this knowledge so the kid can better navigate life but right now is way too early. Let the kid develop more. She will develop strategies on her own for coping. Just a wild theory but have her vision checked. I had bad enough vision that I was fitted for glasses in first grade and I have often wondered if that played a role in my prospagnosia Wow. This just reminded me. I do not remember it but apparently once in a supermarket there was a man with the same hair and coat as my father and I went nuts calling him \u201cdaddy\u201d crying and stuff. Poor guy was terrified. I never connected that story. \nI think it is kind of hard to diagnose. That young. I did not know I had it until grad school.", "Could it be prosopagnosia? I have always been bad at recognizing people, but I have really noticed it last year. When we watch series with my boyfriend, I sometimes have trouble keeping up because when it is not in a particular context I may think someone is a new character although they were here from the start. For example, I kept getting confused between May Carleton and Tatiana Petrovna in Peaky Blinders because they were both \"women with short and brown hair who are involved with Tommy\", also had a lot of trouble telling apart Finn and John in the second season of the same series. It is the same when I watch a movie, if someone is not one of my favourite actors or has very distinctive features or is in a particular context/setting I get mixed between characters. I usually think of someone as \"the guy with the short blonde hair\" or \"the woman with the piercings\". I am also very bad at recognizing people in photos.\n\nThis is going to sound horribly racist but in my class (20 people) four girls are of a different ethnicity than me and except one who is a lot shorter than the others I cannot tell the other 3 apart (they often change their hairstyle so I cannot count on that). I have to look at their backpack to get who is who.\n\nHowever, I have no problem recognizing my family, friends, teachers, boyfriend or boyfriend's family. I can remember a mutual friend like \"Oh I have seen you at X or X party\". Is it a form of propagnosia? Nothing you said was horribly racist. \n\nIt could be a mild form if you are often enough troubled with faces. It definitely sounds like it could be prosopagnosia.  One thing to keep in mind is that prosopagnosia does not necessarily mean that you cannot recognize anybody, it just means that you do not use faces to recognize people.  \n\nIn the example of the girls in your class, my guess is that it has a lot more to do with the constantly changing hairstyles than the ethnicity.  The comments of using hairstyle or a backpack to recognize someone indicates that you often use non-facial features to help recognize someone, which (from what I understand) is more common in prosopagnosia.\n\nContext also plays a large role in recognition (even without prosopagnosia, from what I have heard).  If it is harder to recognize someone if they are in a setting you are not used to seeing them, or if they are wearing a hat, it definitely could be some level of prosopagnosia. I have a similar issue.  I generally remember people who I have close relationships with, had ongoing personal conversations with, worked with, etc.  However, I struggle with people who I have met in a group, have talked to only once, etc.  Part of the problem for me is I have super short gray hair, very recognizable and unique.  So people always remember me.  I feel so stupid sometimes when someone talks to me like they know me, and I have no clue who they are. I guess it could be a mild form but I am no expert.  I also struggle with telling people apart. Like I know who you are but I really struggle with \"categirizing\" people into races (i hope it does not sound racist) like everyone looks the same to me despite being differnt races or ethical backgrounds.", "What Is the process of getting a diagnosis like? I want to tell my work about my face blindness but dont think I will be taken seriously without a diagnosis. I kind of mentiond it in my supervision but my manaager looked at me like I had two heads so I quickly changed topics lol. If I had a doctors note explaining it I think it would really help.\n\nI was just wondering those that have been diagnosed what was the process like? How long did it take and did you find that people where more understanding? I have not being officially diagnosed, so I cannot answer most of your questions.  I did once participate in a research study, so I printed off those results.  I did bring them when I was talking to my supervisor about it.  I think she would have already have been understanding and supportive, but I felt more confident handing her something more official indicating that I was not making this up.  I figure if they ever do something like make me check IDs (I am a teacher - and I really cannot recognize parents by ID) I will get an official diagnosis, but meanwhile there is not a benefit to me.  I also talked to my regular doctor (again bringing study results) and she actually added it to my medical chart based on that, which I think might be helpful in the incredibly unlikely event I need to show that it is something that has been an issue for awhile.\n\nUnless you are asking for certain accommodations, you generally are not expected to bring test results to prove things to work, so I think some of it is how you approach it.  Instead of saying it casually, I would sit down with your supervisor and say you want to let her know about a health condition in case it ever ends up impacting your work.  I would practice giving a brief but clear explanation of face blindness and have some resources for her to learn more if they want to.  Then I would finish with some specific examples of where you might struggle at your work and things they could do to help.  BUT you really have to know the culture.  Is your manager generally supportive or likely to be a jerk about it? It might not be a diagnosis, but I have found the best way to describe it to people is that it is like \"seeing 50 golden retrievers in a group, you can tell there is differences between them, but unless you were very familiar with the dog you would not be able to pick one out and identify them from the crowd, it is just like that but with peoples faces\". Be sure to tell them that you are not legally blind, just that you have facial recognition issues, and use other things to identify people such as voice, walk, etc. Be sure to not make a big deal out of it, it is just a different way of processing the world. Not the OP, but this is a great analogy. I will definitely be using this \ud83d\ude0a This is perfect My brother is a doctor (PhD not MD) and he is pretty skeptical of people who self diagnose. When I told him I thought I had prosopagnosia but had not been officially tested, he said that is something that is pretty self-diagnosable. That surprised me since he is usually pretty uptight about stuff like that. \n\nI did later end up doing two of the online studies, and they both came out pretty conclusively with the same results. I feel like that is a good enough diagnosis for this. Haha I love the analogy, I will definitely be using this when I explain it to my boss, thank you :) Thank you so much for this, I think that you are right. Im going to have a sit down with the owner and manager and explain the situation to them. I know the owner will be supportive just not to sure if the manager will believe me without proof, guess I will have to give it a go and find out. \n\nI work in a nursery and often have to open the door to parents/carers. I always avoid this if I can but our rule is if you next to the door you open it so I try and stay away lol but that rule doesnt work when there is only me in the room. There is only so many times I can ask the parents/carers for the password before they start to get annoyed at me. Thank you for your reply, I think I might do the online studies, print of the results and show her them when I explain it. Hopfully that will be proof enough like as you say its pretty self diagnosable. I have worked day cares before and parent pick-ups are terrifying to me.  It is rude not to remember people, but I cannot help it!  I have done crazy things to get coworkers to do pick-ups.  I just did not know what was going on before, so did not know that A.) It was not like that for everyone, and B.) It is reasonable for me to advocate for myself.   At my current job, I just drop kids off in an area, so that is fine for now, but I am definitely going to try to find another way if that changes. You can try the Cambridge Facial Recognition test. \n\n(", "Women with prosopagnosia, do you wear makeup?  I have no interest in makeup, and I am wondering if that is just a 'me' thing or if it is a common 'side effect' of prosopagnosia for women. \n\nDo you...\n\n( I am colorblind, so makeup just scares me in general. I work in tech and without any customer or client interactions, so I am lucky that there is no social expectation for me to wear makeup day-to-day. That is a super interesting question.  I have fairly stereotypically girly tastes, but never have gotten into make-up and never really thought about why.  I usually just put on mascara if I am going to wear any (which is rarely - mascara is pretty much one use before you need to toss it.)  Two exceptions:\n\nMy best friend who does hair and make-up professionally did my make-up for my wedding.  I really liked how it looked (but way too much fuss for every day!) because she knows me, and you could barely tell I was wearing make-up at all.  I was wearing foundation and everything (because she said it looks more natural in pictures because you do not get weird glares or blotchy bits as much) but it was matched exactly to my normal skin tone, the lip color was my normal lip color, and the eye shadow stuff was barely different than normal.  The mascara was the only thing noticeable - my eyelashes are long, but have light tips.  I had an expensive manicure (clear polish on my hands, very light pink on my feet) too.  So basically a lot of time and money was spent making me look pretty much like I normally do and that was how I wanted to look on the most dressed-up day probably of my life.\n\nThe same friend did my hair and make-up for her wedding.  That time she made me look how she wanted (with my approval.)  Honestly, I looked gorgeous, but I was kind of uncomfortable and I think it was because I did not really recognize myself.  She did not put that much on me that time (it did not feel yucky on my face or anything,) but she did not something that made my eyes look bigger and minimized my large nose.  I never realized why I did not like it until now.  I thought it was me being anti-conformist or not wanting to go to the trouble because I have more important things, I guess, but I am pretty sure now it was that I did not look like me, which is definitely not as interesting of a reason for being anti-make-Mo-look-hot.\n\nI wonder if people with proso typically change their hair styles often?  I have the same hair style I have had since I was five minus updating it slightly so I do not look like I am in the 90s, so that would be a no for me.  It would never occur to me to change it and I  think it is weird when people suggest it. I do not wear makeup because I cannot stand the feeling of it on my face. Also I hate the societal pressure for girls to wear makeup. But I *also* do not like seeing it on other people, which is definitely in part because of it screwing with my face blindness. Wow this is really interesting you have asked this. I basically never wear it. I selected special occasions - this includes a touch of BB cream when I have a spot! Otherwise even though I put on mascara for a wedding i literally do not even know how to use makeup. I have never been interested.\n\nI wonder how these responses fair compared to the general population? It seems unusual, right? If I am working in person I wear it every day. \nFor me, it is part of my professional look. -I also recognize that this is not for everybody, which is totally legit. \nI also really enjoy putting on makeup,  I just hate taking it off. I hate makeup, because it makes me look like \"not me\", which I guess is the point?\n\nI do wear it for special events, but I try really hard to make it as subtle as possible. I wear makeup because I get pretty regular breakouts and I like to have them covered. I rarely bother with eyeliner, mascara, or even eye shadow. I just like to even out my skin tone a bit. I do not think it has much to do with prosopagnosia either way, though. used to be frequently when I worked in the office. \n\nI do not have a good mental image of what I usually look like when I close my eyes and try to recall from memory, but I DO have a \"composite\" idea of what I look like in the mirror when I am looking my best, and what features are considered beautiful for my time period and culture. Putting on make up involves staring directly into the mirror, and using paints/tools to bring that image closer to cultural ideals, so it does not involve direct memory recall of a particular face. \n\nIt is like, you can still tell when your painting of a tree looks like the real thing, even if you cannot recall the exact shape of leaves this tree has or the precise shade of green or whether the leaves are alternate or opposite. You can tell if drawing A is a better tree drawing than drawing B even if they are fantasy trees, because you have a mental composite image of what a tree looks like. \n\nputting on make up is an act of recognition, not recall, so my condition does not affect it. that is very interesting experience with your make up artist friend. :D \n\nI always chalked my keeping the same hairstyle as \"laziness\" and \"stinginess\", but maybe it also has to do with the strangeness of change as well. \"what is your skin care routine, your skin is beautiful!\"\n\nperson with ADHD: years of neglect, I guess? I used to, but I am too sick and tired these days I am a guy, but I really enjoy makeup, especially very goth or very vibrant. It helps me form an emotional connection between who I am and my face I have had the same hairstyle (long, straight hair) ever since I cut it short at 6 to match my mom (she would had it cut short for surgery) and *hated it*.  I am far more attached to my hair than to my face.  Especially compared to other people; \"Why do not you cut your hair?\" \"I do not know. Why do not you get a nose ring?\" Skin tone can sometimes help me recognize people, so I can see where that would be part of your self-image. I am a little boyish for a girl. I do not see the point of makeup, especially on me. I do not even know what I look like, so I am sure it does not matter. I can take a person for an other even though one of them is black and the other white...\nso, for me color of skin does not help me recognize people.\n\nand I do not recognize myself in the mirror, so make up or not changes anything for me...

Oh, Patrick Stewart.\n\nInteresting enough, the list is the same for my son. I think it is partly because of their distinctive voices, so maybe it is cheating :)  I watched Django Unchained and thought Leonardo DiCaprio was Brad Pitt.

The only talk show host I really recognise is Colbert I mix Colbert with them too sometimes but the glasses help, the one I never mix is James Corden For the longest time, Anthony Hopkins and Jack Nicholson were the same person. I only told them apart by their voice. Anthony Hopkins has pretty light eyes, so that helps distinguish them sometimes. Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, James Gyllenhaal, Jake Krasinski Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. They are forever the same person in my mind and I cannot separate them. Brad Pitt has such a neutral face. He and Tom cruise are the same person in my mind. Is not Kimmel the ugly, shrek-like one? Colbert bas the jaw line of Superman. That is how I recognize him. All the Ryan\u2019s. Gosling. Reynolds.

There is about 20 year round employees in my government office and most of them are not coming in since the plague started. I have Aphantasia and Prosopagnosia is a symptom of that. I told people when I first started about my face blindness issues but they are not so extreme that I did not eventually learn everyone is name after about six months (mostly by voice). \n\nThat was a couple of years ago. Now I keep having these terrible conversations because 1. they are coming in intermittently 2. they are often wearing civilian clothes instead of their uniforms 3. They are wearing masks. All this adds up to having to ask people I have known for years what their name is. \n\nAlso our building is locked up and I am one of the few here every day. So I go up to the door and I am asking them who they are before I let them in.\n\nI have gotten a few offended huffs and a lot of side eye so far. Really?  I have found masks have no effect whatsoever on my recognition of people (or lack thereof).  \n\nAnd I think it is because I stopped looking at faces ages ago...there is no useful info there for me, so I have not bothered in a long time. For me I can recognize people by hair, so as long as they have their mask on and are where I normally see them (work, store etc) then I am OK.\n\nThat said, there is a few new people and it really really messes with me if they pull the mask down.  It is like I cannot associate the top of their face with the bottom.  It is so weird. For me it depends on the person.

I wonder if we face blinds, are faster to Guess Who board game than others, as we use to look at these details to recognise people, and not others I hope this is not too intrusive of a question, but as a non-proso person- are cartoon faces still hard? Or only real life/incredibly realistic faces affected? Might explain why I am weirdly good at this game. It is all context clues! Now try a version of the game where all the faces are very nearly identical and you only get to see one at a time, with no names. :) Cartoon faces are easy to distinguish for most of us. They never change. They always have the same coloring, hair style, outfit/accessories. Face blind children usually prefer cartoons over live actors. (Although I am pretty sure that applies to all children.) I have tried to keep all my social circles separate for this very purpose. When I run into someone who knows me, just a few questions about so-and-so or some other mutual touchpoint like workplace, or school, can help me narrow things down.\n\nThe real problem arises when I see someone I am sure I know from my past.

That is why I am always super friendly to everyone regardless, like, we are probably friends, right? o.O hahaha Friendliness is always a good fallback! I have always preferred anime to live action things, since in anime, characters' hair, face shape, eyes, everything is different. When I watched Downton Abbey, for the entirety of the first season I thought the three sisters were the same person since I could not tell them apart by face. People in cartoons are designed to be recognizable. You know the \"main character\" joke of a kid being born with some crazy colored hair? I would love that in real life-but typically they change crazy colors on me if they do it.\n\nWhat you might find interesting is the background characters in like a schoolyard anime will all have the same hair/color/face and be designed to be ignored en mass. For a reversal, it is kind like us expecting you to recognize one of them from one episode to the next. \"Woah you see the extra by the tree? Same dude was in 7 episodes! How did you not notice!\"", "Being able to recognise faces has always felt like a superpower to me I have always been really impressed by people who recognise people's faces, especially after a period of time. Somewhere along the line I realised that it is not much of a problem for most people, and yet I still have this same view. Seeing my dad be able to recognize famous golfers in their childhood photos has me gasping Honestly, working in business has made be even more envious of people's facial recognition abilities. What I would do to be able to recognize clients and network properly. In action movies where the protagonist ends up 'wanted'  and their face is plastered all over the media I would always assume anyone actually recognizing them was some sort of plot contrivance unless they literally had the newspaper or whatever in front of them. I mean, it is not like people could actually *remember* a face they saw on TV an hour ago. That is just a crazy Hollywood thing. Imagine my surprise when I found out normal people can do this. Yeah, I do not understand the point of wanted photos.  I do not think I would recognize the person wanted if they were holding up their wanted poster next to their face.  (I mean, yeah, I would see similarities.  But I would not be sure.) No kidding.  I coordinated weddings for awhile to earn some extra cash.  I am really, really good at it, but I stopped because doing the people guessing game is way to hard, especially remembering former clients at referral weddings.  (Fortunately most of the wedding party wears special costumes to help you identify them.)  It just was super stressful.", "Cheers! I just remembered that \"Cheers\" was my favorite sitcom as a small child (preschool &amp; elementary).

I will go hunting and come back with it if I find it.", "Prosopagnosia vs Prosopamnesia vs Super-Recognition ? ", "Can face blindness develop over time? Hey you all! In August of last year, I got a new job where I meet with students a year or two younger than me to tutor them in science courses. Even with students who have appointments every week, i always have to ask a coworker to point the person out to me in the study hall. For the most part, I remember those close to me (family and friends), but this job has been a real challenge because there are so many unfamiliar people that are really hard to recognize. While I am happy to have a label for what im experiencing, I have never really had problems with prosopagnosia until this new job. Is it possible to develop this condition later in life, or did I just not notice it as much before? You can \"come down with\" face blindness, but it would be as a result of a specific event that caused damage to your brain. If you are not aware of having hurt your brain, you probably did not develop prosopagnosia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might just be having trouble remembering so many people. But I will say (and disclaimer here, I do not have prosopagnosia myself) that I have noticed sometimes people who have it seem to struggle with coming to the realization. They think, \"Well, I am usually able to recognize people,\" but what they mean is that through a lot of effort and putting together clues from context and hair and clothes, etc., they usually manage to identify people they know. But that is not what non-face-blind people do. When the face module/software/whatever it is in the brain works right, for the most part you just recognize people at a glance, easily, without thinking about it. So if you are going around \"figuring out\" who people are rather than identifying them at a glance, then yeah, you probably have face blindness. Thanks for your input! The way you describe it makes sense, I often find myself identifying people by haircut or the clothes they are wearing. I cannot believe it took me 21 years to figure this out lol It is super normal not to realize it at an early age! Nobody tells you about it, unless you take psychology or something. Hope knowing it is a thing helps you out. I did not realise I had a problem until I was in my early 20s. Prosopagnosia is a spectrum. Perhaps you are on the mild end.\n\nPerhaps the methods you have unconsciously developed to compensate do not work in this environment. I, personally, recognize voices more than faces. In the environment you describe you need to identify the person prior to hearing their voice. Just a guess. I have always heard of people developing it late in their life suffering an injury or something.  Basically something physically happened to their brain to make it not work right anymore.\n\nI suspect it is just you have a new job that is different, and you did not notice it before.  In some environments it is no problem for me, and some it is very severe.  I can recognize close family and friends too, but when I think about it I am recognize them by feature not just knowing their whole face.  Face blindness is a spectrum also. I did not figure out I was face blind until I was nearly 50. I always knew that I was not 'getting' something that everyone else did, but assumed it was due to not paying attention or not trying hard enough. The revelation came when I read a magazine article that mentioned face blindness and I realised it had a name.", "Cannot keep track of movie characters and often think one person looks like another celebrity. Is this part of face blindness or just bad memory? I have only recently noticed this getting worse but I guess I have always delt with it to a degree. FWIW I am 22 and suffer from some mental health issues and chronic pain/fatigue which never helps memory. I do not have a good memory for most things anyway but faces in media are particularly hard.\n\nI have a few distinct examples:\n\n1. This week my friend was making me watch Austin Powers for the first time. When they first introduced the leading lady I exclaimed \"oh it is the mum from spy kids!\" apparently it is not her and upon looking up the actress on Google I could not see a resemblance to the character at all despite being told it is the same person. Also did not know Mike Meyers played Dr Evil.\n\n2. I did not know there was not 2 different guys in Hollywood named Gary Oldman. It is the same guy in Harry potter and Batman. And ironically i did not realise Tom Hardy was also in Batman and Inception which I considered one of my favourite movies. \n\n4. Watching Pacific Rim for the first time I thought all the white male mech pilots were clones. Not just related but actual clones. And then when I looked up the cast I saw it was all different actors. Except the Asian triplets were actually triplets which did not help my case.\n\n5. Watching zodiac I thought one of the minor characters was Scarlett Johansson so I was like \"oh is she in this movie too?\" And it was just some other lady with a mole, blonde hair, and a pointy chin.\n\n6. Watching Snowtown today I had an extremely difficult time telling the background characters (aka victims) apart. It was very very confusing.\n\nI also have this in person sometimes with a lot of \"nice to meet you\" \"we actually have met before\" but that is pretty rare.\n\nAnd im not sure if it could be related but I struggle with telling what different accents are and also telling simar accents apart like generic American and Canadian. I did not even know Canadians had different accents and I am kind of not convinced they do.\n\nAnyway i think these small anecdotes are not necessarily a good representation of me because it does not happen all the time. I can sometimes recognise actors very easily and I generally have more trouble with it in media than in real life. And I am worried it is happening more because I am aware of it more? \n\nBut is this typical signs of face blindness? And should I bring it up with my new psychiatrist because it is seemingly getting worse? Well, I am here for the same reason because I have the same troubles and I genuinely just suck at recognizing actors in movies and series. In real life I have definitely had some few moments where I have had trouble recognizing someone I have met before like you already mentioned. I guess I have the thing with accents too, but it is probably because I live in Europe and I am not as familiar with the different English accents as someone who lives in the US or Canada or UK and so on.\n\nWell, I also sometimes (kinds often) forget the name of the face even tho I may recognize (or THINK that I recognize because often it is not the same person lmao) the person. All I wanted to say was just that you are not alone and I have the same struggles and I have no idea if it is face blindness either so that is why I am here. I also cannot recognize actors based on IMDb images. It is super annoying! I like the new amazon feature where they tell you who is on screen at any given time. That pretty much sums up my tv viewing experience.\n\n I quit watching tv 25 years ago. My usual is to watch a movie then look up the cast to see who I should have recognised. Always some surprises! I rarely recognise actors out of context unless they have distinct voices like Tom Hanks. I am so glad it is not just me. Watching movies can be terrible sometimes. there are a few reasons behind this, one of the major ones is that Hollywood loves to hire actors that basically have the same build and look so even without face blindness it is pretty hard to tell them apart, and with it you are basically screwed every knowing which actor is playing in the movie without being told \n\nas for your psychiatrist, ya i would bring it up with them since they might know some tricks to help you out or even help you narrow down what the cause is. as a rule of thump is you ask your self \"should i ask my psychiatrist about this?\" the answer is yes 99% of the time and the 1% of the time is a margin of error Yep, movie issue is classic face blindness - although there certainly can be more than one cause of face blindness.  If you are already seeing a psychiatrist, I would definitely bring it up.  Getting worse does not sound like what I have typically hard for prosopagnosia. I stopped watching movies like 14 years ago :( Agreed, getting worse does not sound typical. Hopefully OP is just noticing it more. Def bring up to psych.\n\nI did not realize it until I was in my mid twenties. When I asked a coworker why she changed her outfit. Lol. For 6 months I thought two people woman were one person. I cannot tell you the amount of times I have thought two people were one person or one person was two people.  Looking back some of them are really crazy, like two college friends with totally different personalities and styles.  I like them both, but they are much easier to connect to when they are two people not one.", "This meme hurts my brain ", "Any writers here? I have been writing as a hobby for a few years and one critique I have consistently gotten is that I do not describe faces. I will briefly mention their hair and any defining features, if they have them- anything I would normally use to recognise people. I am realising that perhaps part of the reason I am lacking in more detailed descriptions is because I do not really see further than that.\n\nI was just curious if anybody else here had tried writing and noticed this- or maybe some people over explain details as an attempt to compensate? Definitely do this too. Something what helps is to base them off of pictures I find of actors or models that fit what I imagine my character might look like. Blend them together and you can just pick out the face they might have. Much easier that way since I can just look at the model\u2019s face and say \u201ccrooked nose, sad eyes.\u201d I always pick the model that expresses the attitude or emotion I feel my character having so it fits better.  I would not worry too much about that, I think it is more of a personal preference for readers than anything. I do not care to read long descriptions of the looks of people so neither do I care to write them. A lot of great books do it like you said - just mention some defining features. I personally want to bang my head against the wall wherever a book starts going on about someone is 'almond shaped eyes the colour of emeralds'  and their 'rose-coloured pouty lips'... Ahaha yeah I do the same thing. Boggles my mind that people have an issue when a writer *does not* describe a character\u2019s face. I have only written fanfic but I tend to just describe people's expressions and hair color. I do screenwriting as a hobby. It does not really matter as much in screenwriting as long as I write about any scars or defining features. It also helps to write a little about their fashion sense (prim and proper, baggy clothes, a size too small, etc.). Giving a sense of who the person is and letting the reader fill everything else in for themselves.\n\nI also found that as long as the characterization is good, people do not seem to mind leaving out details about what characters look like. There are authors who take pride in never describing what their characters look like. I always thought that was weird, but realized I usually went way overboard describing someone is appearance. I do not really think it is that important, unless it actually is important to the character or plot (Zuko's scar). Words are used to invoke imagination in the reader, so I think the basics of description are important, but there is no use in over-describing. I have gotten upset way too many times due to a writer spending half a page or more on someone is dress or face. Or room.", "I have seen five former 'classmates' recently I put 'classmates' in quotes, because I am not entirely sure it was them.

A rather rubbish party, but still.... It is shopped. Same guy, same haircut, same watch, same outfit. No, they are all wearing the same thing and have the same physical build. I assume they are all the same guy.

I eventually cut him off, but we run in related social circles and so there is a chance we will interact again.\n\nMonths after breaking contact, I joined a dance class.

After than, I accepted that Bruce was almost certainly not Al.\n\nSo, anyone else confidently misidentify people? ", "Tips for helping my son with race Hi! I am not face blind, but my husband and one of my kids are. My question is about my son, who is 9. I feel like we have done a good job educating him about his face blindness and helping him figure out strategies, and overall it has been a pretty minor obstacle for him. However, the one thing I am worrying about is that he does not \"see\" or really understand race at all. I live in a very multicultural area, which actually makes it more confusing because a lot of his friends are of mixed racial heritage. So I cannot just be like \"Look, those people are black. Those people are Asian. And those people are white.\" \n\nI have done a lot to educate him about slavery and the historical fallout from that, and about current racial discrimination, so he understands these things intellectually. However, I did not realize for a while that he thought HE was black! We are basically white but both he and I have an 'olive' or more 'tan' skin tone so he thought this meant the two of us were black. \n\nWe got past that and I thought he had sort of gained a better understanding, but then the other day we had an incident that made me realize he is still not able to see it at all. We were at the park and a sketchy guy, probably homeless, stopped to harass me. When he left my son came over and asked if \"that was, you know, one of THOSE guys,\" meaning guys who harass women. I said yes. He then said, \"I have noticed that most of the guys who do that are, you know, black people?\" My knee jerk reaction was to be like, omg my kid is making this vast racial generalization, I have to address this - but then I said, \"Wait. Do you think that the guy who just talked to me was BLACK?\" And he said yes. The guy was 100% white, just sunburned/tan from being outside often. Like he even had straight blond hair. \n\nSo, like, I do not even know where to START with this. I have tried asking for advice in online parenting groups but whenever I say that my kid is \"race blind\" I get angry people calling me out for being bigoted. Or something. Nobody believes it is a real thing. But I am worried that it is going to get my kid in big trouble if he makes a mistake with people who do not know him well. There are different ways to think about race.  Teaching them to your kid might be like different ways to approach math (like fractions, percents, decimals).   One of them I learned from my Spanish professor, whose delineations were \"hair that moves in the wind\" and \"hair that does not move in the wind\".   You could also look into the human diaspora, talk about where we evolved, which other hominids we mated with along our path across the continents, or even what kind of origin myths different populations of humans developed. I am face blind and I frequently cannot tell what race people belong to. I am not sure whether this is a related condition or if there is a name for it. For example, it came as a complete surprise to me when I learned that Meghan Markle was not white. I also frequently cannot tell Arabic people apart from white people or confuse Asians and Turkish people.  \n\n\nBut honestly, it has never been a problem. I live in the UK and it may be different in the US but I do not think be confused about races is a big problem. What kind of situation are you worried about? My facial blindness is on the milder side but I also thought Meghan was a white lady until people starting a fuss online. I looked at photos and realized she was probably mixed race but that was only after I scrutinized. I never really considered this even though I have mild facial blindness myself. I can identify race or at least approximate as well as most people (I can tell someone is Asian but not their specific heritage without other clues, as an example). However with people I do not know like a server I cannot tell which waitress we had if they all dress similarly, wear a ponytail with similar hair color,  and have similar toned skin. So for me it is like my brain sees and immediately discards the data. I have to meet someone a few times to remember them but even close friends can trick me with a sudden makeover. \n\nYou may already have done this but I would ask your husband for how he copes. My guess is he has the most similar experience as your son. And otherwise it depends on the severity (not sure if that is the proper way to say that?)   since I know some facial blind people cannot even notice details like a nose or eyes at all. If your son notices skin tone I would guess he can at least learn some possible clues like hair texture, height, or different accents. If he is able to see features like nose and eyes after some scrutiny or in still photos then maybe you could use popular actors as examples? \n\nOf course even for people who completely \"see\" faces there are times when assumptions are incorrect. So I would suggest that your son never vocalize his assumptions about race in a group that is not very close family or friends. That is a good rule for really anyone anyway since it is not polite. Also as you mentioned,  it can seem bigoted to be discussing a person's race (if they have not chosen to discuss that topic themselves). I have the same problem.  I honestly do not know what to tell you to do. There is one thing I will say -- at least you know now, when he is young.  I was an adult by the time I realized I was having problems with remembering what race people were. \n\nI have a few friends I trust and sometimes I quietly ask them if I am remembering another person's race correctly. \n\nAs for the people who are calling you a bigot, throw it back at them. Tell them your son has a real condition called prosopagnosia (provide a link) and ask them what is wrong with them that they can attack a child with a condition, that they can attack a mother trying to help her child with his condition. Tell them you are disgusted by their ignorance and prejudice. Well, at this point the main thing I am worried about is that he is going to say something unintentionally racist to one of his classmates and really hurt someone is feelings. As white people in America I feel like we have a definite responsibility to educate our kids about this stuff and make sure we are being inclusive and listening. But kids make really wrong assumptions sometimes because they just do not have a complete understanding (like him thinking we are black without me even realizing it! lol) and I would hate for him to be like \"Well black people harass white people\" (based on his perceived experience) or something like that, before I can catch it. I dunno, I guess it would be a learning experience for him but I do not want him to have to do his learning at the expense of other kids of color who have to deal with everyday racism anyway. Someone else suggested just having a blanket policy of not discussing race outside of our family and maybe that would be the smartest thing to do at this point. I think having a blanket policy of not discussing it outside of family is actually a pretty good idea at this point, thank you. I am thinking I will just tell him, look, if you have questions, PLEASE save them for me and just try not to talk about it with others. \n\nWhile my husband is moderately face blind, race is actually not something he has an issue with. Ironically I am the one who (while not at all face blind) has issues identifying people's race! Poor kid has it from both sides. My husband did not know he was face blind AT ALL until he was an adult. His brain was totally manufacturing \"reasons\" for why groups of people in uniform freak him out and why every time I changed something about my appearance, he hated it! We finally realized what was going on when we were watching the show Orphan Black and he could not tell when a new character was supposed to be a clone of the protagonist or not! Since then he is been slowly unpacking this stuff, which is why we were able to spot it in our kid and deal with it early, thank goodness. Wait, there are people whose hair does not move in the wind? TIL. Anyway, this is actually the sort of tactic we have taken so far, but it is really hard for him to grasp the vastness of time, and occasionally he will attempt to apply the historic \"this is where people who look like this come from\" to our current time period and of course that is not accurate at all. I am hoping teaching him about this stuff intellectually plus making him aware of his deficits will help him deal with this best, buuuuut he is still a kid who often comes up with wacky ideas about stuff! I am not trying to be judgmental, but you seem very fixated on getting him to identify by race. \n\nMaybe just tell him that you cannot make assumptions about anyone based on how they look. Many people have different backgrounds, and it is rude to assume ANYTHING because of how you think they look. \n\nYou should not assume they are adopted, or one is the nanny, or he will hate x because he is y... \n\nAll your examples are of him making generalizations, and you are concerned about him making accurate generalizations instead of no generalizations. \n\nIf he learns not to make those kinds of assumptions, he will never be in an awkward situation where he is wrong. I did not know I was face blind until I was an adult either.  \n\nIt is so weird. Could you tell me what I said that made you think I am fixated on getting him to identify by race? I did not mean to come off that way so I am sorry. I definitely call him out on generalizations and make a point of giving him alternate examples to show that his generalizations are false. I do not know if you have kids but I have found that as soon as mine entered gradeschool they started coming home with all of these broad, sweeping pronouncements. For example, \"All teachers are girls.\" (Which is funny because my son also could not tell the difference between men and women until he was about 7, and I definitely do a lot of things that are not stereotypically feminine.) Him generalizing about race is definitely something I want to avoid and I am trying to teach him how it is not true, but it is hard to know how to teach him when I did not even realize that he literally thinks anyone with a tan is a black person. How do I prevent him from developing something like the idea that \"all guys who harass women are black\" when that is literally what he is seeing - albeit completely inaccurate? I figured if I could help him better recognize race he could see that all sorts of different people are doing different things. But maybe I am wrong. The brain is absolutely fascinating. Aww I get that a bit.  Autism (Aspergers) runs in my family but only my same aged cousin has face blindness issues. And I think I am the only one who gets lost very easily, even with a GPS sometimes. \n\nI used to feel like I was \"stupid\" for those issues but I have been able to accept that it is just areas where I have to plan ahead a bit more to cope. And I also found other areas where I excel over friends and family. \n\nSo if your son becomes frustrated with his face blindness try to remind him of other skills he has. It is like some quote I have read about not judging a fish on its ability to climb a tree. We can identify people\u2019s race as easily as an average person. We have difficulty recalling race of people we have met.\n\nI think you are confusing the kid with all your politicaly correct nonsense. People are people. You are training your kid to notice, discriminate, and be a rascist.\n\nI have witnessed a crime, called the police, and could not tell the dispatcher the race of the people involved. I reverted back to the meme mentality of describing hair and clothing. If I had been on the phone with the police as the crime was occurring I most definitely could have given their race at that point in time.\n\nA) educate yourself more on prosopagnotia, and realize that your kid will be fine if you never bring it up again.\n\nB) stop categorizing people by race in front of your kid. While you wrestle with this, you may find it useful to read up on anthropological understandings of the \"race\" concept: the definitions/categories your son is struggling with are very culturally and historically specific, as race has been defined in totally different ways from one era to another and one region to another.   In other words, he is kind of right!   He is having trouble learning rules that are much more arbitrary than people tend to realize, and if those rules do not seem obvious to him, well, he is got a good point! \n\"The American Anthropological Association Statement on Race\" gives a very good overview, but if that is a bit too dry or academic, you might look for a documentary called \"Race: the Power of an Illusion.\" It is older (2003),but still a great resource for thinking about  where modern, western racial categories come from, how they have changed, what they do and do not mean, etc. \n\nAnd in the meantime, even if he never quite comes to grips with it, at least \"treat everyone with respect regardless of race\" tends to be a good policy for absolutely anybody! I really agree with joy090. Teach him that saying things like \"all of those people are x\" is always wrong. Explain why it is wrong. \n\nTeach him that it does not matter what people look like, their actions have nothing to do with their looks. \n\nTrying to teach him what race every stranger on the street is just inaccurate. And impossible. Maybe you could get him to watch shows and movies with an all-black cast, an all-japanese cast, everything he struggles with. It will show him how different from each other and how normal-human each individual is.\n\nHe might just have to learn the hard way that what he is saying is offensive and wrong, and if someone other than you corrects him he might learn it. Until then, at least let him know he has no ability to identify race and he should not talk about it because he will hurt people's feelings. When she was first coming into the public eye Meghan Markle tried to look more white. Everyone sometimes wonders what a given person\u2019s heritage is. This, could obviously differentiate skin color when I was younger but still had a hard time understanding \"race\" up until middle school.\n\nAnd a lot of racial designations are still rooted in physiognomy and facial features like (eyelids, nose size, lip size, nose shape, etc.)", "Wait, so I am not just a shitty inattentive person with a stupid brain? I am literally crying from finding this page. I have wondered for so long what is wrong with me. So much shame and embarrassment and frustration because I cannot recognize people I just met/spent time with and recalling faces is extremely extremely difficult, unless I have known the long while.\n\nI once had to work with a sketch artist to identify my attacker whom I would spent hours with before things went south. As you all can imagine, that was pure hell. I almost had him sketch my acquaintance because my brain was merging their faces. And the more I tried to see my attackers face in my mind, the more his face began to smudge and blank out.  Once I just kept recalling a head with no facial features I gave up and cried myself to sleep. \n\nI have mixed emotions. Happy that there is potentially an answer and explanation for this issue. Sad that once again there is something wrong with my brain. I already deal with other memory affecting mental disorders. Anyway, hi. Thanks for existing.  I do not know if it is the good word but welcome among us.\n\nfor me too, it is impossible to describe a face because I cannot picture faces in my mind even my children or my close family and friends...\nand as you said the more I try to remember faces the less I see them. \n\nsometimes I can visualize photos but when I try to see in details, it is fading away...\n\nyou spoke of other disorders, what are they ?\nI have too : alexithymia, cyclothymia, kind of ptsd/cptsd. And I saw that proso and Alex could come from the same part of the brain. my psychiatrist wants me to see a neurologist to try to find out if it is a lead to follow...\n Thanks for the welcome :]\n\nYes. Exactly what you are saying. The details fade away. \n\nI have bipolar, cptsd, osdd, &amp; adhd. So many letters haha. I see a lot of people here have alex too I asked myself about adhd but I do not really know what it is. and despite all the issues I had since I was a kid, my parents never care about it preferring saying that all was in my head and that I had nothing...\n\nwhat I am sure of is that I have big difficulties with staying focused on one task at a time, and the lesser little thing can distract me from what I am doing. For example I have to put music when I drive to stay focus on the road, without I do not stay concentrate on  driving...\ncould this be kind of adhd... ?\n I also had to do a sketch artist (and police lineup) once upon a time and failed miserably. Learning about prosopagnodia was revelatory. Welcome! Doing a sketch artist or lineup is my nightmare. Sorry you had to go through that after dealing with an assault! Thanks I appreciate that a lot &lt;3 That does sound like adhd! That is how my sister describes it. I am not confident my adhd diagnosis is correct. For me, music in the car does not help me focus, sometimes it distracts me, but mostly I stop focusing on both the road and the music and kind of go autopilot. I think that is just dissociation. I can relate to doing all these diff things but not everything \n\nAnywho, yes it does sound like it lol These \"Aha! Stories\" like yours always warm my heart a little.  It feels a little better to know the name for it, even if there is not much we can do in a practical sense. Wow, I remember this feeling!  I completely relate with the shame, embarrassment and frustration...just feeling dumb and inferior.  Like I was so dumb I could not keep track of people and I was always covering up that secret.  Look at it this way, brains are weird.  Human biology is unique and in some ways unfathomable.  So your brain works differently, big deal.  They probably all work differently.  Ours just happen to not bother with faces.  Now look at everything you have accomplished in life working around that.  When you actually examine it, it seems impossible.  But you do it every day, and you have been so good at it that only know are you finding out that you are working at a disadvantage.  That is amazing.   &lt;3 Wow. Thank you for saying that. That is such a positive and powerful way to see this.  Welcome! You have found your people! I remember having such a huge sense of relief when I found out there was a name for this problem. I always thought I was stupid and inattentive too. So many people in my life have complained about running into me in public and having me not notice them. I live in a very small town so this happens all the time. They think I am being rude or self absorbed. Now that I understand it is just my brain. And I have managed to work my way around it my whole life! \n\nI find that now my embarrassing uncomfortable moments have become funny to me now. For example my fianc\u00e9 was scrolling through some pictures on his phone. There was a pretty woman in the picture with him and I got a little he jealous and asked how he knew her. He asked if I was kidding and then started gut laughing. It was me... I did not recognize myself because the lighting made my hair look dark. But my tattoo I recognize.\n\nI hope you can be easy on yourself now and not beat yourself up. If anything this makes you interesting! I have never explained this problem to anyone and have them respond with anything other than fascination.\n\nHow did you find out you were face blind? Haha thank you I appreciate this comment :)\n\nWell I would asked the adhd community and the DID/OSDD community if they had this issue and they did not relate, so I googled and found facial blindness but when I read what I found none of it sounded like me. I always recognize myself, I do not struggle spotting family and close friends, etc. Well, associative proso fits me. \n\nI am not sure when I first noticed the issue. But of what I can remember, it was in college.. I knew so many ppl but when id see them out of the usual environment I would not quite know how I know them. I was also unknowingly dealing with OSDD, dealing with ppl who I have no recollection of claiming to be a friend of mine. When I came back from Argentina for my senior year, I would see ppl and think they were ppl I met in Argentina. I felt terrible when I saw the one Asian guy at my college and thought I saw the Virginia tech shooter\u2014I literally panicked until I realized that made no sense. \n\nI have always been terrible at names, just like my mom, and my family was well known at my college so I usually chalked up not recognizing ppl to knowing too many ppl or just not keeping track lol. \n\nI started getting really concerned when I moved away for law school and my friends from college who also left for school and I would always be talking about things and ppl at our undergrad. I would not recognize the name per usual, and when they would show me a pic to job me memory, it would not help. It blew my mind that I could not recall classmates, acquaintances, teammates, etc. I do not know how much is the proso and how much is the OSDD. My friends have a running joke that I am just too good to remember people from that time of my life lol. \n\nIt was in law school that I begun to really see the gravity of my difficulty with recording faces. Way way way too many people to keep track of. I just smiled at anyone who held eye contract with me lol. Once at a law school picnic I was talking to a girl I definitely recognized and remembered knowing! At one point in the convo I had mentioned how \u201cthings were at my undergrad\u201d, and she was like....OP...duh, I know that, we went to undergrad together..\u201d I was like fuuuuck lol. It was sooo embarrassing. But oh well. Remembering and recognizing faces was going to help me pass, so I did not make a bit fuss about this. \n\nBut now that I am a lawyer and deal with clients all the time, it is very frustrating. I find it very important to form some type of relationship with my clients and build trust, and it really cuts into that when I turn around for 5 seconds and completely forget what face I have been talking to this whole time lol.  I also had to do a lineup once for a hate crime. Felt terrible about it afterward. I just could not understand at the time. ", "Do I know you  This is not prosopagnosia is it? I thought prosopagnosia is about not being able to remember faces, not their names. I mean if I know one Rachel, and I see a woman who knows me but I do not recognize her, and she tells me she is Rachel... Then I am going to know that is Rachel. /r/Prosopagnosia welcomes you... might not be able to remember your face tho. Wait. I am sure you do have it, but is not it normal to not be able to remember the names of people we met less than 10 times? Or do I just have horrible memory? Yeah, people are identified by their names almost to the point that the person\u2019s name = the person. And if a faceblind person confesses to not recognizing someone, that someone is most likely going to respond by saying their name. Yeah maybe sometimes you would need more context, like I am Rachel, the big sister of your best friend from third grade, but if the person is someone currently in your life you are most likely not going to need much more than \u201dRachel\u201d to know that oh shit that is my friend Rachel.

How?!\"  I mean, I can recognize myself usually, but I look like 9 different people to me.  Also, sometimes I confuse myself with close family members in photos, but not often.  (Although I usually know me/not me, because I have a very good memory for events and recognize clothing, where I was standing, etc.)\n\nAnyway, clicked on the post and realized it was a subreddit for parents of small children.  The person was posting about recovery from childbirth.  I am used to feeling like myself looking very different ways, so that is not an issue for me three years after giving birth.  Mo with extra lumps and sags is just another Mo. I follow the same two reddits and thought exactly the same \ud83e\udd23 Get a tattoo with your name and SSN on your forehead. Easy enough to solve. You do not have faceblindness, do you? Aw sucks to be let down like that unintentionally. If it is a help, ( (starting at ~2:40) talks about struggling to identify himself and some funny stories that came from it Nope! Clicking the random button and replying on random posts? No. I am just curious. What are non faceblind people not allowed here? Most people are face blind.  The description includes family members of face blind people, although I have never seen any comments from one.  Occasionally there is someone posting for information (do I have prosopagnosia posts, researchers, or people just curious.)  Your comment was...unusual and a little tone deaf. Some people are face blind some people are tone deaf. When you visit a subreddit like this you should be more respectful If this joke hurt your feelings then you should probably stay only in this subreddit because the rest of the internet is really going to be awful. The post literally asks how to recognize yourself in photos. A face tattoo would do that, but obviously be ridiculous. This is a sub for people with prospagnosia. You are the one intruding here so learn some respect or get out. Literally all posts by non faceblind people in this sub no matter how trivial get attacked by people who do not want non faceblind people in this sub. Chill out. I am not intruding anywhere. This is public on the internet. Do you typically troll forums for people with neurological conditions or is this a new thing? Grow up. Literally all non faceblind people that say anything in this subreddit get attacked no matter what they say. I have watched this subreddit for a while and it is pretty ridiculous. Stop being so toxic or put it in the subreddit rules that this is a place for solemn reflection on the great tragedy that has afflicted you. I am sure it sucks being faceblind, but I am also sure your feelings can withstand the onslaught of my one joke or you have bigger problems. This subreddit is primarily a place for people to post pictures of celebrities that look alike to literally everyone in the world and talk about how they cannot tell them apart and to weirdly bash anyone who is not faceblind and dares to speak as if they have cause some great harm to you. Maybe stop saying shitty insensitive things like \"Get a tattoo with your name and SSN on your forehead\" and you will stop getting attacked. Most people here suffer real life mockery and social rejection when they fail to recognize friends, family members, or coworkers. This subreddit is a place for such people to feel better after being treated like shit in the real world. It is not here for you. You are the one bringing in your toxic, ignorant attitude. And you are responding to that social rejection by socially rejecting people. If you had apologized at any point like a decent human you would have been welcomed Right. I am sure.", "What is going on with all the night shows with Jimmies??!? And then there is a James too?! I thought I was the only one People still watch tv?", "Some sort of short-term face blindness, and many people look the same? Ok so I can recognise familiar people in normal situations 95% of the time, including myself, family, friends, coworkers (so basically, no face blindness there.)\n\nBut when it comes to remembering in the short term it is near impossible for me. It is bad especially at work, if a customer says they will be back in a few minutes for whatever reason, I cannot recognise them when they come back. I try so hard to take note of what they are wearing but it is useless.\n\nAlso when watching films or TV I get lost in plotlines because people all look the damn same? You have got Character A: Man with black hair. Character B: Man with black hair. Character C: Man with black hair. I usually end up thinking they are all the same man, unless context makes it obvious that it is not.\n\nThen there is the problem of thinking people look the same. For years and years I could not tell the difference between Joey and Chandler in Friends, for example, unless they were standing next to each other. I have this problem right now with two co-workers. I thought it was one woman, but I heard her called by a different name on different days so I am certain it is actually two women. I always avoid calling her by name because I have no idea which one it is &gt;.&gt; I would be interested in hearing some responses as well. I feel like I have similar difficulties, although not quite as bad. This sounds close to my experience and according to tests I am definitely face blind. The catch is that once I have known someone for a period of time, I recognize them easily based on about 20 other clues. In that context the face looks familiar too. However, if they change in any way - dress style, haircut, out of context - it is back to confusion. Most of the time I compensate well, but it does not fix the underlying bug in face processing. &gt;Ok so I can recognize familiar people \n\nProsos recognize familiar people without using facial recognition.  I recognize people by their voices, gaits, clothing, physical build, hair and a bunch of other clues like the kind of motorcycle that they ride up on.  For a while I would mix up two guys that rode motorcycles to my place of business until I took note that one rode a Ducati.  Most of picking up clues happens unconsciously, but you can train your mind by deliberately trying to observe all of the secondary clues.  I have recently started to play back in my head individuals saying their name in their own voices.  I am very good at recognizing voices.  You have to work at it.\n\nAll your other experiences ring true as poor facial recognition.  For some people it is more severe than others.  At the other end of the spectrum, some people are extremely good at facial recognition and many use that gift in their careers.  For example police detectives often remember faces extraordinarily well. This is exactly how I have experienced prosopagnosia and based on what you have described I do not see any reason to think that it would be something else. I realize this can be a shocking discovery. For me, I did not realize that I had it until I was 27. I had an embarrassing encounter and was started searching for tips to help me remember faces better and then discovered that most people do not need help remembering faces. You should definitely find and take one of the tests to be sure. Interesting, now that I have given it some thought after these responses, it would explain a lot. Now wondering if saying \"I have a problem with recognising faces\" would get the point across to people \n instead of saying \"I am bad with faces\" Figuring out how to talk about it is one of the hardest things. A phrase I like is \"I have legitimate face blindness\". People may have never heard of face blindness before, but they will usually assume it is a real disorder and not just an excuse for carelessness. It also opens the door for them to ask for more information if they want it. \n\nAs an FYI here is a ( to an analogy that another  redditor uses to describe prosopagnosia. I have found it works pretty well. \n\nAnother piece of advice, I would encourage you to try not to let this discovery shake your confidence. Now that I know I have prosopagnosia I am more hesitant about using people's names because I am afraid I might be mistaking them for someone else. I would be better to take the risk and lived with the occasional mess up.", "Has any one else had to deal with people trying to take advantage of having prosopagnosia? I have a person in my life that seems to find it amusing that I am unsure of who people are and is intentionally making it difficult for me to know who they are and where I know them from.  Has any one else run I to people like this? How do you deal with people that play games like this? That person sounds like an asshole I have not had the misfortune to run into someone like that. You may need to consider cutting them out of your life or at least minimising your encounters. I really wish I could. They seem to be going out of their way to do this unfortunately and since I do not know who they are I cannot just walk on down and get a restraining order. Sounds like someone with power issues.\n\nHow well do toy know them? Is there anything distinctive and specific you could look out for such as the way they move or the kinds of clothes they are likely to wear? I know the more I know someone the better I am able to spot them by gait/height/weight etc. The power issues thing sounds likely since they are going to school to be a doctor.\n\nI am somewhat familiar with how they move. The problem and creepy part is that they purposefully dress like people I know some times. However I do have one solid tell I can rely on. Their eyes have certain white spots on them and for some reason I *can* memorize that one small distinguishing feature about people. But that presents the problem of having to be close enough to see them and that this person has also used color lenses in the past.\n\nYa know. The more I write this out the creepier I realize this situation is. Have not had this experience. Most people are understanding when I tell them and will over-introduce themselves even when I have figured out who they are. Sorry to hear someone is making it more difficult for you.

I have known that I have had prosopagnosia for over ten years, and have probably read everything in English and that does not require a special log-in on the internet about it.  Never told my doctor, because it is a random thing, but figured I should, because it kind of is medical information and I am up front about everything else.\n\nIt went well.  She had no idea what is was.  Perfect example though of why I like her:\n\n1. She does not rush appointments, so she listened to an explanation and asked intelligent follow up questions for maybe 10 minutes.  Questions were for her to learn more not questioning me if I actually had it.  (To be fair, it is the only thing I have self-diagnosed myself with in my life and I have been going to her for awhile.)\n\n2. She had a pretty good instant understanding of social complications.  She started thinking of work arounds, and had interesting questions about what worked best.\n\n3. She asked what follow up I wanted and had several idea of things that could help.  (No, to getting an official diagnosis, because it would not do anything.  No, to finding someone who could help me with coping mechanisms because I am pretty good.)\n\nSo it is now actually in my chart.  Took her forever to find, but it exists under visual agnosia in her diagnostic thing.  I bet she went home and read on it (she likes research,) so I will be curious to what she says next year.\n\nSeparately, I realized it would be more important to have a conversation with my boss.  I work in a school, and am pretty good at managing things, but it would be nice to give her a heads up in case something did not go well or they changed the end-of-the-day policy for me to check IDS...because I really cannot do that.\n\nMy principal is also pretty awesome; probably the best one I have worked with ever and there have been many.  She:\n\n1. Also \"got it\" quickly and asked smart questions.\n\n2. Asked what I needed to help me with my job.  (I just told her that I am not checking IDs ever, and if I offend anyone, please tell me so I can explain to them and apologize.  I am able to do my job pretty easily, and make the accommodations I need myself.)  \n\n3. She immediately thought of some upcoming situations (staff orientation with a bunch of new staff) and things that would be harder for me.  In situations since that point where you have to know who people are (and I know most of my coworkers well) she has adjusted things, so that if I did not know it would not be obvious.\n\n3. Wonders if a family member of hers has it, based on some behavioral things.  Planned to ask family member about it, and started brainstorming coping mechanisms (and good ones) to teach her (she is a kid) if that was the problem.\n\nIt was lovely to tell two such nice, understanding people.  I do not often tell people, but when I do it is about 50-50 if they are helpful or annoying.

That is why the more expensive the store, the more sales assistants there are\\~ they want to form a bond and make you think of a purchase as a connection rather than let you wander around on your own and hope you pick up the most expensive item. They also encourage touching products because that breaks down another barrier and helps people see the item as a real object that they could own rather than something in a box or on a screen. Seeing people in an ad helps us transpose ourselves into the situation, which is generally hard to do without the right nudges. There is a reason that houses with furniture in them sell faster, because they help us visualize ourselves there and show us how to use them.  \n\n\nWhich shirt would you rather buy, one laying flat on a surface, or one on a model? Of course we will choose the one on another person because we can see how it lays, how it fits, how long it is, how the fabric reacts, etc, and can then put ourselves in that shirt in a mental picture in our minds. Of course, having someone smiling while they wear it helps us to think that we would also be happy in it. To me, this is not really about proso, but more about our tendencies to see ourselves using and enjoying an item by having a placeholder person modeling or representing it. Its common knowledge but the FFA is instinct so when triggered it overrides rational parts of the brain so even if known non face blind people will do it. ", "Is it wrong to notify people they have face blindness? A couple years ago I was in a chat group for individuals with NVLD. NVLD is kind of like autism, but in reality is a grab bag of similar neurological conditions we do not yet understand. Not all of us have face blindness.  \nBut anyways, I noticed about 20 people talking about recognizing others based on articles of clothing. I immediately told them they have face blindness, and should go see a specialist. Was that the wrong thing to do?\n\nI am guessing face blindness is a condition most would desire treatment for. Yes. It is the wrong thing to do.  Let me count the ways:\n\n1) You are not a doctor and should not be diagnosing people.\n\n2) even if you ARE a doctor, diagnosing people online based on one piece of self-reported data is not only foolish, but potentially dangerous.  Doctors do not do that.\n\n3) recognizing someone by something other than their face does not automatically mean someone is faceblind. Could be they need glasses, or any number of things.  It could be a symptom of nothing at all, because everybody sometimes recognizes people by their voice, clothes, etc.\n\n4) Get treatment?  What treatment? There IS no treatment.\n\nNow, that is not to say raising awareness is bad.  I am quite grateful to the person who informed me that face-blindness is a thing.  I spent the first 25 years of my life believing I just was not trying hard enough, and that my inability to recognize people was a moral failing.\n\n However, saying, \"you have X diagnosis, run to the doctor\" is alarmist, unhelpful, and (in the U.S.) expensive.  If you want to broach the subject, there need to be a LOT of disclaimers.\n\n\"I am no doctor, so take this with a grain of salt, but what you are describing kind of sounds like prosopagnosia, aka face blindness.  Might be worth looking into.\"\n\nSimilar, yet totally different. &gt;Yes. It is the wrong thing to do.  Let me count the ways:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You are not a doctor and should not be diagnosing people.even if you ARE a doctor, diagnosing people online based on one piece of self-reported data is not only foolish, but potentially dangerous.

It could be a symptom of nothing at all, because everybody sometimes recognizes people by their voice, clothes, etc.Get treatment?  What treatment? There IS no treatment.\n\nThey clearly had the condition. It was a rather long thread. I told them to see a doctor.\n\nThere is no current treatments. But, something like crispr could be used to fix the part of the brain that gives them face blindness. There probably are therapists that could help them develop methods of not becoming victims of violent crime. It is my understanding a lot of criminals take advantage of face blindness.\n\n&gt;\"I am no doctor, so take this with a grain of salt, but what you are describing kind of sounds like prosopagnosia, aka face blindness. Might be worth looking into.\"\n\nI should not have to state that up front. I do not know what the exact words were. But, there is a lot of conditions one can tell another has, and inform them to see a doc for confirmation. If you just read a lot you start getting more accurate at identifying who others are. umm ah i doubt all of us here with face blindness would be criminals. \n\nalso, it is rude to blatantly say \"see a doctor\". there needs to be way more context than that. face-blindness is often just a way that the brain works, kind of like aphantasia. these things do not mean anything about someone is personality or health.\n\nit has absolutely no effect on someone is physical health - potentially only mental. they do not need to see a doctor for treatment unless they had bad mental health. I am not saying that. They get taken advantage by criminals a lot.\n\nI mentioned they should see a medical doctor or psychologist / psychiatrist.\n\nI think many would want a cure for their own personal reasons. Just to see a loved ones face, etc. It needs treatment. lol we do see our loved one\u2019s faces, you have no idea what this condition is, you should not be diagnosing it I have never heard of a criminal targeting someone because they are faceblind, and what special self-defence tips would there be?  Any tips you could give a faceblind person about self defense and situational awareness will be the same tips you would give anyone else.\n\nHow would this hypothetical criminal even be able to target the faceblind? It is not a visible condition.  There is no registry of faceblind people.  And frankly, most people (criminals included) do not even know it exists.  Even fans of Arrested Development often assume it is a silly, made-up condition invented by the show.\n\n So, if this hypothetical criminal is a stranger, they would not know the victim is faceblind.  If they are a good enough acquaintance to know about the faceblindness, the victim would probably be able to recognize them by other means, so the ONE potential benefit to targeting the faceblind (not being able to identify the perpetrator) is basically gone.\n\nAnd wanting a cure does not magically make one pop into existence.  I wish there was a cure for Alzheimers, but as they say, wish in one hand and spit in the other and see which gets full first.\n\nIn short, you came here describing incredibly rude behavior, something THAT EVEN QUALIFIED MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICIANS WOULD NEVER, EVER DO, hoping to be told you are great and wonderful.  Now you are trying to justify that rude behavior with unlikely hypothetical situations and the possibility of a cure being developed sometime in the future?\n\nYeah, no.  It is still rude and inappropriate.  Only someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, could be so egotistical as to think they are able to perform an armchair diagnosis of neurological issues based on a few posts. Clearly you have NPD.  You should see a doctor about that.*\n\n\n*See how that is really incredibly rude, and jumps to a huge conclusion based on insufficient information? At first I thought that you probably meant well, but now it is coming off as though you have just read of the existence of such a thing called \u2018face blindness\u2019 somewhere, and you got excited trying to flaunt this knowledge at people. OK, you seem like a bunch of sjws. I mean you do not recognize the face. In essence you have not seen the face, as you cannot recall it.\n\nI am telling people they have it. So, they may receive treatment. I am a transhumanist, and assume most want to change things about themselves. We can use plastic surgery to change the body. Certainly, the brain and mind may be edited with medicine voluntarily. Well you can either choose to really think about what people in this thread are telling you or just ignore it and carry on doing whatever you are doing. Nobody here is going to tell you how to live your life. The responses were rather aggressive. I do not see what is wrong. I just told a group of people they might want to get diagnosed and access any available treatments.\n\nI am in a group of people with nvld. I am very excited for the fact crispr can probably cure it. Disability groups will largely no longer exist in 100 years. Their members can choose to end their membership, and live better lives as a result. It is just one's own self interest.\n\nLife is the will to power. Individuals gain more power from not having a handicap. The only exception is people in power within disability groups. But, they are a very small minority of that social group. The more minor figures will leave to gain greater power among a larger more desirable group of people. I have read about people finding out, and tricking the face blind to give them money. If you ever go people watching you pick up on conditions people have. All you have to do to trick the face blind is mimic a friend. Tons of insects use this same strategy to catch prey. People with disabilities are targeted by criminals. \n\nThat movie Momento is about an individual with face blindness and other memory disorders being manipulated by tons of people. He takes notes, through tattoos, on his body to help him remember. He just does not know who he can trust, and some of the tattoos are too vague.\n\n&gt;Yeah, no. It is still rude and inappropriate. Only someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, could be so egotistical as to think they are able to perform an armchair diagnosis of neurological issues based on a few posts. \n\nI did not say it like that. More like, \"sounds like you have face blindness. Might want to see a professional about it, and look into treatment options.\" All of the posts were about life difficulties, so I told them how to best solve their problems.\n\nI have no interest in being told how great I am. I am trying to have a nuanced discussion. Not be told what to do. The responses are lack any nuance. You asked a question but do not like the unanimous answer you are getting... Okay, let me try to explain.\n\nI do not know if it is obvious to you, but your remarks in the scenario that you have originally described came off as really insensitive to me, and I was actually surprised that you did not see anything wrong with it. It did not help that you showed no signs of wanting to understand what face blindness really is, let alone empathise with people who may have this condition. Instead, all you did was to tell people to seek medical advice, which is just completely dismissive of their problems if they actually have any, and insulting if they do not.\n\nConsider remarks like\n\n* \"Oh you are shy? You might have social anxiety and you should see a specialist\"\n\n* \"Oh you are sad? I think you are depressed, and you might have BPD. Go see a specialist\"\n\n* \"Oh you have a hard time with directions? You might want to get that diagnosed. Please see a specialist\"\n\nDo you see what is wrong here?\n\nAnd really, face blindness is not what you think it is. It would be more productive if you were less defensive and try to read what people are telling you with a more open mind. The comments that you have received are for the most part quite constructive, and they were only answering the question that you were asking. CRISPR does show a lot of promise and potential  - most of which will not likely be realized until my grandchildren's generation. 10 years based on medical advances. Only a world war would slow that down. We are having like 100 years of history every five to ten years now from the internet.\n\nLook at where we were 100 years ago. Compare that to today. Then go back one hundred years, and compare to the previous point. You will notice larger societal advances quicker from more advanced technology building on each other. LMAO at referencing Momento.  He was not faceblind, he had short-term memory loss... see Finding Dory for another movie about the same condition, although Dory was born with it and IIRC, the guy in Momento acquired his through a head injury.  I think Fifty First Dates was also about STML, but I only saw it once, ages ago, so do not quote me on that.  \n\nSTML is a totally different issue from face blindness and much more debilitating.  The only faceblind character I know of is the guy in Arrested Development, and his issues are exaggerated for comedic effect. Well, I am defensive since you are attacking me. Knowing me it was probably a paragraph I wrote trying to offer a solution for people suffering emotionally so they do not have to feel that again. You are taking my words out of context, which I paraphrased. I do not appreciate being shamed for asking about whether one should inform an individual with a condition difficult to diagnose if they do not know about the existence of the condition. Everything reads like people in sjw culture. Bunch of moral puritans. They can then look it up online, and find the appropriate professional. Sure, it will make a few of them angry, but they are not the target.\n\nI can read a book to understand face blindness more in depth. Sure, there are means of conversing with others to gain greater understanding, using analytical methods to get more accurate representation of their mental contents. You still do not see faces, as you cannot recognize. It is an issue with object permanence. The face goes away when out of site. \n\nI have aphantasia, which makes one more rational as a result of not mentalizing visual imagery. I still know what it is like to see a face, and even though I cannot visualize their face. I still know what it looks like, and if I sat down and wrote I could describe it. I might be a super facial recognizer, as I rarely forget a stranger. So, since face blindness prevents seeing the face in one's mind. You have not consciously seen the face. Someone like Motzart still heard music, without having hearing. Essentially, face blindness is the lack of a sense. The movie discusses another character with face blindness that might be him. You have to really dig into film analysis for the connections. A lot of memory conditions are related. \n\nIt is just a fact people with disabilities get targeted by criminals. It is good to be aware of what condition one has, and finding answers can relieve emotional pain.\n\nThe post was about 200 posts of people talking about how many life difficulties they have had with face blindness. None of them were aware of why they were facing so many difficulties. So, I told them the cause.\n\nI see informing them as causing emotional pain in the short term, but relief long term. I am looking for reasons to why I should not do the short term pain, for someone without the word to describe their condition. If they choose to not learn from what I said, and resent me. That is on them. In a sense, it is kind that like telling someone they have a bad haircut. It ranges between making them angry to appreciative. I received unreasonable responses. Sjws do that enmass to anyone, if they disagree. It is group bullying by a collective. I am mostly face blind, but I can recognise people who are close to me. There are a lot of other cues that help with identifying a person, like their voices, which I am quite sensitive to. It feels a bit stupid when I am pretending to recognise people that I do not, but for the most part, it is no big deal.\n\nWould it be nice if this could change? Yes. But I think I would feel slightly offended if someone were to push me to see a specialist if it is not in the right context, especially if it is by someone who does not seem to empathise with me. \n\nObviously, I was not there and so I do not know how you delivered that message, but there are many ways it could have been done wrongly, and only a few where it could have come off right.\n\nIf you felt that you were being tactful and did not come off as offensive, then that is great. But why are you asking the question here in the first place? There is no need to justify what you did to us, no? Youre not being shamed for asking, you asked if it was wrong and you were told and answer that you didnt want to hear, \"yes\", and now youre acting defensive. If youre going to ask a question, be prepared for an answer you might be unhappy with. I just made a recommendation to people in pain. Was not pushing. I do feel like people in general are mad with me from having decently high anxiety I pick up on facial ques and tone of voice, but it can be reasoned away. Often I will ask for a confirmation. I have a hard time understanding how so many can be so emotional, when rationality is easy for more. All they have to do usually is use words.\n\nSo, you recognize them without really seeing their face in some sense. I do not mean physically, but a part of the mental representation is missing. There is probably some internal concious or subconscious process the mind lacks full access to. Well, then answer my question in a less defensive and nuanced manner. The first response was attacking me. I see nothing wrong with informing people based on the responses. Honestly, I wrote my post pointing out why you were wrong on the same \"bad haircut\" principle. Often people are too polite to say anything in scenarios like the one you described.  Had I witnessed it in real time, I would have stayed silent as well, because to do otherwise is tone policing and derails the conversation.  I would, however, have mentally filed you under \"tactless and jumps to conclusions.\"  Since you asked though, I gave an honest answer.\n\n I think your heart's in the right place, but clearly some part of you realized your delivery was lacking, or you would not have asked this question.  Unfortunately, in this case, your gut was correct.  It is always embarrassing to look back and realize we handled something badly, but it is also how we learn and improve our social skills.\n\nI am not saying not to talk about face blindness.  Please do!  I am all for spreading the word.  Just be aware that there is a world of difference between \"you have a condition,\" and \"you MIGHT have a condition.\" I can see the features. They just do not get committed to memory unless I have seen their faces very frequently (like say a couple of months of constant contact). That is when I would start to recognise them in photos, etc. Usually, I will be able to find a person in a photo if I know that I am looking for them, but it is unlikely that I would notice someone I know in it if I just saw it without context. \n\nAnd regarding your first paragraph, in the end, I cannot speak for everyone, but that was just how it came off to me. Make of what what you will I guess. \n\nIt would have definitely been interesting to talk about, and I think most people would be more than happy to share their experiences, but I do not think it is wise to give your advice for most of these situations unless you really know what you are doing. You could even bring up the fact that you know of a solution to it, and I am sure they will be appreciative of it, but ultimately, it is up to them to decide if they want to follow through after they are made aware of this fact. You never want to sound \u2018pushy\u2019 in these instances, if that makes any sense. lmfao, dude, that is not what happened. you wanted and expected unwavering support and celebration for your actions and you did not receive that, so now youre accusing people of attacking you. the original answer not only answered your question but gave several reasons why the answer was warranted. you didnt prepare for or want any opposition, and so now you are hurling around \"SJW this and that\" because you have no ground to stand on. \n\nyou say you see nothing wrong with informing people, but you wont let others inform you despite your request for information. youre reading tones over text that arent there because the words arent reflecting what you wanted to hear, and so because things didnt go your way, now suddenly everyone else is the asshole.\n\nyou came to our community asking a question about your behavior and now the community is telling you your behavior was inappropriate. if you didnt want to listen to the community, try asking your mirror for support instead. I do not think criminals being taken advantage of face blind people is actually a thing.  I am fairly up on reading readily available research on the topic as well as online posts over time on forums related to prosopagnosia, and have never heard anyone mention it.  I personally have never been taken advantage of by a criminal as a faceblind person, which I realize is too small of a sample size.  NVLD involves difficulty with social skills, so maybe that is the reason that these people are taken advantage of?\n\nAlso, face blind people can see their loved ones faces just fine.  It is not a vision problem.  I read your reasoning for that statement, but maybe you do not quite know what the definition of \"see\" is.  I am not trying to be condescending, but you seem to be confusing see with remember, and I do not think linguists or researchers/doctors would agree with your definition.\n\nFinally, you do not seem to believe anyone, but there is no current established thing a face blind person can go do to \"fix\" their face blindness.  If there was, I would be very interested, but depending on the side effects, I may or may not want it.  \n\nFor example, I have pretty good coping mechanism, so face blindness at this point in my life is usually not noticeable but occasionally annoying.  It is not psychologically distressing to me.  I understand you think it should be and it is for some people, but it does not keep me from enjoying my life or having social relationships.  If the treatment was a new lens in my glasses that costs $10, clearly I would want that and would wear my glasses more often.  If the treatment was an extremely high-risk surgery that only worked 50% of the time, was highly likely to affect my speech, and cost 5 million, I would definitely not want that. And now you have removed all doubt that you do not mean well. We have been 5 years from fixing diabetes for 50 years. See is used to refer to mental states. You lack the ability to see the whole face in your mind. You physically see it; do not distort it; but, cannot perceive the gestalt of the face. It is recognizing aspects that require the face as a whole. You just see parts of the face, but not the entire face. Hard to explain, but it is like reading between the lines. So, you are not fully seeing the face.\n\nIt is more psychologically distressing if you tell someone they have it for the first time. I just reccomended seeing someone to find out more. Maybe, Elon Musk will build a chip that let us then see faces? I do not know. &gt; Was that the wrong thing to do? \n\nI dunno about \"wrong\", but it is tacky and offputting.  It is your choice if you want to come off like that though.  \n\nYou seem to really want to find physiological problems and fix them.  That is cool -- I freaking love modern medicine too! -- but some people do not.  Some people have a hard time dealing with the problems they have, much less having to deal with new problems.   So you know how you are getting upset that some people in this thread are not OK with your insistence on getting folks \"cured\" of prosopagnosia ASAP?  You are upset with them going all SJW and ganging up on you?  That is how some of the people who you diagnosed and ordered to get treatment feel.  \n\nSo it is up to you if you want to continue to do this to folks, but you should understand that it is upsetting, rude, and offensive to some folks, and just rude in general in our society. We have. It is called go on the keto diet, and symptoms improve. After ten years on it insulin sensitivity might be back to normal. But treatments have vastly improved for diabetes. It is why new insulin is hundreds of dollars. They can get the old stuff for $10, without a prescription. But, the new shit requires less shots, and works far better. It is still on patent.\n\nThere is a lot going on with science right now. When I say something and a bunch of people get mad at me, I assume that I have said something wrong, either in content or phrasing.  Now what is appropriate to say depends on the subculture, so what is negative in one place may be typical in another place.  If I go somewhere else and ask for a second opinion, and the people there tell me why they think I was not in the right, I would assume that what I did was socially unacceptable on a wider scale.  I would try to figure out what it was and listen very carefully to what people were telling me, so I could avoid unintentionally repeating my mistake.  \n\nIn direct answer to your question, I think if you are not a professional who has completed an established evaluation process on an individual, \"notifying\" someone they have face blindness is not appropriate.  I think carefully mentioning that is something they might look into is fine.  I would be cautious about suggesting HOW they do it, unless you are actually knowledgeable about it.\n\nI am sure if you keep shopping forums, someone is going to tell you that you were right.  If that is what you need to move on with life, you could probably just keep trying subreddits until someone agrees.  You seem pretty set on your opinions on what prosopagnosia is, how people experience face blindness, and what they should do about it, so I do not know how much you are going to get that is going to be helpful to you out of this post. I did not order them to get treatment. Sjws are just crazy. Being offended is not an argument. Oh from the age of 3 when a group got angry with me I went on the offensive physically. I was the kid on the playground other kids would call names. When they would not stop I struck to teach them a lesson. I then got a philosophy degree, and enjoy destroying others with my words. I find it gives me a lot of insight into the human condition, and helps hit sweet spots. \n\nI would side with that other groups of people, and think those other people should go to hell. I think you are wrong. I hate collectives. If you only care about arguing with people, and not how they feel, you will never have close relationships.  Feelings are integral to human physiology, psychology, and sociology.  Ignoring this essential thing means you will have trouble in those fields. Please go on with believing that insulin has been \"vastly improved\" so it is debilitatingly expensive.  That is excellent.  Keep spouting that nonsense and it will be easy for everyone to see the rest of your pap is nonsense too. It has been improved. The stuff that is still on patent is being charged a high price to collect profit. It is affordable if you have a decent job or insurance. If we stopped regulating health care costs would go down substantially.\n\nThe stuff that is off patent diabetics could pool resources, and hire a chemist to make. But, they cannot because government highly regulates pharmacies. Teens were making acid in the 60s, so the government shut them down. These are problems caused by the existence of nation states. Brilliant.  Keep repeating this stuff. The Republicans are clearly open to military action, if the democrats keep going so far left. A civil war might be necessary to refresh the tree of liberty with the blood of patriots and tyrants. You people are crazy.\n\nIf I come upon an accident of some sort and I tell someone \u201cdo not move, your femur is broken,\u201d yes, technically it is a diagnosis. It is not practicing medicine. I do not have to say, \u201cim not a doctor, but you might want to see one, because there is a condition affecting the bones called \u2018broken bones\u2019 and you might want to have that leg checked out by a professional.\u201d\n\nLikewise when your buddy gets a parking ticket and you tell him to fight it in court because you did and won, you are offering legal advice, and technically offering that advice without having the proper credentials. The latter one is not always. The requirement is it would not convince a reasonable person. If something terrible happened to a friend from your advice. I am sure the courts would say, \"should have taken it with a grain of salt,\" and dismiss the case. You sound like the kind of guy who would walk into a casino, play blackjack, and double down on a 20.\n\nFuck, cannot you just admit that you are wrong? No one\u2019s going to kill your entire family because you were wrong once. \n\nAlso, the fuck kind of thing is \u201cyou sound like a bunch of sjws\u201d? Sounds like to me that you are admitting you do not have empathy or compassion for other people.\n\nHonestly, if I saw you in a movie theater or grocery store or church, I would get the fuck out before you drew your gun and started firing into people. That is the kind of person you are coming off as.\n\nFortunately, I will not ever be able to recognize you, because I have some of the most ridiculously severe associative prosopagnosia known to humankind. Wow, I made a comment further above where I accused you of being a domestic terrorist. \n\nThanks for backing me up on my assumption that you are a domestic terrorist.\n\nI hope to god you do not own a gun. Nope. But, I support a coup. We have generals opposed to woke ideology. Once some crazy restriction goes in place they move. Force is always an option. We have had too much peace here for too long to not use it as a teaching moment for why civility, and moderation is important.\n\nThere is enough right wing movements growing over federal policy failure from both parties to make this likely. I am saying you are the stereotype.\n\nI am good at math. Would never hit on a 20, unless the odds were in my favor. #A coup is domestic terrorism.\n\n#The Capitol Insurrection of January 6 was domestic terrorism. Dude, get out of this subreddit. You are unwanted. Sjw scum. No, it was not. It was a group of morons rushing the door. They were not even properly armed. It is like leftists wandering into speeches blaring loud noises, or fraternity members disrupting meetings they were not invited too. #Badly-performed domestic terrorism is domestic terrorism. That coup was domestic terrorism. You support a coup. You are a domestic terrorist.\n\nAnd also a shit person in general. You lack nuance. The left cannot implement some majority rule system. The constitution has the second amendment to preserve the minorities right to liberty. Things have to be like they are now to justify it. The policy under Biden socially controls people far more. Trump style policies stop that. The left is colluding currently to stop the rise of the right world wide. Their policies are why blacks are trapped in poverty. &gt;I immediately told them they have face blindness, and should go see a specialist. Was that the wrong thing to do?\n\nYeah.  Makes you sound like an asshole.  Next time suggest they might have it, and to read up on it a bit. The way you describe what you did makes it sound like you are giving people with a lot of concerns one more thing to worry about until they can get to the doctor Your cryptofascism are not subtle, pal. #Facts, not feelings. Man up. #Stiff upper lip. Do not cry in front of people. See I was not distressed when I figured out.  I was relieved, because it explained so much.  From reading here, the response seems 50-50 about whether people are upset or happy. If you hate collectives, why on earth are you posting here with a question?  The expected end-result would be to hear what is basically a collective opinion of this subgroup of people on an extremely specific topic.  That would be useful if you truly wanted information, but if you just want to convince everyone you are right and do not have any research or experience to back it up, it is not going to be effective.  \n\nIf you psychologically need people to be angry at you, so you can react and feel good about yourself, I would recommend looking for a larger subreddit.  Maybe something related to parenting?  You just are not going to get enough responses here because it is a small community and people are pretty logical on average.  You will get a few people mad, but mostly you are going to get well thought-out replies explaining thinking and trying to help you, which I do not think is really what you want.\n\nIf you need to argue with people to feel superior, you will get some of that here, but again, you will probably be better off with a larger subreddit or at least debate-based one.  Depending on your personal preference, I would try to filter the subreddit by average intelligence/education - you may want to argue with people that are smarter than you for a challenge or people that have less education or intelligence to be more easily superior.  I am not sure which would be the best for you.\n\nI hope you find something to help get what you need.  I feel like you really are not getting what you wanted with your question. I was expecting to hear individual opinions in disagreement. The emotional responses I mostly ignore. I will pick the ones seeming the most reasonable, intuitively, and find strong evidence to refute them.\n\nMy IQ is in the 130s. Statistically I am smarter than you, most likely. Have a 5 in writing on the GRE, 166 verbal, and 163 Quant. That is above the 90th percentile in all domains. I was on the math team in childhood, from pure effort. Went from the retard class to the gifted math team, purely from desiring giftedness from the beginning. Pretty sure, I am way smarter than you.\n\nI was expecting diversity of thought. But, I just got vile sjws. That is common since reddit started banning the right. jesus, you are getting downvoted to hell. people here seem to get offended easier than others... /r/IAmVerySmart I think diversity of thought depends on the topic and group.  For example, if I asked, \"Should one month olds drink soda?\" or \"Was I rude to smack the old lady in the face, because she was sitting in the seat I wanted?\" I would expect most people to say I was wrong, although a few would agree with me.  Also, I would not expect as much variety in response in a small subreddit based on having a certain, fairly unknown condition.  In that case, people are far more likely to have similar experience that affect their response.  You asked people who might have actually had that experience.\n\nOut of idle curiosity, if you care to answer, how would your thinking be affected if I said my IQ was the same as yours and my test scores were equivalent or higher in all areas?  I mean in honesty, not just saying that I am lying.  It is not really relevant, because this is a social intelligence question which is not the same as IQ.  I was just wondering if you listened to people who were smarter than you or no one is smarter than you (which statistically some users on this subreddit are if your IQ is in the 130s) or if it does not matter if people are smarter, you are right no matter what. You are pretty dumb if you do not know that IQ is an outdated measurement. Let us dig deeper into this broken leg analogy.\n\nIf you are physically viewing an injury or illness, you already have VASTLY more context and input than reading or hearing a description.  People are not always good at describing problems, and they are not always good at recognizing what is serious and what is not.\n\nReal life examples from my days as a vet tech.  \n\nI got a call one day from some folks who said their dog's eye was kind of red and irritated.  They did not think it looked too bad, but wondered if they should bring it in right away or wait and see if it cleared up on its own.\n\nI told them that I could not judge without seeing for myself,  but that eye problems can be serious, and if they wanted to being the dog in right away, we would absolutely find a way to fit them into the schedule (note, we did not charge emergency fees or anything, the cost was the same whether they came straightaway or waited).  They decided it was not that bad and chose to make an appointment for the following day.\n\nAs it turned out, the dog's eye was not just \"red.\"  It had somehow bulged a bit too far our of the socket and the eyelid had snapped shut behind the eyeball instead of in front of it, making it impossible for the dog to blink.  This happens sometimes, especially in brachycephalic (squashed face) dogs.  If handled quickly, it is a simple matter of gently putting everything back into place and monitoring to make sure it does not pop out again.\n\nBecause these folks chose to wait, their dog suffered agonizing pain all night and the eye had to be removed.\n\nI also saw someone bring in a dog they  described as \"having muscle cramps or something.  He is having trouble moving.\"  The dog was very much dead; the stiffness the owner had noted was rigor mortis.  All we could do was put the owner in an exam room for privacy and gently break the news.\n\nOn the other side of the equation were the people who described things in alarming ways, only for the issue to be very mild or even nonexistent.  I knew a woman who took her new (first ever) puppy to the emergency room at 2:00 AM because it is urine was yellow, and another worried because their cat had a \"tumor\" that turned out to be testicles.  I have seen multiple people worried about \"bumps\" or \"ticks\" that turned out to be nipples.\n\nNone of these people were stupid; they just did not know what they were looking at.  We always made a point to tell new employees to take owners concerns seriously, even if what they are describing does not sound that bad over the phone. If it turns out to be nothing, great!  You can take a glance and send them home feeling relieved, no charge.  If it turns out to be serious... well, better to err on the side of caution, because sometimes it is very, very serious.\n \nNow, back to the broken leg analogy.  If you are at the scene of an accident, you probably know what happened (did the person fall? Were they hit by a car?) And you are looking at the injury.  A leg bending at the wrong angle or with bone jutting out is pretty easily identified as broken.  And in that situation,  you still send them to the doctor, so if your diagnosis was wrong and they actually have a torn ACL, the doctor will spot that and treat for the correct issue.  No harm done.\n\nBut what if you are at home on the computer and someone is describing leg pain after a fall?  Suddenly things are not nearly as clear-cut, especially when considering that descriptions cannot be fully trusted, and people do not always identify the correct cause of the problem.  Is the leg broken?  Maybe.  Or maybe they have a pulled muscle, or ligament or tendon damage, or dislocation. Maybe they have nerve or circulation problems that were exacerbated by the fall, but not caused by it. Maybe they HAD pain but feel better now... because the tissue was infected and is now necrotic.  Maybe they landed in a beehive or patch of poison ivy or campfire, only they forgot to mention that detail when describing their pain.  Or they DO mention it, and think it is the cause, when actually the real issue is something else, or has changed. A wasp sting hurts.  A wasp sting that has become infected also hurts.  The treatment, though, is vastly different.\n\nYou can make an educated guess, sure, but if you guess wrong and give improper medical advice, the results can be disastrous.  Any medical professional can tell a thousand stories of folks who thought they had A only to actually have B, and the (usually negative) consequences of treating for the wrong thing. &gt; 4) Get treatment? What treatment? There IS no treatment.\n\nThe best that exists is training you to work around it. Like being able to recognise people by other things. Like their clothes.\n\nWait... &gt; There probably are therapists that could help them develop methods of not becoming victims of violent crime. It is my understanding a lot of criminals take advantage of face blindness.\n\nI do not speak for everyone, obviously, but because I cannot tell much about someone is face, I can tell more about their body.  \nAnd when dealing with violent crime, you learn more about the situation from body language than you do from facial expression.  \nBecause most people are used to telling what the other person's emotions are by looking at their face, people who want to surprise you often try to keep their face neutral or friendly, but they ignore their body.  \nA clenched fist, a shift in stance, a subtle change in shoulder position. All things you might miss if you are looking at a face. Maybe tell them they *might* have face-blindness and a specialist could tell them more. People do not always respond well to being told they *must* have a specific thing and *should* do a particular action. I did not downvote, but I do not think the general reaction here is due to people getting offended. Yeah, I grew up with that. I do not always like it. But, I can admit when the other party is right. I think I am more rational than the average person, though. I am a computer programmer by traded. I have noticed the reason we have societal problems, mostly, comes down to people being too emotional. Lol yup!!! Wrong thing to do!!! That is definitely not how those things work By who crazy people? The research is some of the most replicable in psychology. That and personality theory have the strongest scientific support. James DaMore writing about that stuff is why he was fired. Does not matter if they are smarter. Very smart people are extremely good at twisting nonsense to fit their world view. Met a ton of gifted individuals that believed in extremely out there conspiracy theories.\n\nI do believe the current left wing is working to ban the expression of concepts that contradict their ideology. It is happening in uni with people blocking lines of research that might harm gender, racial, ethnic equality, etc. In the past five to ten years post modernists have gained control of many university departments, and are trying to enforce relativistic thinking. I have had many of them scream at me for seeing objectivity as possible. They believe one should lean into subjective biases, and use word salad to support that. \n\nThose individuals are largely opposed to conceptions such as free speech, diversity of thought, and individualism out of the misguided belief it might cause harm to someone somewhere. It is paranoid thinking, based on the horrors of the holocaust that leans into quasi-communist thinking. I am almost certain they will lead to a mass genocide of millions of people. That is an awful lot of words pretending to address my point. From the if-you-cannot-dazzle-them-with-brilliance-baffle-them-with-bullshit school of response. That is my diagnosis over the internet without meeting you in person. I stand by it.\n\nThink about it. Write one paragraph of 4 sentences. \n\nAs a vet, you cannot diagnose a broken leg over the internet. I agree wholeheartedly. If I make no false claims that I am a vet, it is understood that I am just some guy offering an opinion. It is not immoral, illegal, nor wrong in anyway for me to suggest a diagnosis when people on the internet are freely sharing their problems and wondering about them. We do not need a saviour. It is not really the end of the world dude. You obviously have no idea what prosopagnosia is, so stay in your own lane. Preferably far away from us. No one here asked for or needs your saving or pity, just like no one in that group needed your armchair diagnosis, which must still be bothering you since you are seeking (and failing to get) validation YEARS later. Make like Elsa in Frozen and Let it go!  \n\nYou are making it sound like this condition is the end of the world and it really, REALLY is not. \n\nI know it is hard to believe but some people with disabilities are totally fine with who they/we are. Sounds like you are not and that makes me sad for you. Maybe you should work on that?\n\nNon-verbal learning disorder is not \u201ckindof like autism\u201d but autism is one of the overlapping conditions a person with NVLD can have. NVLD is not even recognized as its own condition in the DSM-5.\n\nDo not ask a question, expecting praise, and then get mad or attempt to \u201cright fight\u201d when people tell you the answer you do not want to hear. What did you expect?\n\nAlso, it is very clear that you know VERY LITTLE about prosopagnosia ie thinking there is treatment or people with the condition are more prone to be preyed upon by criminals based on a movie! Please! \n\nYou know you can recognize people by things other than their face right? Probably not, since you feel like it is soooooo important. As a matter of fact, a lot of people with face blindness are keenly aware of other descriptors that can ID any potential perpetrator. \n\nMany of us have a very keen memory for other details (tattoos or birthmarks, clothing, walking gait, voice recognition, more acute spatial awareness of things like height and weight) that someone without FB might not even notice. Also, it is not like we walk around with neon signs that say \u201cFACEBLIND!!\u201d over our heads for criminals to see. Do not trust everything you see in movies dear. \n\nJust because people recognize others by things other than their facial structure does not mean they are prosopagnosiacs! There are many advantages to noticing other details about a person, for instance, you can ID someone by clothes, hairstyle or walking gait from a greater distance if you are looking for someone in a crowded/large space like a store/mall.\n\nFor your future reference: Armchair diagnosing is ALWAYS the wrong thing to do. I just wanted to say, this response is so well put together and well said and I appreciate you. You want a TLDR?  Fine.\n\nPeople do not know what they do not know.  My post provided examples.  Sorry you could not be arsed to actually read them.\n\nIf you offer an opinion or diagnosis that turns out to be wrong, and people act based on your words, it can cause make their problem worse.\n\nIf it is potentially harmful, then yes, it can be immoral and wrong.  (Though you are right, it is rarely illegal). Another example, just for fun.  Let me tell you the story of the folks who bought topical flea treatment, did not read the instructions, and tried to get their dog to swallow the liquid.  Dog started gagging and salivating like crazy and they realized their mistake. \n\nTheir neighbor said \"My kid swallowed something poisonous once.  Give the dog milk to help it pass.\"\n\nSo they forced milk down the throat of an already gagging animal.  When a day passed and the dog did not seem better, THEN they brought it to us.\n\nThat flea product assumes animals might lick it.  If they had brought the dog to a vet, or called poison control, they would have know the dog may be uncomfortable for a while, mostly because the stuff tastes dreadful, but would ultimately be okay. \n\nUnfortunately, the milk had been aspirated, and THAT was a major problem.  The dog ended up dying because of well-meant, wrong advice (that may have worked in other circumstances).\n\nIf I get long-winded about these things, it is because I have witnessed the aftermath first-hand.  Incorrect advice can kill. 1. You are very, very, very, very smart.\n\n2. \"Very smart people are extremely good at twisting nonsense to fit their world view.\"\n\nCool!  Got it! It is also very evident from their comments that they actually have no idea what \nprosopagnosia is. They should not be trying to provide \u201cexpertise\u201d and diagnosis when they seem to lack even a basic understanding of it to begin with. This is not the echo chamber the OP was looking for. Hehehe exactly You are hilarious", "Work with kids in acute care and this group is such a struggle for me One girl took out her beads and I thought she was an entirely different child.\n\nOne kid had her hair braided, now I cannot look at her without being reminded of a coworker, and had to ask if that was .\n\nOne boy came in and I just stopped and stared and was like, \u201coh you are back.\u201d  Different kid.  Added bonus points I called him other kids name at one point.\n\nThere is a kid that looks like my friend from college and that hurt my head.\n\nThere was a little child who was super chill the entire time he was here.  I originally thought he was this other kid who was very angry and was always up to something.  I was preparing myself for the worst and did not introduce myself for a few hours.  Oop.\n\nSend help. *sends condolences and affection*\n\nI wish I could help. Hang in there though &lt;3 \"I am faceblind!  It is a problem I cannot get fixed, unlike you!  So tell me your name and I will remember everything I need to, and then we can get YOU all fixed up!\" \n\nUpbeat, honest, helpful, unflinching about your disability, allows others the space for compassion for you and therefore for themselves, and lets them talk about something else for once if they want.   Also they may be able to talk to you easier if they know you are struggling too. That second sentence is the best.\n\nThat is kind of how I go about it.  Once I realize I goofed I say, \u201coh heck, sorry , I am faceblind.\u201d One time I put a hat on my child, and I seriously thought they looked like a different child.  It was easy to reason in my head that it was still my child (because this happened at home where the only children around are mine), but it was still a bit rough to grasp.\n\nI would suggest encouraging everyone to wear name tags, but with kids that probably would not last long.  Good luck! In acute they would probably use them as shanks...", "People I Should Know I thought I was doing really well recognizing people for awhile.  Like maybe I was exaggerating how bad the problem was.  Well, this last week:\n\n1. Was looking at pictures of kids from my son's preschool with him.  He was naming the kids.  I said, \"Is this Cam?\"  (Cam is another kid at the preschool.)  Nope.  My 2 year old son said, \"No, NOT Cam!  It is me!\"  Oops.  When I really looked at it, I recognized my kiddo.  But people look like more than one person than me, and this picture looked like the least common type of my son I see.  (To clarify, I do not think people are actually different people.  For example, I see myself as having about seven completely different looks.)\n\n2. Saw some of my friends from college.  I have known these people over a decade.  And because they are my friends, they are pretty distinctive looking and easy to recognize.  I went away from our table for a little while, and totally walked past them when I came back.  I was not really looking at them and thinking; I thought I would just recognize them because they are familiar and, like I said, all very distinct looking.  Guess not.\n\nSo, I guess I am here to stay. \u201cPeople look like more than one person to me\u201d \n\nTHIS- I am just about to post about this! It is an interesting point and I find the same. My husband, sons and son-in_law are approximately  the same height but dont look identical and there are 30 years between the oldest and youngest. If they are all in a room together I have to concentrate hard to identify who is who and frequently pick the wrong one to speak to.  It was the same when my children were young. If they were in a group with children of the same age I never saw them.", "Faces and whatnot in the clouds. Anybody else also find it really hard to see the faces (and animals) in the clouds or other places people tend to see faces? I have wondered if my complete inability to see what others are seeing like that is related to prosopagnosia. No, I have no problems. Maybe it is just imagination? How vivid are your dreams? I have absolutely no problem with that, I can see faces everywhere! It is great fun.  Apophenia is the word you are looking for friend. Humans (generally speaking) are hardwired for pattern recognition to the point of absurdity, and sometimes it can run amok. I can see faces just fine. THey  just dont look like anyone. I do not really see faces in clouds but sometimes other things like animals or objects. I do not see faces in cars either which I believe most people do. I cannot tell  cars apart at all.", "This video on /r/funny.

I thought blocking the camera with the brush was just one of the ways to make the transition between different people. It makes more sense now. I did, but only because I know the meme I only realized when I saw the comments. Then I thought there were four people total (woman 1, woman 2, protagonist, TV human, woman 1 again, woman 2 again, protagonist). Turns out no characters repeat.", "I Prefer Anime/Cartoon over Movies/TVSeries. Anything else? I have learned that my preference over cartoons and anime is because of Prosopagnosia since they usually have the same outfits throughout so that it makes us easier to recognize people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust wondering if there are anything else like that where you have deviated from a popular culture due to prosopagnosia but would be a good suggestions for this community? Yeah same here. Realy love anime and I feel like it is way easyer to follow than movies/ TV Series. I suspect this is also the reason I like Star Trek so much. Color-coded uniforms and alien makeup really help Same! Unfortunately, I find most anime to have too many similarly drawn characters and it throws me off. Western animation is awesome about making everyone distinct, but I wish we had more variety then shows for older children like Gravity Falls, and drunken adult comedies like Rick and Morty. The proso definitely turns me away from standard TV and movies, but honestly I just like anime because I am a huge weeb, not to fill some void that the absence of other media left. I went a long time without really watching anything before I got into anime. So apparently like to make things hard on myself, and I do not really like a lot of cartoons or anime.  It certainly is easier to follow though! I love movies and try my best to recognize people in movies, but what I simply cannot is movies about politics or similar jobs where everyone is an old white man with a suit. I am not able. I had a hard time following House of Cards, because of that.\n\nI love cartoons, always have, probably because is easier to tell characters apart. They are designed to stand out from each other, I like this. I found that my interest in movies and TV really dropped off once I started getting too old for kids movies. I have found that a lot of my favourite movies are animated or have a fairly small and \"diverse\" cast. Interestingly, I loved Interstellar but I had no idea the character Dr Doyle even existed until (SPOILER)&gt;!he died on the water planet.!&lt; I would never heard this, but I definitely have a preference for animated shows/films, and with live action ones, it always takes me a few episodes to distinguish the leads if they have similar body types and hair colors. With anime and cartoons, the body or facial structure has to be really distinct for me to remember the character quickly though, I think I just have a poor memory for names in general. \n\nI think a similar comparison would be my general preference for musicals over plays, where the actors tend to have more distinctive costumes, plus songs to really hammer in who they are lol. Also, I do not tend to like \"realistic\" CGI type games and always prefer the cartoonier/stylized ones to the ones where the characters's faces all look similar. For the most part, I do not have too much trouble with recognizing characters in live action TV series or movies.  (I am more likely to have problems understanding the dialogue if there is too much background noise.)  Because most directors use standard techniques to convey importance and direct your attention where they want it, I am pretty good at picking up on camera focus cues and hints from the plot.  I also have strong memory for voices, which helps.\n\nI do still get people mixed up sometimes, but usually the dialogue and plot will correct me before I get too lost.\n\nSome shows I have enjoyed:\n\nBabylon 5\n\nBurn Notice\n\nLeverage\n\nNCIS\n\nPerson of Interest\n\nStargate (SG1 &amp; Atlantis)\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\n\nDoctor Who (classic and new)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Taking a film class might help if you want to watch more live action movies and shows. I do too and I suspect why it is why I have had a lifelong love of pro wrestling where everyone dresses in strange ways and the commentator introduces them  if I cannot figure it out. Interesting observation: I am studying animation and very much have a preference for animation over live action. (Usually I can tell actors apart; just something in me is like \"Cartoons are more interesting to look at.\") When I started realizing I have prosopagnosia, or at least a sort of face amnesia (I can usually recognize a person after meeting them a few times, but, before then and if they do not have a distinctive consistent feature, I might be like \"Hi! ...You seem like you know me. Do I know you?\"), I learned that one of my favorite cartoon fan artists is also faceblind.\n\nThen I learned \\*another\\* fan creator I like is faceblind. And it is not as if everyone who is faceblind is both aware of it and mentions it, so I will bet there is even more. I know it is anecdotal, but I will bet there is a larger pattern going on here. Oh for sure! I used to watch a lot of detective shows, but every man there looks like a stereotypical Englishman with short hair, so I could not discern them in the slightest. I would constantly think 'is this a new character or have we seen him before?', not even counting times where a dramatic plot twist is done by showing a photograph - leaving me wondering who the hell I am looking at.  Anime/cartoons where everyone wears the same outfit each episode are definitely easier on me.", "Prosopagnosia and Speaking with Strangers Hiya everybody. \n\nSomething just occurred to me this morning; I sometimes spend some time on r/socialskills, offering people advice about all sorts of things. Some of the common things people ask about is approaching strangers, meeting new people, and how to introduce yourself to someone you do not know.\n\nI think I have got some pretty strong social skills - I generally do not get anxious, I have a lot of confidence and I do not shy away from human interaction, so I often have advice or tips I can share with people on that sub. Just this morning, somebody was asking about speaking with strangers, and it occurred to me that for this specific social skill, I have **tons** of practice, since I hardly ever recognize people.\n\nIf I was not born with Prosopagnosia, I may have been one of those people who have a difficult time speaking to strangers and meeting new people, but I have had literally my whole life of practice to get over that fear (and replaced it with the fear of \"do I know you?\").\n\nDo any of you with Prosopagnosia (or your significant others who have it) notice the same for yourselves? That you do not have any anxiety about chatting with somebody you do not know, maybe because you have been doing it your whole life? I am really interested in if this is a trait we all share, or if it is just me. I am a lot more comfortable with strangers usually because there is no pressure to recognize them. When I know someone intimately enough I know what to look for to recognize them. But there is always this in-between time when I am seeing someone for the second time and I am anxious because I know I probably will not recognize them Many people with prosopagnosia cope by being friendly and outgoing with everyone.  That way, there is less chance of ignoring someone that you know.  Many also do not notice the discouraging glances that we get when our gregariousness is making people uncomfortable.  I do not think that this is phony if you genuinely like people and being nice to people that you do not like is not a bad thing. Now that I have read your comment, I realise that you are right.\nIt is easy for me to discuss with people I do not know, it is even easier when I am somewhere I am sure I will not meet somebody I know.\n well Tristala completely agree with you there I am a teacher and have no problem with speaking in public or meeting people however I do avoid places where I can run into people and I feel stressed in super crowded places and if someone speaks to me now that I know mu suffering from prosopagnosia it makes me uncomfortable that I will again not recognize them after asking them for their name  and then being angry with myself about it", "How do i explain this- (Apologies for bad grammar or if this just does not make sense, struggling to write right now)\n\nI have only recently discovered prosopagnosia and a lot of things just made sense, and one of them is that everyone knows my sister despite never having talked to her and i do not know any of their family. They see me walk out of school with her\nand they talk to me about her, and they recognise her when i am describing her without saying her name. It is weird but apparently people can do that. It is a weird super power people have. Our super power is the ability to never be tainted by an actor's previous work lol! \n\n\nOthers essentially have a photographic memory for faces. It is how they are mental filing system works. Instead of faces, our filing system is essentially stories and other visual cues. It takes longer to find the file as a result and can require being prompted before the search begins. \n\n\nHonestly, dont over think it. Its a part of you, it will not stop you nor slow you down. You very likely have other means of figuring out who people are. Remember that even though most people can recognize faces, most people have their own weaknesses too. This is just one area where we are not on even footing. &gt;Our super power is the ability to never be tainted by an actor's previous work lol! \n\nLOL!  That is really a great point. Heck, I am not \"tainted by an actor's previous work\"...in the last scene he appeared in two minutes ago.", "Even though I know he is the same person throughout, it totally seems like he is three different people.  Which ones? \ud83d\ude39", "Subtitles for Prosopagnosia? My friends know I have prosopagnosia and occasionally suggest movies I might enjoy. I had a few recently suggest Deadpool by saying, \u201cYou will have no trouble! The main character is always in costume or appears burnt so there is no losing him!\u201d What they failed to mention was that half the movie was pre-transformation flashbacks and he is indistinguishable from the guy he was hunting down. Oops. Thankfully, I was watching it with a friend who is an excellent spotter.\n\nI wish there was a subtitles style of aid where the name or nickname of a character pops up on the bottom of the screen whenever they are onscreen. Or just add the name to the subtitles whenever the character speaks, which already happens in CC when the character is speaking offscreen. If prosopagnosia is a recognized disability, I wonder if this could be requested as part of the CC/Subtitles package from major producers? This could be automated in the future for older films/shows once facial recognition technology inevitably becomes advanced enough. What do you think? There are \"subtitles\" (discrete narration) for the visually impaired. I have always liked those, when I can find them, because they reference both the character and the emotion.  I think this would be awesome, especially if made them like ( and gave everyone a color and wrote their text in that color every time.

As in, I am slow to recognise faces of my loved ones in out of context situations, but for the most part I do recognise them. \nI forget customers almost immediately as soon as they are out of my vision, so I usually memorise what they are wearing if I need to come back to them etc.\nYesterday in a fitting room, they had those mirrors that are fitted at angles so you can see the side and back of whatever you are trying on.\nI caught sight of a blond girl watching me and it genuinely gave me a fright before I realised it was me.\n I then spent about 10 mins inspecting myself and my own movements to see if I could find something familiar about myself that I remembered.\nIt was an extremely odd experience. I suppose it is because I am usually looking at myself in a mirror face-on, and this was the first time in a long time that I have been able to view myself from a different angle. This is actually common even for people without prosopagnosia.  For instance, it happens a lot in gyms when you watch a bunch of people doing the same exercise/machine, idly evaluating form or pace, and then you realize one of the people you evaluated was yourself.  Then you can examine what you thought of your body when you did not auto-recognize.  It is an interesting experience. I experienced this once. I was tagged in a photo and was very confused as I did not know it was me.", "Which fictional characters have prosopagnosia? I guess the obvious answer is \"Everybody from superhero universes\", but which characters can you think of who cannot recognize faces, even though everybody else from their universe can? \n\nI am thinking of Ryoga from the anime \"Ranma 1/2\". First of all, he has no sense of direction (I have read that there is a link between that and prosopagnosia). Secondly, he cannot recognize Ranma when he \"disguises\" himself by changing his clothes or hair, or putting on glasses, even though none of the other characters are fooled. \n\nCan you think of any more?

FIVE MINUTES AFTER TALKING TO HIM. at my job we have no uniform except for one requirement: hi-vis neon yellow must be worn on the top half (could be a vest, shirt, jacket etc. does not matter as long as it is hi-vis.) one of my co-workers chooses to wear a vest over the top of regular clothes so he can change as he clocks out. \n\nit was a pretty slow day today with not much needing to be done so we pretty much wandered around and chatted for approximately half an hour. this was half an hour of extensive face to face conversation. at the end of the conversation, he let me know that he was going to clock out and left me to continue working.\n\nless than FIVE MINUTES LATER, co-worker walked past me, waved and told me to have a good day. same clothes as before, same hairstyle, etc etc... but he was no longer wearing his hi-vis neon yellow vest. I kid you not, guys, I looked directly at this dude who I would just had a whole conversation with five minutes ago, and had no idea who he was.

I have had this happen to me too. It is mortifying. Seems like it happens more when I am under a lot of stress. It happens a bit less now that I am retired. But of course, we have been in shutdown and not interacting with many people due to the pandemic, on top of being retired, so I guess it is hard to say if I am doing any better.\n\nI have learned that your strategy of just addressing the problem directly with the person, with apologies and a deprecating smile, is the best way. Not everybody is kind and patient about it. Most are though. You need a nickname.\n\nSeriously.  Just about every workplace, school, social group, etc, I have had as an adult, I use a different nickname.  That way, I know where people know me from based on what name they use.\n\nDoes not help with this kind of thing,  of course (back when I worked with the public, if someone left the room and returned, or even moved down to a different place along the counter, I would think they were someone new).  However, for running into coworkers at the grocery store or wherever, it is invaluable. wow, that is genius! I will have to keep that in mind, thanks for the tip Haha I work security as a living I do not know who I am talking to half the time. Confused people so many times reasking for IDs multiple times in a day. What is worse is how close an ID has to be to someone is face for me to make a connection. Some of these long term contractors have pulled fast ones on me. I just cannot recognize people from IDs.  If they have changed their hair, I will think it is someone else.  If it is not their ID, but someone who look similar, I would not know.  I work with kids and now refuse to check IDs, because me checking it means nothing.\n\nI have two aunts that look a lot alike.  Once at a wedding, one used the other's ID to get a drink in a darkish room.  (She was plenty old enough.  Her ID was just upstairs in her hotel room and she was lazy.  She had planned to lie and say they got mixed up if she got called on it.)  I remember thinking, \"Well, why would not it work?  They have the same skin color, eye color, and hair color, plus the same nose.  Who could tell the difference from a picture?\" Gosh, can people actually? That is one of those things that I just genuinely cannot conceptualize what it is like to do--being able to look at an ID picture and say \"nah, that is not you\" even though the basic features are the same. I could never have a job that required checking IDs. I cannot identify people from their ID's either, but I figure since most people do not even know prosopagnosia is a thing, they are not going to use an ID that has someone else's picture.  Even if they have a fake ID, it is the security features you need to be able to identify more than the picture.  \n\nBack when I was in college (and long before I would heard of prosopagnosia) I worked a seasonal job at Hickory Farms (sausage and cheese gift baskets at a mall kiosk).  We were supposed to check ID's when people paid with a credit card.  I barely even looked at the picture, I just matched the name.  Of course this was pretty low stakes and the point was mostly to scare off any credit card thieves.  I would not want to risk my lack of facial recognition skills on a job where security was critical. Hah! Good point! I look at their chins, ears, and other noticable features not the face.

Very useful if you are living in ( Combo of hair plus glasses For me, from most to least used:\n\n1- Hair  \nChange your hair cut, or cut your bear, and you become an unknown person to me.\n\n2- Behavior  \nLike how the person walks or if (s)he look like angry or smiley.  \nIt gives me low level of confidence to recognize the person, but enough to make me think like \"Maybe I know him/her\"\n\n3- Specific details  \nBirth mark, Scars, Freckles  \nNot easy to see, so rarely useful, but high level of confidence to recognize the person\n\nI do not use clothes, glasses or body type help me to recognize people at all. I always shock my friends because I cannot see when they change of clothes style or glasses. Body type, posture, mannerisms (stride,talking with hands). I was about to comment \"by face\", and then I realized this was the \"face blindness\" subreddit. Sorry guys... Also, it is best to distinguish by hair, body type and clothes they wear. You just have to remember their clothing style. I also use people's mannerisms pretty often. Like how they use their hands when they talk, how they emphasize certain things they say... speech patterns... accents... that stuff. I am curious about all the people saying that hair is the easiest \u2014 are you around mostly white/Asian people? It is not at all useful with Black folks, since we can and do change our hair pretty drastically from day to day and wigs and extensions are common. Mannerisms for sure. Voice is also good. Tattoos used to be great, but then I started working at Hot Topic's corporate office \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Hair is important for noticing someone quickly, but I find to be 100% certain, looking at their gait and mannerisms is the best thing. Their style - Like the combination of clothes, hair, phrasing and tone, etc.  Actors are the worst - they purposely do this different ways! Voices help me! Me too!!!! I listen more than I watch tv to keep track of what is going on and who is who. I have always said that glasses act just like a veil on someone is face i.e they 'cover up' their face, so you really need not focus much on other details. &gt;2- Behavior\nLike how the person walks or if (s)he look like angry or smiley.\nIt gives me low level of confidence to recognize the person, but enough to make me think like \"Maybe I know him/her\"\n\nI do not know, but for me, they tend to more *unconscious*? I actually cannot list each person's set of mannerisms and explain them, but if you show me said people going about their day normally, I can recognize them. This also includes stance, walking position, etc. and literally anything that has to do with someone is motions and body language. A combo of the way someone moves/walks, their build, and the style of clothing they wear. Posture/movement/bearing. How a person carries themselves when the sit and walk, along with the fundamentals of how they move, is a huge clue for me. I can remember most of my schoolmates names or faces worth a damn, but I can remember quite clearly how most of them moved. Oh yeah, you are maybe right (I use mostly hairs, as a White European)\n\nYou can note also that I do not have in memory one only hair cut for each person; I try to memorize all haircuts and hair color I already saw once on the person. It is not everyday that someone try a new totally different cut (but when it happens, I am fckd)\n\nAnd for people who change of hair cut too much, I just forget the Idea to recognize them with hair, and use others details, even if more complicated (mainly applicable for women that often change cut and colors) It is voices for me. same. i often will not recognize a person until they speak. conversely i can recognize people even in disguises or costumes if they do not disguise their voice as well. thus on halloween my slight disability becomes a slight superpower Most people have a chosen resting expression. Like how some people have resting bitch face (me), others naturally look like they have just heard something excited. That combined with mannerisms and the sound of their voice. I think if I ever went deaf I would just be screwed tbh Usually I get to know from their movement, like someone tucks their hair behind their ear often, and the other walks a little too fast, and someone else will have twitch in their upper lip, etc \nIf that fails then: Identifying features ; like a chin dimple or a ring they wear or a certain necklace I rely heavily on hair, gait, voices, and especially eyebrows. Its horrible when trying to get tested because they always take away the hair but leave the eyebrows on so sometimes I will know someone by their eyebrows. It also makes my own face unrecognizable for a while after I get my eyebrows done Voice and Smell", "saw a pic of Joaquin Pheonix but thought it was Julian Solomita but then thought maybe it was Ryan Gosling instead  This happened a while ago but I am still frustrated thinking about it. I think I saw the cover of \"her\" and thought... this is Julian photoshopped on a cover of a movie? and it all kind of went downhill from there. This just reminded me of how Julien thinks Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts and Anne Hathaway look identical. Every time that comes up I have to agree with Julien. every time a see a white man with a mustache I briefly wonder if it is just julian again I do not see it, but I also have /r/Prosopagnosia and identify Joaquin Phoenix by his harelip scar. That is Mr. Beast on that top one and you cannot convince me otherwise. I found this 5 month old post because I needed to know if I was the only one who thought they looked alike.

TLDR: How best to avoid coming across as rude, and not embarrass yourself, when trying to meet people and make new friends?  \n\nI do not think I am properly face-blind, I can recognise people after a while of knowing them, or if they have some distinctive feature. I am at a level where some films can be difficult to understand and I have been told various times that I have just walked past or served someone really famous and I am utterly oblivious.  I am hoping some of you might have tips or explain how you deal with meeting new people. I am also appalling at remembering names.\n\nAnyway, I moved to a new place, have started a new job and the covid lockdown has eased here so I should go out and meet people. It is so difficult because I will go to a meet up group, or party, and not recognise someone afterwards, which makes it so difficult to build up acquaintance to the level where it might become the start of a friendship. \n\nE.g. I met a neighbour's friend a few times last year, then I think again last week, but her hair was different and she had no make up on and I am still not sure it was her or someone else I would met previously at a party. She clearly knew me and talked to me so familiarly that I could not figure out how to check who she was.\n\nSimilarly, I will have a good, deep chat with someone new, at a gathering of some kind, then not remember who it was precisely...there might be 2 medium height white men with short hair and weak jaws and a bit of stubble and of medium build, and I will not know which it was that I talked to. So I end up feeling very vulnerable if I have talked about deeper stuff with someone new, and also run the danger of talking to the person I think is the one I talked to before, picking up where we left off, and then realise it is not the same person. A few months later, I will disbelieve that I could ever have mixed people up, but it takes a long time for me to make the distinctions. If hairstyles, hair colour, glasses, facial hair, make up, or clothes change dramatically, I have problems.\n\nI have read accounts of people with full on prosopagnosia just greeting everyone in a friendly and familiar way, and winging it, but that terrifies me because I would have people thinking I know them when do do not and probably an issue with men thinking it was some kind of flirting...\n\nHelp?! I found it really helpful to do volunteer work. It is generally the same people every time, and if you volunteer in some places (like boards of directors) everyone will have name plates every time until you are able to recognize them. I am getting more comfortable saying, \"By the way, I have face blindness so I probably will not recognize you the next time I see you. You will have to introduce yourself again but then I will know who you are.\" I agree that for women, being friendly to everyone, esp men, can be difficult and sometimes dangerous. That is why I do not feel comfortable with that approach either. Good luck! I pretty much make friends two ways:\n\n1. I get to know people in environments where there are the same people, ideally with under 30 people max.  I would try to find those!\n\n2. My husband makes friends and tells me who they are.  Fortunately we like the same people for the most part. If you fear causing a misunderstanding or putting yourself in danger treat everyone like your meeting for the first time. People you befriend let them know you are face blind and to approach you or remind you who.  It is hard for some people to grasp the concept of not being able to see faces, but for the most part people understand. Some people even have pins that mention their face blind. I have been face blind all my life. I spent most not knowing then hiding it, then the other part being open. It is best to be a open book for both you and them.", "How are you all with names? I should be decent with names, right? Given that I cannot recognize people's faces and it would be handy to have *some* way of identifying people?\n\nUnfortunately, I am bad with names. Just awful. Friends of friends, teachers, neighbors... I avoid using people's names in most conversation because sometimes, I try to reach for names I *thought* I have memorized and cannot find them.\n\nI have also noticed that I also tend to start swapping the names of some of my friends for other names when I have become too comfortable with them. Embarrassing, but thankfully after a lifetime of face blindness I am nearly immune to embarrassment :)\n\nA couple of my friends have theorized that I am not great with names because I do not have a face in my head to \"attach\" the name to, but I have no way of knowing if that is true. Thankfully since names are just a matter of memorization, I can just repeat them to myself over and over (as long as I remember!)\n\nSo how are you all with names? Better than most people? Terrible? I am also terrible with names.\n\nOne problem I have had is that if someone I have met shares a first name with a celebrity, I will sometimes just assume that their name is the celebrity's full name... because I have heard that name *somewhere*, so I assume it belongs to that person I have met, not realizing it belongs to a celebrity I am not familiar with. I am pretty bad with names, and also struggle with 'swapping names' like you. For some reason I seem to especially struggle with standard English male names, so will call a John Mark or an Ian Lee for example.  I can usually remember my own in only a couple of tries. I am terrible with names.  SO bad. Oh god, I do not do names AT ALL.  It is like the names database in my head pipes to /dev/null. I do not remember names. Ever. I do not even pretend to. Apparently to my brain, names are irrelevant as fuck.  Horrible i have explained it away with \"i have face blindness\" which i am pretty sure just confuses people.  did not even think that it is not an obvious by-product and most people think face blindness is an excuse anyway.  maybe sounds like i am making a joke or just underhandedly saying they are not important to me.  \n\nmaybe between the AI in google photos and the AI in Goggles and give me a way to recognize faces on the fly.\n\nBut I think the theory that there is no face to attach them to makes sense.  otherwise it is just a name floating around.  Obviously we remember them and all that is attached to them once they are invoked so it is not a matter of remembering names, it is a matter of attaching that name to a face. Like if I see a coworker outside of work, I have lost context for who they are.  I am TERRIBLE with names. Far worse than most people, and I do think it is related to face blindness.  Horrible. I sometimes cannot remember someone is name for months. but certain people I get immediately. I am really good with names IF I have something to attach them to.  So I used to be a substitute teacher: I can memorize the names of all the **desks** before lunch.  The kids?  Not so much...unless they stay in their desks where they belong.  And I actually find it easier to recognize kids than adults for some reason. Absolutely horrible. There is people who is names I still cannot memorize after YEARS of regularly working with them. People assume I am a tourist in my hometown because I frequently mix up the names of nearby cities. I have been trying to figure out if this condition has a name. It is really difficult to associate a name with a face when you do not remember the face between one interaction and the next. Terrible with names too. I wish I could find the source - I actually read a while ago that people who are face blind can also have trouble remembering names and other information related to a person, because they think it is stored in the same affected area of the brain... Unfortunately. At least it makes me feel better knowing why I have such difficulties. Yes, I am terrible with names too. I am even bad at remembering details of conversations, like if someone tells me their job I can never remember it later. I think my memory sucks in general.\n\nBut I also think your friends\u2019 theory has some merit. The first several times I meet someone it is like I am meeting them the first time. It is like my brain does not know how to categorize personal information about someone until I eventually learn their face.\n\nDoes anyone have trouble with remembering directions to get places too? I usually have to memorize a procedure (left, right, left, etc) rather than keeping a mental map.", "Worse than I thought?  Every once in a while a little thing like that has to happen just to keep us from getting too complacent.

I once walked up to a stranger from behind thinking she was my mom. Thankfully all I did was stand behind her for a minute before I saw my mom and realized I was with the wrong person.", "So I just recently came to terms with the fact that i am probably face blind. I was talking to someone who I just met and I could describe every part of their mannerisms and speech and how they walked but I could not picture their face. someones voice is easier to recognize to me than their face.

A friend linked an AllGasNoBreaks video where the guy went to a Nascar event and interviewed people. Apparently it was a lot of people but I thought it was only the same few guys over and over. My friend jokingly called me elitist for saying they all look the same, but... Everyone looks the same to me.

I can recognize myself in the mirror just fine. \n\nWhen I talk to people, though, somethings it takes time for it to \"click\" with who they are.

But I definitely feel like my reaction time to recognize them is slower. \n\nSometimes my friend would talk about an actor/actress in a movie and I man, sometimes I do not see the difference. For example, Scarlett Johanson. I am not sure if it is because she is blonde and has a celebrity face (so she kind of looks like every celebrity) but it is not easy recognizing her. I did not realize she played Black Widow, although I know her from Lucy. Or maybe I did not realize her because I do not follow her as a celebrity? \n\nI do not really know how to diagnosis myself. I know that there are celebrity face tests, but how accurate can that be if you do not follow celebrities? Also, there is no study or research done on it in my area. \n\nOk, to put it simply:\n\n1. I can recognize my family, friends, and myself in pictures. \n2. I tend to recognize people more on everything else but faces (but maybe that is normal). \n3. I have trouble recognizing people out of context (Ex. seeing a coworker shopping at a store). \n4. I can recognize people close to me. Or at least, for the most part, I can. Sometimes when they change clothes, it can be sudden. \n5. I can easily forget people's faces that I just met. Genuinely, I have a pretty shitty \"recall\" ability. Then again, maybe it is normal that people forget faces they just met. After all, you just met!\n6. ** Overall, people can look very familiar to me, but I cannot easily place them until I get some sort of context information. **\n\nMaybe, I am just really bad with faces. Or maybe I have a mild form of prosopagnosia. I am definitely not the best in recognizing faces, but maybe this is common.\n\nI do not know.

It changed the way I look at things. &gt;Joe Rogan Eat shit OP. Fuck if with the pseudoscience and *especially* with using Joe goddamn Rogan as a source. Nuff said. I agree. Stutters are not anywhere near the same as face blindness???? Sure, but both can be a result of brain damage. For example, stand up comedian Drew Lynch developped a stutter after having a concussion, and YouTuber Katzun developped face blindness as a result of their concussion. If shrooms can fix a stutter that was caused by brain damage, there might be a chance that it could fix prosopagnosia or other conditions caused by brain damage. But is there actual proof that his stutter was only fixed by the psychedelics? I am familiar with both people you used as reference, I am actually a fan of both! But would you tell them they can fix their problems with the psychedelics, especially if you do not know if it truly does work?\n\nIn addition, neither of those people seem to be licensed doctors of any sort, one is even a comedian, why should we just trust what they are saying with no proof? no I am not familiar with the person claiming shrooms fixed their stutter, and I would not tell someone to try a \"treatment\" without proof that it actually works. However, the post is not claiming shrooms can fix prosopagnosia, it is someone wondering if someone has tried it or researched it.

Absolutely. But only in person, or on good recordings. I have problems with cell phones or if there are any distortions.  Oh, absolutely.  This is one of the key indicators I use to identify someone.  I think it is similar to how if you loose one sense, the others get stronger to compensate. I feel like I am okay.

Depends on the voice, but yes\n When I talk to clients I recognize voices instantly but in my head everyone is face looks the same. A Dark figure wearing sunglasses.

I may even have a bit of an emotional reaction understanding that I have had either positive or negative experiences with the person. And the second they speak I know who they are.  I remember when I learned about Capgras delusion that felt familiar. People become convinced that their family have been replaced with replicas. But the delusion only happens with visual stimuli. If they talk to people on the phone they recognize them. Yes but this also can cause me to have a startle reaction to people I am supposed to know well.

New class, new kids, new parents. And with 200+ kids in each grade the combinations are endless. \n\nThanks for listening to my despair.\n\n OMG yes! Once I had to pick up my niece from preschool. (It was my turn.) All the kids were in the playground and it seemed like all the girls were blond with a ponytail. I did not know which one was her. I waited for her to run up you me, and she did not. I started panicking, and one of the teachers came up and said, \"Can I help you?\" \n\nI explained I was there to pick up my niece and she said, \"Her mom already picked her up.\"\n\nI laughed (haha) and said, \"No wonder I did not see her.\"\n\n\nThen a few years later I had to pick my son up from school. I worked the graveyard shift so I was able to volunteer in his class a lot, so lots of the kids knew me. They would wave and say \"hi\" and I would pretend to know them.\n\nI was a few seconds late, so some kids had already left the class. I was waiting for my son to come out, and he never did. I looked in the classroom and there were no more kids. While I was standing there a kid came up to me and said, \"Mommy, you walked right past me!\"\n\nI said, \"I am sorry, I did not see you.\"\n\nHe said, \"You waved right at me!\"\n\nI said, \"I did not know it was you.\"\n\n(My son is also faceblind, so he understood.)\n\nI used to try to hide it, now I tell everyone. I tell them it is not personal, I cannot recognize my own husband or son. I try to tell a funny story about it. People will now come up to me and tell me who they are before they say anything else. It has made my life much easier.  Wow that sounds rough. Thanks for commiserating x  Concentrate on making some friends.  When they become good friends discuss your proso and educate them.  Then ask them to put the word out.   So if your son is face blind, how did he pick you out?   Do you wear a unique hat or something? The struggle is real I am 6'3\". If I am standing up, he can recognize me. :)\n\nSitting down? A whole other story. Faceblindness is both funny and mind trippingly scary.\n\n\n If you do not think you are ready to tell everyone, try just telling one person and see how it goes. Or just wait until you introduce yourself to someone and when they say they know you, laugh, apologize, and let them know you have Faceblindness.\n\n\nAt least they will not think they are totally forgettable :)  That must be tough for him.   Hang in there. Thanks for your reply. It is good advice. I guess because i do not have it as bad as some people I feel like a hyperchondriac  talking about it...  Now imagine you are a teacher in that school I am doing teaching degree. *despair* Why though, you like it or? I like teaching. It just takes me ages to tell the students apart. I have methods that help though.", "Weird thing happened to me I have Proso and I am aware of it but last week when I was talking with my sister her face was changing all the time her eyes and nose keep get bigger and smaller all her face! I could not handle it I looked away. I do not like that .cannot remember my family faces is enough for me. I do not know if this is on the mark but have you heard of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome? I have it. It usually hits me at night. Never heard that I am looking for it thank you \n\nCould this be it? I have heard of something similar in my proso research. A case study on someone with an acquired form of proso from epilepsy. They were doing some ECT, and the patient suddenly starts seeing the doctor's face as kind of melting. There was another who said their doctor's face \"just metamorphosed\"  during a treatment, however, I cannot remember what exactly that treatment was.", "Umbrella Academy I enjoyed this Netflix series. I found all the characters to be unique and distinct enough to know who they all were, at all times. Except... Diego (number 2). In the second season, am I the only one who could not get their head around them looking like an entirely different person.\n\n(\n\nturned into:\n\n( \n\nThat is never the same person! I had trouble seeing them as the same character. Oh yeah. I totally looked up to see what actor recast him. Turns out it is the same person. Haha, I have only gotten up to the second episode of the second season and I am wondering why I have to re-remember who these people are again. Totally makes sense now. I even watched the first season right before the second one came out which probably did not help much.  The MFers covered his goddam eyebrow scar.  SURE COVER THE ONLY EASILY IDENTIFIABLE THING WITH BANGS wtf HIS THING IS KNIVES dude you will want to get the hair out of your eyes, right SO CUT YOUR HAIR so you can see\n\n*so I can see your eyebrows*", "People that help My husband is horrible at nonverbal social hints.  Like if I indicate privately that I am ready to leave a party, he will verbally ask if I did that because I wanted to leave right now instead of indicating he wants to stay a little longer or starting to leave.  He is not trying to be a jerk; his parents have really bad social skills and he learned a bunch of stuff wrong.\n\nSo he is great at facial recognition which helps me make friends (we like the same people usually, so he makes friends with them first and then I kind of jump in) BUT he is terrible at subtlety.  I would love it if he could just slip in people's name and a cue about who they are when we run into someone, but he does not usually and if he does, it always sounds weird.  I keep telling him a need a people recognizing assistant and I have hired him.  Maybe he will eventually learn.\n\nBut I never thought of our son as a possible helper.  He is four now and was recently diagnosed with some sensory processing issues.  He saw the same person for the evaluation with the occupational therapist, but we do not have a regular time for a weekly appointment which means he sees whomever.  I forgot to remind him that it might be a different person at his first post-evaluation appointment.  \n\nWhen the OT came out, I could not tell if it was the evaluator or someone else.   Both were young and had straight blonde hair.  BUT my son clutched my hand tight when I asked if he wanted me to stay or go this time (he would have wanted me to go if it was the same person,) so I know it was someone new.  It was fantastic!\n\nSo it is okay if I bring my kid everywhere with me just to see if I am supposed to recognize people right? Great benefit of having a child! Maybe I should get myself one!!! \n\nIt made me wonder though, if you have difficulty recognising faces and you have an older child, it must be a nightmare if you tell her/him that s/he cannot see such and such friend, because that friend is a bad influence. If your child was rebelling (like most teenagers), you could end up having the unsuitable friend hanging round in your own house and not realise. This post has really got me thinking now. We have guide dogs (and ponies!) for people who are visually impaired, and dogs (and many animals) recognise people by scent. Could an artificial nose (scent analyser) be developed to be programmed with your the signature natural scent of people you know/meet, which would give an ID when you next encounter them? You could wear it like a watch, or it could be like a mobile phone, it would register the scent and give you the person's name. Glance at your wrist and you would know who you were talking to. It could beep or vibrate when someone you have programmed it to 'know' (like a really close friend or relative) is near, so you can greet them and do not blank them. Hmmm. I do not think technology has caught up to a dog's nose for recognizing things. That is why we still use dogs to sniff out drugs, bombs, and missing people! Give it 20 years! I know dogs *can* recognise people by scent, but I do not think this is fast or reliable. My dog often fails to recognise me: when I wear a wig, when I wear a face mask, even if I wear different clothes. It can take her up to 10 seconds to recognise that it is actually me.\n\nMaybe my dog has some kind of scent blindness. Or vision works over longer distances than scent on a moving person. This is in my house, over a distance of about 2m.", "Does your brain try to lie to you? Was not sure how to word the title without making it long and title gore.\n\nOkay so I have been with my fiance for 4 years now. I know his voice, how he dresses, his hair, all that jazz. \n\nSometimes we will be laying in bed or hanging out and he goes to kiss me, I see his face and for a second my brain says, \"who the heck is that!? Do not kiss him your taken!!\"\n\nI live with him. I know its him logically, but my brain still makes me feel like I am cheating or makes me hold back for a second.\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else? I assume it is the prosopagnosia just messing with me. Face blindness causes anxious feelings, that is a fact.  Really? I did not know that, makes sense though! My brain sometimes does this with my own goddamn reflection", "What show has aggravated your Proso the most? I recall during my childhood a show called Omar Series that is supposed to be a historical recreation of a biography of a man named Omar. I have watched the show (or at least like the first ten episodes) over and over in my childhood but I swear, I have never gotten any better at identifying the people. It is literally all a bunch of Arab men with pretty much the same skin tones and beards. A true nightmare. They all dress in bland looking robes too because of the ancient fashion and desert climate, which adds to the difficulty. And do not even get me started on even attempting to remember the names. If you want to experience Proso on steroids if you have a milder case, try watching it.\n\nWhat is your most-difficult-to-watch series? Orphan Black was confusing as all hell for me on the first watch.\n\nNot because I could not tell characters apart, they all wildly shuffled up the makeup/hair (even the performances) but because I could not necessarily tell straight away which of them were clones. (if you do not know the show, basically one actress plays like 10 different characters on it that are all clones)\n\nSeriously, first time Cosima was on screen I was like \"and this is?\", actress was wearing heels for that character and not the other two so she moved differently. Twin Peaks. I heard it was just the kind of show I would adore but I cannot keep up with the characters, too many people look alike and there is so much going on. Cooper is easy enough to tell apart from everyone else but it is like the people all dress the same, talk the same, their hairstyles are similar, etc. I love the show tho tbh, I just hate that I cannot ever tell wtf is going on because I cannot tell who is who. Anything with a bunch of white guys in suits. For whatever reason I seem to have a slightly easier time telling women apart. Handmaid's Tale! They are all wearing the same thing! \nGame of Thrones is a close second. Agents of shield. So many characters have similar hair! Anything in a military or school uniform setting. iZombie season 2\n\n&gt;!I thought Vaughn and Angus were the same character until Major kidnapped Angus.  I was so excited he kidnapped Vaughn because he was crazy and was very confused when he was in the next episode.!&lt; I thought Haunting of Hill House only had half as many characters as it actually did.  The women needed more hair colors. It is the opposite of your question, but I watched altered carbon, and one of my friends said I would hate it because characters change bodies and faces all the time, but I never had a problem with that show for some strange reason Hypotheses:\n\n1. Because the characters change bodies, the writers make an effort to ensure the audience knows who is who. \n\n2. Way more variety in actors\u2019 physical attributes, personality, and clothing. I think both these things, yes Anime can help a little there - the main characters, at least, tend to have hair colors picked from different parts of a psychedelic rainbow, and usually have oversized and individual hairstyles. Same. Me and my sister watched it and I was constantly asking her who was who. So many similar looking people. Oh my god yes, I tried watching handmaid\u2019s tale and while there were some other reasons I did not like it as much, the main reason was because I could not tell like any of the girls apart. The only identifying feature is their face which is exactly what I cannot identify lol I think it is because women almost always have accessories or some kind of personal touch (this is just my own biased opinion) and guys seem to just dress from one copy/pasted outfit selection that they all share Game of thrones.\nSo many main characters!\nI constantly had to guess or ask my boyfriend \"hey is that the guy from x 5 episodes earlier?\" Anything that is about politics, because everyone is white, everyone is old, no one has a crazy haircut, and they are all in suits.\n\nLike, when I watched House of Cards, I literally had to ask my girlfriend all the time \"this guy has appeaed before?\" like, I only recognized Kevin Spacey in there. &gt;Seriously, first time Cosima was on screen I was like \"and this is?\", actress was wearing heels for that character and not the other two so she moved differently.\n\nI literally had to rely on the gasps of other characters to figure out someone was a clone, and I went way too long not realizing one of the villains was a clone...  \n\n\nin the end i managed to latch on to her perfectly trimmed eyebrows that looked exactly the same on every clone... which i mean was good for my proso but kind of messed with the immersion lol never had a big problem with AOS myself... at least not the main cast, i think i got a little confused when they added a bunch of new characters but they had a good amount of diversity which helped... I saw a movie like 9 years ago with some family, I was not fully invested but it was about a cop who goes undercover in the mafia, and a guy from the mafia who goes undercover as a cop... both of these where white guys with dark hair and wore similar styles and for the life of me i spent half the movie thinking it was the same person going back and forth between the cops and the gangsters, and at the end of the movie when they actually came face to face i was still confused who was who Oh, definitely. Most of what I watch is animated. That is actually common for people with proso since cartoons are processed differently than faces. Band of Brothers. Really good show, excellent actors, but apart from a couple people I had no idea who anyone was. Kind Of hard to be sad about a main character dying when you have no clue who it is! \n\nI have been watching Black Sails recently and the main cast is all pretty easy to follow, secondary cast I keep mixing up though. \n\nI like superheroes, fantasy and sci-fi. Greater range of distinguishing features! Mad Men and Dollhouse. Mad Men because of the whole \"middle-aged white dudes in suits\" thing, and Dollhouse because I kept losing track of who was a staff member and who was a Doll, and whether x person was a Doll or a client. ORPHAN BLACK SAME.  I watched the first season with friends but could not watch it alone because I would get so confused. Agreed.  There is a lot more variation in women's fashion than in men's.  Plus if it is a white guy in a suit, he probably has short hair and there is only so many types of short hair.  Facial hair seems to go with the time the movie was made, so may or may not help. Anything involving disguises unless it is a comedy (and they are ridiculous) is no good.  Plus, often it is too fast paced for someone to tell you who the people are. Vikings... They all have better beards than me and they introduce characters at light speed. I am watching the last few episodes right now and all I know is that the blonde people are fighting against the dark haired people. Even when I was a kid, police shows, where they would have a witness pick the suspect out of a lineup.  I would think to myself \"nobody can do that...\" ME. I legit watched all those forensics file rosier, crime documentaries, etc, and any time they would get to recognizing faces via lineups or drawings or even irl with Missing posters, I just assumed these were extra desperate measures because there is no way the average or even most people can do anything with them. My life is a lieeeeee", "CMV: These are literally two different people  Wait, are they or are they not? They are both Anne Hathaway in The Princess Diaries! Thank you for the clarification. But OP needs to learn the meaning of the word \u201cliterally\u201d. Yeah, can definitely be confusing, in this sub especially. Only reason I knew is because I have seen that movie so many times! Yes i was thinking. \"Of course they are different. Just look at them\" Her teeth are different! Her eyes are a different color! &gt; Anne Hathaway in The Princess Diaries!\n\nAre you saying both pictures are of her at the same age?\n\nI might be able to believe that they are the same person with pictures taken several years apart. Yup, same age. Part of the movie is that her character undergoes a makeover, so the confusion is understandable &gt;  her character undergoes a makeover\n\nWell, that is not even fair thnn. I get that they did the hollywood hair/makeup/glasses thing \n\nbut their cheek structures and chin are very different from this picture???? This is why Clark Kent is able to keep his identity hidden lmao. I think that is just a facial expression thing? The smile accentuates the cheekbones and chin, versus the more slack expression with an open mouth, which will not emphasize either The only reason I know they are not is because I have seen the movie. I literally could not believe anyone could think they were the same person. Asked my parents and a friend. They all said same!! Wtf They do look different though actually (I do not have prosopagnosia). Tbf they do look very different in these photos, but people will recognize them as the same person. Are they not?", "Gosh I am so glad there is a name for this. All my life I thought there was something really wrong with me. Where should I start from? The terror of watching a movie with two male leading actors? Have fun telling which is which. If you have the same hair color with that old classmate I have not seen in years then you are surely her and I will greet you despite not really knowing you. Want To know why I like men with long hair? Because I can tell who I am dating more easily as literally every man with short hair ever looks like every other man in the world. You think I must at least have a good memory for names? Lol. Of course not.  welcome among us !\nyes, it is a release when you finally put a name on it.\neven though it does not make you forget all the little past shames and the ones to come...\ud83d\ude04\n &gt;Want To know why I like men with long hair?\n\nDamn, that is an advanced level coping strategy, how have I never thought of this before?!? \ud83d\ude02 Back in college i liked this guy with long hair. Could recognise him pretty easy. The bugger went and cut his hair after a few weeks!  Sure, it looked good, but couldnt pick him out of a group anymore it was such a pain! I reckon the reason i also have a poor memory for names as well is because when you learn a new name but cant attach it to a person properly because of recognition issues, the name just ends up as this isolated thing with no relevance you have to try and remember! I immediately develop crushes on redheads and often people with curly hair. I think it is just because I recognize them first. Oh shit, I think I just realized why I find body modification so attractive I definitely cannot see myself ever in a relationship with a person without distinctive features.  My husband is super easy to pick out for a number of reasons; never confused him with anyone else, even when I first met him.  Pretty attractive to me.\n\nI did not realize it for a long time, but growing up none of my friends were conventionally attractive.  I have one friend now who is absolutely beautiful...and completely stands out next to most middle age moms.\n\nI feel kind of bad that I am apparently picking friends based on appearance.  I can be friendly with people easily, but it is hard for me to make friends until I can recognize the person reliably.  At that time, often the window has passed.", "Is just faces in particular? I suppose it is different with varying degrees of prosopagnosia, but can you all identify animals? I used to have a chocolate lab. I could distinguish between her and a dozen other dogs based on facial bone structure, even though most chocolate labs look about the same due to inbreeding. But can you all distinguish between people with different bone structures? I know hairstyles and clothing can help, but if you can identify that, then why cannot you identify faces? \n\nI just found out about this condition. To me it is wild because recognizing people is such a fundamental part of my life. I am just curious how broad the scope is for this condition, whether you all can identify bone structure, nose shapes, or whatever in people and animals.\n\nI literally cannot imagine life with this condition, so major props to those who can manage. Typically the way people recognize people's faces is different than the way they recognize other things.  I can identify animals fairly easily, especially if it is a type of animal that I have experience with; the same as most people.  \n\nI can recognize my dog easily even in a group of 20 other dogs of her breed - of course there are behavioral difference that help, but also I can recognize her by her features.  But I probably would not recognize another dog that was not mine that I petted briefly if I saw it the next day in a group of 20 different dogs sans owners, right?  (Unless I had taken the effort to learn the dog's features or the dog had some notable traits.)\n\nApparently, most people who go to a party with 20 people and talk with one briefly, would recognize them the next day even if they did not remember their name.  People with prosopagnosia would not, because trying to recognize people by features is less efficient than using the whole face.\n\nMost people's brains work differently, with deficits in some areas and other areas that are above average.  It is hard to imagine a brain that works differently than your own.  My brain remembers color very well, so I use it as an organizational and a study aid.  Life seems like it would be significantly harder if I were color blind, but people who are color blind generally seem to think it is an annoying inconvenience at times (because other people function differently - it is not the color blindness that is the problem; it is people like me using color coding) and normal the rest of the time. &gt; My brain remembers color very well, so I use it as an organizational and a study aid.\n\nI am very visual, so I can remember EIR as E=I*R (Ohm's Law) for electrical applications - Voltage (E), Current (I), and Resistance (R). From there it is just a matter of isolating the thing I want to find. So if I have current and voltage, I can visualize that really easily. \n\n&gt;Most people's brains work differently, with deficits in some areas and other areas that are above average.\n\nSo I mentioned that I am visual. I can recall faces, buildings, etc without much difficulty, though remembering the names that go along with them is difficult. I am also convinced that I have some kind of Auditory Processing Disorder. I have difficulty remembering words and hearing lyrics in a song. I can remember directions, but that is because I can picture what to look for, ie street signs. If you just tell me words that I need to remember without letting me read them, I find it very challenging. I cannot carry a conversation if there is too much background noise. I have to be able to hear the other person(s) clearly. Song lyrics are very challenging for me. I can do it sometimes, but I need to really concentrate and separate the music from the words, which is really too much effort for casual listening. I can remember and with perfect pitch sing a melody that I hear, though, although I cannot tell what notes I am singing. I do not have any particular problem distingusing other things - just the one thing that would be most useful is diffiult for me ;) I used to have 2 grey gerbils, very, very similar in appearance and had no trouble picking out \"Gerb\" and \"Bill\" (very creative naming!). When I was young my mum was impressed that I could identify virtually any make/model of car, even quite similar ones at a fair distance.  Several parts of the brain are involved in processing information about faces. If there is damage, or connective issues between those areas, then difficulty with recognition will occur.\n\nFace recognition is really important for humans, which is why we have evolved specific parts of the brain to deal with it. That is why if you are face blind, it is just faces that are an issue, we have other options for recognising people.\n\nFace Blindness can occur alongside other neurological differences. I have aphantasia, I am also autistic, I have topographical agnosia too. My brain is wired very differently. It is cool.  I am a little different. I can tell animals apart, but as a kid I had this recurring nightmare there were duplicates in my house and I could not tell the impostors from the originals. This may have just been some subconscious processing of how human faces were to me, but to this day I still prefer unique looking animals. My dog, for example, is utterly bizarre looking in an adorable, non-gremlin sort of way. And I usually find one distinguishing characteristic on animals as well as humans to try to help me if I get confused. \n\nBut the human facial identification thing is real. If I recall correctly, it is pretty unique to us as a species to see faces where there are none (eg, the man in the moon). And I see faces in random patterns, too, despite having pretty extreme prosopagnosia.  That is pretty wild. It sounds like most can find a feature - shape of ears, nose, eyes, whatever - and use that instead of a whole face. \n\n&gt;it is pretty unique to us as a species to see faces where there are none\n\nDo you see faces in cars? If not, does ( help? I do not see faces in cars normally, but yes that does help! It is a bit of an effort to see the face in the photo portion, but the drawings are easy.  That is so wild. You can distinguish between drawings of an exaggerated face but not actual human faces. What about cartoons? I would imagine those are pretty easy because the creators try to make their characters stand out, so they give them notable features. For me, human faces specifically pretty much all look identical. Other things are far easier to visually distinguish.\n\nBut I *do* have a poor visual memory overall. When tested, I am pretty good with other types of memory, like learning lists of words and reciting them back, but then when it comes to visual memory I am down at the bottom percentile.\n\nI can tell my cats apart, but they do not look even remotely similar. If, say, I had two Siamese, would I be able to learn to distinguish their faces? I do not know. Maybe I would learn to, or maybe I would not. Because for me specifically, there is the poor visual memory to go along with the prosopagnosia, so maybe I would not ever learn to tell one Siamese cat apart from other Siamese from their faces.\n\nI do have trouble telling cars apart, compared to other people. When looking for my car I have been known to get drawn off-course by other red cars, even if they are by different manufacturers. No, that is not what this condition is at all. Of course I can distinguish between faces in a line (you did not actually ask me that though). I can look back and forth between them and see the differences, like one of those \u201cwhat is missing?\u201d drawings. But if you show me a different string of faces and then ask me which one I have seen before, I cannot do that unless someone had a very unique feature (and at that point it is just an educated guess). &gt;When looking for my car I have been known to get drawn off-course by other red cars, even if they are by different manufacturers.\n\nThat must be a whole lot of fun lol. My grandma put window stickers on her car so she can know which one it is while she is walking in the parking lot. If it does not have those paw prints and a shitload of ferret bumper stickers, it is not her car. \n\n&gt;I am pretty good with other types of memory, like learning lists of words and reciting them back\n\nYou could tell me a list of words and unless I picture those words, I will not remember them. Directions are easy because I can picture street signs, but just audibly, I cannot remember it. Melodies are easy for me to repeat. Hearing lyrics in songs is difficult. I can match the pitch perfectly after hearing it once, but I cannot hear what the actual words are unless I am really trying to. Oh, okay, gotcha. Sorry for the misunderstanding.  &gt; But can you all distinguish between people with different bone structures? I know hairstyles and clothing can help, but if you can identify that, then why cannot you identify faces? \n\nI can actually recognize people mostly fine, because I have so many workarounds. Those workarounds include things like body type and bone structure. They also include things like a person's gait and other movements.\n\n&gt;   I am just curious how broad the scope is for this condition, whether you all can identify bone structure, nose shapes, or whatever in people and animals.\n\nI can still see facial features -- I can tell the difference between bushy eyebrows and thin, bearded vs non, different eyes. Sometimes I can use these features to identify a person in the future.\n\nThe problem is that these features are not inherently \\*distinguishing\\*. It just does not come together and link to a person's identity. That is why I have to find other ways to do so. By looking at their noses I can determine if a cat or a dog is male or female.  \n I can usually recognise when I have met a dog or cat before. Their owners, no.\n\nIf you want to know what it is like (for me at least) the best I can come up with is: there was a film (think it was the Ring?) where faces in photos kept getting blurred out. That is what it is like trying to recall a face. Hair, clothes etc are all there, but the face is just kind of...blank.\nI read somewhere that it is to do with most people's brains processing faces as a single image, whereas with proso the parts seem to get processed separately. \n\n\n", "Told friends about my prosopagnosia, but I still feel anxious when they mention it My friends know about my prosopagnosia, and they understand. Still, on occasion it is come up (related to the conversation or because I did not recognize someone), and I feel like I have been *exposed*...but I am the one that told them. \n\nI still try to compensate, and I still try to fake it when I cannot figure out who someone is. I get frustrated with myself when I fail to recognize people correctly. Like I need to try harder. But it is a neurological condition, so it is not that simple. \n\nI had thought the anxiety around being faceblind would go away if people knew about and accepted it. I dunno, I just want to feel comfortable with myself. When did you tell your friends?  If it is recently, it may just take some getting used to.  Did they say it around someone new?  If so, let them know that you would prefer to keep it private.\n\nI recently talked to my boss about it, and just caught myself using one a typical cover phrase when I had no idea who someone was even though she would not have cared and no one was around.  Felt dumb afterward.  It is just so habitual in my language. I told them months ago. They have not said anything around people that did not already know, so they are not being rude or anything. It seems I am just oddly sensitive about it. \n\nYeah, I do the same kind of thing! I guess I have been hiding for so long, it is hard not to. I would like to at least be open and comfortable around my close friends. I found out I was faceblind about 15 years ago and have concluded that telling people is not worth it and apart from a couple of occasions I have always wished I had not. People generally do not respond with interest, understanding or even politeness and I find it annoying when they say something like \"I am bad with names too\". In fact I fell into the trap two nights ago, talking with someone who brought up the subject of brains and their function. I told him I was face blind and he barely paused to draw breath before he carried on talking about something else. It is a big thing for me to share that piece of information and I was very offended.  I am not saying you should never talk about your prosopagnosia, but as it is such a personal subject you might want to limit who you discuss it with to sensible and respectful people.", "That time I actually did not know the person. I was leaving work once, about 9oclock at night, the office was in the centre, but just down a darkened side road. As I am walking, a girl from the other side of the road gives me a bit of a whistle, gets my attension and beckons me over. As is a normal occurance, I have no idea who she is. So I cross the road, smiling, then it dawns on me that I actually *do not* know this girl, and this isnt just a prosopagnosia job,  and I have just crossed over the road to what I know realize is quite clearly a prostitute.\n\nI am a couple of metres from her when I realize this, and, ever the way with words, panic and say \"no no no no sorry sorry sorry sorry no no no\" and walked off quickly. \n\nShe must have thought that I ***was*** looking for a prostitute, but when I got closer to her I decided she wasnt good enough and decided no. So I probably mortally offended her honour. \n\nAnyway, offended or not, she starts following me. So I had to get a taxi for the 300 metre walk home. That sounds awful. I am sorry that happened to you, but this is now my favorite prosopagnosia story.  Her following you is not cool.  The rest is just an unfortunate misunderstanding. You should post this in TIFU too", "Are there different levels of prosopagnosia and how are they different from each other? I personally do not have it (or at the very least I do not think I do) but I have been interested in the topic for a while now and I just cannot get an answer to this question. I have seen people say they cannot recognise any faces and have a hard time seeing all the features, other have a time remembering faces which is what led me to have questions about this.\n\nIf you have an answer I would greatly appreciate it!", "Crosspost - OP: I moved Adam Driver's eyes down. Me: And now I do not recognize him.  Yep. I have tagged him as \"massive long nose\" and moving the eyes removes his feature! Same!  Thank goodness for the occasional face with such a distinguishing feature. I could not recognize him even before the eyes moved down :( He goes from Adam Driver to James Franco got me.", "Prosopagnosia + aphantasia = strange memory loss? Hi, I am not sure if it is a kind of prosopagnosia or a strange effect of my aphantasia. So I have a strong aphantasia, I have no inner eye, no imagination of sounds, smells or tastes. It is fine, but I also cannot recall a persons face.\n\nI can speak face to face with you, but after looking away I forget in this moment your hair (length, color, ...), your facial feature, your voice, sometimes even the sex/gender. I remember the content of the conversation (as concepts/points). If I look back, I possible can identify you at the moment. But some minutes later without interactions I could have the feeling *I saw you somewhere.* Or I will never reconize you again (happened every time after emotional incidents). It is really bad if I ordered something in a restaurant and cannot say which waiter served us. Family is kind of okay, but customer or store clerks are so-so (more via context than the voice or visual) and neighbors are mostly strangers (but their dogs are easy to identify).\n\nBut I can identify people by their walk even by the sound of their walking. Or if the person has a very strong facial feature or I am told to look at a specific part, then I can put a *tag* to the person. But mostly the people become simple concepts like cute, *salesman-clothes*, *looks like a math teacher*, *student of philosophie* and so on. Aphantasia works more with concepts, categories, tags and comparison. \n\nAnother factor is, that I cannot repeat a sentence, names or a middle long number the instance I hear them. A sentence becomes a concept of the content. Names are pointless if I can not read the written form of it. And numbers need to become a melodic or visual pattern. \n\nIs this memory loss a kind of prosopagnosia, a stupid combination with aphantasia or something different. It is not a prosopagnosia you are describing but something much more serious. How long has this been? I would highly recommend you to visit a doctor. I have this problem since birth, so it was always like \"I am really bad with peoples faces\". The aphantasia is also like \"I am a really bad learner and untalented in everything\". After realizing that aphantasia is a thing, I understand myself so much more. And I learned that the school system is the most stupid system ever: remember the exact definition, remember the song/poem, draw from memories. I am good with concepts and logic that is okay, for the other parts I only need a lot of references, technical helper and a supportive family.\nThe \"forgetting people memory\" is unlucky but it is a stable condition. I hoped I could find an explanation for this. I think I have prosopagnosia and aphantasia too. I identify a lot with what you have said. Sometimes I feel like I have a goldfish memory, I forget what people have said, I forget who said it, unless I am really paying attention or write it down. I agree, this sounds way beyond proso although the commonalities mean that proso strategies will help you with that element of it. I think we all recognise the tagging of people. I would  have to say find more specific help, either medical or a support group for people with this specific condition. Good luck. I have this as well but rather mild compared to yours. I look at someone and I can see them fine, but when I look away and try to visualize their face, it is either not there or extremely warped and broken and completely unrecognizable. I can still remember hair and i can remember eye color but cannot visualize it.\n\nI started noticing this problem about a year ago and it is slowly getting slightly worse.\n\nIf you find anything about it please let me know as it would be greatly appreciated Just found this group today and also having the same issue. Has anyone found someone to help them with this issue?", "Would you like to take over the Faceblind Podcast? Hello friends! 2 years ago, I started the ( project to interview folks with faceblindness. The goal was to normalize the condition and offer coping skills for people just discovering they might have it.   It has been a great ride, and I am proud and honored to be a part of each of these special conversations. Along the way, something unexpected happened... for me! The low (and sometimes high) level anxiety I have always felt in social situations around proso disappeared. I believe this is due to the process of being so personally &amp; publicly open about it, and deeply exploring the experiences of others. On this front, the discussion with Chris Lipford had a profound effect on my thinking.\n\nIn parallel with that realization, other priorities in life have sprung up. I no longer have the time to continue the project. Rather than just killing it, I thought I would offer it up for anyone here who might like to take over its stewardship.\n\nOther than time, it costs almost nothing to record and publish. And, I would certainly stay on as long as you need to coach and advise. If you feel comfortable using tools like Skype, Google Docs, or Microsoft Office, I am confident you can record and produce this podcast. No audio engineering experience required. It is a well oiled, turnkey machine. Just needs a driver!\n\nPlease email me  if you might be interested. Thanks for the hard work and enthusiasm, I hope you can find someone to take the reigns! Very kind, you are welcome! Thanks so much for the project and your generosity!! The discussion with Chris Lipford was great, that and his comments on this sub totally changed the game for me as well", "Does someone here also have aphantasia? I can\u00b4t recognize people i just met 30mins later, whitout really thinking.  \nwhen i want to remember someone i \"scan\" them, like, big lips, short long eyebrows, a mole in their left cheek or something. And sometimes dosen't really work.  \nI would realy like to read some experiences and what is your metod to remember a person you just met : ) I work in retail and a lot of my job features having to go get a product and then come back to them. I can do all the \"face scanning\" I want, but it is useless. Instead, I focus on what they are wearing. And gender. Red coat, high heels. Or glasses and whacky earrings. Then I have to ask the customer to please stay where they are, because I will not be able to find them when I come back...and nothing is more embarrassing than holding up a product and saying \"Who was asking for this? when the customer is literally standing right there.... *raises hand*. I have made one or two threads about this in the past, it seems there is no consistent link between the two. Or synesthesia, which I also have enough of to confuse my memory of names. For people close to me or important to remember, I can memorize their faces: mole near temple, green eyes, strong jawline, widow's peak, etc., and repeat that over and over again while looking at them over a long period of time, much like studying for a test. Also like studying for a test, it is time-intensive and I cannot remember every single person in the world, so I save it for when I am seeing enough of them lately that it is going to be a problem soon otherwise. I do not have aphantasia in the least. Most of the time, I can visualize things that are about as vivid as real life. Oftentimes, I will not remember whether I read something in a book or saw it on TV, because I \"see\" pretty much the same thing either way.\n\nI generally just pretend I know who people are, since there is no way in hell I would recognize someone unless I have seen them dozens or even hundreds of times. Yes. I have both. Equally cursed and blessed, so the saying goes. Hyperphantasia actually when you imagine a person, their faces look like, actual blurryness to you? maybe you have hyperphantasia like the other guy, RadioactiveJoy When did you realize aphantasia was not a \"normal\" thing?  \n  it was weird to me knowing everybody else could see real images in their heads, like, the one phase \"picture yourself in your happy plase\"... or, \"how do they look like\", It is just to much to explain, some people feel like i ignore them, and is just that i don really know if their are or not a person i know. I do the same thing...somethimes when i meet someone new and they are about to leave, i tell them to say hi first if they see me the next time, and then just say a short reason \"i do not have a great memory\". And save the --\"i do not remember my parther of  2,5 years relationship face, so i will not remember yours\", For later...(now i kind of think is a combination of both things) ( Do you have aphantasia AND synesthesia?  \n  Idk if you mean the names of this things or people's, so that makes me remember that the times i meet a group of 5 or more people, i can remember names (most of the times just a couple) but do not know witch goes with who. It is frustrating. Im a bartender. Sometimes when the bar ins't that full my boss makes me go waiter,  encourage people to get a new, fancy drink, etc. It is just all a big mess; my bar dosen't really have tables, so i need to remember where they were, what they wanted and who they were, plus if they already play for the drinks or not.  \n I LOVE mixology, but these kind of things stress me out.   \nLET ME PREPARE YOU THAT; DO NOT MOVE, pLeAsE (then i die).\n\nYou with a product is me with a drink, litteraly yelling trough the loud music, sometimes people see me weirdly.\n\nThanks, for the clothes thing... i just try to see their bracelets, rings, or hand tattos, so when they pay me i remember if and when i received the money. (scaning their hands when they touch the menu, grab the dink, give me the money... new ring new person :v) I have all three, fairly mild prosopagnosia, letter-color synesthesia (the plain boring one most people get), and aphantasia, I basically can only visualize direct memories I have seen many times, and in small chunks. (Eg. I cannot visualize a room, or an imaginary necklace, but I can visualize a necklace I use often. Proportions and perspective still go wobbly.)\n\nWhat confuses me with names is the synesthesia, my brain archives new words as colors first, so then I am there going \"ah yes your name was... sort of purplish with a bit of blue... fuck.\" It is like a list of parts. I can only see one thing at a time I cannot see the whole. that is funny, sorry... at least you can identify people with their colors(? ok.no. like, IRL just by parts?  \nFor me IRL all okay. But in my mind  i cannot  see anything. Is just  a list of parts a sizes for me. So, 30 mis later, when i need to remember who they where, is just nothing. I cannot even conseptualize like i do with objets. I know it is funny, do not worry XD, but on top of the prosopagnosia it is definitely given me a complex about calling people by name. Only best friends! Even then it is hard, I have a \"Miriam\" and I always want to say another friend's name \"Maril\u00f9\". Not as severe as I guess that sounds. Because obviously my eyes work I am seeing the faces but it is not registering right. It is like a looking through a pinhole. I can only comprehend one thing at a time. So I just keep my focus moving. Faces move and change a lot so i just follow. So it is almost like hyper focus.  \n\nThat is why I like weird people, weird shapes, odd features I can pick them no problem. I cannot tell people are identical twins when they are standing next to each other until it is pointed out and I think people that look very similarly are the same person if they are never together. I have made that mistake idk how many times. But I also did not care about them enough to try, that was just my brain coasting along doing it is thing. I called  a friend other name and he  did not tell me :c, wasen't a problem for him, so, there was i, calling a guy named Fabrizio, Juan, for at least 5 months.Both guys are from the same group of friends, so i remember the names but not who was who.  \n(at least yours where similar(? ) oops :P\n\nthese are kind of similar, but the problem is the color's kind of independent from the order of the letters, so I will basically get any name that is an anagram or close enough, and people will be like, \"that is not similar at all!\". Cannot think of a person's name right now but I always confuse \"Napoli\" and \"Milano\". They look nothing like if I write them or say them, but in my mind, they are just a letter apart, all yellows and greens like bamboo with a little sky showin. Yup. Interestingly enough I always knew I had prosopagnosia, I learned about 2 minutes ago that I also have aphantasia. what is the blessing?\n\ni still have not discovered my superpower. I cannot picture the people and things that I would rather forget... It usually takes me a long while to remember things about people, especially if they do not have any kind of defining feature.\n\nAlso, on a side note, do you have trouble reading books like I do? I can barely imagine the scenes or descriptions authors try to create, so I mostly focus on the feeling rather than the actual descriptions. Or the thing where people tell you to \"imagine a forest\"? I know what a forest *is*, but I cannot picture one very well or at all. I cannot imagine anything when I read, I love to read and when I knew that people could see \"watch a movie\" in their minds it was really strange. For me it is the same as you, just feelings, the \"environment\" of the situation, etc.\n... if I \"imagine\" a forest, sometimes I can smell the trees, the grass, hear the insects or birds, if the books say they are there.\nI cannot visualize, only in a consepsual way, as if I knew that there are things but I cannot see them. Only sometimes and if I concentrate enough I can smell / listen. The idea of reading being like watching a movie is such a weird concept to try to grasp. I am the same as you, I can maybe catch glimpses of what a scene should be if I really try to concentrate, but normally I cannot. That is why I love it when writers talk about feelings, or the \"environment\" because I can actually understand that stuff.", "Do you ever struggle to tell who is who in a movie then see them side by side in a picture and feel like an idiot because they do not even look similar? It sucks and it is annoying. All the time. I realized the reason I \"do not like movies\" is that it takes me half the movie to figure the characters out. Or when I spend spend like half an hour scrolling through an actor's/actress's picture just to \"cover\" every circumstance they can be in e.g. shaved, with a beard, without makeup, with their eyes closed, right/left side of their face, etc. Eh. Depends on the movie scene, lighting, makeup, all kinds of things. Actors who look completely different in their daily lives can end up looking incredibly similar in specific shots onscreen. Difficulty Level: Gary Oldman Well I was watching 'The Hunger Games' today for the first time, and was appalled to find I could not tell the difference between the main male 'goodie' character (Josh Hutcherson, Peeta) and the murderous 'baddie' (Alexander Ludwig, Cato). And I still cannot. But fortunately the story was pretty straightforward and for once it did not matter too much, because I could see who they were from what they were doing.\n\nThey *still* look the same to me. Why did they pick two people that look the same? Or perhaps they look totally different to \"normal people\"?!! &gt; Gary Oldman\n\nJust googled the man, and I *really* hope that I will not see him in any upcoming movies, because I know that I will spend hours scrolling through his pictures to find some \"sequence\". A note to my future self, I guess. i usually do not have problems, but my fianc\u00e9 was watching supernatural and i thought i was looking at a set of twins. it took her telling me to realize i was actually seeing at 4 characters, not 2.\n\nin my defense, i was not paying attention, and 3 of those characters are all middle aged white men with brown hair that sticks up at the front and 5 of the clock shadows, so anyone could have had trouble. Could be worse; could be Doug Jones. :) I have not watched The Hunger Games yet, but I watched a scene and I was also confused with Cato and Peeta, but I had also looked up Cato's face and it seems he has some sort of chin slit? Did you notice that before? No I did not! Thank you, that is a great clue.\n\nBut I fear I might be beyond hope. I am right now watching the sequel. A woman with long flowing hair walked towards the camera. I thought 'Oh I have seen her in some other film???'\n\nYou have guessed it, it was the MAIN CHARACTER but with different hair. I only realised when she spoke.\n\nYou have to laugh at this silly affliction do not you, otherwise you would cry :) Yeah. It is something that we do quickly context-wise plus whatever we could make of the bits of their features, be it face-wise, vocal, or what else. Same. I really prefer books. Also when I read a book, I do not have a mental image of the characters' faces.", "Questions.. Questions... Hey you all!\n\nFirst of all, Is this allowed? If not, I am very sorry!\n\nI am researching prosopagnosia as a side project, and resources have not been helpful! \n\nCan some of you guys tell me about your experiences? anything!\n\nCauses? Pros? Cons? Struggles?\n\nDifference between associative and apperceptive?\n\nI am also writing about prosopagnosia, and I do not want to offend anyone by poorly representing. \n\nSo, my character remembers someone from a night at the bar, but HE ONLY remembers the color of the other guy's eyes and hair. and the guy's tattoos.\n\nDoes that fit with how prosopagnosia works?\n\nI also have this theory that the characters prosopagnosia is the after \"shock\" (?) of carbon monoxide poisoning... Anything wrong there?\n\nAlso, for those born with prosopagnosia, how/when did you realize you had this?\n\nBye for now! Read the sub.\n\nEdit. Its not CO poisoning brain damage \ud83d\ude12 CO poisoning *could* cause it, but it is highly unlikely.\n\nWhat is more likely is that the person passed out due to lack of oxygen, hit their head, had a brain bleed, and the resulting neurological damage caused it.  \nThat would be more realistic for CO to cause acquired prosopagnosia. This is all self diagnosed based on symptoms and experiences.\n\nAs far as I know, born with it, though I did have more than one traumatic head injury as a child, so maybe it happened then.  \nDid not know I had it until a couple of years ago (mid 30s).\n\nI have both mild-moderate associative prosopagnosia and prosopamnesia (difficulty remembering faces).\n\nI can recognize my wife or friends in person and in pictures. I can focus on a detail of a face and tell you about it, like the colour of someone is eyes. But if I am not looking at them, I cannot tell you any of those same details.  \nI can recall facts about people, like a friend has blue eyes, but I cannot visualize that friend's face and eyes. I just know they are blue because I know they are blue. Like remembering a birthday. You just know that detail about the person to be true, but it has not visual component to it.\n\nI can recognise someone by the way they move, how they dress, their hair style and colour, how the sound, how they smell, and the situation in which I see them.\n\nHave been going to the same place to get my kid's hair cut for years. Saw the barber in a store less than a week after a haircut. Talked to her for a bit, knowing that I knew her, but did not know from where.  \nWas not until she moved in the line that I recognized her. It was the way she stepped, I think, that trigged it. A stance, a step, weight shifting.\n\nWas dropping my kid off at school. Someone came out to say hi to him. Did not know who she was.  \nLooked at the pants she was wearing, her general body shape, and the fact that she was talking to my son, figured she was the teacher. She changed her hair style and colour. Did not know who she was even though I see her like 6 times a week.\n\nIf I take those prosopagnosia tests, I usually do well on them. I can hold details about a face for a short time to see them again, if I am intently trying to remember a detail. Like a face has a mole, or strong jaw line, or something like that. Then I see those details in the recall part of the test and it throws it off.  \nIf there was an hour break between those sections, or if the instructions were not to try your hardest to recall, then I would not.\n\nAs far as the carbon monoxide thing goes, it is unlikely to cause the right kind of brain damage needed to cause prosopagnosia.  \nIt is more likely to be an aneurism or blunt impact, I think. Has to hit specific areas to cause different types, and CO would be an overall oxygen deprivation. I think everything about prosopagnosia is probably beyond the scope of a Reddit comment.  It might help you to read older posts and other online information to narrow down what you are looking for a little more.\n\nYes, your scenario would be reasonable.  (The carbon monoxide poisoning seems a like a stretch.  I meant that your character could only remember eye/hair color and tattoos.)  They would also probably remember the conversation, what the person was wearing (at least the style,) their mannerisms, etc. but unless the person is very distinct that is not always enough to recognize them.\n\nI realized that I was face blind in my first job after college.  I thought it was normal not to know everyone in your class of under 30 kids most of whom you had been with since kindergarten, because no one ever told me they did not and no one noticed, because I am good at faking it.  Once I was an adult I thought I was just kind of self-centered, because I could not remember people and tried to pay more attention which made it worse.  I had learned about prosopagnosia in psych, but did not realize it applied to me, because I recognized myself and my mom (but not how most people do.)  In retrospect, I did not understand the rest of what the prof was saying about facial recognition because I had not experienced any of the examples.  I thought I just had not been paying attention for a minute!  One day I read something online of a person whose experience was more like mine and then a lot of things made sense. Hi! (Self-diagnosed based on symptoms and little details) - born like this lol\n\nI first noticed when I was really young that if I am all alone in my room, I could not picture my family member's faces in my head, and I thought it was strange but no one seemed to believe me so I did not think much about it.  \n\nIt does not get in the way of \"normal life\" for me (which is why I did not know it was a thing), and I recognise other people based on distinct features they have or physical mannerisms the way they normally dress or the sound of their voice, but sometimes it is not that I am conscious that I am doing it. I realised not remembering other people's faces was not a thing, about a few years ago when I was talking with friends and they told me it was weird that I did not know how my mom looks like if I tried to picture her in my head, even though I see her almost daily. Did not think much about until I had another conversation about dreams and how I do not see faces in my dreams, but apparently people do? - if i saw a stranger (and maybe had a non memorable interaction) and then saw the same stranger 30-45min later, probably would not recognise them. Hi! Really interested to read ur book or paper if possible\n\nHereditary, my mom has it as well\n\nHow did I discovered it? I knew I was bad at faces, but one day few years back we were playing face swap on snap chat and I could not recognise my face and the faces of my best friends after swapping. I asked around, and every body could. So here i felt something is weird. I Googled \"why cannot I recognise faces\" and I discovered prosopagnosia\n\nAlso, for me, meeting someone in a club, i would not remember his eyes color or hair color,  since a club is dark (unless they stand out, like red-haired in a the middle east)\nWhat I would remember is a general look, shape of body, voice, or anything that stands out I have congenital prosopamnesia/moderate prosopagnosia. For me, I do not think it is fully neurological, rather a combination of neurological predisposition, vision problems (severe lack of depth perception) &amp; behavioral causes (avoidance of eye contact due to ADHD). I have extreme difficulty recalling and visualising faces, but if it is a person I see on a nearly every day basis then I may be able to retain their face partially (although, I would still not recognize them if they changed their haircut). It impairs my life to a moderate degree. It is particularly difficult when watching movies. I also never recognize friends on the street.\n\nI realized as a teenager after comparing my past experiences with what was being described by proso sufferers: the way that as a child I would  confuse friends who had the same hair color, the difficulty following movies if all the characters were the same race (god damn you hollywood white guys), the insistence I had as a kid that every guy with short dark hair \"looks just like dad!\", my complete inability to understand the concept of celebrity doppelgangers (is not that just anyone with the same haircut???) ... etc\n\nThe situation you describe with your character is pretty much exactly how it goes for me. If you asked me how any of my friends look the most I could tell you would me \"He uh....has brown hair...wears glasses....I guess\". \n\nAs for the cause though... carbon monoxide poisoning is a pretty unlikely one. Almost all acquired proso cases are a result of a brain haemorrhage, either due to impact trauma or due to a stroke/aneurism. For me, I realized I had prosopagnosia long before it was as well known as it is now. (I realized I was having trouble as a small child when I could not tell several of my uncles apart and when I asked for help I was told I was not trying hard enough.)\n\nFrom what I can tell, growing up with prosopagnosia is very, very different from developing it when older (I grew up with it and cannot remember a time I did not have it). So, first, someone who is born with it (or developed it at such an early age that they might as well have been born with it), they realize *really fucking quickly* that there are things that they cannot do that others can. And, here is the thing--people tend to not believe it exists.\n\n\"Why cannot you tell me apart?\"\n\n\"Are you retarded?\"\n\n\"Are you slow?\"\n\n\"You are not trying hard enough.\"\n\n\"You read/study/watch cartoons too much.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe you could tell people apart if you bothered looking at them.\"\n\nThese are all things that I heard growing up. I spent a significant part of my childhood being bullied *because I could not tell the people around me apart*. Hell, if I saw a mirror with more faces than mine in it *I did not know which face was mine*. It is terrifying to be a young child in a room of people you have never met before unable to talk to any of the adults *because you cannot tell which ones are your parents and you do not want to get into trouble*.\n\nNow. In order to function like this, coping mechanisms are developed. My first was shoes. (Which only partially helped; my father was in the army and they all had the same boots, same uniforms, and--for the most part--the same hair styles.) Second is voices. I know it is not the same for everybody, but for me voices come in variations of four different types (and no, I am not sharing them, because people tend to find insulting). I also tried to correspond behaviors to animals, because that helped me differentiate people (again, something I learned not to share, since it offends people). \n\nAnd that is another thing. I do not know if my experience is typical, but I learned not to share my coping mechanisms *because they offended people*.  But again, these are just my experiences. \n\nAnd yes: remembering someone by colors (hair and eyes) and a tattoo is perfectly reasonable.\n\nAlso: I hope you are not too attached to your CO theory for your character. Unless, as a result of the poisoning, your character hits their head prosopagnosia is exceptionally unlikely. A high fever (over 104 F) would be a much more likely culprit. (Of course, my childhood is riddled with head trauma and high fevers, so I guess I was pretty much doomed.)\n\nIf you go ahead with this, and you get it published, I would appreciate a link. As far as I have been able to ascertain, there simply is not much literary representation of prosopagnosia, and I would like to read some. Hi! Mild proso, hereditary checking in!\n\n\nPros: I am LOVING face masks. I am customer facing, and i find it much easier to not have whole faces to try and make sense of. A friend's theory is the reduced data points combined with how I am used to telling people apart (clothes, hair, etc) is benefiting me.\n\n\n\nCons: people just do not believe you. Or they do and assume I lack intelligence or have other mental deficiencies. You just want to say \"no! Just wear a damn name tag or tell me who you are when you walk in.\" Also people seem to feel like not being recognized is an insult, or hurtful, or they take it personally in some way. That is probably the hardest part, really. \n\n\n\nMy understanding of acquired proso is brain damage due to shock/impact is required. \n\n\n\nI found out by reading a news article and going..... \"wait a minute... people recognize faces?!\" Then taking a bunch of tests and things. \n\n\n\nGood luck! Okay, thank you! Thank you so much for your response!\n\nSo, If, let us say, Person 1 always wears a specific necklace, could that be a trigger?\n\nCould falling down the stairs be a cause? Necklaces or really any jewelry or clothing that is worn all the time is a good way to recognise someone.  \nBut that alone would not make you know the person. So if someone else was wearing it, you might recognise it like anyone else would, but you would not confuse the person for the other person unless they were similar in other ways already.\n\nImage if you were looking for a friend's car in a parking lot.  \nIf you have the license plate of the car, you could check it against every other license plate, and get the right one for sure. That is what seeing faces is like.  \nBut if you did not have the license plate, what else could you go by? Colour, make and model, accessories like roof racks or stickers in the window.  \nWith enough secondary things to look at, you do not need the plate number.\n\nSo for the necklace, what would happen if you saw a different car with the same roof racks? Unless the car was already similar, you would not think it is the same car.\n\nAnd sure. Falling down the stairs could cause acquired prosopagnosia. Wow. Just wow. \n\nI loved how you related this into something that I have lots of experience with, as I am very forgetful!\n\nThat is genius.\n\nThank you so much! No problem.\n\nHave fun prosing it up :p My experiences:  Good Idea; will do!\n\nAh, I have gotten the Poisoning thing wrong, so I guess I will just switch it up...\n\nThank you so much for sharing your experience!\n\nSo, you self-diagnosed? Thanks for sharing your experience!\n\nI totally can relate to the not-trying-hard enough thing. There was I time someone told me I probably have Prosopagnosia, because I could never identify relatives. (I could easily identify Aunts and Uncles and Cousins, but afterwards..)\n\nIt is absolutely hurtful when you are unable to do something, and people say you have not tried enough.\n\nThe coping mechanisms make sense, I will be using them! Though I wonder what would happen if someone shared, hehe...\n\nOh, I was some Med site, and they were like CO is totally alright! Thank you so much, for correcting me! Fevers... That is something I do not have much experiences with.. Only get them once a year, maybe? (Tho, diseases? Yeah, I did not have that easy.)\n\nDefinitely! I will be making sure to provide you with a link, (or even a free copy, with a special thank you note!), and maybe even finding someone/someones with prosopagnosia to read over, just to make sure that everything is correct. \n\nTho, There are a couple of books about Prosopagnosia, I actually have a list, I want to get my hands on them, as soon as I earn some money!\n\nAgain, Thank you so so so much! I do not have Prosopagnosia, BUT I HATE FACE MASKS! Not that I am a anti-masker (I am literally like the opposite), I just find it HARDER to recognize faces. Curious, do you use the \"I CANT RECOGNIZE YOU CUZ OF THE FACE MAKS\" excuse?\n\nI think the fact that no one will believe you, and think you are just lazy, is definitely the worst part.\n\nThank you so much! \n\nP.S. Nice username! Is the sign of not being able to picture faces always Prosopagnosia?\n\nCause I cannot do that. I can recognize people (mostly...) but has never been able to picture someone. I know how they look but just cannot put it together. Should.. I be worried?\n\nIt is actually cool how you do not let it interfere with life!\n\nThank you so much for replying and sharing! I will be writing my book on paper, then re-writing on Docs, then re-writing on Wattpad. I will definitely let you read my book!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAh, another self diagnoser!

Have a nice day \u2764 OMG, I know you are just making an analogy here, but it reminded me of something really funny that happened a long time ago.  I never connected this before to proso, (I have mild proso but did not realise that was a thing until my late 20s).\n\nWhen I was in high school I once came out of a supermarket and got into my car but the key did not fit in the ignition (people did not lock the doors back then).  Huh, weird.  I looked around confused, then saw a car seat in the back and realised I was in the wrong car.  It was parked right next to mine - exact same make, model, color.  It was SO embarrassing to get my groceries out, walk around, and get into a different car.  And after I realised the mistake so many clues jumped out at me.\n\nMaybe this could happen to anyone. But now I am wondering if a non-proso person would have noticed more subtle things that were different about the car dents/dings/other stuff in the front seat/dashboard.  \n\nAnyway, thought I would share for general amusement :)\n\nalso u/Madihaf07 this newsletter from faceblind has a lot of personal stories that might help you: ( &gt;essentially colour blindness, but face edition\n\nthanks for that, this will help as a response when people say \"I am bad with names\"...

I am in my first year of grad school. I am meeting all these new people and I cannot tell who I have met before and who I have not. People say hi to me and I have no idea who they are. I am scared that I am coming across as an asshole because I am rarely the first to recognize someone else. Having social anxiety on top of all this does not help.\n\nI do not want to just tell people that I have prosno, because people just think that it is an excuse to justify being an asshole. I have only told a few friends that I have prosno, and many of them only really believed me when I said that I was in contact with a group that was researching it. I hear \"everybody has trouble with faces\" a lot. No. Not as much as I do. *They are* able to follow along with who is who in movies. *They* do not stop recognizing people after they have had a haircut or changed glasses or shaved off all their facial hair. Gah. It is really frustrating to have to inform people about prosno; it is not the sort of thing I can mention and have people know what I am talking about without an explanation (as opposed to, say, \n\nNot sure where I am going with this, I just needed to blow off some steam.

I cannot place your voice, can you remind me where I know you from? Or the other situation is someone will see me and say oh I saw you downtown the other day I was waving at you from across the street and you looked right at me but you did not wave back and it is that is when I also say I do not recognize faces so I may have seen you but I might have thought you were waving at someone else)\n\nNew here, glad to meet more people like me! Wow, painfully accurate portrayal of my life. I love it!  When you kind of feel sexist, but for the life of you the only way you can tell the pony-tailed waitresses apart is by how much cleavage they show. I have finally learned to make a note of name tags when they first come up. I love name tags.\n\nAlso, my favorite local restaurant has a racially diverse group of waitstaff. Skin tone helps narrow it down. When you realize that guy at work is actually two different guys. My neighbours are twins, I thought they were one person but it made no sense because one is really friendly and the other one is very shy so I could not understand why my friend would have such weird mood swings lol  Two of my cousins are twins. They are actually fraternal, but they looked similar enough that everyone thought they were identical.  \n\nI actually found myself to be really good at separating the two of them -- not so much identifying who was who, but just that I knew I was not talking to the same person -- In retrospect, others were probably looking at overall features, but I was focusing more on how they parted their hair. I do this in movies all the time as well.  Or when someone trows you a surprise party and you spend the first 15 minutes trying to figure out who every one is....

Personally I can only think of two people...\n\nThis condition tends to run in families, so it is not surprising that my dad is also bad with faces. The price of watching shows together is accepting that we are both going to end up confused.\n\nBeyond him, I think there was one kid in my middle school who might have had it. I only spoke with him a few times, but from what I heard from our mutual friends, he rivaled me for the \"poor facial recognition\" award :p\n\nSo how about you? Do you know anyone IRL with this, and did you ever talk about it? There was a kid in a class that I subbed for that I was positive had it.  (Fourth grader.  Only recognized a few of his classmates.  Like me when I was a kid.)  I left a note for the teacher and also talked to her about it, but I do not think she took me seriously which was frustrating.  I wanted the kid's parents to know what was gong on, and the teacher to understand certain behavior. I have never knowingly met someone with it IRL (excluding family). \n\nGranted if I had met another person with it, I could have met them over &amp; over &amp; over and thought I met a lot of face-blind people instead of one. Just a former coworker. She heard me talking to someone about face blindness and approached me to tell me she is, too. I guess I cannot know for sure if I know anyone else who is since it is not obvious unless someone outright says something. And I did not even realize it was a thing until I was in my 20s, so I am sure a lot of people do not.\n\nI did not know it runs in families! That is interesting, never really thought about it. I am adopted, so maybe something to ask my biological parents. No. Once I realized I had this I started asking family about their experiences and I am the only one. In fact several close family are able to memorize new people and places really well after only one or two meetings/ visits. My mom has it too, but other than that I have never met anyone with it (that I know of). Considering something like 1% of the population is estimated to have it, in sure you run into people with it quite frequently, it is just not something that comes up in conversation much, if the person even knows they have it! My mum discovered she was face blind because of conversations with me. Suddenly it made sense to her why she was always being approached by \u2018people she did not know\u2019, and why my brother at school complained she never remembered his friends. She now thinks her mother also must have had it.\n\nApart from her I do not know of anyone. I did meet one. Do not live there anymore but I started to go into my spiel and she gave me this amused look and said \"I have that too.\"\n\nIt was pretty cool!", "What was it like to find out about face blindness: and more importantly realizing you had it? I recently realized that i most likely have Prosopagnosia. I first discovered its existence through Katzun's video, and as i was watching, it clicked, this was me, these things described me. I looked father into it and what i had previously brushed off as me being forgetful or tired, could be explained by face blindness. It was strange that when i really looked at it, the people i knew, i knew them by things like what they wear, or their hair, or their body shape, or their accessories. And it was almost frightening that when i actually thought about it, i **could not** picture the faces of people i knew, even my own. How did you guys react when you realized you had face blindness? \"Huh. That explains some stuff. Oh well. Meh.\" like colour blind people : ) \n\n\"Huh....that explains a lot\"\n\nwhat is truly surprising to me is how LITTLE people I have told care at all. I am better with pictures than real life. Pictures is a face in one exact moment and I have found that I can replicate that more strongly in drawings. In real life I find people look really different moment to moment due to micro/major changes in facial expressions.\n\nWhen it comes to learning I try to focus on the feature that initially stands out to me the ie. smiles, long lashes, big eyes, style of dress, shoes (preferably physical not clothing because that changes daily) and then people get grouped into their general  characteristics ie. short-average weight-tan-brunette, curvy-pixie cut-petite, male-brunette-nice shoes. I cried for about 2 hours. It was overwhelming to realize quirky things that I had thought was unique to my personality was only coping strategies. Yep. It explains but does not change anything. It does facilitate some useful coping behaviours like getting my wife to act as spotter for me. It was not so much realizing something about me as realizing something about everyone else. I would never realized that other people genuinely can recognize people by their faces\u2014I would thought that was a figure of speech!\n\nI felt extremely vindicated, because people had noticed that I was bad at faces and had always told me \u201cjust pay more attention!\u201d And it explained some things, for sure. Honestly, I think I am still trying to internalize that there really are people who can meet you once and then recognize you in any situation. I found a huge relief. I guess prior to, I beat myself up for being selfish or inattentive or deficient in some unknown way.\n\nYou can hear directly from the horse\u2019s mouth with others on my podcast: Faceblindpodcast.com Relief!!! I am not stupid, I am not thoughtless, I am not crazy. It is a legit condition that explains so much! Relieved.  I thought I was being a self-centered jerk. i found out about it last year. I had the same reaction as mo in this thread\n\n&gt;Relieved. I thought I was being a self-centered jerk.\n\nRecently I started reading books about it,\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand another one, which i downloaded, called ( It sounded interesting. I read a bit about it. When I got to the part about how it manifests itself in children, I said \u201choly crap, that is me\u201d. The article said children have difficulty following characters in tv shows and movies, difficulty recognizing people out of context, like not recognizing their teacher in the supermarket.\n\nMany episodes of my life flooded my mind where I did not recognize people after they got a haircut etc.\n\nIn 10 minutes I went from not knowing such a thing existed, to explain many things in my life that I never realized were abnormal nor even needed explanation. I found out about it years ago, and had even read a couple of science articles on it, but it was until last year or so that I clicked that *I* had it. It was just this interesting fact I knew until I clicked on a link for the self-reporting face blindness test. After scoring for mild prosopagnosia, it was like well shit, that explains a lot. I still sorta wondered for a while after that, but then I a couple of moments where it Very Obvious that my brain cannot do faces. I had to review and rewrite every memory from my life where I had a social issue from a lack of facial recognition and had blamed myself for \u201cnot trying hard enough\u201d. It was cool because now I had a word to say to people instead of like \u201coh hey btw I am awful with faces very sorry I keep mistaking you for the other guy with the same haircut.\u201d I wish I would known earlier!  There were so many times when life would have made more sense if I would known I was face blind, many times when I could have avoided hurt feelings and lost friendships.\n\nNow that I know, I am better able to adapt and communicate with others.  Some people I have told about it did not \"get it\", but for the ones that do it is really helpful. For me it was really disappointing. I always held out hope that one day I would get better at remembering who people are, and it turns out I have a neurological disorder that makes this impossible.", "I knew this condition existed, and that I had it, but I would never met anyone else in the wild with it until the comments of this video. Then I realized there is a subreddit for everything and here I am.  So... Is this the same person or not? I need to know. The top one is Jim Carey I believe, the bottom is the original with Jack Nicholson Definitely the same person. No? I first saw this having been told what it was (deepfake of Jim Carrey's face over Jack Nicholsons performance from The Shining)\n\nseeing them side by side I can discern which is which (the cheek folds next to the nose... *google* TIL they are called nasolabial folds, are more pronounced on Jacks face)\n\nBut if I would gone in uninitiated (or I was not seeing them A/B) there is a pretty good chance that it would have tripped me up entirely. The eyebrows are shaped differently. Boy did I have to stare to pick something out tho. I am not face blind (maybe *slightly* but I have no trouble recognizing popular actors) and even I had trouble telling them apart. If it had just been the Carrey clip on its own I might not have noticed anything amiss. The one on top looks like he is younger than the bottom guy. Is this a deep fake or digital de-aging?", "I have got a good story for you all It is relevant I swear. I went on a bad date one time. I do not like movies (too hard to follow the characters, maybe you have the same trouble) but I was interested in this guy so I figured I would sit through one anyways. I told him explicitly no horror movies. Naturally, he picks a horror movie.\n\nWell, the movie he picked was Split.\n\nIf you do not know the movie, it is an M Night Shyamalan about a guy with multiple personality disorder who kidnaps some children. The actor plays it well and genuinely seems like different people. \n\n\nLet me tell you, I spent the entire goddamn movie waiting for the accomplice to show up. There was no accomplice. I understood the premise well enough but in the very first scene where he kidnaps the kids, he genuinely looked like someone else. I spent this whole movie looking for a character that did not exist.\n\nAll in all 2/10 would not watch again. The twist was super obvious too. Oh man, I feel you. I could not help chuckling though. \n\nHow was the date otherwise? Extra garbage. He was a tool. It really does make a good story though. That sucks, but hey, you got a good story out of it! I could have guessed that if he took you to a movie you already said you did not want to see. It is like he was trying to meshe a bad impression.  My fianc\u00e9 started The Haunting of Hill House then decided it was too scary to finish. I wanted to finish it because I felt like I would be less scared if I found out what happened. \n\nI tried watching on my own but I had a really hard time telling the characters apart. Especially the sisters. Too many beautiful brunettes! \nFortunately I got my Dad to watch it with me. He understands and does not mind helping me keep track of people.

See, this might be a good date move for this sub: \n\nI think everyone is supposed to look alike.", "DAE have trouble recognizing Black Widow in the MCU films? I recently finished Endgame and realized that Scarlett Johansson, the actress that plays Black Widow, seems to change her hair for every movie.\n\nI swear, every one that she was in it would take me a good 15-20 minutes to figure out who she was supposed to be. In Avengers: Infinity War she dyed her hair white and I did not know who she was until at least 2/3 of the way through the movie.\n\nI did not have trouble recognizing anyone else in those movies, just Scarlett. Did anyone else have this issue? To an extent. Usually, though, it is a little mitigated by the knowledge that the character is supposed to be in there somewhere, and there is this character onscreen whose name has not been given yet but she is about the right height and is doing spy or action stuff (or is in a scene opposite Hawkeye), so it is probably her. Since my childhood all the women look same to me, it gradually changed around 16 yrs or so. But it is still hard to recognize people in real world, but on screen it is getting better at least for me. LOL.  I was going to recommend you look at /r/Prosopagnosia until I saw where this was.  Well, she is pretty much the only female character in the avengers, so I have never had much of a problem.  PLus distinctive voice.\n \nNow, that orphan black series?  OR anything with gary oldman?? Forget it I have been wondering if the mechanism in the brain for remembering what someone looks like vs recognizing them is two different things. Orphan Black was fine for me. All of the clones are played by the same actress so they took steps to make them different-looking even with sharing a face. For me it sort of leveled the playing field since in movies where (for example) there are two different brunettes played by two different actresses, there is no effort to differentiate them because they figure everyone will be able to tell them apart lol Oh, yeah, but I couldnt really follow it as well because I wouldnt understand who the clones were untill i was hit over the head with it.  Like the opening scene almost in the train station it think, I had to ask my friend, is that supposed to be her clone? Because they looked too different for me to tell they were supposed to look the same. I had no trouble following that show and really enjoyed it. But I was actually shocked and quite confused when I discovered the clones were all played by the same actress. Kudos to Tatiana Maslany for pulling of such a surprising acting range in a single show. You had me fooled. Black Widow? No. Been watching Scarlett J\u2019s movies since Ghost World but did not \u201cmemorize\u201d her face until Lost In Translation (that was a trip connecting the two).\n\nNow the actress who plays Sharon Carter (Peggy Carter\u2019s granddaughter), I *still* have trouble with.\n\nShe is in the Falcon &amp; Winter Soldier series. Anytime there is a pretty long blonde lady in the show, I know it is her. Would not be able to recognize her in any other movie/show. I can NEVER recognize Scarlett, and any time someone tells me that she was so-and-so from a movie, they act like I am a moron for not being able to recognize America's sweetheart. SO glad to hear it is not just me.\n\nTo be fair, she specifically has dumbfounded me enough over the years that I have compared her looks from all these different movies she is in. She ALWAYS gets done up entirely different for each movie. The makeup artists reshape her eyes for every role, and her hair is always vastly different. I am honestly confused as to how other people can recognize her, because her looks are so incredibly varied.\n\nI have always wondered why people are so enamored by her, because to me she just looks like any other woman out there? I think she just has a good facial structure for wearing all these completely different makeup looks; most people's faces stand out beneath makeup, and therefore they do not look good in every style. But her face is just basic enough that she can pull off...practically any look. Maybe that is why people are drawn to her?", "You do not remember him? Let us go and talk with him! - awkward study abroad experience. Just came across this subreddit and I feel that I can relate in some ways. Here is one story that I kind of kick myself over sometimes.\n\nA few years ago, I studied in Japan on a study abroad program with my University. My first day on campus, I was led around and assisted in various ways by one particular guy we will call \"Shun.\" \n\nShun had some pretty distinct features that most people would probably identify him with, such as his height, prominent brow, deep voice, etc. He was also a very social guy and seemed to care about getting to know everyone. \n\nI spent nearly an entire day with him: going to the uni orientation, riding in his car to have lunch at a local restaurant, him helping me open a bank account, all kinds of things. \n\nAfter that day, I saw him on occasion, but we ended up having pretty different social circles after the first couple months. \n\nFast forward to about the mid-point of that year, I was in the hallway talking to my friend \"Saki.\" She says Shun's name in reference to whatever we had been talking about (I do not quite remember now) and I just kind of give her a blank stare. She expects me to know who she is talking about and she points to the guy.\n\nEven after saying his name and pointing to him, I still stare blankly and I have to admit that he looks \"familiar\" but I cannot honestly recall from where. She then says \"oh really? How about we go talk with him?\"\n\nI am not sure why she wants me to talk with him, but I get the impression she just wants to help me remember who he is. So we go over for a quick chat. She explains what we were discussing and we have a rather awkward conversation about where we had met each other before.\n\nI had to apologise a lot, because it is very embarrassing for me and I felt so awful being unable to remember someone to whom I should have expressed so much gratitude to in the beginning. I do not like being put on the spot and it turned out to be a moment I will never forget. I often think about that time when I am in a situation where I need to remember people's names and faces so I think super hard about distinguishing features that I can attach a memory to.\n\nIt is a struggle sometimes, but I do my best. It is ok not to remember everyone at all times. I think it is pretty understandable you would not remember someone you have met months ago. If you are on exchange you probably met a hundred other people after that. It is unfortunate you forgot the name of someone who helped you out, but as long as you were grateful and polite on the day and then when you remembered again (as it seems you were) it is ok. \n\n\nI also studied in Japan in my younger days (school) and really struggled to recognise my classmates. We had strict uniform rules, so no dying hair, big accessories etc. Almost everyone was way shorter than me and the uniform was efficient at hiding body shape. I tried to memorize people based on where they sat in the class but we switched seats all the time... I once confessed to a classmate I struggle with names and faces and she said \"yes, I have heard that Europeans cannot tell Asians apart\". Everyone around us agreed... I wanted to shout \"that is not it\" but then again I did not know what the actual reason was. I just say all HUMANS look alike. I always felt like the worst kind of racist when I helped in my mom\u2019s classroom and would not be able to tell, say, two ambiguously brown kids apart... but there were always at least two white kids that I could not differentiate between either. And I *am* white.", "As far as I can see nobody has posted this yet...  I can see they are different, but what is going on here? Are they swapped with each other? One of the videos has the faces of Tom Holland and Robert Downey Jr deepfaked over Micheal J Fox and Christopher Lloyd respectively. \n\nI think the bottom one is the original (mainly due to video quality) but I cannot be sure. I only know about the faces because I encountered this video before.\n\nI also mainly recognize people by voice so this kind if videos is doubly confusing to me. For me, I mainly identify people by gesture/gait/facial hair/etc, then I can confirm whether the face looks familiar.\n\nI do not know if I would have ever guessed Downey and Holland Did they change the younger character\u2019s face? I honestly cannot tell.  I can see the face of the older character is different though. I determined rhat the bottom was the OG too because the top one has the watermark of whomever deepfaked it. They look the same to me They look the same to me, except in the top one the faces are smoother, like they have been blurred. I can see the difference in the Doc but Marty just looks the same in both. Marty looks the same to me. Doc I can tell is different because I remember him being extremely wide-eyed and not having mustache stubble. I do not recognize RDJ without his distinctive hairline and jaw. Me too Oh fun.\n\nI just showed this to my wife and roommate, and they were weirded out by it.\n\nI mentioned how the bottom version's Doc Brown almost looks fake because of how his eyes look artificial, like they are popping out of his face. I said it reminded me of of the Judge from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nThey both looked at me dumbfounded. \"That would because they are the same actor\"\n\n... FML... *\"Remember me, Eddie!?\"*\n\nAlso Uncle Fester in The Addams Family movies. Which is even harder to recognize. That one just sounds like BS.\n\nI believe you tho I kept going back and forth and the actors that I wanted to say kept changing. I thought I saw Daniel Radcliffe and that kid from Hunger Games and then it changed again. But then sometimes they both looked the same. \n\nI was rapid cycling through my dictionary and failed horribly. I would pull out a name and then watch mannerisms and go \"hmm, that does not look right\" all within 2 seconds.", "An text message exchange between me and a friend. Did you know who it was before reading the texts?  Was either Ellen Degeneres or Justin Bieber just from the photo.\n\nThe photo also has the text \"Ellen\", so I did not need to get to the texts to know who it was. I only needed to get to the \"text\" as it were. Without reading the text, I had absolutely no idea. I am assuming this is the Ellen with the talk show? I thought it was the chick from My Drunk Kitchen until I read the photo caption.", "Other problems related to Pros. Fellow Prosopagnosiacs (I am not sure if that is a real term, but I am making it one lol).\n\nGiven that Prosopagnosia is a neurological condition, I have been asked, when talking about it, whether my Prosopagnosia has affected my cognitive functions in other ways. Specifically other memory and recognition skills.\n\nBut i have other cognitive disorders that could be the cause of my memory and recognition problems, so I thought I would ask you all about your experiences. Have you found that you also have problems with memory, or other recognition disorders (like dyslexia and dysgraphia)?  I do not know if it is related or not, but I just cannot remember names.  One notable example is playing The Witcher 2.  There is probably a really good, deep story full of intrigue and such, but I could never follow it, because I could never remember who was supposed to be who.  I feel like I missed, like, 80% of that game because I could not follow anything. I have memory issues in general and specifically with names. I also have found recognizing words difficult at times, tho probably not enough to really be dyslexia.\n\nHowever, I also have ADHD, and that could be the cause of those. omg in totally the same. Tho i usually attribute that to my ADHD. I get lost very easily and have trouble finding my way around. I read somewhere that topographical memory problems can be linked to pros, so I guess that makes sense for me! my memory is notoriously spotty. i could tell you the exact circumstances in which some random event from 5 years ago happened when prompted, or rattle off facts about various theme parks, but not a single detail about the US civil war, which i spent half of last year learning about, or anything about my favourite shows if i have not seen them recently. like legit somebody mentioned an Angel episode (one of my favourite shows) and i was just like... what? i do not even recognize who those characters are. it has not been that long since i have seen the show either, only a few years. \n\ni am also awful at directions - i cannot figure out if i am facing north or east or whatever for the life of me, and i still get my lefts and rights mixed up. i have lived in the same small town since i was 3, but i still use google maps to navigate everywhere because directions just do not stick in my head. \n\nlike somebody else here said, names can be problematic. i have been working at my job for several months now and i still do not know who one of my coworkers is. it is been waaaay too long to ask by now and we do not wear name tags, so it is problematic. Omg i have the same problem with directions!\n\nIf I ask for directions, i need the simplest step-by-step left and right directions. None of this north south weast est bidnis.\nAnd then after like two steps i have to ask another person for directions\n\nI have lived in Utah for like 15 years now, and every single time, without fail, when I say \"i do not know which way is north\" people tell me \"The mountain is west.\" and I am like \"you are kidding, right...?  we are in a valley.....\" I find it bleeds over into recognizing other things. I get lost easily because I cannot recognize areas well. I cannot tell cars apart, I am usually guessing at the difference between truck/SUV/minivan and I am blown away that people can recognize makes/ models/ years.\n\nI know this is vague but my ability to \"notice\" things is not great either. I could be staring at something in the distance and fail to realize someone is standing next to me. I tend to startle easily. I can often be looking all over for an item that is in a really obvious spot and walk right past it, or be looking at a scene with a surprising and eye- catching detail and I have to look carefully at every thing one by one until I see it. Disclaimer: Not a full prosopagnosiac myself, but I test below average at recognizing faces.\n\nI am unusually bad at remembering colors. I do not mean mixing up shades of the same color, I mean just full out remembering it as a different color, like thinking something was blue when it was actually white (Makes playing \u2018Among Us\u2019 extra challenging! Lol). I also forget people\u2019s hair colors. Thought my best friend had auburn hair for two years before realizing it was brown, whoops. \n\nOn the other hand, I have found that I am actually great at names - if it is a name I know how to spell. If I cannot spell it, I cannot remember it, period. \nThe spelling thing can be handy because I just need to see someone is name written somewhere to remember it, but it is less useful when I cannot remember the face that goes with the name, which happens a lot unfortunately. \nI am a teacher, so you can imagine how this gets problematic when I know a student\u2019s name but not their face aha. Omg, i did not even think about that. i do that, too! another thing i attribute to ADHD. lol To be fair I have also been diagnosed Bipolar and DID. I have no idea what features to attribute to what issue. Lol... I just think of my brain as a mess and do my best with it. I believe that in the future we will look at mental diagnosis as having lots of fuzzy edges and overlaps. I do not think i have Prosopagnosia as badly as others here, either. But the condition is not only complete inability to recognize faces.\n\nThe pathways in the brain meant to recognize faces can be either *deficient* or defunct. If it affects you enough that you have to make changes to the way you do things in order to function, I would say that is enough to be considered a Prosopagnosiac. From what I know of both Bipolar Disorder and DID, I feel like they would not really affect memory and recognition skills the same way Prosopagnosia and ADHD do. Granted, what I know is not a whole lot, but I do have a rudimentary knowledge of both. Although, DID can affect memory in that different alters may not share their memories and so what was experienced while one alter was present, will not be remembered by another, but that is the closest I can think of it coming. Bipolar is not connected to memory issues, but DID is an early childhood trauma disorder that can be associated with developmental issues, and it also strongly affects memory. I mean I can see how memory might be spotty in that what one alter experiences, the other(s) do not necessarily remember, but aside from that, do you mean that it has other effects on memory? Yes. Besides the compartmentalization, frequent dissociative states make regular recall very difficult. Just adding a comment so you do not get a biased sample of commenters.\nNo, I do not have any other memory/ cognitive issues. Names are awful, but I am actually awesome at directions. I definitely also have issues with names but I have always attributed that to an attention thing. I am also a very very strong introvert so while someone is being introduced to me, I may be already thinking of how to get out of the conversation and miss a name. But it could be faceblind related. \n\nAlso directions. I am ok with remembering them and general navigation. But if I am the passenger trying to give directions, I will read them and inevitably point one direction while verbalizing the other. So point right, but say left. Over the years I have noticed that the pointed direction is more likely to be correct-unfortunately a driver hears me but does not see the pointing. Somewhere between reading a direction and verbalizing it, my brain likes to reverse them. \n\nBut no general memory problems as far as school or work. thank you. these comments are also helpful.\n\nI am not just looking for confirmation bias afterall. \\^v\\^ Also commenting just to avoid sample skew: I definitely have a weird brain--I was a very early reader, for instance--but I would not characterize its other weirdnesses as \\*issues\\*. It is like someone took all the points out of facial recognition during character build and put them into language instead. I also forget names, but I also have ADHD. My memory in general is also just bad. I cannot take directions either because I cannot remember which way I am facing, *or* the street names. You will have to describe what the street looks like, or else I am hopeless. I also cannot remember people's names. I get lost very easily, even when I know the area. Pretty good with names though...often rely on the names when re-meeting people who recognize me. i am terrible with names, directions, navigation, and recognizing places and cars", "Ever grab someone else\u2019s child? Thought this would be a fun (and mortifying) thing a lot of us can relate to.\n\nMy nieces were at the park and I forget why, but I was calling for the one.  She was not answering, so I walk up behind her and gently grab her shoulders.  Child looks up at me confused.  I look down at child.  Took me a moment and then I saw it the child had bangs.  \u201cOh no, I am sorry!\u201d  Her mother walks up and I apologize to her because I probably scared her shitless, then we laughed.\n\nSometimes I remember this day and die a little more inside. I would not beat yourself up about too much lol, they probably forgot about it the next day. Mabye try to dress your kid in something specific to remember? My nieces.\n\nI immediately forget what people are wearing as well.  I would be useless if I got robbed.  \u201cI think he had blue pants, but what if they were black?\u201d Depends on the niblings. A lot of the time we are the most ethnic  on the playground and stick out due to that, but one of my niblings is blonde and blue eyed, lost them for a minute in the museum once. Panicked soo hard. When I walked into my son's daycare (pre-Covid), I always waited until the teachers brought him to me, rather than go up to him myself! I was terrified they would think I was the worst parent ever if they saw me hesitate in figuring out which one he was! \n\nHe was in daycare from about 3 months to 10 months, so generic baby looking, and his size and shape were changing constantly. And since he rarely ended the day in the same clothes he started in, it was even harder. Holy crap, this.\n\nMy daughter is in dance, when I go to see her I spend a long time starting at little girls trying to figure out which one is mine. I always worry that people think I am a creep. Belated response, but I want to share some camaraderie around the \"I always worry that people think I am a creep.\" I am fairly near-sighted, but I do not wear my glasses in most social situations because -- counterintuitively to what popular culture often shows -- I have noticed people treat me better when I wear them; I would rather people know me without the glasses first so our interactions and associations of each other are more authentic. (When I am nervous about a meeting or going into a job interview, though, the glasses go on. And I will sometimes keep them on if I am meeting with people who already know me well and I got there from driving, when I always use glasses.)\n\nAnyway, combine being near-sighted with face blindness, and I stare at people a lot. I wish I could tell every stranger or kid/parent of said kid I stare too long at \"Sorry, I was not sure if I know you/them.\"", "Husband laughed at me while watching Breaking Bad. I knew the general plot: That a science teacher starts making meth with a student of his. \n\nIn the first episode we see a student disrespect Walter in the classroom and later we see a student make fun of him at a car wash. (Is it the same student? I have no idea.) Even later in that episode, Walter finally gets Jesse to agree to start making meth with him. Jesse is a student of his, so I assume he is the same student from the earlier two scenes. In fact, he is not. Jesse is an old student and he is past high school age. I got embarrassingly far into the show before I finally asked my husband what the hell was up because Jesse clearly is not going to school and why is not Walter saying anything to him about it?\n\nI of course had no way of memorizing faces, so I usually recognize characters by attributes until I finally see them enough that I remember them. \n\nAnyone have any legendary stories like this? Not that I am aware.. XD I try to avoid this with preemptive verification, though. My friends know I have a problem w faces so I say things like hey, that is the kid from the opening scene right? Iiiis that the woman who broke her shoe? Etc. Helps me enjoy it more, and they like that I can actually discuss shows and movies after. =P Exactly this. I use friends, who know I have issues with faces, as \"spotters\" when I am watching movies/shows. If I get confused, I can just quickly ask wtf is going on.  My husband knows about my prosopagnosia, so when I make that kind of mistake, he corrects it and I kiss him, then we are both grateful and happy and understand the plot better.  \n\nBut sometimes we have to rewind it.  I watched the Edward Snowmen movie with my siblings, and I honestly thought the girlfriend was a different person in each city they lived in. The fact that they had the same hobbies and hair did not tip me off. Honestly, there is so many movies and shows where I mess up the plot line the first time and have to watch again to get it. If I am watching it with someone I will just ask \"who is that\" and they will quickly explain it usually. Also, turning on subtitles is amazing because a lot of the time it will say something like  or . I seriously would appreciate little name tag subtitles on each new scene, it would help a lot.  Same. I saw Hamilton recently, and I lost track of the main character. There was a scene where he was getting married and I had to ask my SO who it was, because I thought it was Burr.  I have had a lot of trouble with this in the past; it is part of why I prefer watching non-cartoons with other people around. I am constantly asking \"Is that the guy from the other scene?\" and \"what is that guy's name again?\" \n\nI also cannot stand shows with non-diverse casting. Sometimes it is necessary (in The Man In The High Castle, basically everyone is Aryan or Japanese because, uh, the Axis won and basically everyone else is dead), but it really bugs me when there is a show where everyone looks really similar. Not mainly because diversity is good (it is, but that is not my number one reason), but because I just straight-up have no idea who the fuck everyone is! \n\nI love The Office (US). Everyone looks different enough that I can tell them all apart from hair/gender/race/height/etc.  I typically have to ask my wife who people are a few times through a movie or series and she is  great about helping me, but I could tell that for a while I was really testing her patience when I went through a phase where I was obsessed with Hong Kong cinema.  Hair and features were too similar for my stupid brain to distinguish.  Every now and then they would throw me a bad guy with crazy blond hair, but usually I could not tell who was who without constant help. Have you found that plays/musicals are so much more difficult than tv shows/movies? That is how it is for me. One of the best parts of being married. I could *not* have gotten through Game of Thrones without her. I have not, for me it depends on how uniquely the characters are costumed and how easily identifiable they are. For instance, in the first season of WestWorld, I had NO idea that there was two timelines, with a younger and older version of a character. I thought it was all same day stuff, because the robot characters rarely changed much, if at all.  Have not seen WestWorld yet, but I hear it can be really confusing. Dunkirk was kind of like that. Different concurrently running timelines and characters are not ever really introduced. I only recognized two name actors (Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branaugh) who had relatively small parts. A very confusing experience. I recently watched several seasons of Shameless and thought \"Steve\"/Jimmy was the sidekick guy from Breaking Bad. I have only seen a few episodes of Breaking Bad but I bet I could see the whole show and still confuse these guys. I was told they look similar but have not Googled myself. I forgot about it until now.  I watched the most recent Mission Impossible but thought the two actresses were the same woman in wigs until they were on screen together.  I have seen all the movies but could not remember specifics about any person or event, so until the shared screen time I had no idea if there were several women in prior movies or one woman pretended to be different people as a spy. It made the whole movie seem funny when I realized how less sneaky it was in terms of the women's identities.  Also this is beyond facial recognition issues but I saw RENT live and could not tell who was sick until one character died.  My sister claimed most of the characters had HIV/AIDs but with an unfamiliar story I cannot watch and listen well so I miss lots of cues and events,  or focus on minor characters by accident. That is why I like subtitles on TV. I am a fast reader so I am able to pay more attention to visual cues, and as someone mentioned,sometimes subtitles have clues about the mood of the scene.   I love musicals but I cannot go see unfamiliar ones live. I miss too much between facial blindness, being hard of hearing, and always being in crappy seats.\n\nI have to familiarize myself with a movie version or getting a cast recording first. Aw, my boyfriend helps me too. It also annoyed him initially so now he will pause if I need to ask questions. I actually like Korean drama and comedy shows became they are usually easy for me to follow.  Usually they have a specific hair style or personality type for certain characters in the story,  so it helped me when I first watched.  Now, I do look for more unusual shows but many of the same cues or character tropes pop up, and there is often specific repeated music for certain moods.  When the first Lord of the Rings movie came out, there is a scene where Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean) are walking around near the shards of Narsil, the sword. Aragorn has dark hair, Boromir light, but the lighting in the scene is very dark and monochromatic, making Sean Bean look like he has much darker hair than in outdoors scenes. Both characters have beards and fairly longish hair, are dressed in similar materials, and at the time were played by actors I had not seen in anything recent.\n\nI honestly could not tell them apart the first time I saw the scene played through, and as they are the only characters *in* the scene, and the camera kept cutting back and forth, it was impossible to keep track of what was going on and who was saying what.\n\nPut the two actors side by side in good lighting, and they do not look anything like each other, facially. But in the dark, dressed the same, with roughly the same hair, and almost never appearing in the same camera shot...", "Making characters in the Sims 4. One awesome thing about realizing I have face blindness is that I now understand why I could never make my character look like me! I would literally have a photo of me on my other screen and still struggle lol.\n\nAnd then I would get so many other sim characters mixed up if they shared the same hair style. Anyone else have similar problems with the Sims? Try out custom content. Hard to mix up important Sims if you keep the hair styles, clothing styles, and colour schemes distinct. Plus, way more options for skin details, tattoos, facial hair, eyes, glasses, clothes, etc. \n\nI have not played since the country pack released and broke many of my mods but now I want to play again lol I remember spending like 2 hours making my first character in Fallout 4, with my own photo as reference. When I was finally satisfied with it, I showed it to my roommate and  he said \"Dude, this looks nothing like you. Have you seen yourself in the mirror?\"\nThis was two years before I was diagnosed, and now it is one of those moments I look back on and think \"oh, so that is why\" yes haha! glad others can relate to this as well. i still do not really know what i look like and have to break it down to individual features when trying to make avatars (bitmoji too lol). Even with CC and having the person who I am trying to create sitting next to me, it is a huge struggle to make anything that looks like them ;-;\n\nI just give up and use templates with tiny edits tbh, I hardly even look at the sims when playing so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "This is me when my coworkers have the same color hair as eachother. ", "Pumped to be on this subreddit I have self-diagnosed mild to moderate prosopagnosia! \n\nI have started a little group with about 5 friends where we watch movies from the 90s and eat snacks and make fun of them, and my inability to recognize actors/characters has come up A LOT lately. They still have trouble understanding that I CANNOT see the famous people's faces! So no, I do not remember them!! (See screenshot below) I know the name Sarah Paulson becuase I was told that she plays Marcia Clarke in the OJ American Crime Story (Big true crime fan). I do not know what she looks like!! \n\n\n\nThat being said-- I remember some actors who I have seen a lot, I particularly liked at some point, etc. I know George Clooney and Johnny Depp and some others! \n\nI recognize myself in photos, I recognize myself in the mirror. I recognize my close friends and family. I cannot recognize a person I have met 1-3 times if I see them again. Unless they have purple hair, or always wear certain distinctive accessories, etc. It is tough to explain this! &gt;I know George Clooney and Johnny Depp\n\nHeh, I once watched Up in the Air and then when the credits rolled, I asked, \"wait, George Clooney was in this?\" The previous movie I had seen with him was Syriana, where he has a scruffy beard. So, might as well be a completely different person. (I likewise have trouble with Johnny Depp if he does not look like a pirate.) Wait until you find out Depp was in Crimes of Grindelwald. A big one recently for me was realizing that it was Ben Stiller as the nursing home orderly in Happy Gilmore. It is amazing what facial hair can do. I have never heard of any of these movies so maybe I just have not seen enough movies. Maybe I have only seen them in photographs that are captioned \"JOHNNY DEPP\" and known it was them! oh no! I went looking for this subreddit just to see if anyone else has only \u201cmild\u201d face blindness. I have gotten better at recognizing actors and I can recognize friends and family, but I cannot imagine faces in my head and I cannot hold a memory of faces I know well for very long.\n\nEven though I heard of face blindness years ago I only recently took the self-test and realized I might be. And I have got a few experiences that scream \u201cFace Blind!\u201d now that I know what to look for. Like only vaguely recognizing my new boss the day after being hired and only then because I thought her tattoos looked familiar. Or not recognizing someone I would known for several years just because I was ringing them up at a register instead of the other way around until I placed his voice. I feel like Johnny Depp makes everyone face blind when he is not a pirate. If it were not for the fact that his name is plastered on the cover art of Charlie and the Chocolate factory I would never have known it was him, and my non-faceblind relatives agree! Yeh thank god tattoos are becoming more common, a distinctive tattoo really helps", "I am an art student, and this is a tiny quick project for one of my courses. Inspired by my mild faceblindness.  I really like jt Thanks! :)", "Is this face blindness? I know, I know, another one of those questions.\n\nFirst of all, I feel I should mention I have ASD, which may very well contribute to what I think may be face blindness.\n\nSo, basically, what it comes down to is this. If you asked me to picture what my mother looks like, and draw her, I would not be able to. I could very well be in the same room with her, and be looking right at her, and turned around, I would not know what her face looked like. \n\nOn top of that, no one in my dreams has ever had faces.

Thank you so much for reading.", "What is your Prosopagnosia love story? Hi people! I am so curious, what is your love story? How did you fell in love with him/her, and how to keep a relationship with Prosopagnosia? Thanks! I was introduced to mine at a quiz night. Instantly thought he was cute. He is got curly hair. Even at 50 he is still got all his curls and a very distinctive nose. He is the only person I have ever met that I have never confused with anyone else. I always feel that when I am with him, I am with the most handsome man in the room. i actually wrote a poem for my partner, about my prosopagnosia, what i see in place of their face when i think if them, and my curiosity as to what imagery they can recall when we are apart as someone without the condition. i dont mind sharing so here it is: \n\nwhat do you picture when you think of me?\ndo you see my face? am i smiling?\nam i looking at you? or am i struggling to keep eye contact even in your imagination?\ni see tall. i see the way sunlight bounces on your skin, and all the hues that it brings. \ni see your hands. i see the scars on your knuckles, and how i need both of my hands to hold one of yours. \ni see your hair. i see the way each loc cascades like a weeping willow, and how they move with you. \ni can hear your voice, groggy and mischievous at times.\ni can feel your warmth, and i grin as if you were here. \ncan you feel it too? or is it cold, stagnant snapshots? \ncan you hear me? am i laughing? \nwhat do you picture when you think of me? They had amazing hair. Long ringlets down their back with a huge beard and they were running an obstacle course in his picture.\n\nThey stood me up on our first date because they fell asleep post race.\n\nIt worked out because I actually brought my friend the first time and we had our own date! \n\nWe met up after they apologized and had the most honest conversation about everything important and it just blew me away. S/O and I met on OKC, at an 85-89% match rate. Almost if not every photo on his profile had him wearing a tan baseball cap. I hit him up asking about a watch he received from his grandfather that he talked about in one of his profile sections. After chatting we met and he, thankfully, wore the same hat! Three years later he still wears the hat \u2014 it is part of the uniform his family\u2019s bakery, even if he does not work there anymore. I am sure it is mostly sentimental, but it helps me always be able to find him at a glance.\n\nThe moment I knew I was in love with him was when we went to a noodle restaurant near our college. My prosopagnosia is actually a sub-symptom of ASD. With ASD, I struggle with fine motor skills. That night, as usual, I struggled to use chopsticks. He found the restaurant had \u201cchop stick buddies\u201d, these little plastic connectors to help people learn to use chopsticks. I was overjoyed, I felt normal being able to eat noodles with chopsticks for the first time in my life. After we finished eating, he opened up his jacket and revealed a dozen or more chopsticks buddies he had smuggled out, so I could use chopsticks whenever we went on a date again. Met him the first weekend I was at college.  He is really distinctive looking, so I recognized him when I saw him later and knew where I met him.  First time we had a real conversation, we clicked.  We have a lot of common viewpoints and a nice mix of different and similar interests.  We could talk forever.  Gradually became closer friends over the months until we started dating. We met online as teenagers, he needed an artist for his game dev team, I volunteered, got rejected, but we still kept talking, and talking, and talking... It took him a while to send me a picture of himself, but by that time, I did not care how he looked anymore, his thoughts and character and knowledge about obscure things I could not discuss with anyone else had already swept me off my feet. We lived in different countries, and no one believed it would work out. 10 years later, we are going strong, there for each other during these harsh times. Sadly, we had to go long distance again because of Covid, but we text each other every day. When we get to live together (at mine or at his place), I recognize him by the way he walks and his posture, as well as his clothing - I am familiar with most of the pieces. Every time I am waiting for him to meet me, I get flustered and nervous like it is our first irl meeting again. I can never get enough of this feeling. We met online, so I fell for his personality before I got to see him. We have not met in person yet but he sends me photos occasionally. He knows I struggle with faces and he does too, so we have agreed to wear something easy to identify when we meet so we can recognise each other. When I met my boyfriend, he had a beard, waxed mustache, and round Hemingway glasses that were very distinctive. I later fell in love with his personality too of course, we get along well, but the first time he shaved I did not know who he was. This was also before I knew prosopagnosia was a thing, I just told him he is never allowed to take off his glasses until I learn new ways to recognize him since he looked so different, and he has to wear a familiar shirt. We were both confused as to why I had no idea who he was, but it all makes sense now. This is so sweet! What a beautiful poem...thank you so much for sharing! You story made me melted...He is so sweet.", "Let us all share our horror/humorous stories! Since people have been posting lately, I would love a thread where we can commiserate! I will go first.

It was a very startled and confused customer.\n\nWhen my boyfriend entered a few minutes later, I let him come to me.\n\n- My runner up for most embarrassing:\n\nWhen I was in middle school, my brother had a brand new caretaker who graciously was picking me up from school. She pulled up and I hopped in the front seat, greeting her. She asked how I was and was very pleasant. Then one of my classmates got in the backseat and asked what I was doing in the car.\n\nThat was his mother, not the caretaker. His mother assumed I was hopping in and just a friend coming over after school. I bolted from the car, mortified.\n I once saw my friend on the way home unexpectedly and ran up to hug her. It was not her.  \n\n\nLost  count of the amount of times I have waved at people who did not know me! The other day I met my family at a local outside bar/restaurant. I brought my dog because it was a dog friendly place. \n\nI walked up and sat down next to my brother, step mom, and a girl who I had never seen before. She started petting my dog and telling me how cute she was. Then I introduced myself and asked what her name was. \n\n...it was my brothers long time on-again-off-again gf with a haircut...I thought they were \u201coff\u201d\u2014I  I was wrong. \n\nDEAD. Writing this from the grave.  My horror story was I had no friends in Middle school because I was afraid of talking to people in case I was wrong. I would wait for them to talk to me Here is another!\n\nI used to go to sleepaway camp. Normally, we would have a few repeat campers but for some reason, one year was entirely new people. By the end of the first day I knew all 15 girls to the point that even the counselors were impressed.\n\nThen the next day rolled around. Everyone had changed their outfits and I had no clue who anyone was. I knew there was a Sarah, Miriam, Maggie, Hannah, etc...but I had no idea who belonged to which name. Once the girls realized I was not pulling a prank, I was a bit of a social pariah all summer.\n\n In elementary school, I saw my friend during recess and chased her around yelling her name, \"Vera!\"\nShe kept running away and saying \"I am not Vera!\" \nYears later I know she was not messing with me or playing a game. That was a differwnt girl with the same haircut as Vera... D: \nIts a terrible trick when they all sneak around behind your back and turn into new people when youre not looking \n\nI go to a monthly social group, only about a dozen people in it and ive been going for a couple years. Can still only reliably pick out about 3 of them (in context only) otherwise it might as well be a new group every time! \n\nI have not told anyone about my problem with faces though..  Maybe i should I do this in a monthly social group. Walk in, find an obviously free seat and sort of smile at everyone and wait for them to say hi. Only sort of works. Got a few acquaintances but not really any friends. Tricky when you start from scratch every time! Yesterday i went out to dinner with a social group run by a Carers charity. It was a joint meet up between my local group and the next towns one so i vaguely knew the 3 people from my group but not the 10 or so new people. \nIt was an L shaped table so i couldnt quite see everyone from my seat.\nHalfway through one of the new people came to sit next to me and introduced themselves as Dawn. Had a nice chat for the rest of dinner, i tried to take note of some distinctive features in case they moved again (brown ponytail, jazzy earrings, red jeans, grey shirt) \nAt the end everyone was milling around a bit. One person was going around getting names for facebook,  they got to me, had brown ponytail, red jeans, jazzy earrings, black hoody. Must be Dawn with a jacket on now right? I give my name and Dawn says cool, look for a request from Anthony.\n\nWhat???!!! \n\nSurreptitious look around, nope no doppelgangers anywhere, what the hell is going on. Reluctantly say i must have misheard them earlier or confused them with someone else.\n\nTurns out Dawn is transitioning and is not out on social media so wanted to give me a heads up. Of course by the time everyone has got up from seats and picked bags and coats up ive got all mixed up again so I thought id somehow met two similar people or siblings. Whoops.\n\nStumbled an apology, hope we can still be friends. I was working as a supervisor at a very large retail store that requires an all-black outfit and an apron, so everyone pretty much wore the same outfit while working. \n\nWhen we did seasonal hiring, it was a nightmare. I could not tell anyone apart, I could not learn all of the seasonal employees names, I must have seemed like such a jerk. There were multiple instances, not just one, where I had been training a seasonal and they would take their break, go take off their apron/put on a coat or sweater, and then come buy some products with their discount. When they would come up to the register and ask for their discount, I would politely, in all seriousness, ask \u201coh, which store do you work at?\u201d and they would have to tell me that I was literally training them 10 minutes ago.\n\nOne year, when we were keeping some seasonal employees on staff after the holidays, it took me until the end of the holiday season to realize that an employee that I often worked with was actually two entire distinct people who were the same height, had the same hair length/color, and both wore thick framed glasses. I only realized this because our shop kept one of them on staff and not the other. I ran into the same problem again when I transferred to a new shop and there were two people with the same hair, same height, and their names both started with the same letter! I looked like such an asshole calling them by the wrong names all the time... Lmao I have a bi-weekly group I have been going to for over a year. Only about three people regularly show up and everyone else is sporadic. I have gotten people mixed up so many times and have introduced myself multiple times to the same person. Whenever we meet up somewhere else or someone changes where they sit I panic because I forget who they are. I have gotten strange looks because I will mention something someone said about themselves once and they will say that was not them. Why cannot people just wear name tags all the time? \n\nOnce one of them found me out of context and I spent about ten minutes trying to figure out how this stranger knows me, up until they mentioned the group and then I spent the whole day trying to piece together which one of them they might be. I end up just not using names and pretty much going for small talk every time. \n\nMakes it nearly impossible to make the jump from acquaintance to friend though and I am sure I just seem really stand offish because we could have talked for 3 hours last time, but you are still getting the same bland polite greeting as hannah-marie-laura-whoever-the-hell. \n\nNot that I do not remember and care about all the things we have spoken about, I remember your dogs name and that your mum was unwell and where you would love to travel, I just do not know who YOU are! \nI want to be friends but it is hard :( Yeah, I remember all sorts of details about a person and can almost quote past conversations, but I cannot link that conversation to the person. Setting up outings is horrifying and I have to either spend time slowly analyzing everybody to figure out which one I am supposed to be meeting, or get lucky and they wave at me first. I try to somewhere first if at all possible and will loiter somewhere nice and obvious so whoever I am meeting can find me! \n\nI volunteer with the blind though and it doesnt help there :P", "Were have you found out about prosopagnosia? When I was a kid, I did not knew prosopagnosia was a thing that existed, at first I assumed everyone had the same difficulties that I had, and when I figure it out they did not I started to feel that maybe I was not smart enough to memorize simple things.\n\nIt was only when I was watching Arrested Development, that a character claimed to be face blind, and I became curious if they were inventing a condition like my difficulty or if more people like me existed. And I started googling it.\n\nHow it was for you guys? How did you learn that prosopagnosia was a thing? You heard from a doctor? A acquaintance? A Tv Show?\n\nI think that prosopagnosia is not a well-known enough condition, when I talk about it to people most people have never heard about it. And I think that if I had not watched a specific tv show I myself would not know to this day. A couple of years ago I stopped watching movies as a result of me not being able to keep track of the plots because I cannot recognize / tell apart the characters in the movies. I googled \u201ccannot recognize faces\u201d and found out this \u201cdifficulty\u201d has a name. I spent the longest time thinking it was just something i was fooling myself with, like obviously theres nothing special about me forgetting people's faces, its just me not trying hard enough etc... being undiagnosed with autism until i was 18, and always wanting to believe i was normal despite obvious implications i was not really gave me some issues with imposter syndrome i think...  \n\n\nfirst heard of the condition from a Because Science video (  \n\n\ni like to jokingly think of proso as me being someone who belongs in a superhero universe, where nobody recognizes superheroes because of small masks it is a major plot point in the visual novel horror game 999, which i played last year. i started researching it because i thought it was an interesting condition, and came to discover that my whole \u2018inability to remember faces thing\u2019 was not something everyone experienced. i talked to my therapist about it and we both agreed that i almost certainly have proso. \n\non a side note, that game does get a fair bit wrong about the condition, but it is still a great game! Reddit.\n\nI was lurking on Reddit like I occasionally did, as I did not have a Reddit account.  A subreddit I was looking at had a link to r/Prosopagnosia and I thought, \"That looks like an interesting word, I wonder what that is about.\"\n\nI looked at some of the resources and various posts, and after learning a bit about what Prosopagnosia is, a vast number of my experiences with difficulty recognizing people made a whole lot more sense.  So much in fact, that I finally made a Reddit account after years of occasionally lurking so that I could post in the sub. Got an armchair diagnosis from a stranger online.  I was sharing a couple funny stories about not recognizing people I should have (fiance, myself), and someone was like \"you know, that sounds a lot like peosopagnosia.\"  Looked it up and was like \"holy crap, this is a thing!\" Same as most others. I thought it was a normal thing, that everyone could walk past their fiance and not recognise him, that everyone took a few months to learn what their colleagues at work looked like, and so on.  I would just joke about it, \"you know I am rubbish with faces\" and so on.\n\nI do not know when it clicked that this was 'different', and I cannot remember how I found out it was a recognised condition but I probably googled it when it started getting too difficult.\n\n(Also a big hug to the guy at work who had moved desk and needed to meet with me.. I technically 'knew' what he looked like but he still stood up and started waving as soon as he saw me so I knew who he was and where he was sitting :) ) i mixed up two of my friends from college, my excuse being that they looked similar. they are not similar at all lol, and then one of my friends sent me a face blindness test and i failed it. Watching the show My Holo Love in which the main character has it and so much made sense with how she went through a lot of things that I have always had trouble with. It was mind blowing for me. Good question - I always knew I was bad at faces. It may even have been reddit here where I realized it was a real condition and not \"just being bad at faces\" I actually learned it here. I am not sure what link I followed to get to this sub, but this is where I learned the word \"prosopagnosia\" and that it is a diagnosed condition. I watched the same show and that was the reason I did not think I was faceblind for a longer time despite everyone telling me that I was. I just kept thinking of \"my holo love\" and was like \"but I CAN see faces, Im just bad at remembering them so I am not faceblind\"... I missed the point to put it lightly. I totally understood how her coworkers thought she was so snobby and did not recognize them at times. And I was not sure if I had it either because I can see faces, just that I do not notice the details enough to recognize people or something, lol. Yeah, it was super understandable but it still broke my heart when they were cold to her because of it.\n\nYes! I was so scared to mention it to anybody because I thought I was just too self absorbed to actually remember other people's faces. It was such a relief to learn that it was not like that at all! I was in bullied in highschool, the school wanted me to talk to a therapist about it. She asked me who bullied me (clasmates or others). I told her I did not know everyone that bulleid me, but they somehow knew me. She then suggested I might be faceblind. No official diagnosis though. I think I only went once because it was to far away. But afther reading about it online I was sure I have prosopagnosia. I read this Washington Post article (  and took the link to the Cambridge Face Memory test. There was a movie when I was young about a woman who became face blind from a car accident. My siblings and I were low key freaking out that we were face blind and my mom asked each of us \"can you recognize people from their face?\" Everyone else said yes. When she got to me I thought about it and realized I could not. I could meet someone I was playing with the week before and they would get on my level look me in the eye and I still did not know who they were. They would leave and she would tell me \"you were playing this game with these toys with them a week ago.\" And I would always think it was weird they did not just say that to begin with like it was normal to recognize someone from their face.   \nAnyway, when I said I could not recognize people's faces she just told me \"Alright do what they did in the movie.\" I never saw a doctor and had to wing it for almost two decades.   \n\n\nI forgot that it existed and that I could not really recognize people by their face because I am partially, not fully, face blind. So there would be times when I would and just use that to invalidate the times I could not recognize people I knew even if I knew them very well. \n\nThe second time I figured it out I was in my early twenties. I have always been into art and especially portraits. Any time I tried to do portraits though they would come out fucked up. I told myself I just was not good at them not understanding the extreme resistance and inability to do portraits did not come from lack of skill but from my face blindness.   \nThen I met someone who had been doing art like I had for about the same amount of time since the same age. They decided to do a free hand portrait of me in public and people kept stopping to talk about how incredible and realistic it was. When he finished and showed it to me my first thought was \"that does not look like me.\" (which is something that happened before when someone else did a portrait of me in person. I could recognize it looked like me but my first and overwhelming thought both times was that it did not look like me.)   \nI went to my state capital and free handed the capitol building free hand. It was very realistic and proportioned correctly. It was also fairly easy for me to do so it made me realize that I had skill as an artist I just could not do portraits for some reason.   \nWith this information I decided to just force myself to do portraits and I would get better. Every time I would do a portrait I fucking could not do the face. If I forced myself it always came out proportioned horribly no matter how I tried to portion it correctly. I ended up looking through my artwork with a fresh mind one day and just had this realization that connected everything together. I looked it up and was like \"that is what is happening.\" So- first time movie. Second time- my faceless or fucked face art.   \n\n\nNow that I know my partner will tell me who people are in movies or before we go to a party and one of my brothers would tell me who was in family photos without me asking. I have also been able to come up with better coping skills being fully aware of it now and can be honest with people. Even if they do not believe me or act like I am being dramatic at first it becomes pretty obvious if they spend enough time around me. Lol (like the other night when I told someone \"those are different people.\" for a tv show we were watching. They were in fact the same people from earlier) I ended up doing this for someone else. I had a friend that I would see but would not always recognize me or come say hi which I thought was weird. Then one day she greeted someone then looked at me and said \"You know I cannot recognize people even if I know them but for some reason I can always recognize that guy.\" I told her about prosopagnosia  and was honestly happy I happened to meet someone else like me in the wild. Whenever we meet up in public it is kind of my duty to wave her over since she is easier to pick out of a crowd than I am and I am only partially face blind. I always think people look similar until they are side by side. Then I think \"how tf did I think these people looked the same?\" I even told my girlfriend once that she looked hot in a picture she was not in. She did not say anything until later when I realized it was not her. I later met that person in real life and was like \"Wow they do not look alike at all.\" Now we laugh about it. I wish I had a RL faceblind buddy, but even if I did, I figure we would not recognize each other, which would make it hard to get together. She dresses like a 70\u2019s flower power time capsule. Now it is pretty common for me to wear a neon pink beanie. It started as a work thing then I fell in love with it. So having statement pieces that other people really are not going to have is my go to. \nIf I am meeting non-face blind people my go to is arriving early and staring at my phone or reading a book. I text them saying I arrived then make it their job to find me basically. It is pretty effective I was 35, when I realized that I did not recognize myself in the mirror. \nFirst I was afraid of being schizophrenic, so I wrote on Google \"I do not recognize myself in the mirror\" and that is how I discovered Prosopagnosia.\n\nwhen I told my parents about proso, my father told me that he had sometimes issues for recognizing people but it never really bothered him. I think he has a proso less high than mine.\nSo I knew at this moment that I have the congenital (and hereditary) form of proso.", "Do i have prosopagnosia? Hi all, 28 y/o asian male here. I was always bad at remembering faces, but i feel that it is normal and im just slightly worse at it than everyone else. Or maybe i just could not care much about other people. But after like a week or two of constant face to face interaction, i most likely can recognize their faces when i see them. I cannot picture their face when i close my eyes though. Which is really weird. I mean, i can remember all my colleagues from my previous workplace where i have been working for almost 3 years. But now that i have started working a new job, i cannot seem to remember most of my colleagues i have been interacting with the past 1 or 2 weeks. I think it is getting worse that is why i researched online and found out something called prosopagnosia. I do not think i have it but i want to be sure, i can remember my family and relatives and im confident i can remember my previous colleagues if i meet them out of context. It is weird because at my new job, I can remember certain people maybe like 4/15 of them. But cannot remember the rest which is embarrassing and makes me feel like an ass who is so full of himself. Just the other day at my new workplace, this beautiful american girl greeted me by my nickname and proceeded to cheerfully joke with me. Which i had to play along and i assume we should have communicated quite abit in the past given that she knew my nickname. But i just for the life of me cannot remember her face or her name. I do not recall having any sort of interaction with her.  I then told myself that she was a weird girl and later that day, the exact same thing happened but with 2 other indian ladies. (I was at the toilet and this lady greeted me by my nickname and i was so shocked i just gave a blank stare and she said \"what? U do not know who i am?\" Which i had to pretend to recall\") i feel like a terrible POS. And that is why im researching more about this. Do i just have selected memory? Because sometimes i can actually remember people which is weird. P.s. about the beautiful american girl. Since im residing in singapore, i am usually only working with fellow asians so i felt that if it was an american girl i would have remembered because it was just so rare in this country. Welcome to r/Prosopagnosia! Do not hesitate to write down your experiences with facial recognition/perception and post them here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, you think you may have Prosopagnosia? Well, try and answer these questions:  \n\n- Can you recognize faces but have trouble visualizing them? \n- Are you always able to recognize co-workers, even when you see them outside of work?\n- Can you recognize actors in movies even if they change their looks a lot? \n- Do seemingly complete strangers come up to you and know who you are, but you have no idea who they are?\n\n(Thank you /u/cyborgdreams for this amazingly helpful set of questions). \n\nYou may also want to look into ( ( \nAnd ( In my knowledge, there are no tests currently available for ProsoPam since the two are very much alike that only brain scans would differentiate between the \ntwo- take this with a grain of salt, though. \nProsoPam is more of a deficit relating to encoding faces, rather than a perceptual deficit.

The phenomenon was first described by Francis Galton in 1880 but has since remained largely unstudied. Interest in the phenomenon renewed after the publication of a study in 2015 conducted by a team led by Professor Adam Zeman of the University of Exeter, which also coined the term aphantasia. Research on the condition is still scarce.\n\n***\n\n**Prosopamnesia**\n\nProsopamnesia (Greek: \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd = \"face\", \u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 = forgetfulness) is  a selective neurological impairment in the ability to learn new faces.  There is a special neural circuit for the processing of faces as opposed to other non-face objects.  Prosopamnesia is a deficit in the part of this circuit responsible for encoding perceptions as memories.\n\n***\n\n^(( | )( | )( | )( | )( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28) I took the test and see number 6 as the red star. What does that mean?\n\nEdit: oh wait i thought it meant if i can see the red star in the picture. I cannot see the red star in my mind. It is just complete darkness. But i can slowly draw the outline of a star if i try hard enough but for some reason the outline will not come together as in connect. The perimeter wont touch, it keeps disappearing halfway.

The perimeter wont touch, it keeps disappearing halfway. It is like 3/4 a star but its black in colour with four pointed tips instead of 5. What does that mean? \n\n\nYou probably have Aphantasia! Aphantasia is usually defined as the inability or heavily deficient ability\u2014it is also a spectrum of different degrees of severity, just like Proso\u2014to visualize and generate visual stimuli in your head *consciously* (as in images, videos, etc.) in your head. Others agree that it may also extend to the other senses (imagining a smell in your head, inner monologue/inner voice, etc.)\nYou can, however, still see imagery or something akin to that in your dreams. \n\nSpeaking of inner monologue, someone documented their detailed experience: \n\n 'I do have the \u2018milk voice\u2019\u2014that flat, inner monologue that has no texture or sound, which we use to tell ourselves: \u201cRemember to pick up milk.\u201d I can \u201cdoo doo doo\u201d in my milk voice and tell myself I am singing the theme song to Star Wars. However, most of my friends and family describe what they \u201chear\u201d as music\u2014not as vivid as the real thing, to be sure, and not as many instruments\u2014but \u201cmusic\u201d nonetheless. I would never describe my experience as such; it is just the flavorless narrator, struggling to beatbox. And I have never had a song \u201cstuck\u201d in my head.' \n\nOh, and it is apparently from ( \n\nIt seems that perhaps SDAM, Aphantasia, Proso, and maybe ASD also tie into one weird stream\u2014or multiple\u2014line of thinking and cognition. \nThe author in that article explained how he had difficulties in questions that required telling a story or writing down previous experiences (based on autobiographical memory). It should not come off as a surprise that people on the opposite end of the spectrum have some degree of hyperphantasia, hyperthymesia (Superior Autobiographical Memory), and (hyper?) facial reconigition\u2014also dubbed as 'super recognizers'. Thank u for responding. I always thought not being able to picture faces is normal. Now i wonder how does it feel like for other people to picture someone and that person's face comes to mind. How wonderful would that be. It shocks me that actually most people can do this. I really hope that me not being able to recognize some people's faces is due to this condition and not me not making a conscious effort to remember them. Because im really trying my best to recall and nothing comes to mind. Thanks for the shout out! To answer my own questions: \n\n- I have zero problem visualizing / imagining (in fact I am a professional artist) and I can visualize/imagine faces, however, what I am visualizing is probably not accurate. For example, I may think I am imagining Jim Carey's face, but I cannot recognize his face on Jack Nicholson's body at all. By contrast, I showed my boyfriend that video and asked him what he saw, and he immediately said Jim Carey, despite the hair and head shape being completely different. So it is possible I am visualizing a generic face with Jim Carey's hair and head shape when I imagine him. \n\nI would like to know how people with aphantasia experience facial recognition. I would imagine they cannot visualize faces (or anything else) but are still able to recognize when they see a familiar face? Anyone with aphantasia want to chime in and talk about it? \n\n- I sometimes can recognize co-workers out of context if they have a very unique appearance. A lot of the time it can take a little bit for me to figure out who it is, and sometimes I have to straight up ask them who they are. \n\n- recognizing actors in movies is nearly impossible for me and I gave up a long time ago. Unless they have a very distinct feature (like Hugo Weaving's forehead) I am just not able to do it, even if I have seen them in multiple movies. \n\n- people knowing who I am and I have no idea who they are happens to me all the time, at least once a week. Mostly what I do is pretend to know who they are until I can figure it out. Is there a big proportion of face blind people who have aphantasia then? I am face blind but I also have a great mind's eye. &gt;I always thought not being able to picture faces is normal\n\nMost aphantasiacs thought that, too, before they had known of their inability to do so. Also, thinking that picturing things is used more in a figurative sense rather than a literal one. \n\n&gt;Now i wonder how does it feel like for other people to picture someone and that person's face comes to mind\n\nI think that most people would say that they can picture and visualize people's faces normally, even crystal clear. \n\n&gt; How wonderful would that be\n\nCertainly. I mean, ever missed a loved one? You would probably be picturing their face a lot. On the downside, some people report that it can get quite annoying and maybe emotionally wrecking to constantly have their face in their minds 24/7. It just varies from one person to another. \n\n&gt; It shocks me that actually most people can do this\n\nYou and I both.\n\n&gt;I really hope that me not being able to recognize some people's faces is due to this condition and not me not making a conscious effort to remember them\n\nA lot of people with Proso dealt with self-doubt in that sense; thinking that not recognizing someone is more of an attention problem, or that you feel you are too self-absorbed. It can be quite damaging, honestly. Assure yourself whenever these thoughts come to mind that you are physically unable to do that. \n\n&gt;Because im really trying my best to recall and nothing comes to mind.\n\nI want to ask: you can still recognize people without picturing them in your mind e.g. a person with aphantasia can still recognize people more or less than someone without aphant. The inability to visualize faces and difficulties recognizing them are *still* signs of Proso, though. Just to remind you that the two are not mutually exclusive. &gt;I have zero problem visualizing / imagining (in fact I am a professional artist) and I can visualize/imagine faces, however, what I am visualizing is probably not accurate. For example, I may think I am imagining Jim Carey's face, but I cannot recognize his face on Jack Nicholson's body at all. By contrast, I showed my boyfriend that video and asked him what he saw, and he immediately said Jim Carey, despite the hair and head shape being completely different. So it is possible I am visualizing a generic face with Jim Carey's hair and head shape when I imagine him.\n\nSo, basically, you know you are *seeing something* in your head, but the facial features of Jim Carey are probably inaccurate or maybe not even defined? Maybe like seeing a canvas of a face\u2014more or so clearly\u2014but you cannot grasp their facial features and perhaps even put them in \"place\"? I am just trying to get an idea of your ability to visualize things in your head *with* Proso. \n\nOn a second note, the ( that you are talking about with Jim Carey played as that dude (I do not know which dude as I have not watched it) in The Shining? I only saw the video where the two of them were put side by side and compared. I think that the other guy had more wrinkles than Jim Carrey? I am not sure. Oh, and apparently, Jim also starred as The Mask. I did not know that! Edit: Cameron Diaz' first movie was The Mask, too- Crazy! \n\n&gt;I would like to know how people with aphantasia experience facial recognition. I would imagine they cannot visualize faces (or anything else) but are still able to recognize when they see a familiar face? Anyone with aphantasia want to chime in and talk about it?\n\nThat would be very interesting, actually. I do hope someone comes forward and talks about their experience!\n\n\n&gt;I sometimes can recognize co-workers out of context if they have a very unique appearance. A lot of the time it can take a little bit for me to figure out who it is, and sometimes I have to straight up ask them who they are.\n\n&gt;Oh, I hope they were not very offended when you could not recognize them like that and instead had to ask them directly. \n\n&gt;recognizing actors in movies is nearly impossible for me and I gave up a long time ago. Unless they have a very distinct feature (like Hugo Weaving's forehead) I am just not able to do it, even if I have seen them in multiple movies.\n\nI can recognize them by a collection of hair colour, distinctive features, voice, etc. \n\n&gt;people knowing who I am and I have no idea who they are happens to me all the time, at least once a week. Mostly what I do is pretend to know who they are until I can figure it out.\n\nYes. Asking them very generic things, etc. until it just **clicks** who that person is.\n\nThank you for sharing! I am not sure\u2014I do not have solid statistics on the prevalence of Aphantasia and Prosopagnosia.  \n\n&gt;I am face blind but I also have a great mind's eye. \n\nThat is very cool. May I ask: how would you describe seeing someone is face? Can you still see other parts of them e.g. hairline, forehead, chin, maybe parts of their facial features? Or are they more \"scattered\" and not in place? I tend to picture people with a generic face. Like I know that they have a face, but I do not remember what it looks like exactly unless I have worked to memorise specific features. Characters I have come up with myself have a tragic case of same-face syndrome in my mind (I make sure I rectify this when I draw!). I guess it is almost like I have aphantasia specifically for faces. I know I do not have it generally because I have no problem coming up with cool action scenes in my head or visualising 3D shapes in maths. So I would say my brain just kind of hand-waves any faces I think about. If that makes any sense at all. &gt;So, basically, you know you are seeing something in your head, but the facial features of Jim Carey are probably inaccurate or maybe not even defined? Maybe like seeing a canvas of a face\u2014more or so clearly\u2014but you cannot grasp their facial features and perhaps even put them in \"place\"? I am just trying to get an idea of your ability to visualize things in your head with Proso.\n\nI really wish I could show you what I am imagining when I visualize a face. I have to assume the features I am imagining are generic and not that accurate. I wonder what someone with normal face recognition abilities would see if I could show them what I am visualizing. I do feel like my visualization of faces is not as clear as for other things like objects. \n\n&gt; I think that the other guy had more wrinkles than Jim Carrey?\n\nThe first time I saw that vid I thought it was digital de-aging.\n\n&gt; Edit: Cameron Diaz' first movie was The Mask, too- Crazy! \n\nFor the longest time I thought Cameron Diaz and Kirsten Dunst were the same person...\n\n&gt; Oh, I hope they were not very offended when you could not recognize them like that and instead had to ask them directly. \n\nWhen that happens I tell them I have prosopagnosia and try to explain what that is. Sometimes I think they do not believe me or think I am making excuses, so I am trying to figure out a better way to explain why I cannot recognize people. \n\n&gt; I can recognize them by a collection of hair colour, distinctive features, voice, etc. \n\nI sort of can too, but I will still mix them up with other actors that look similar. And if it is someone like Johnny Depp who drastically changes his look for every movie then forget it. &gt;I guess it is almost like I have aphantasia specifically for faces\n\nAnd that is Proso for you!\n\n&gt;because I have no problem coming up with cool action scenes in my head or visualising 3D shapes in maths\n\nI have grown up watching a lot of animated action so I totally get what you mean, but it is the 3D shapes that I cannot do. \n\n&gt;So I would say my brain just kind of hand-waves any faces I think about. If that makes any sense at all.\n\nYes, it does. It is simply the Proso experience in visualization- very insightful.\n\nThank you for sharing! &gt;I really wish I could show you what I am imagining when I visualize a face. I have to assume the features I am imagining are generic and not that accurate\n\nI think I am getting what you mean: you try and conceive the \"face\" on a person, usually through things you remember about them, but the \"face\" that you built has more generic features and thus not really \"tailored\" to each individual person's face. That is how *I* understood it, at least.\n\n&gt;I wonder what someone with normal face recognition abilities would see if I could show them what I am visualizing\n\nIf they have a considerably good ability to visualize, I think they would do just fine in recognizing people and picturing their face in their mind. If they are aphantasiac, however, I do not think they would be able to visualize faces, but they can still recognize people by their faces\u2014I genuinely do not know how, though; it probably comes off as a more intuitive and spontaneous experience. I have read in an article that Aphants\u2014including those whose recognition abilities are normal\u2014feel as though they may let go of people more easily, since they cannot mentally reminisce and re-experience the collection of events, though I think that is a somewhat bold statement to make; I am sure that most Aphants are still capable of emotional bonding, but probably through other means. That is how Aphants have developed other methods of learning. \n\n&gt;For the longest time I thought Cameron Diaz and Kirsten Dunst were the same person...\n\nI just looked her up, and she seems to have a more pale complexion than Diaz.\n\n&gt;When that happens I tell them I have prosopagnosia and try to explain what that is. Sometimes I think they do not believe me or think I am making excuses, so I am trying to figure out a better way to explain why I cannot recognize people.\n\nYes. That must really suck. I reckon that you have stopped telling people that you have Proso because of this particular reason, eh? Or maybe you could feel more open speaking about it in front of a close person, or is it that you have grown indifferent to their reactions, thus refraining to disclose it again?\n\n&gt;I sort of can too, but I will still mix them up with other actors that look similar. And if it is someone like Johnny Depp who drastically changes his look for every movie then forget it.\n\nI recall seeing Johnny Depp in something other than his usual Pirates of the Caribbean character, and if I remember correctly, the credits of that movie said Johnny Depp, which made me ask my mother if that really is him. No, I still tell them, because I think it is important that they know why I cannot recognize them (even if they do not believe it at first). Lately I have been phrasing it differently and instead of \"I am face blind\" I say \"I have a neurological condition called prosopagnosia which makes it impossible for me to recognize faces\" and try to answer their questions and mention that I am in a study (the Susilo Lab one). I think it is good to spread awareness and understanding since most people have never heard of this and likely never met someone who had it. &gt;I say \"I have a neurological condition called prosopagnosia which makes it impossible for me to recognize faces\" and try to answer their questions and mention that I am in a study (the Susilo Lab one)\n\nIt is more formal and straightforward; it also gives them room to ask you questions and get to know about this condition.\nAlso, Susilo Lab? As in the one you had linked before? How is it coming down? I am curious about participating in a study. \n\n&gt;Johnny Depp's looks are so different even when he is playing normal-looking characters. I mean \"Finding Neverland\" and \"Secret Window\" I would not have known it was the same person.\n\nI will make note that the \"apparent dude I do not know\" is going to be Johnny Depp in both of these movies. Thank you!", "meeting new friends I have always been a bit of a shut in, and the pandemic made it worse, so I joined a social group in my town for people around my age. I was nervous for many reason, one of them being would I even recognize the people I am supposed to meet? One of the people going had a big beard so it took a little bit of me pacing for me to guess that was the group I was looking for.\n\nWe met up at a roller skating rink and had a good time. This is the first time i have had to talk about my condtion to people. I could probably have faked it well enough, but I would feel guilty if people thought I was ignoring them when I just did not recognize them. So I explained as I talked to people \"I am very bad with faces\" And as the night went on explained that I can recognizes people by their voices better. I got some reactions, none of them rude but, \"I have not heard of that before that is interesting.\" And \"Oh, I am going to be asking people for names I am bad with names.\"\n\nIt was stepping out of my comfort zone in more way than one, but I am glad I went!

I use a lot more tricks to hide that I do not recognize a person (like open-ended conversation) and then use the clues they give to place them. Apart from the usual stuff, which is clothing, hairstyle etc., I try to memorize scars and/or tattoos, which are fantastic markers. Also I try to memorize people\u2019s posture and the way they walk as good as I can, and I excel at memorizing voices. These are traits people do not usually change, so if someone changes their clothing or hair I am not totally lost. \nAnyway, if I am in a conversation and really cannot figure out who I am talking to, I mention my prosopagnosia. Reactions are usually quite understanding and it is not awkward. Only associate with weird looking people At work I use the employee directory and seating chart often!  Sometimes at a party I can refer to a Facebook invite list / comments to look for the right person. \n\nOtherwise if I want to remember I email myself a short summary of what to remember about them and their interests.

This may be a stupid question and I am sorry if it is been asked here before. \n\nI was just wondering if you can recognise yourself. I would imagine you know that you are looking at yourself when you look in the mirror but can you recognise yourself in pictures?\n I actually struggle to recognise my daughter in her baby photos and even photos of her as a 1 year old. \nShe is only 2yrs 3mnths.  I cannot. \n\nWhat makes it worse is that I am trans, and my face is changing over time, slowly, and I cannot notice the changes cause I cannot remember the baseline. \n\nI still think I look male as fuck, but everyone else disagrees. Usually I am not in a picture with people who look like me, as I do not have any same age/gender siblings. So I use context to figure out which one is me. And as you mentioned, looking in a mirror you know what you are looking at. If I was in a photo lineup with 6 people of similar age, build, hair, and eye color as myself, I would take longer to identify myself. In a more realistic scenario, I do struggle to identify myself in class photos from elementary school. Kids have less variation in height and build, and I do not remember the clothes I wore when I was that age, or how I wore my hair, so my usual identity clues are missing. Now imagine a photo lineup of me as a 6 year old--there is no way, I would be just guessing. I do not recognize myself in my mirror, and I hardly recognize myself in pictures, I think that I do because I know I am in the picture... I always recognise myself, but sometimes I mistake others for me too. A few weeks ago at work someone put a message in our company slack showing \"me\". The joke was that it was a lookalike, but I sat for ages wondering where it was taken until someone realised and pointed out that it was a crowd shot of the oscars I do not always. There have definitely been times when I did not realize there was a mirror and did not recognize that the person staring at me was actually me. It is a super weird feeling.  Usually, but that is mostly because I can recognize the setting - family home, school photo etc - and so I am 'primed' to search more carefully for any faces which might be me. I have sometimes picked the wrong face in family photos which include other people of about the same age, though. Usually - but I feel like there are four or five different \"Mos.\"  Different factors make my face look completely different to me, but I recognize all the variations.  And I have a few distinct features that mean I only confuse myself in pictures with family members. I cannot recognise myself in photographs or reflections, not by my face anyway.  I recognize myself in mirrors, unless it is an unexpected mirror (like walking through a department store and seeing myself in a mirrored wall or something). Then it takes a few seconds. \n\nI do recognize myself in pictures, because I know we are looking at family pictures and one of them is probably me. In other words, I have a cheat code that I will be appearing soon :) ", "Do I have prosopagnosia? I just took the famous faces tests and what I experienced was really weird. I knew almost each face but I could not even remember Tom Cruise's name. I knew I knew him, I knew what he did even the movies he was in but not his name. I only got a 48% correct score on the test and the average is about 85%. \n\nI know that often I see actors that \"look alike\" but nobody will agree with me, and sometimes I will see an actor I know in a movie, but I will have no idea from where, or what their name is. \n\nCould it be that I am just really really bad at remembering even famous people's names when I see their face or something? Or is this what someone with mild prosopagnosia experiences? \n\nI am so curious and confused as to why I got such a low score thinking I could get an above average one. ", "Faces vs. voices My best friend and I are keeping in touch during the pandemic by watching our favorite TV shows together virtually--we both queue them up at the same time then text each other while we watch. Everyone who knows me knows that I cannot tell actors apart, even if I have not told them about my prosopagnosia. So she is used to having to tell me \"that is the guy the heroine broke up with at the beginning\" or \"that is the villain's henchman in disguise,\" or whatever.\n\nThe other day we decided to mix it up by listening to an audio drama together instead. There were two main female characters: one smart, fearless, and a bit bossy, the other more timid and inexperienced, with slightly different British accents. To me they sounded completely different from each other. And my friend actually got them mixed up! I asked her \"is this what it is like watching a visual show with me?\" She said yes, it was....\n\nI have always known that voices were a major crutch for me, and now I suspect that may be why I like audio dramas/fiction podcasts so much. Anyone else into the audio medium?\n\n(Side note--is there a voice recognition test one can take, similar to the Cambridge Face Memory Test but for voices? I would like to know if I am unusually good at recognizing voices, or if I am average, just better than at faces.) I use voices a lot to follow TV shows.  I actually do not really watch; I am usually doing something else at the same time. Same here. I am always either sewing, doing chores, or texting a friend who is also watching the show. This is my life. It drives my husband nuts, because I almost never actually \"watch\" a show, but listen instead while I do something else. I do not forget voices, and I never remember a face.

I think it would have been no less confusing if they had each worn their masks all the time.\n\nAnd now, just starting season 3, is Tokyo a completely different person?", "DAE love subtitles? I started turning on subtitles because I have auditory processing issues and I can more easily pay attention when stuff is in text on the screen. \n\nBut then I found an amazing thing: Many subtitles have character names! Like this:\n\nMARY: Did you see Lucy\u2019s shirt today?\n\nThis has been a game-changer for my face blindness. Now I can associate a character name with a voice, and I can follow the voices. Seeing everything in print has made all the difference for me. \n\nDo you feel the same way? Any other \u201chacks\u201d like this? I love subtitles! I do not know if I have auditory processing issues or not, but I also have a hard time comprehending without subtitles. I have used them since I was a kid.\n\nSubtitles with names? Top. Fucking. Notch.  Yes!!!\n\nI love subtitles even when they do not have names - they make focusing much easier, and I know I will end up missing *something* without them. And yes, I will admit that sometimes I talk through movies, and subtitles help with that too... sorry, friends and family :/\n\nAnd it is even better when they do have names! I have always wished that they always had names... it would make movie watching so much easier! Yep, I watch everything with subtitles! I wish they had prosopagnosia-targeted ones with names on lines on the first one in each scene or something I apparently like to make things hard.  I hate subtitles (but love to read in general,) and cartoons/anime.  I guess I like being confused? I love subtitles, but im also hard of hearing. In shows with people who all look the same to me i do find that helpful. Otherwise i go to the wiki for the show if i am confused and think im thinking two characters are the same person Me too!  I had a deaf friend in grade school, so I learned about closed captioning from watching TV with her.\n\nUnfortunately, my husband hates them.  When I watch TV alone I like to sit in a dark room, with the sound audible but not too loud and subtitles on.\n\nThere is also a service which is called descriptive narration.  It is designed for the visually impaired.  it is interesting, but I have not found it as helpful as CC or subtitles.  That one *really* drives the husband nuts.\n\nOther hacks?  When I am in a meeting with strangers and we all trade business cards, I lay them out on the table in the order that the people are sitting.  It is a handy reference, even if you are just bad with names.  Even if they leave the room and come back later they almost always sit in their original seats.  I think it is a territory thing. :) I love both subtitles and descriptive audio.  I mentioned in another thread, but watching \"The Haunting at Hill House,\" descriptive audio was my game-changer! \n\nExample: Oldest brother Steve comes home, and a lady with long dark hair is waiting in his apartment.  First try on the episode, I had no idea who this was.  (Nell?  Olivia?  Theo?  Shirley?)  When I re-watched with descriptive audio, a narrator helpfully adds something like, \"Nell is waiting for him inside.\"     \n\nI kept it on the rest of the series.   Super useful for the living characters, and also really useful to be told when one of the ghosts is someone we have already met!   \n\nSide benefit: the narrator also tells you when, say, Nell is staying in the same hotel room her mother visited a couple episodes ago...  Lots of stuff I would have missed, even without prosopagnosia.  If you are like me and you do not mind \u201cspoilers\u201d, I often read movie synopses on Wikipedia beforehand. That way I know which character is supposed to be doing what, so it makes it easier to keep them straight (eg \u201cMary is dating Bill, so Bill must be the one bringing flowers home\u201d etc). I find I can relax more and just enjoy what is happening on the screen (irrespective of how well I can identify characters without much contextual information) that way.  ", "Cannot picture anyone's face in my head, anybody? I am so glad I found this subreddit because I have been struggling by myself for so long...Never have I felt so understood. I have had so many awkward moments because of face blindness throughout my life. I really want to socialize but I always struggle matching names with faces and just end up not talking to people because I might get the wrong person/call them by the wrong name....but anyways.\n\nRecently I realized something interesting about this condition- I cannot picture anyone's face in my head. Not my friends, not my parents, not even my SO who I live with and see every single day. Before I knew I have this condition, I have always been kind of confused when I see lyrics like \"I can see your face clearly in my head\" or \"Your face is becoming blurry in my mind\" or something like that, because I have never been able to picture anyone's face at all. When I ask people about this, many people say that they can do it with relative ease. I can picture an object in my head, just not faces. I assume this may be relatable to some of you too?  This realization was the missing link for me in terms of understanding why I could not recognize people\u2019s faces. I cannot picture them in my head.\n\nMy face-blindness is more on the mild to moderate end, in that I can picture and recognize my close friends\u2019 and family members\u2019 faces, but it takes a long time for me to be able to build up that mental image. I need to have basically daily visual contact with someone for many months before I can picture them in my mind, and therefore recognize them. So, my husband - yes. A coworker I have worked with every day for a month? Probably not.\n\nLong story short, yes, I too have a hard time picturing people\u2019s faces in my mind! Mine is more mild as well...if I try really hard I can see people's individual facial features (eyes, lips, nose, etc) but I can never put them all together as a whole...is that weird? I cannot actually picture anything in my head (full aphantasia), but I just realized that when I dream, none of my people have faces. Brains are weird. I can picture objects in my head, but not faces and not routes to and from somewhere. I can picture the start and the end, but nothing in the middle. \n\nI used to get lost in my home town all the time. Thank goodness for GPS. It is the same with me! Ditto. Can only see a few peoples faces and they are realllllllly not detailed. Actually I cannot see a lot in my mind. It is kind of like a Lite Brite if I do (like imagine a sunset made on a lite brite if you tell me to think of a sunset) I am the same, plus I have some level of aphantasia. I really realised this was A Thing when I noticed I could not picture my mother's face a few years back. Not weird for someone with face blindness! ;) I often am the same This is called aphantasia.  Basically you cannot picture stuff in your head.  I can picture things, but it is hard and limited.  For example, I can picture an apple if I try, but it is not automatic.  It is kind of like drawing it in my head.  Interestingly, I remember color and placement of things (like that part of the book was on the bottom right page) well, but not details.  Visualizing a face is extremely hard.  It is usually a little foggy and it is much easier for me to visualize a photo of someone than their actual face...but I cannot reliably recognize a person from their photo. I am not so sure that comes from aphantasia. I have an incredibly detailed imagination but I cannot picture anyone's face either unless it is really distinct I cannot picture faces in my mind either. I can picture everything else, just not faces. The only exception to this is I can sometimes picture a *picture* of the person. For example, there is a picture I took of my husband 10 years ago making a funny face. If someone told me to describe my husband's face, I can picture that PICTURE and describe that. But if I try to focus too hard on it, it is gone. Oops.  I misread what OP said.  I thought they said they COULD NOT visualize other objects. Huh. I did not even think about that...I did not even...think that was a thing people or myself could do. Yeah if I try to think of a face it is kind of... not there in my mind at all. Me too!! lol before people told me that they can I truly had no idea that people can do that without trouble Me too! Places do not have connections when I think about them. I also love GPS No offense, I just started reading up on this and found this sib, but have you tried psychedelics or any other form of therapy? Like I said I just stbled on the issue and would like to know more. I will do my own research. I just feel like psychs might have the potential to ease this sort of thing. I might be way off base here. But thanks either way ME TOO! When I dream I always have the \"feeling\" who the people are, but I wouls never see their face OMG yes!! I was actually just thinking about that. I have some framed photos in my house and I look at them a lot, so I think I have (somewhat) memorized what the pictures look like, presumably along with the faces in it. If I try to think of that specific picture in my mind, I can see it. And just like how you said, if I try to focus specifically on the face in the picture, it becomes blurry and empty. I cannot remember faces either, even if they are someone very familiar, like my wife or Mom (this goes with my difficulties in recognizing faces). I have walked right past my Mom in airports, because she looks different in airports. She is not in her normal surroundings.\n\nI can only picture certain facial features, like my wife's nose or Mom's teeth.  Now that I think of it, I have difficulties picturing entire objects as well--I picture details or parts of them but not the entire object. I have Asperger's, and many of us have face-blindness. I think we are oriented more toward details rather than the whole picture of something. I can picture faces in my head. \n\nAs a whole, they are blurried like in most of my dreams (sometimes \"empty\", i cannot see them at all but I know there goes the head). The details alone are sharp and texturized (not necessarily realistic). \n\nAs I zoom-in, it is all cool; when I zoom out, it is cool but uncommon I guess? Basically, I visualize the facial features \"separately\" and/or \"distorted\" (most often they are floating in front of the person's head, uncoordinated with the facial movements, they nay be cartoonish).\n\n I do not see all the facial features, I only see those with \"character\", I guessed. For example, if a person's brow movement is a strong clue, I will see their brows showing an expression but disjointed from the face.\n\nI used to draw / paint and making portraits of people had me memorize their faces. I can visualize - I think, it is a bit transparent - realistically those people's faces (not cartoonish, reliable proportions). The more I focus the less I can see, so I taught myself to actively avoid that because it may lead to forgetting (it happened a lot when I was younger). These faces are not attached to a body, I suspect it is because I only drew heads. Yes!! When I picture my friends and family, I picture particular moments.\n\nI am so grateful I have a picture of a friend who died suddenly and young, smiling his distinctive cheesy grin. Because I have that snapshot and have looked at it a lot, I have learned it. Now I can technically picture my friend's face--not directly, but through remembering this specific image. I know this is an old post, but holy fuck dude. you hit the nail on the head for me, especially your replies below about being able to picture the individual features. with loved ones and my own face, I can picture stuff like their nose, eyes etc... but when I try to visualise the whole face I just CANNOT. the most I can come up with is a general kind of \"vibe\" or feeling. Yes!! Me too! I am so glad someone can understand haha\nI also do not see any face in my dreams because of this. It is only a general \"feeling\" like you said", "Thought at least a few people on here might appreciate my text history with my friend  Well... I know Bob Ross, and I know the meme.

I did not think my Prosopagnosia had any effect on animals, specifically dogs, however I just realized I tend to favorite unique breeds or colorings of dogs. \nRecently I have been looking into Service Dogs but had this unexplainable dislike of the common breeds- yellow labs, black labs, golden retrievers. And I would much rather prefer blue Merle Australien Shepherds, German Shepherds, or spotted/Merle dogs in general. I just realized this may be due to how similar all labs and retrievers look compared to how Merle dogs are all very distinctively unique. \nCats are the same too... I prefer tuxedo or calicos... \nbut it does not apply to birds, I love many different mutations of poultry and do not prefer unique colors, maybe due to the different face shape? \n\nAnyone else have similar problems? Or a tendency to prefer unique colorations of animals? No. I do not have your issue. But that is not why I am responding.\n\nIn my usual way I am going to comment on an issue I think is interesting but unrelated to the question. \n\nMerle colored dogs are problematic. While I agree the color is cool, the genetic mutation is fairly bad for the health of the dog. Merle dogs are prone to blindness, deafness, retardation, and other health problems.\n\nTo discourage the breeding of Merle dogs legitimate kennel clubs will not register them, and they are ineligible for many shows.\n\nBad mutation. Try not to encourage it. And I will give a preemptive agreement to anyone who wants to say I oversimplified my comments, but this is prosopagnosia fer cryin\u2019 out loud. Is not Merle the main color of Aussies? Just curious what causes those links? Do not all white dogs with blue eye genes carry higher risks of being deaf/blind? I always thought that one kind of animal looked like another, but not long ago I made a surprising discovery: that dogs have different faces. Apparently the owner of a black labrador can recognise his dog in a group of other black labradors by its face. The same goes for other animals, which I still find extraordinary, I do not think this is related to prosopagnosia, it is just your preferences. I agree that merle dogs are very pretty though! It is weird but besides obvious markings, I can tell individual cats apart from their face, mannerisms and voice. I am decent at telling their approximate age, and even have a \"type\" of face I favour. Other creatures and humans? Nope. Completely stumped. One could argue it is because I grew up with cats, but I grew up with plenty of humans too so that makes no sense. I think blue or rarely, red merle are the *only* colors that Australian Cattle Dogs (aka Blue Heelers) have. They are generally considered one if the smarter breeds, and no more prone to genuine blindness or deafness than any other breed (selectively, deliberately blind and/or deaf is another question entirely, and they are often incredibly stubborn animals). Australien cattle dogs are ticked and do not carry any Merle genes Okay. Did not know that.

I have known them both for about a decade and they are pretty conservative in appearance.  I was pretty good friends with Shayla for a few years.  As I was checking myself into the work roster, I heard them walk up behind me so I said, \"I got you guys.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Dwyla.\n\n\"Yeah, thanks!\" said an unfamiliar male voice who was definitely not Shayla.  I turned around and I could not place him.  He also had a smart alecky look on his face - one that said \"I know you did not see me behind you and you were not talking to me\" so I figured it was a new guy trying to be a dick.\n\nI decided to double down and actually check him him in, so I asked \"And you are...?\"  The look on his face told me that he was not the one being a dick.\n\n\"Damn, BennyG, that was *cold*,\" said Dwyla.\n\nHow cold?  He is worked with us for about 4 years, I have worked on projects with him, gone on a couple of work-related trips with him, and have genuinely enjoyed his company.   I had not talked with him in a few months, and he caught me feeling awkward and off balance.  *Pretty cold.*\n\nBut jeez, it is not like I dated the guy... This is what scares me.  Well, not dating Lisa and accidentally ghosting her.  I am a straight, married female, so I think Lisa is safe from me.  But accidentally being mean to someone and never knowing it.  I suspect I avoid building relationships with people, because of this. No one's ever called me out on it, but I know I have had to have done that to friends before. I know of at least one person that changed their hair and I could not find them again, although they are partially to blame because they never came up to me again. Although one time, I ran up to two of mine and grabbed them around the shoulders and asked how their day was. Took me several seconds to figure out why they stayed silent and backed away from me. Wrong people. Forget Lisa.  You are too good for her.  And if she was really excited about you, she should have made a point to talk with you.   On the other hand, if Lisa is also face blind, you have got nothing to worry about (sometimes people get radically different haircuts on accident, as I did when I asked for a trim, got a hack job and could not recognize myself for weeks afterward). If you like her why not reach out and explain what happened? Lisa, why did you cut your hair Lisa????? Not cool Lisa. Really who is the dick in this scenario?My ex was a natural blonde but dyed their hair red. I told them \u201cplease do not ever go back to blonde, I might not love you anymore\u201d", "I am confused the thing is I can recognize some celebs some times and sometimes I forgot the faces of famous people out of blue for example like prime minister/president of a country.  \nand I cannot remember faces normally in day to day life and the whole exposure-based facial recognition test is a living nightmare for me.  \ndid I have this facial blindness condition or not.please tell me? I do not think that for most people this is a yes/no question and answer.\n\nSince there is no cure or treatment, the answer is not that important.  It is helpful to understand that people with prosopagnosia are not crazy or stupid, or uncaring, or un-empathetic.\n\nIf you do notice a sudden change in who or what you can recognize, it would be a good idea to see a doctor, though. You might want to read about Prosopamnesia, a \"cousin\" of Prosopagnosia, since your symptoms sound more of that. thanks There are different degrees.  Dont panic.  T Here are online tests that can give you an idea of where you stand.  I tell folks I have the red/green color blindness level of face blindness, I can recognize people, but it takes me much longer than normal and is very context related.    I can recognize friends and family just fine, but coworkers out of work I cant be sure.  Dont panic, and keep researching, you will figure out what your own level of problem is. Thanks man IM here to help.  Even if we cant figure out who were helping.  :) For me, I sometimes recognize celebrities in photos if I have seen the photo before. It is also possible to recognize people by things other than facial features, such as hair, jawline, voice, gait, makeup, etc. I remember Kim Kardashian used to wear very long, spidery eyelashes and I was able to recognize her based off of that until she changed her look. \n\nIt is also possible to recognize celebrities in movies if you know they are going to be in the movie, since you are expecting to see them. Just as many prosopagnosiacs recognize their co-workers at work, but might not recognize them if they see them in an unexpected setting. \n\nMy point is, having prosopagnosia does not mean that  you never, ever can tell who someone is. Faceblind.org has a test that you can take to get a better idea of your face recognition abilities. Try the Cambridge test which removes additional features like hair and eyebrows that can be used as clues by someone with proso. \n\nIt is still not a diagnosis, but it can give you an idea whether you might have it or not", "Which characters do you guys think is prosopagnosia representation?? Dr Doofenshmirtz - unable to recognise the platypus as Perry unless wearing the trademark hat\n\nPrince from Cinderella - relies on shoes to find the person he danced with \n\nWho do you guys think should be added to the list? Everyone in Hannah Montana that could not recognize Miley without a wig Lois Lane who could not tell that Clark Kent was Superman Ricky Ricardo! I actually messaged my professor to see if I could prepare my speech on that thesis \ud83d\ude02. One mustache and he was lost My wife told me that it is ridiculous that the people of Gotham city cannot recognize Bruce Wayne as batman. I said it would work on me. Ryoga Hibiki from the anime Ranma 1/2. Cannot recognize Ranma when he puts on a different outfit or glasses. And it is a running gag that he has no sense of direction! Two characters I can think of that are canonically prosopagnostic:\n\nAce from zero escape\n\nInga from Ace Attorney: spirit of justice. Akane Owari from Danganronpa 2\n\nShe says she has a hard time remembering names, but I feel like it is actually prosopagnosia Gentarou Hongou from \"Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors\". All events in the story were ignited by this guy wanting to cure his prosopagnosia. Ash from Pokemon because he can literally never recognize Team Rocket in their disguises I have said it on here before, but the Doctor from Doctor Who. (Makes sense, really. Their face changes all the time--how are they supposed to keep track of other people's?)\n\nThe Second Doctor had to reconstruct his friend's face out of pieces of photos (long story) and got it completely wrong. (This allowed them to recast the other character briefly. The actor had chicken pox.)\n\nThe Third Doctor was shown a group picture: \"Can you find me in this picture? It is from before I grew my mustache!\" Total faceblind panic.\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor goes undercover in his best friend's workplace by, uh, changing his clothes. Seems genuinely surprised that it does not work on her. The McPoyle brothers on Its Always Sunny. Ryan gives himself a disguise, which is just a moustache, and the gang are sure that will not work, but then Liam walks into the room and asks who this person is\u2026 until Ryan takes off the moustache and he recognises him again. \ud83d\ude02 Interesting, never really thought that abt her I did not think that at first, but I recently started playing SDR2 and when I saw she struggled with remembering names (especially Hajime's) it kind of clicked. It is one of my favourite headcanons now.", "That game is just impossible ", "If you cannot laugh at yourself ", "An interesting title  This is the best thing I have seen all day. Thank you. In the comments of the original post was some excellent short fiction, at least one of which was a direct continuation of this post!", "Do you remember some faces more than others? I am wondering if anyone has the experience of being able to remember some faces more/better than others? Like I cannot see a cohesive image of my sisters face in my head but can remember Ingrid\u2019s from one class junior year. (Ingrid if ur reading this, hey girl) Definitely. The farther away from average a person\u2019s features are the more they stand out. I do a lot of identification based off of futures that cannot change. Like, a person has long eye lashes wether they smile or not, but sometimes I cannot recognize people as well if their expression is different then expected. Jane Goodall said she could only recognize people that were not average. (Her actual quote was that she could only recognize people that were \"extremely beautiful or extremely ugly\", which seems a little harsh \ud83d\ude0a)\n\nIt is easier for me to identify people with an unusual trait, but am I recognizing them or their trait? Absolutely. Definitely. Sometimes the whole face will just coalesce around a particular distinctive feature. I can remember family faces that I was very involved with during childhood, however I am extremely poor at placing people who I met in the last 10 years. Yes.\nMy boyfriend has a very unique face and I have never seen any real person looking like that, but he looks like Danny Fenton from the cartoon \"Danny Phantom\" lol. \nHe looks unique so I can tell where he is on a group picture or recognize him with zero effort when he comes to me at the street and says hello. But I still struggle to find him, for example, when he goes out of a bus and there is many people on the bus stop, I am getting stressed because people look kind of like these pictures simulating having a stroke - you see something but cannot understand what it exactly is, idk, it is so so hard to explain. Unusual features are the key for me, because I can recall them from a textual description of their distinctiveness. I actually find women with distinctive features quite a bit more attractive than other women because they stand out in my mind from all the other women, who all just sort of blur together. I see people only in flashes, and cannot hold a solid image of them. But yes I totally relate to this. The more distinctive features a person has, the more I am able to conjure their face as a whole, but I cannot really hold it there in the same way I can hold an image of my parrot for example.\n\nI was with my partner for 6 years and I knew his face well enough to picture. But then he decided to shave. Very very uncomfortable. Now we have been together 9 years and I guess I would have to start over remembering him if he grew a beard again. 100%. I have people mentally packaged as \u201csmile\u201d, or \u201ceyes\u201d. And if they do not have any distinct features I only use their clothing, gait, etc. It is those people I am lost with when they change their hair.", "do i have prosopagnosia? hi, i am a 15 y/o girl and i recently am starting to think i have prosopagnosia, but since i am not familiar with this field i would love any input on if what i am experience may be prosopagnosia!\n\ni first realized i am bad with faces when i could not recognize a friend of 3 years after she changed her glasses. i doubted \u201cis that her?\u201d but never came to a conclusion until she came up to me. the same thing happened with someone else with a new haircut and this time i had no clue until i saw her backpack\n\nhere are some more things i am now beginning to tie together\n\n1. i hate going to places where i might run into someone ik because i dont want to accidentally ignore them, and often i am paranoid that someone i know is there (and it turns out to be someone completely random)\n\n2. i feel frustrated watching movies because the characters look so similar, i like disney and rewatching movies. \n\n3. celebrities are just a big no, too confusing (they all look so similar, i might have guesses on \u201coh is this__\u201d but i am either unsure or wrong)\n\n4. i recognize people by height, style, hair, glasses\n\n5. sometimes i tell my friends or family that i think these people look similar and they look at me funny because apparently they look completely different\n\nif this might be prosopagnosia, are there any tips for me to get thru the rest of high school? \nthank you for all the help! Ooh, i see we experience similar stuff. I have the same question about this too haha\ud83d\ude02 People might say we cannot diagnose you from the internet but tbh this 100% sounds like proso. Welcome to the club, it is so awkward here lol. For me, just realizing I had it helped because I began to semi consciously try to memorize people\u2019s features, and constantly tested myself on recognition with people in movies and on tv, where there were no stakes. The downside is I now get false positives sometimes, convinced I know someone only to get it wrong, but overall it is somewhat better! I feel you 100% on all of this. You may have a mild version of prosopagnosia, you can check out some of the psychometric tests they have (Google search prosopagnosia test) Welcome to the club. thank youu will definitely check it out ahh yeahh!! it is been so confusing for me, hopefully i can figure out a way that works for me :)) Facial recognition is a spectrum.  While random people online cannot diagnosis you with prosopagnosia, it is clear you have at least some level of difficulty with facial recognition.  All of this sounds very familiar.  You can get an official diagnosis, although it may not be as easy because everyone is not familiar with it and there may not be any benefits to being diagnosed.\n\nI did not figure it out until I was out of college.  I thought I was just being a jerk and not paying attention to people.  I had some pretty good coping mechanisms, but knowing what was going on helped.  Everyone has their different styles of making it work.  Some people tell people directly, others do not.  If you have a close friend who is understanding and around a lot, sometimes it is helpful to have them cue you.\n\nWhat works for me:\n\n* General friendliness or pretending I am preoccupied in public places.  Waiting for people to approach me.\n\n* Try to work and socialize in smaller settings with a consistent group of people.\n\n* Being vague in conversations while I try to figure out clues of who people are.\n\n* Making friends (and having romantic relationships) with people who have a distinct appearance.\n\n* Watching TV shows with a limited cast instead of movies.\n\n* Paying attention to how people move or speak first (because those do not usually change,) and then appearance things.\n\n* Never, never calling people by name.  It is a good thing to do, but I am wrong too often, because calling people by the wrong name never works.\n\nIt sounds like you are doing well already. For me, isolating features helps. Like, focus on eyes. (Most people have differently shaped eyes, or noses, etc.) If you have any musical ability whatsoever, I recommend matching pitch/tones with the people you know. (You will still have to wait for them speak first, but it does help.) And if someone acts like they know you--they probably do. If possible, introduce someone you are with to them. Usually manners dictate that they introduce themselves to the person you have introduced them to. (Not always possible, and can backfire if you are in a small town where everyone knows each other.)\n\nAnd, if you like anime, you might like *Zoids: Chaotic Century*. Every single person in that anime has different facial markings, making them really easy to distinguish from each other. I felt similar to you before I was accidently diagnosed by a sharp eyed therapist. I herd of proso but I never thought of having it because heck I was born this way. He told me simply, close my eyes how do I see a persons face. Do I see a face, or do I see nothing? Then after further talking he sat me down and told me I have prosopagnosia, it is not the most severe but it is life effecting. If you want me to show you how I see faces I do have several drawings how I see faces, I also have a custom drawing how another proso person sees faces which is different then me. It is really something you need to sit down and have a proper talk to get a right dianosis. We cannot diagnose you, of course, but these are all typical prosopagnosic experiences that you are describing. Welcome to the club!\n\nBesides what others have said, my biggest tip is just to be open about it, and lighthearted, as far as possible. If you are doing one of those group icebreakers where you have to give a fun fact about yourself (which, if you do not have a lot of them yet--you will in college!), that is your 'fun' fact. \"My name is Jane, I am from Smallville, and I have a neurological condition that makes it difficult for me to remember faces. So please do not take it personally if I try to introduce myself again later!\" If you are meeting someone for the first time, \"By the way, I should mention that I am faceblind--that means I can see faces, but I cannot consistently remember them. So if I ever do not seem to recognize you, just remind me of your name and I will remember our conversation!\" You can also throw in any stories along the lines of \"my mother got a haircut and I did not recognize her\" if you can make them very short and funny.\n\nAnd then do make a point of remembering names. For me this is the ideal interaction:  \nPERSON: Hi!  \nME: Hi! ... I am so sorry, I am having trouble placing you.  \nPERSON: I am Mary, we met in biology class.  \nME: Oh yes, of course, Mary! You were telling me about your dog. How is Spot?\n\nThis approach works better with peers than authority figures, of course, but that will matter less as you grow up. Overall I really have found honesty to be the best policy, especially if you are lighthearted about it (frame it not as \"I have this terrible affliction\" but as \"Here is a weird thing about me and why you might notice it\"). Personally no one's ever been rude to me about it, and some people have been really interested (one new friend turned out to be a neuroscience major and was curious to hear all about what faceblindness is like!). Some people on here have had people be really rude and weird about their faceblindness, and I hope that does not happen to you, but if nothing else, now you know they are jerks and you can avoid them. (As soon as you work out how to recognize them....)", "At least some of these are different people AAAAAH. Hairstyle is one of my only ways to tell folks apart so stuff like this is my kryptonite!  I am confused Wait, some of these are different people? Top left, Mr Clean\n\nTop right, Patrick Stewart\n\nTrue middle, Bruce Willis\n\nBottom Left, hell if I know\n\nBottom right, Voldemort\n\n\nEveryone else is a morph between the others.\n\nI tend to do well on the famous faces test. I guess they have enough unique features that I can recognize. Or maybe I am not faceblind, idk, haha I am faceblind for sure. (I have trouble recognizing my husband and my own son). I got the exact same results on this that you did. (Including the \"hell if I know\" result\" \ud83d\ude0a i thought the top right was Locke from LOST OMG what is happening? I think he is the cop brother-in-law from Breaking Bad, but that is a guess. It is the hair and his particular balding pattern. See ( Got it. \n\n1- Mr. Clean \n2- (morph- note blurred background of 3)\n3- Patrick Stewart (Picard/ Prof. X from X-Men)\n4- (morph- note blurred background of 3)\n5- Bruce Willis\n6- (morph with 7)\n7- Dean Norris (Breaking Bad)\n8- (morph- note blurred background of 9)\n9- Voldemort (actor Ralph Fiennes)\n\nAnd this is why I will never let my husband go. He is pretty good at knowing people. I do not have face blindness but this confused me so much", "Saw someone with (temporary?) face blindness saying stuff about it I am going to ramble a lot since I never really got to talk to anyone who understood.\n\nYoutuber was talking about her concussion.  She said face blindness sucked and she hoped it goes away and that she is recognizing people on things like hair.\n\nI have been going primarily off of hair for so long it is normal.  I never really thought of how different it would be for someone who can normally pick out faces.\n\nI know I do not have it as bad as other people.  I can recognize myself, my boyfriend, my dad, and Obama.\n\nIt took me months after me and my boyfriend started dating him to pick him out easy without searching for his hair (I would not be surprised if it was longer than months).  I passed my (large and very noticeable - he was asked to be the quarterback once) friend for over a year because he did not have his red jacket on.  A peer who wore plaid the first three days we talked did not wear plaid and I looked at him funny for talking to me outside of class just because I could not recognize him without plaid.  My psychiatrist has gray hair and called someone else back and I panicked a bit because *what if that was someone else with gray hair in a similar style*.\n\nThe hardest thing I have used was my friends shoes.  I could not grab anything from her face, hair, or clothes, but her shoes were almost always the same.  If I saw someone who I thought could be her I would look at her shoes.\n\nIt is so weird to think people can recognize faces easily.\n\nI wonder if it plays with other things.  I cannot smell very well and I cannot distinguish things like swelling unless it gets pretty bad.\n\nI have met one other person.  I saw her a few times and she was so nice.  I asked a few people who looked like her (to me) if they were her.  Lots of confused people.  I think I have asked at both stores (different places - I go to college) at this point.\n\nRamble along in the comments?  What is the hardest/oddest thing you recognized someone by? I have always had a fascination with accents and linguistics, so I mostly recognized people by their voices. \n\nI am 55 and have been losing my hearing for 8 years or so. Now I go by their mouth/teeth. Prominent canines, overbite, underbites... it works usually.  The way they move/walk. \n\nVoices and accents. \n\nHair, though my husband usually wears a hat to protect his scalp, so for him I look for his hat. My son's hair is now down to his waist, so that helps a lot.\n\nEyebrows.\n\nHeight.\n\nTattoos! I work with a lot of people that have tattoos, and that helps.\n\nAnything that is distinctive. Bill Nighy's hands are a great giveaway, and my son and I have a sign for him :) \n\nBut seriously, most people tell me who they are, since I started telling almost everyone I meet that I am faceblind.  Hair is a huge indicator for me. Then I work with gait, clothing, and voice. Also expected location - seeing someone where I normally see them. \n\nSunglasses kill all hope of me identifying someone, along with hats. Guess that is why spring and Autumn are my favourite seasons - people are less likely to hide the characteristics I need to identify them! I have only within the last year realised I had face blindness because 1) I had not heard of it before and 2) did not feel I had much of an issue recognising people\n\nI use how people walk to know who people are. I have never really met someone that walks identically to someone else - they sway their hips differently, lean slightly, etc. Along with their walks, people sound different too! My ears are quite sensitive, and I seem to remember voices much better than faces or many other characteristics like height and whatnot.\n\nI use hair mostly as a secondary, but most of the people I know (and myself) change or hair a lot, so it is not all that useful.\n\nMy best friend has a mole on the side of her nose, and I remember that, so with other people I will use characteristics like that. Moles, scars, etc.\n\nAs for specific circumstances where I have recognised someone by something \u2018strange\u2019. I recognise my mum predominantly by her smell! I do not know why, she just had this \u2018mum smell\u2019 that clicks and I know it is her. Obviously I recognise her voice and such, but she is very, very generic. She looks like almost every other plus-sized 50 year old lady!\n\nMy dad is similar. He is a very generic person, and just blends in everywhere. However, he is a huge fan of a particular sports so he is always wearing a sports shirt of his team! I cannot recognise him without it. Usually just the context, like if I see them in the same coffee shop every day and they are about the same shape I know it is them. I have an added layer of ridiculousness because I have aphantasia too, so a lot of the time I cannot even remember the clothing and/or hair color. Just body shape and voice seems to be the most intuitive for me.  I never thought about sweling. I do not notice it either. I jus thought it must be subtle.  I recently was in a group interview of about 30 people. We were split in to small groups and one girl in my group had very distinctive eyeliner, the kind where you can tell us how they usually wear it. I thought she would get the job so I memorized it in case I did too. She did get the job, and so did I. She is the only person I recognised from the group when we started. Turns out 6 other people I have now made friends with were in the same group, they just told me the other day! The interviews were in December and I never would have know if they had not said.\n\nAfter I found this subreddit I began to see that how I recognise people are coping mechanisms and not how everyone does it. For example when I go out with people I memorise what they are wearing in case we split up, because I will not recognise them in a crowd.\n\nA previous post about people with proso not being able to recognise patterns resonated with me. I have a hard time understanding song lyrics, I have zero, I mean ZERO rhythm. I have a hard time following directions and often misuse misinterpret landmarks. ", "How do you guys remember names? I have prosopognasia from a head trauma, but experienced some of the symptoms prior. My short term memory is also extremely poor. I can look at a person, and recognize them, and if the situation is in context, know how I know them. As soon as I look away, I could not for the life of me picture their face. For example, I can recognize a coworker easily at work, but if I run into them elsewhere, cannot figure out how I know them. If I know them well enough to know their hair, body, etc, I am fine. It is extremely difficult for me to remember names, to the point that it negatively impacts my social life. I try very hard, but I just cannot remember them within the first 5+ times of meeting someone. Does anyone have any tips for remembering names? I have the exact same issue.  Here a a few tricks that I use to help (though sometimes it is hopeless).  \n\n* Associate their name with a known/existing person/object.  (ex: Associate someone named Holly with Christmas)\n* I go through the alphabet (A-Z).  Sometimes, just getting the first letter is enough to jog my memory\n* Look it up.  Maybe even keep a list of names on your phone.  If nothing else, you will have a smaller pool to work from.\n* Do not use names.  \n\nUnfortunately, most of the time, I just avoid using their names.  I have had problems remembering/associating names my entire life, so I pretty much mastered not using people's names.  It does not always work, but 9 times out of 10, I am fine.  If pressed, I usually blame it on a momentary brain fart.  If it is a group that I am going to be spending a lot of time with (i.e. Co-workers), I am just up-front about it.  The occasional teasing hurts, but at least I set-up the expectation.\n Yeah right now I just avoid using names if I can. However I just got a job and the nature of the job requires that I will know the names of my coworkers and it will be super obvious if I do not. Usually I get so caught up trying to remember everything else about them and actually listen to what they are saying that their name just goes out the other ear and I have forgotten it by the end of the conversation. I have tried associations and I can sometimes remember the associations but I usually cannot connect them to the person. I am going to try to make a list in my phone though! Maybe I can find an app or something.  I give everyone famous titles. Eric the Viking is the blond guy with the beard. William the Conqueror. Beard and always looks pissed and ready to destroy the country.  \n\nYou get the idea.  I just legitimately pretend like I know everyone who acts friendly to me. The people I do not actually know probably think it is kind of weird that a stranger is asking how their weekend was, but it is better than the other way around. I have never had a problem needing to actually remember someone is name/context in this circumstance. If they continue the conversation, they will usually give me some hint that helps me remember how I know them, like \"did you ever find your hat?\" or \"I never see you outside of the office!\" Even if you know you have met someone before, you can get away with not using their names. You just do it in a jokey way if you need to call them SOMEthing - like \"this one over here,\" or a common saying-name like \"Judy blue eyes\" or \"watch it, Jack!\" They will not notice you never say their name as long as you seem like you remember who they are. I usually stalk them a little after. Like a lady came up to me at a conference (where we are already a little forgiven) and started talking to me about a specific topic, which made me remember she worked in that field, which led me to swing by her table later and 'get her email' aka her name, and had the added benefit of redeeming myself from when I seemed to forget her earlier in the day (I probably walked past her before she said hi to me.... that happens a lot). Before I had ever heard of facial blindness, I gave people nicknames for my own purposes. I now understand it was an mechanism to help with a disability I did not know I had. I would not say the names aloud but the names would help me remember where I knew people from. Blue hair, tight pants, red beard, long dress, no chin, deep voice, were some secret names I gave to people who I only encountered occasionally in order to help me associate them when I did encounter them.", "r/Prosopagnosia reaches 1,000 subscribers!

Sometimes I have thought that I might have face blindness, because I am embarrassingly bad at recognizing people in person. Couple examples: I have introduced myself to (or just ignored) coworkers, thinking they are complete strangers, the first time I have seen them out of their work uniform. My girlfriend came to visit me after being apart for 3 months, and she wore her hair down (not usual for her), and I had to confirm her identity by recognizing her shoes. Just a few days ago, I thought my friend's wife was a complete stranger, just because she was not wearing makeup. \n\nHowever, I am extremely good at recognizing actors in movies. I can get one glimpse of a famous actor and I know exactly who they are, even in costume and makeup. Can anyone else relate to this?  I can recognize certain actors if they have really unique features\\~ I think that the difference is, people irl you only see sometimes, but certain actors and other famous people have their faces plastered all over the place and you are being bombarded by pictures of their faces all the time. If someone is made up or something, it is a bit harder, but people like Eugene Levy with his big bushy eyebrows who I have seen all over the place (including in a recent bingewatch of Schitt's Creek), I can usually recognize. Would I recognize him on the street? Maybe? More bland(?) actors are really confusing to me... I was watching The Departed and was so confused because Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon looked so similar...    \n\n\nI also think the angle thing is pretty important because I have gotten confused about people just from seeing them at a different angle. Stars usually have a \"good angle\" that they use for all of their promotional materials and ads, so seeing them in the same pose with the same expression can make things easier, whereas irl people are moving all the time\\~ One of my coworkers was turned slightly away from me and I stopped myself right before introducing myself because I had no idea who he was XD;;; I once had a conversation with a couple of bartenders that I had hung out with a couple of times before, but when I went to the restroom, one of their shifts ended, so she took out her ponytail, took off her outer shirt, and sat down in the chair next to me... I came back and this random girl was just talking to me like she knew me and I was like who tf? Why does she act like she knows me and why is no one questioning this? I had no idea that it was the same girl until someone said her name out loud about twenty minutes later  For me, I can often recognize the voice even if they are in costume. Often if an actor is not in costume but using a different accent, I would not  recognize him. Ooh that is another good point~ really distinct vocals can help a lot ^.^ I am good at recognizing actors on TV but have met a few without recognizing them at all. Usually they find it pretty funny.  Hugh Laurie is pretty distinct luckily visually, but his native accent always throws me off I absolutely relate to this.   In 'real life' I have mistaken strangers for family (even my mother) more than once, totally failed to recognize people I have known for years when I saw them out of context... but I do ok with actors.  Not all actors, but there are some I always seem to know right away when they turn up in a new role, occasionally really surprising myself.  Maybe some of it is like sarangjill suggested: their faces get plastered all over, I have stared at them at length, seen their faces filmed in close-up...  (and I do not really know how often voice cues are what actually tip me off).  I also wonder if with actors, they are always \"in context\"?  I have never seen a celebrity in person, (or if I did I did not know it!), so I do not know if it is only on-screen that my recognition seems to improve.

The thing is that we all have to wear work clothing, so everyone has the exact same clothes.\nThe guy who was responsible for me one time left the room for like a minute, came back and looked at me as a sign that I should come with him but I did not realize that he was the same guy from before. It was an awkward situation.\nI also get told to go to \u201ethat dude from yesterday\u201c or something and I always need to ask if someone can show me where he is so that I do not have to look myself because I would not recognize him anyway.\n\nThe people there are not the kindest and they always assume that I am dumb. I feel very pressured and anxious because of that tbh.\nHas anyone experienced something like this and maybe has tipps on how I could deal with it? I told them that I struggle with recognizing faces but they do not really care (and it happens everywhere not just at work)\nI do not recognize my therapist and I saw him once a week (he always had to call my name when I was looking at him when he entered the waiting room), I do not recognize my doctor, my teachers, my neighbors, I even struggle with friends I have not seen for a long time.\nI mean you all know the drill, that is what this subreddit is for. I just wanted to get this out of my system and maybe speak to people who understand my struggle. I have had people not believe me or think I am making excuses when I tell them I am face blind. I think they take it more seriously when I say I have a neurological disorder called prosopagnosia and that I am in a study. People do not always realize that what we have goes way deeper than just being \"bad with names\" or whatever. Try to explain it as best as you can and be willing to answer any questions people have about it. If your company is small and people are willing, you could request that people wear name tags at work. I introduced myself to the same person three times at work within a week. They got offended that I did not recognize them and held it against me for a while. There had been three new employees and I just assumed I would met the three of them, but it was all the same one.\n\nMental nicknames based on a distinguishing features helps initially. Things like \"Mr. Beard\" or  \"Miss. Slouches\". My sister who has a mild case actually gave the nickname \"Pixie Stix\" to one of her friends because they had a pixie cut style hair. In a work situation, I would not say them out loud, but mentally thinking of them might help. Thanks, I\u2018ll try that! Actually never thought of giving them nicknames like that but I can imagine that that will help. It is a really big company so that will not work. I am actually afraid that it might have consequences if I insist on having prosopagnosia, even tho it is the truth. Yeah, I think it is not well known enough that it is hard for people to get.  Plus if you explain anything is different about you, some people treat you differently.\n\nI depend pretty heavily on strategies to avoid revealing whether I know the person or not.

Looking through the comments right now, looks like you were not born with Prosopagnosia, is that right?\n\nI was born with Prosopagnosia (did not realize things were different for me until a couple of years ago), and I cannot help but feel bad for people who got it later in life. I actually really resonate with a lot of the things you said. Especially when you mentioned that everybody tells you that you have got an odd sense of who is attractive. People tell me the same thing - though I always thought that was more related to me being asexual than my Prosopagnosia.  Yea I am not too sure honestly... All I know if it started when I was very young but I do not know if that is cuz it started them or if it is because that is as far back as I can remember.\n\nI always assumed the attractive thing was because I look more closely at specific characteristics than the whole face since that is all I know. To me a woman with a very pretty nose or lips stands out so much more than a woman who people consider attractive all around... So I do not know which of it correct I guess lol  That is funny, I was considering doing an IAmA recently but looks like you beat me to it. Might still do it eventually. Reading through your answers your symptoms are much more dramatic than mine, so it is neat reading your answers. Lol thanks.... I did not realize it was odd at all since it is all I know but yea I guess it is. There is just something about faces that just does not add up. Like when I talk to my dog and he tilts his head trying so hard to understand what I am saying... That is how he must feel just like how I do about faces. Something just does not click for me. I envy those who can recall faces.\n\nBut it is not just recalling them. It is also being able to read them. When people say the eyes are the window to the soul... I never understood that. I assumed it was just something people say because it sounds cool. But apparently people really can read eyes linked to emotions. How odd. ", "Information cards, to be handed to non believers.

I explained that yes, face blindness is a huge issue for me; usually at big events my husband is there &amp; will tell me who people are, but he did not come to the funeral. I told her she was not the only one I did not notice. Also that I have been struggling with this for years but never had a word for it. She messaged me back a long apology, said she had no idea &amp; she reacted badly because she thought I was angry about a whole separate issue. I am happy to keep her as a friend, but even more I am relieved. It is always been a sort of nightmare, wondering what I would do if I offended someone. Well, I did, but the world did not melt, and I was able to defend myself. Thank you all for your support - each one of your comments meant so much to me!

I (f23) have a slight form of face blindness (undiagnosed, but it is quite obvious to me that I prefer associate people more with their haircut than their face, etc.)\n\nSome days ago, I got my eyebrows shaped. A friend of mine had previously suggested to look at eyebrow style's picture online to know what I was aming for or what was going to suit my face more.\n\nI tried. I did not know. Like I cannot imagine how a different eyebrow shape would change my face or anyone else's, if that makes sense.\n\nDoes any of you experiences something like that? I have never considered my eyebrows but I have difficulty if my new hairstyle or new clothes do not look like my old ones. It takes me ages to get used the new strange person in the mirror. I can never tell what would suit people\u2019s faces at all, even my own. I have lived with my face for 55 years. I know what I look like. However, I cannot tell you what shape my eyes are, or pick my brows or lips out of a line up.

Appearance (in terms of my ability to recognize them) seems to be a major factor in forming relationships for me.  But I think it also my affect how I present myself.\n\nI dress pretty plainly and conservatively, but that allows me to keep the same style for longer periods of time, meaning less change from year to year.  My hair is really long and has been since I was a kid.  I definitely think I do not like to follow fashion so I look more like myself.\n\nPeople usually remember and recognize me more than others.  I do not know if it is the long hair (choice,) other aspects of my appearance (genetics,) or my personality.  It is rather unfortunate though, because I do not remember them.  When I started college, my friend and I visited a bunch of different churches.  We would run into people or go back a second time.  They always remembered me but not her, and she always remembered them but I did not, so that was fun./s I think subconsciously I have gone out of my way to make myself extremely recognisable, in order to assist others who may have faceblindness (and perhaps even to help me to recognise myself..) i have worn variations on the same outfit for around 7 years now with only two major (three if i count dying it) major changes to my hair. i almost normally have a hat on, which is a little unusual for the school i go to. \ni think i actually try harder to blend in, because i want to avoid people trying to talk to me. if you do not approach me, i do not have to pretend to know you! I have always tried to have unusual hair and I am way more comfortable in clothing that stands out. Right now I have neon hair and a lot of tattoos. I regularly have nightmares that my hair is it is natural color, or my tattoos are mysteriously gone. I wake up super freaked out because I am afraid no one will know who I am. It is a blurry line between my autism and prosopagnosia. I keep my appearance very consistent in both fashion, hair styling, makeup, etc. I cannot tell if it is a guarded routine part of ASD, or related to needing similarity for self recognition as part of prosopagnosia. I often feel \u2018alien\u2019 if I change my clothing or hair too drastically, but I could see that hitting either mark. I would be curious to see if there is research on this phenomena. I started dying my hair colors to make really easy for me to recognize myself, and for others to recognize me. \nWhen I was small I would wear ALL hot pink \ud83e\udd23 Years ago, there was a prosopagnosia website, where the woman compared prosopagnosia to being able to identify individual rocks. (I am pretty sure it was prosopagnosia.org)\n\nIn it, she off handedly mentioned that women with prosopagnosia are less likely to wear makeup. That is certainly true for me. Makeup makes me look like not myself. I did not start wearing makeup until my 50's, and even that was very light (natural?) makeup, and only for special occasions.\n\nI really miss that website. yes definitely! i always wear my hair down bc it is very distinctive (big curly hair) and i have an even harder time trying to recognize myself on the rare occasion where i put it up in a bun or into braids, so i do not experiment with other hairstyles in the way i think i might if i were not faceblind. \n\ni also stay pretty committed to my style and i feel very uncomfortable if i am dressed in a way that strays from how i typically dress (but until now i did not realize that might also be partially influenced by my subconscious attempts to keep my appearance rather uniform/consistent bc of my prosopagnosia) so interesting! I do not think it effects the way I dress too much. But it definitely affects the way I deal with my face and hair. I usually do not do anything with my hair other than keep it out of my face because if I style it at all, I recognize myself even less than I already do.  When I look at myself in the mirror or in pictures I usually always look slightly off to myself and it is often a little upsetting. Like.. I know it is me immediately but I do not look the way I expected myself to look. If I comb my hair or tie it up, that feeling gets worse Huh.  I never wear make-up either except for very special occasions and then it is always super natural looking.  Like the only time I have put on more than mascara in the last decade is when I am IN a wedding. See I am very against my hair being dyed or tattoos.  (Not on other people!  I do not care if other people have tattoos or different hair colors...although CHANGING hair confuses me, but my gut reaction to anything like that on myself is very strongly negative.)  My facial features are just enough different that with the long hair I am easy to recognize (well, except from family) so I think I got used to a certain look.  I never thought about why I did not like tattoos but after reading people's comments, I think it is because I am worried I would not recognize myself. I think I try to dress to blend in too, but also to look like \"me.\"  I feel like the prosopagnosia is a weird combination with my personality.  I am fairly extraverted and do not have a blend-in style personality at all, but I think a lot of times I try to hide from people because I am not sure who they are, so I do not want to stand out. I feel like I have a bunch of different looks.  Like somedays I dress up as the Mo who has her hair up and somedays I dress up as the Mo who has her hair down.  (Still not a lot of variation in my clothing, but I have several distinct styles that I chose from.)

I am a painter, and back in high school all my peers would complain about drawing hands, and while they were not the easiest thing to do I did not find them nearly as hard as drawing faces that resembled the face of which I was trying to depict. Pretty bad at making them symmetrical in general, but even when I could get the proportions right, they just looked nothing like the person I was trying to depict. As such, most of my paintings try to avoid painting faces in any legitimate way. Check out some of that on my Instagram Trevlabevart I have definitely made avoiding face is part of my style. Not especially. I think people complain about hands being hard because it often comes as a surprise that they are so complex. \n\nFaces are really hard but they are kind of obviously hard. I do not know what level of artist you are but learning the proportions of a face by heart helps. Like for example it could help if you know that there is always roughly this amount of space between eyes or that there are muscles here which will affect the smile or the the common places where the shadows fall when light comes from X direction... I have also found that if you get the shape of a person's face right you are already halfway there. I agree! Honestly drawing faces helps me remember them. Im awful at portraits, and tend to stick to a semi-cartoony look. Youre not alone with that! I am an artist and portraits are my thing. Normally I strongly prefer drawing from life, but when it comes to faces I usually need to work from photos (or have some available) if I have any hope of getting them to look right. I cannot quite keep the image of a person\u2019s facial proportions in my memory, even just during the gap between looking at a subject and placing my hand on the page to draw. EXACTLY Yes!! I am an artist, and while i have managed to draw some pretty strong portraits, there is always something that feels off to me. Like every part of the face is fine, the proportions are fine, but it still does not quite look like the person. And i always need a reference photo. I have found that it hurts me more when drawing OCs. yes! my style is specifically anime because it is way easier to draw faces that way. i am trying to learn to be more realistic with my style, but it is hard when you are not sure how it is supposed to look! I am an amateur artist but I have been told I am actually pretty good at getting a likeness. I tend to focus on each aspect of the face individually. Perhaps it is different for me because my style is very realistic. I draw with coloured pencils and I am good both in portraying certain people as simple stick figures and a whole realistic portraits and they are easily recognizable to others. I think it is because I see faces more like many details on one surface rather than seeing the whole face. I am more like \u201eit is curved up there, but has a wrinkle here and there it goes down, there is a little shade of purple, because of the skin thinness, and this is an orangey pink shade, and she always has like tears in her eyes, and there is a vein going down and up and it curves like that and\u201d rather than \u201eshe has eyes\u201d.", "There was a day where my guidance counselor changed her hairstyle and I was having trouble telling if it was her. Superman's \"disguise\" would likely work on me. Do I have prosopagnosia?  Yup, welcome to the club! Coolio! Now that I think about it, I am able to recognize actors from shows I watched years ago. Would that disqualify me, or just mean I have mild facial blindness? Probably just mild. There are varying levels. I am able to recognize actors only by certain facial features, but not their face as a whole. Face blindness occurs in varying degrees. I am able to \"learn\" people's faces and have probably moderate face blindness.  I just need a lot of exposure, and I am learning features, voice, and mannerisms.  Mannerisms are tricky with actors, but often people get type cast which helps. I started watching a lot more tv as an adult than movies and found watching the same lead actors over and over really helped my recognition of them.  But if you take off the hair that is a lot harder. I always find \"flat\" images easier than real life: faces on TV and in movies are much easier for me  than people I actually know.  (Plenty of actors are still basically interchangeable to me until I hear their voices, but there are some I recognize consistently - to my own shock!).   I am sure I am only somewhere in the \"mild\" range, but I have often wondered if there is something fundamentally different about the way the brain processes \"flat\" faces vs 3D, or if it is just a function of how much more I stare directly at the faces of some actors, to a degree that would never be socially acceptable in real life. Not even sure if that would apply to me, since I do not have depth perception, but it is still interesting! Face blindness can also be completely random.  I recognise people some times but not others. I think it is related to angles and posture. For example, I nearly always recognise my husband but it is not guaranteed. I was at a market with him and we were looking at a table. I turned away a little, then turned back and found my husband had gone but there was a strange man standing a couple of yards away. To cut a long story short it was in fact my husband, but it was not until he spoke that I was sure. (Here is hoping I did not just take a strange man home!) I always think of what I have as the red green colorblindeness of face blindness.  I can recognize people, but it takes much, much longer than most people, and its highly conditional."]
