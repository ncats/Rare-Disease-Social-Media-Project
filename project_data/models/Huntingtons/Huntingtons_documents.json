["What does it feel like? Hi all - I am new here and a first time poster - 32f with a CAG count of 43. I do not have anyone in my life with lived experience of Huntingtons disease. I was wondering if anyone with symptoms can tell me if they experienced any sensations in their body at the early stages of chorea? I am experiencing a restless leg feeling in one of my legs that feels like a surge of energy and I just have to move. Has anyone experienced something similar? Thanks! Yeah, that it. There are also other feelings. Nerve pain, which felt like fiery pin and needles. Sometimes your limbs just will not work. I think Austedo would help your restless leg. But it is expensive and a pain in the dick to get. my mom used to say she felt zapped or stung sometimes. Read this post.  Although you are positive you may be symptom seeking.  Keep your head up friend. I wish you many more healthy years.    ( Heya, I am also a 32f, but I have a normal CAG count - my father died of HD. This caught my eye, as I do have restless leg syndrome. Does this happen to you primarily at night, or in the heat? I have dealt with this for years, and definitely used to worry it was an HD thing &lt;3 I would not read much into restless leg - tons of people get it.", "Redditor in r/relationships faces a challenge  I am in shock. This is awful. This poor woman...there are no words It seems like the guy knew for a year\u2026 there are no winners in this story. I crossposted it here so people in the community could share their valuable thoughts and experience.\n\nI was disappointed though that pretty balanced comments that mentioned some experience with the disease were downvoted - even a woman whose ex(that she divorced) sharing. Reddit can be very black and white in it is thinking to the extent that it resembles blindness. OP of that post here:\n\nFrom what I can recollect, he has known of his condition for over 6 years since he said he had testing done around 2014. I can only speculate that an event must have happened to cause him to seek genetic testing.\n\nWe have been dating for 3 years and live together. SEVEN YEARS?? What on earth made him think that was okay????? I do not know. Like other people mentioned in my post, it is possible he is in denial and thought it would be best not to inform me of his health issue.\n\nHe felt comfortable telling his childhood friend, understandably so, but not the woman he agreed to move in with... me.\n\nWhat is the end game? I have no idea. Have me stay around, possibly impregnate me, and then as he deteriorates, I realize that I have to take care of him, the father of my child, AND raise a child that possibly has Huntington's by myself out of duty?\n\nI would have never asked for a genetic test for a pregnancy. With that in mind, if I bore his child, this means that I would have no idea if the child would have Huntington's unless the child displayed symptoms OR he displayed more apparent symptoms down the line. It would be increased symptoms that would force me to look into the cause of the issue or force him to disclose his Huntington's to me. I am thinking things are over.", "Vince Neil and others help to raise 750k for \"Keep Memory Alive\" (the article reads like gibberish, but the news is good)  ", "Can someone help me understand this update on AMT-130? ", "Thinking of genetic testing for a similar disease (SCA3). For people going through pre-symptomatic testing for Huntington's, what was your experience? Family history of SCA3 (Machado Joseph's Disease). My grandfather had it, and my mom has it, and I have a 50% chance of having it. She developed symptoms at 53, and is almost 74 now...needs care as she cannot walk, has trouble with hand movements, speech, and some memory issues, but is still mostly in good spirits. Fortunately, she had a late onset version of it which is less severe than someone with earlier symptoms or higher repeat numbers. However, like Huntington's, there is no cure and no drug to slow the progression, although clinical trials are underway. People tend to live 10-30 years after onset of symptoms, depending on many things.\n\nI am 40, and so far have had no symptoms, never been tested, but I do question every little thing I experience. I do have two kids under the age of 10, and I knew of my chances before then. We decided to have kids anyway as it appeared a late onset disease. However, since I saw my mom decline quite a bit since COVID, and I started to notice a minor bit of double vision (unsure if it is new or always been there and I never noticed it, but it can be an early symptom), the thought has crossed my mind multiple times that maybe I do have it and have more repeats and therefore an earlier onset of symptoms, and feel a sense of dread that my kids would get it and have symptoms even earlier than that....I know, it is a train of dark thoughts, and I do not see a reddit group for this type of disease, but since there are many comparisons between this disease and Huntington's, I thought I would try asking here. I went to a genetic counselor to weigh the pros and cons, and will soon speak to a therapist who specializes in cases like this. Optometrist did not see anything that alarming except some minor esophoria, but did not notice any other symptoms (plus, I wonder if eyes changing at 40 is contributing to this, plus being at a computer all day).\n\nHowever, my question is for people who opted to do pre-symptomatic testing. Obviously, we all want to hear a negative result, but if you had a positive result, did you wish you had not of tested and was it awfully hard to adjust? I feel almost ready to know myself, but the thought of suddenly knowing I had a 50% chance of passing it to each kid makes me feel a great sense of guilt, and that if I had a positive result, I would suddenly lose the ability to assure myself \"maybe I do not have it\". I know that even with a positive result, it would not mean that the things I am experiencing are necessarily related, but feel I am at a crossroads as to if I am ready to hear the news, or enjoy the next few years with the kids with not knowing....I do have an appointment with Vision Therapist and Neurologist to get a baseline and see if they see anything I do not see. Just wanted to see if anyone had anything that helped them decide to get tested or not for Huntington's, or any other disease. I will be honest with you. I did not read very much of your post. When I saw she lived to 74 and has problems normal old people have; I stopped. I speak just for myself here and my gene positive experience. I do not appreciate your post. I apologize if I offended in anyway. Sca3 tends to be more severe with earlier onset of symptoms\u2026 and with anticipation each generation will most likely have worse symptoms, leading to paralysis and inability to swallow and death after 10-20 years with more severe cases, in addition to the myriad of other issues with vision, cognitive ability, etc. Her problems are definitely not typical of old people problems\u2026she was fortunate to not have symptoms until 50s, but each generation is usually worse.\n\nEDIT: and my heart goes out to you and any other that has had a gene positive diagnosis or know someone who has. One thing you will tend to hear on this sub is that people are usually open to sharing their stories with no pressure for others to make the same choices. We all have to ultimately work it out for ourselves.\n\nMy Mom had delayed onset HD. My brother started having cognitive symptoms around age 54. We were hoping he would have similar onset as Mom but did not win that consolation prize.\n\nI have no symptoms and have not been tested, so I cannot speak from personal experience. However my brother got tested maybe ten years before he was symptomatic and had no regrets. He is the kind of person who just wants information even if he cannot really do much with it. It sounds like maybe you are in a similar frame of mind?\n\nThis is the first I have heard of SCA3. I am sorry you have this in your family.\n\nThank you for asking. Thank you so much for the reply. The genetic counselor is teaming me with a therapist who specializes with Huntington\u2019s as MJD is uncommon in my area (it is more prevalent in the northeast corner of the us, where I am from). There are dozens of types of sca (which I did not know) and all have different symptoms\u2026some worse than others.\n\nSounds like your brother was/is very brave. I am not sure if I am that brave!

", "Really interesting HD treatment being tested Hi guys, non-HD sufferer here. Have had issues with cognitive impairment for about 5 years now though.\n\nI was doing some research the last year and found something you folks might find interesting.\n\nA company called Mitochon Pharmaceutical has been working on a treatment for Huntington\u2019s called MP101. Here is a link to the conclusions of some studies they have done  .\n\nMP101 seemed to preserve brain volume, neuron integrity, improved motor function, and significantly reduced free radicals in the human cortex, all in mouse models of Huntington\u2019s.\n\nBasically the MP101 increases brain protection to a really high degree.\n\nHere is what is really interesting.\n\nMP101 is not a new drug. It is been around for almost a century. It is actual name is 2,4-dinitrophenol. In the 30\u2019s it was used as a weight loss drug, in doses of 200mg and more. It worked extremely well, dangerously well. Overdoses caused mitochondrial toxicity that resulted in people literally overheating to death. Long term use at these high doses also increased the chance for cataracts. The drug was taken off the market and shelved for decades. People today still sell it illegally to dedicated bodybuilders because there is no more effective method of losing weight in a short amount of time.\n\nResearchers began to look at it again when they figured out something incredible. At very low doses, the drug had entirely different effects. It acted as a mild stressor to mitochondria directly, and like as with fasting or exercise, the body responded with powerful anti-stress and resilience mechanisms. Increased neuroprotection being a huge one of them.\n\nThe implications of this are explained here  .\n\nAs I said, I have had issues with cognitive impairment for 5 years now. These include memory lapses, issues with executive functions, damaged working memory, etc. I have also had long stretches of depression and anxiety.\n\nI had tried a lot of meds as treatment with very marginal benefits, the impairments were still hampering my work as well as my personal life.\n\nSo I did something very risky and what was probably one of the best decisions of my life. After doing my research, I went and obtained some 2,4-dinitrophenol from a bodybuilding source and began dosing it at 3 milligrams per day. Almost every issue I had with cognitive impairment is gone now, after 3 months of consistent daily dosing. This is not an endorsement or a suggestion, this is just me reporting my anecdotal experience. I am very grateful for finding it.\n\nHD deserves better treatments and research. I am hoping for everyone is sake that MP101 clears human trials and does well, and that some day everyone has the chance to experience to same healing I did.\n\nThanks for reading, and my best wishes to all of you. Thank you! This is fascinating. I enjoyed your synopsis and went on to read the whole article. \n\nI have heard about mitochondria being implicated in HD before but had not heard of this drug. I consulted my trusted HD site HDbuzz and they mention it as a new treatment covered at a recent conference - \n\nI am glad you shared your personal account as I find these helpful. Glad you found something that worked. \n\n Can you share your source?", "Cannabidiol drug trial results for Epilepsy might finally get MJ off of Schedule 1 and into research labs ", "Advice on long term care insurance My wife is at risk of HD and she is considering getting the genetic test to determine if she is positive or not. She has no symptoms currently at 32 years old. Her father has HD and is currently in a nursing home and he is 72, with symptoms that started about 20 years ago. \n\nAfter talking with a genetic counselor she mentioned that we may want to enroll in long term health care and long term disability prior to the test. Has anyone had experience with this? I can get long term disability added to my plan at work, but I have never researched long term health care. \n\nI would appreciate anyone\u2019s experience with this and possible insurance companies others have used that they can vet (or companies to avoid).\n\nI may just decide to keep coverage even with a negative result. We do not want children and this seems like an attractive solution to cover any possible end of life care expenses. \n\nThanks I am not an expert on this and am a few years removed from when my wife and I did our initial research prior to her testing, but from what I recall about our experience was that long term care insurance was too costly at our age (also in our 30s) to pay for up until the point where it might be necessary.  We did have the benefit of seeing that both my wife\u2019s father and grandmother did not become symptomatic until later in life.  If it had impacted them at earlier ages that may have altered our decision on long term care.\n\nWe did get and maintain long term disability.  The cost was more reasonable and the need more likely (with or without HD).  We do not get it directly through our employers but were eligible for a group plan with good benefits because of our job type (US federal govt civilians).  Since we are likely to stay in these jobs (or similar jobs) for our career this was a good option.  I would think that most long term disability through your employer would also be group plan but you would have to look into whether it is transferable if you are in jobs you are not likely to keep until it is potentially needed. There are also individual plans available on the open market and are underwritten similar to life insurance.  If opting for that route, you would definitely want to do that before testing.", "I do not really know what to say here, I just need someone to talk to right now who understands. I am an 18 year old at risk male, my father currently has Huntington\u2019s but thankfully it is still really early on so I have time left with him. I do not have anyone I can talk to about this, my family generally do not enjoy or want to  talk about the subject and the only time I have had the confidence to mention this to my friends was when I was drunk and you cannot really have proper conversations then and I have not talked about it since, what would we even say?\n\nHonestly though I am just not very good at coping with all of this, last year at a wedding I saw a family member late into the disease and she had lost complete control of her body, she could not even talk anymore it was horrible and the thought of me, or my sister and my dad like that kills me. \n\nI have really spiralled the last few years, i decided that if I did find out I was gene positive then I would not get married or have children. I am just always upset cause this is always on my mind, and I do not know what to do. I understand there are people out there suffering a lot worse than I am but I just do not how to deal with everything.  At 18 you do not need your parents permission anymore. However I would strongly suggest trying to get to a better place emotionally before adding the baggage of a test. A therapist can help a lot with this.\n\nAs a tested positive but still symptoms free person, I can safely say I am doing better at life with knowing then I was with the ambiguity hanging over my head.\n\nI can also say with confidence it is NOT the end of the world. Even if you have a positive test you still have a lot of good life left before you start suffering.\n\nAnd, the best part is you might have a negative test waiting for you. Yo, I know what you are going through. My mom had HD and when I was 18 I went through a lot of the same thoughts you did. If you want to talk about stuff, I am here. There is also groups you can explore. I recommend HDYO, they have a particular focus on young people impacted by HD. As for testing, it is a very personal decision but talk to people about it, people who have been tested and have not. If you need some names, I can put you in touch with people who have been through that but if you explore hdyo, you will find a lot of people like us who are just trying to figure shit out. While right now everything seems confusing and scary, it will be all right.  Just keep in mind you are still super young and the chances are not all that bad, that you never might have to suffer due to massive progress being made in science right now :) Thank you, I remember a social worker mentioned HDYO quite a few years ago when I was first introduced to Huntington\u2019s but I was young and forgot about it.  I am pretty certain my dad had to go to meetings with a therapist or something along them lines before they would test him anyway, and I think I remember a social worker mentioning that i should talk to a therapist before thinking about being tested. So perhaps I will go see one.  You are not alone and your not the first person to go through this. There are great resources available.  \n I am 28F at risk. My dad passed from Huntington's when I was 17 years old. His father had it as well but I did not get to meet him. \n\nWhen I was 18, my thought process was \"If I tested positive, I would rather die than put my family through that\" so that told me that I was not ready to get tested.   \nI am still not ready but I feel that I am getting closer and closer. I always told myself that I would get tested when I was ready for kids, and if I was positive that I would not have children. \n\nI now have a 7 month old son, and i still have not been tested. The rules in Alabama are very strict about being tested. Since I Just had a baby, they would deny me until they see fit. I fear that if I am positive, my son will have to watch me go through it and that would kill me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother tested positive and his symptoms started at the age of 20. My sister tested negative and I am the only one left that has not gotten tested.  I really sympathize with your situation. I agree with other commenters, please get yourself into a better state of mind emotionally before you get tested if you choose to do so. It may take years and that is ok. You do not need to go get tested today, you can do so at any time or never if that is what you want to do. \n\nI found out I am gene positive and I am currently presymptomatic. It sucks but it is not the end of the world. Trust me. I understand the fear around getting a positive and just thinking that your life will be over if you get that positive. It is not true at all. I am married, I have a great job that I love. I could still have kids if I wanted them. There are options. And the future is bright for people like us - those at risk and those gene positive. There are researchers out there right now working 24/7 on developing treatments for us. Have hope. \n\nI personally think that everyone should test. If more did, then hopefully more people would know about this disease. If more people knew then more people would care. If more people cared then more support would be given to people in our situation. It is a win for the affected in my opinion. Although I believe testing is a positive thing, I do not think anyone should test if they are not in the right place emotionally or financially to do so. Wait until your established, have a job with good insurance, have found someone to share your life with who will stand with you during the testing process. There is no reason to do it immediately. \n\nI understand your pain. It took me 7 years to test after finding out I was at risk. I am glad I waited until I was ready. Now I feel prepared. \n\nTalk to your friends. They will probably understand better than you expect. If they do not, find others who do. Join HDYO and HDSA-NYA. NYA offers retreats if you are in the US. HDYO offers camps. I suggest you meet other people your age with the same circumstances. It will help you cope. \n\nBest of luck. You are young and have so much going for you that you do not even realize. There really may be an effective treatment in your lifetime before you ever show symptoms if you even are gene positive to begin with. Keep posting here too, I have met incredible people on Reddit who have changed my life. :)  IVF really works. We have two children 99.9999% HD free. They are the greatest blessings in the world. hey I know it is a ways away but you should consider checking out the HD youth organization summer camp (( in August Its for kids 15-23 in San Diego and the organization pays for travel expenses. It seems like it is a good place to talk with other people going through similar experiences. Also there will probably be people there who know a lot about the testing process and treatment developments.   I wish I could, I live in the UK though sadly. I work in the biotech industry at a company that works on genetic diseases. If you are 18 I am confident that you will experience effective treatments in your lifetime.   \n\n\nTreating genetic diseases such as this is the biggest growth area of healthcare right now.   \n\n\nEveryone else has given great answers but getting tested, but I am here to say empirically you should have real hope.

Brother-in-law says MIL cannot come back because he does not get along with father-in-law. My husband and I do not have the space. FIL cannot care for MIL by himself. He honestly cannot really take care of himself. \n\nHow can we get MIL a decent place to live on short notice (2 weeks)? I do not think she is getting all the benefits she is entitled to. We are not sure what to do with FIL yet, but one step at a time. Where in the world is she located? How old is she? The neurosurgeon where she gets medical care should have a team of social workers that can help. If not, look up the closest center of excellence on ( and talk to them. We are in KY. She is in her 50's I believe. Know before going in that most government-funded SNFs are a total trainwreck - moreso now with COVID. Here is my story about one such home. It has gotten MUCH WORSE there since I last updated and trying to make them fully compliant - or even baseline not criminally negligent - could easily be a full-time job (unpaid). Go to any SNF you are considering. Look for staff not wearing PPE, ask to see the meals, talk to any residents you see, see how dirty or clean it is. Look up their DPH violations or citations. Best of luck to u. The Eviction Moratorium has been extended so you have longer than 2 weeks. It will take 2 months to get her doctor to order SNF admission and get responses back from area facilities. \n\nMy story. It is long but Americans NEED TO KNOW.\n\n Yes I would second this advice. I totally agree such a a shame our nursing homes are so bad!! Omg Missouri nursing homes my sister has been in two are exactly the same as you have written!! Does anyone know how to start a petition? Omg they are so bad. How do star a petition Call them! Tell them you read the Hold Stearns Accountable Facebook Page and you are outraged at how they treat our elders. Seriously, Reddit fam - if we flood them with calls - they will have to do better for the Residents left languishing there.  Their # is 618-931-3900. Ask for Sherri Whitmer. Tell her how outraged u are. It takes a Village to be the change that needs to occur at some places. \n\nEven if u do not call - thank u for reading my story. Thank you so much for your great information!! I am calling Monday along with as many family members I can get!!", "Questions questions Hi guys. My girlfriend recently tested positive for Huntington's Chorea. She has 44 reps in allele 2 according to her report. She is just 25 right now and is going crazy. Her mom passed away from brain cancer a long time ago when she was a child so we have no idea about her condition. Her dad (60) does not have any symptoms although he did not get tested. She is more worried about her brother who is going to get tested in a few days. What is the possibility he might be positive and if so would it pass on to his kids? (His wife is 6 months pregnant) I am sorry to hear that, this is really tough news to deal with for both of you. Did your girlfriend test positive for the gene through predictive testing, or has she been diagnosed with Huntingtons symptoms as well?\n\nHer brother has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and also testing positive, and if he is positive each of his kids would have the same 50% chance. If he is not positive for it, there is no chance of his kids inheriting it. Thank you for the response. She has been diagnosed with the symptoms as well. My heart goes out to you guys, this is devastating news to deal with.\n\nMy family and I went through similar things recently with a surprise diagnosis and pregnant siblings getting tested, so if there is anything you or your gf want to discuss or ask or vent about I am here. I am sorry about your position. It was really shocking to us as well as we did not know about any history existing in the family. I think we just need to take some time off and clear our minds a little. 44 reps and she is symptomatic at 25? God, I am so sorry. What tipped them off to test her for HD without a family history?\n\nTo answer your question: if she has the gene, then her brother has a 50% chance of having it as well. This means that his kids have a 25% chance of inheriting it. (Or, if he tests positive, then you will know they have a 50% chance each. The 25% chance is only if you do not know his gene status.)\n\nI have 45 reps and I am 29 and still not showing any symptoms. My sister is 31 and also does not seem to have any obvious symptoms.The variance in how this disease progresses for people is all over the place. How is she handling the news of the positive result?  \n\n\nedit: if the neurologist who tested you has not mentioned it yet, would recommend looking up Ionis's gene silencing trials for HD that are going on right now. His kids have either a 0% chance or a 50% chance depending on if brother is a carrier. Yes! Exactly.   \n\n\nIf he is not a carrier, 0%   \nIf they do not know if he is a carrier, 25%  \nIf he **is** a carrier, 50% My dad had it. He died nine years ago\nIf you have any questions or ever want to talk about it PM me.", "My Mom passed from HD 10 years ago today is her Birthday. I miss her so much. ", "Feeling guilty Back story. My mom told my that HD runs through my dads side of the family. His mom had it. And so did her sister, they both died in there early 40s. Everyone else tested negative except my dad. He died from colon cancer at 30. So he never had the chance to. I had kids young. ( at 19 &amp; 21 ) my fear mow is that I could potentially pass it onto them. I was never informed about the severity of the disease. My wife is super supportive and said she still would have wanted kids. And she does not want me to get tested but if our kids do we will support it and pay for it. Now I am stuck with this feeling of dread and guilt knowing I could have potentially passed it down. I need some advice I am of the opinion that if you are a parent, or a soon to be parent, you need to be tested. Sticking your head in the sand does not help anyone. You have to be able to make educated decisions in the future that could change because of Huntingtons. a positive result could mean more family time and vacations. Negative result could be to save more for retirement/keep working. You do not want to wait until things get bad before you realize its to late for you to spend quality time with your family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tested positive 2 years ago. I do not regret getting testing. Either way I still stay up all night thinking about my future I just feel like if I found out it would make me depressed and angry. And I have always been huge on family and travel. That is why I wanted kids young. I did not want to get colon cancer and die before my kids got to know me My parents had me without knowing. I would not take my life back for anything. And I would not take back the experience of having a parent with a disability either. I am going to get tested, because it will make me feel more comfortable. If your kids want to I would let them know you are there for them and willing to do whatever it takes to help. You should not feel guilty for having children, and they will not fault you for being their parent. I actually really needed to hear this! Idc if I end up with it. My life will always be free and fun. But I do feel bad that I could have potentially passed it to my babies My mom died when I was 23. She will never be at any of my life events in the future (weddings/holidays). The only thing I remember from her is the final years where she could barely do anything\n\nWhat if your kids start planning big future events/weddings. I would think they would try to plan things sooner while your still able body and mind. \n\nWhat if your kids start having kids? If they are aware of the situation with it being genetic they can do things to prevent passing the gene on again.\n\nYou need to be able to put yourself in be able to make educated decisions going forward,.\n\nAgain this would probably depend on your repeat length when it comes to timeline.\n\nThis is just my opinion on it. Not trying to attack you in any way. I plan on fully telling my children about it and giving them the choice, and helping financially as much as I can. My dad passed when I was 2. I have no recollection or memory of him. And colon cancer runs in our family too. I plan on getting tested if I start showing symptoms. \n\nI know you are not attacking me, I appreciate you reiterating it tho lol. Thank you I am officially an adult (but I honestly do not know what I am doing, I still feel like a kid and I am 20 in 2 months) and my dad tested positive a few years ago. \n\nWhen my dads mom got sick, they did not officially diagnose her with Huntingtons. At the time my parents wanted kids, there was not the technology at the hospital to make sure your kids do not have Huntingtons, which there is now, but that is very expensive if you want to do that, and it can fail sometimes... They basiccly make sure that the parent who has it or is at risk of having it, will not pass on their Huntington gene, so that the kid will get the healthy one. They try to improve more and more, so with time it will be less likely to fail if you try it. Since it was not \"official\" but highly likely my grandma died bc of Huntingtons (she died before I was born), my dad thought he did not have it. Sadly, he is now diagnosed with it, and also felt/feels very guilty towards me and my siblings. But, I understand the situation he was in, and I am not mad at him. I feel lucky, that I have such an amazing dad, eventhough he is struggeling, and changing bc of this disease. I have great memories with him, he still tries to be my dad eventhough of his disease, and I am very happy that he is my dad.\n\nYes, I am scared for the future, but there is still a 50% chance I do not have it, right? Honestly, when you are able to talk to your kids about it, they will understand the situation you were in. I do not blame my dad for anything, and I do not think your kids will blame you at all. You sound like a caring parent, and I think your kids only love you and want to be there for you if needed. \n\nYou will know for sure they are at risk, if you get tested. I know that is a very personal choice, and you should choose whenever you feel ready. \n\nI know it is hard, but please do not feel guilty. Try to be the best parent you can be for kids, no matter what happends. I am sending you much love, and I hope this helped you a little \ud83d\ude0a No that definitely helped a lot. I am going to make sure my kids know about it and are fully aware of everything that goes on. And I will make sure I pay for both of them to be able to get the testing for there kids. We do not think my dad had it. He died in his 30s from cancer and was not showing any signs or symptoms of HD. His mom died at 43. I heard that the positive gene for HD actually fights cancer and is ridiculously rare to have a patient with HD to get cancer. So idk. But it does stress me out. I am 22 rn. Are you planning on getting tested? A very similar Situation happened to my husband and I. We choose not to get tested because we are prepared and live life to the fullest. Knowing or not know will not change anything, other than killing hope. We have life insurance, long term disability insurance, we travel we enjoy every waking second. When my kids are older we will tell them and they will make their choice and we will support and help them along the way b This is exactly how I feel! I feel like knowing would ruin my time. I just want to enjoy what time I do have if I have it. I will be open and honest with my kids when time comes so they can be prepared and have money to cover the ivf stuff for there kids I think it is best to tell them when they are old enough and when you think they are ready for it though\ud83d\ude05. Maybe talk to your partner about it what is the best way to tell it. \n\nI get that it stresses you out, and I do not know for sure what advice to give you here. Maybe it is best to talk to a professional about it, if you are able to afford that, to see what positives, and negatives there are if you get tested. I think they could give you the best advice when it comes to that.\n\nI did that myself back when my dad got diagnosed when I was 17 with my oldest brother, and we came to the conclusion that it was not a good idea for me. I am so young, and in my family the symptoms come mostly at a later age than average. My dad started to show signs when he was 54 or 55. \n\nKnowing so early on could harm your mental health, but, it might also give you peace and help you to plan your future. Since I have had mental health issues in the past, and sometimes still have bad days, (I got diagnosed a bit too late with ADD and Autism, so yeah, I wondered most of my life what was wrong with me) they advised me to not get tested yet, and to live my life to the fullest. They told me it was best to wait until I was older and wanted kids, which I understand. At first I did not want to get tested at all, since I would recognise the symptoms myself, but now I am not so sure anymore. I think I will wait until I want kids someday (if I want them, I am not even sure about that), and then look back into if I want to get tested. Its a very personal choice, so I am taking my time in my decision! Also, life is full of purpose for a gene carrier. My husband has changed countless lives for the better and I KNOW the world is brighter even if by a little speck because he is here.. my children also are a light and their lives are and will be so meaningful even if they carry the gene. Do not feel guilty.. it is the trial we have to endure but it does not mean our lives are not worth it, just because we carry that gene. This actually was really nice to hear! I absolutely agree. I do not think people deserve any less of a life just cause they carry. My mom had me late, and passed away from HD when I turned 21 after years of declining. I still think of her often and love her with my whole heart. And somehow I have slowly come out of it with a much closer relationship with my Dad and step mom as a result. No life is without suffering, and watching my mom decline and pass was without a doubt the hardest part in my life. But I am still grateful and happy to be here. I want to enjoy many more hugs and sunrises. \n\nHave you ever seen interstellar? TLDR: the father had to go away for a long time, potentially forever and he says a line I did not quite like for a while \u201cand she said now we are just here to be ghosts of our children\u2019s past\u201d I did not really get the line and did not really like it. Now coming on 6 years since my mothers passing I think it is absolutely true. My mother and the memories I have snuggled up and spending time with her, fill me with feelings of love I can hardly express. They are my connection to something I have lost. I bring this up to say, ignore the rest and love your kids. Love your wife, treat her well, love your kids and be mindful of their needs. Hug them often and never hesitate to express your love. And although they will certainly face suffering, they will never forget your love and it will sustain them. Just wanted to add on this that while I knew my mother was sick I was not given a specific diagnosis. My dad and step mom did not tell me that it was specifically HD until I turned 25. Tbh I am glad they waited, as I was not ready to handle such a potential diagnosis till around then (I had a rough time for a while after my moms passing, so I think they worried about adding onto that). Now that I have know a while I do plan to get tested in the next year or so. Mainly so I can adjust my financial planning accordingly, and inform any long term partners of my future medical issues. My parents did tell me earlier, I have known from a young age (about 10/11 or so), but not from a very, very young age. I do have to add to this that my grandparents from my dads side died lots of years before I was born, and no one in my direct family were suffering a lot from it at the time. I think they choose to tell me and my siblings early, before my aunt, who is diagnosed with it too, started showing severe symptoms. Otherwise it would just get harder to tell us about it etc. I think it really is all about the situation, the personality and mental state the kids and you are in, the relationship you have with them, etcetc. I appreciate this! I have not been tested yet. I highly doubt my father had it due to him never showing signs even through his cancer. He passed when I was 2. As a parent I do not care as much about me. I just do not want my babies to have it. Absolutely right about situation playing a large role. In my case they did not know until my mom was in her later stages, at which point I was already having a tough time. So waiting was a good choice, where your case it sounds like it was perfectly fine to bring up early. Yeahh, exactly. It must be hard for parents to know when is the best time. I might be late to the party. I am 24 now and have been dealing with this most of my life. Just know my that your kids will hold no ill will. I love my mom and I know your kids love and will love you regardless of any diagnosis.\n\nAre there times when it upsets me? Yes. Do I wish I was not born because this ugly thing could potentially affect me in the future? Absolutely not. Give them a life worth living as a parent and it will still be worth it! Thank you man. I actually appreciate this. Since learning about it I get angry with my dad sometimes but I get why he was never tested to so it is hard for me to blame him. I do not regret being born cause I would not have these beautiful babies that I do now. I just pray they do not have it. They are will probably be a cure anyways by the time they are old enough to deal with it. 35 more years for them. Probably about 10-15 for me For what it is worth if you ever need to vent to a stranger on the internet let me know! My inbox is open. I get it is tough and we all need to be here for one another! You did not know. You did not shrug the knowledge off and decide to have kids anyway because you wanted them. You were young and had never seen it happen to anyone, and it is nearly impossible to comprehend unless you have seen someone die of it. \n\nThe decision to get tested is yours and yours alone. Your wife can tell you what she thinks, but this is your life.\n\nI am not saying this as someone with HD, I am saying this as someone in her position. I desperately want my boyfriend to get tested (because he is as much of an emotional wreck as if he knew he had it, so it cannot get much worse but it could get better), but I will never ever *ever*  make him do it and I know 100% that I will *never*  make getting tested a condition of anything, even getting married. I cannot ever make him feel forced into that decision. It is his and his alone. If I cannot respect that, and if I put my need to know what the future holds over his mental health, then I do not deserve him.\n\nIf you want to get tested, you will know what the future holds. You will know whether you need to save up for early retirement and specialized care. You will know whether you will need life insurance (which you need to get *before*  you get tested, unless you get tested anonymously). You will know whether you need to take or avoid losing certain jobs, you will know that you cannot risk taking one that sounds amazing because it does not come with a retirement plan, you will know how to structure your family budget to build up savings...\n\nAnd if you do not have it, you will be free of the dread that you will have to tell your children that they will have to watch you die of this and that they might die of it, too.\n\nHonestly, there is a 50/50 chance you can spare your children that emotional turmoil; if you get tested, they might never have to deal with that fear and dread. If you want to try to make up for potentially inflicting this on them... this would be the way. I agree. Me and my wife have agreed and I am getting tested at 30. So I can prepare and save up for my kids to be able to have ivf and not let there kids have this stupid disease. I am 22 now. My sister is 26. My dad passed at 35 from cancer. None of us have ever show any symptoms in the slightest. Not even a muscle spasm. But my uncle and grandma both developed symptoms in there late 20s. Made is to 41 and 45 then died.", "Tominersen (Previously IONIS-HTTRx) Is anyone participating in this study and willing to share their experiences? \n\nI am  \u2018at risk\u2019  for Huntington\u2019s disease and have been following these studies as closely as I can. my wife is in it. she gets a lumbar puncture every 2 months. She has to take some tests while she is there. It seems like it may be working, but at the same time we may be receiving a placebo Thanks for sharing. I understand that the placebo effect is a possibility but I am encouraged to hear that it seems to be effective. Omg please give your wife a big hug!! Love that she is helping the HD community! How do you get enrolled into a study? I believe that the drug is in phase 3 testing and enrollment ended, right around when Covid started.

Thank you", "My parents just told me about our chance for Huntington\u2019s Hi there, new to the sub but not reddit. I do not know anything about HD and just started researching and I am starting to feel overwhelmed. I found out today that my aunt is dying of HD and told my dad to get tested. Well he tested positive and my parents kept it secret for the last couple of months. They have not told my siblings yet and I barely understand what is happening. Should I get tested? (I am 25) Will it affect my job or my insurance? I do not understand how this disease works and I cannot talk to my parents openly about it because it is still a secret. Supposedly my dads repeat count may be low enough he may not exhibit symptoms but the doctor said it is still a 50/50 chance that he passed it on. \n\nThank for you listening I just do not know who to talk to about this. My parents are shutting down over it and I am nervous my partner will freak out...idk who to trust right now until I figure out what the actual fuck is happening right now ", "A clinical trial reaches phase 2! \n\nI know a lot of studies have reached phase two and have not succeeded, but I am still holding onto hope. If this one is not it then hopefully other studies in the works or future studies will be. This is good news, but reads like its not meant to cure or slow disease progression. It looks like it is a drug meant to reduce chorea symptoms which, if it works, would definitely improve the quality of life for people with HD chorea. Yeah, I was slightly disappointed whenever I read the article. My mom has slight HD chorea though so hopefully this could treat it There are medications that help with chorea available now, but more options and potentially fewer side effects would definitely be a good thing.", "CAG count of 43. I finally got the details on my test results from my neurologist. It was really hard to see it in black and white like that. I wish the number had been lower but there is nothing to be done about it. I am in my early 40s now and it sucked to see that the average age of onset for people with my CAG count is ...now, but it is possible  that I will make it into my 50s without major issues like my mother did. Maybe the drug trials will be successful and it will not be too late for me. I am currently engaged to a wonderful guy who helps me take care of my mom and planning a beautiful wedding and honeymoon. I feel like once some time has passed I will be able to focus on appreciating every good day but I am just not there yet. I still need to tell my kids and brothers the test was positive. Telling people is the hardest part for me. I am really sorry to hear that. I hope you live a happy life with your fianc\u00e9 and stay asymptomatic for as long as possible.  I am sorry to hear the numbers. Good luck. It sounds as if you have a great support system. \ud83d\udc99 I do not know if it is any comfort, but my mother's repeat number was close to yours, in the mid-40s, and she did not have significant issues until she was in her mid-late 50s. She got herself a good neurologist who specialized in HD and got on good drugs early to help keep things under control as long as possible. The difference between her progression and my aunt who was not nearly as conscientious, was stunning. Take good care of yourself and good luck with your wedding! Thank you, that really does help. My wife and I travelled as much as possible before her symptoms came on, and I really am grateful that we did that. That is a tough conversation to have with your kids. Internet hugs.  I think my dad's count was 42 or 43. He ended up showing physical symptoms in his late 40's and dying a few years before he would have turned 60. Another woman in his support group had the same CAG count and is still going strong (living at home 4 years after my dad's death), despite starting symptoms around the same time as him. I am not a doctor, but to the best of my knowledge, it seems like you \\*can\\* make a difference in your age of onset by how you take care of yourself. If you are interested in this, I would suggest looking into the twin study where their AOO was something like 6 years apart. They were genetically identical and still had nearly a decade of variance in when they started symptoms.    Hey, you sound really positive and grounded. That is great!! It is wonderful you have someone there to love and support you. I hope this does not change any of that. I am hopeful for these new drug trials. Hope is on the horizon! Best of luck to you.", "Does having Huntington's Disease reduce your risk for Cancer? ", "Does it sound like my girlfriend has Huntington's Disease? To start this off, me and my girlfriend are both sixteen. We have not been together very long (about 7 months) though I do feel like I love her.\n\nThis will be a long post.\n\nHere is some very necessary backstory:\na) My girlfriend has been diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome since she was a child, for which she takes prescribed medicine. She makes occasional jerking movements and also makes several uncontrollable movements with her face.\nb) Her mother drank and smoked a lot, and very possibly did other drugs during her pregnancy. She took almost no care during her pregnancy and acted as she would if she was not pregnant, if not worse.\n\nShe does indeed show many symptoms of the disease; She makes involuntary movements, and she has many cognitive disabilities. She is slow to take some info in although it really depends on the information. She is been able to pass her classes with all A's since I met her in 8th grade and she is still able to do it. She is having more difficulty in some classes but this is rather because they are AP classes than the fact that her learning skill is deteriorating. She shows symptoms of anxiety and depression frequently, and she does have frequent thoughts involving death and suicide. I think these may be attributed to the fact that she is been bullied and alone a good portion of her life, and she is been made fun of for her Tourette's.\n\nAnother thing I have noticed which helps me feel better about it is that she is shown no very noticeable changes in the past 4 years; She has changed of course, but her learning skill is about the same, her involuntary movements have not gotten much worse, and her depressive thoughts have actually gotten better since I have started being around her.\n\nI know asking this will not really prove or change anything; Her doctor suggested she may have it and that she gets a blood test, which she is and the results will be in on the twenty second of September.\n\nBut considering that her involuntary movements can be attributed to her Tourette's, her slow learning can be attributed to her mother's poor care during pregnancy, and her depressive thoughts can be attributed to her past, does it sound more like she does or does not have it? Please help me out. And please give me honesty.\n\nWe know nothing about her family history and whether or not it involves Huntington's Disease. We do not even know her father and we do not know if her mother has it, so any answer given must be based off of the facts I have provided.", "Could CRISPR benefit Huntington's victims? I have been reading into CRISPR a lot and it is insane what it is done. It has cured Hemophilia in some animals and I also heard that it cured HD in some mice as well. Of course, mice are quite a bit different from humans but it is still amazing that it did it. Maybe. But it is difficult to get all the cells in the body (huntingtin is expressed everywhere) and my understanding is that efficiency is not quite there yet for all therapeutic purposes. It is something to keep an eye out for but not necessarily soon. There is nothing wrong with staying informed on the latest research in CRISPR, and ZincFinger, and Gene Silencing, etc. \n\n\nIt is so important that you keep in mind that mice are not people. \nLOTS and LOTS of outcomes in mice has ended up not being replicable in humans.\n\n\nI guess I am saying, please temper your expectations accordingly. I can never get excited about results in mice. The headlines are so great, right? \"Wow look at what they were able to do...!\" then you read on and in regular sized font it says \"in mice.\" Personally, I shrug and say, \"well that could be something someday,\" and file it away. The thing I took away from what I have read about CRISPR is that it is ideally suited for diseases that affect one specific part of the genome, versus others that are more broad spectrum. So yes, there is lots of potential.  \n\n\nI am probably stating that incorrectly, but you get the jist. I think there is a lot of hope in CRISPR for genetic diseases in general\u2014perhaps not right this minute, but definitely in the next ten-fifteen years. I signed up for an HD Google alert, and I get notifications every day about treatments in progress. It is true that there are many disappointments, but there is also progress being made in real time. \n\nAs an aside, I (29F, gene status undetermined, just learned about my mother\u2019s diagnosis in May) am generally experiencing a lot of anxiety around HD. Researching the treatments can be productive for sure, because I think it is important to learn, but there is definitely a point of diminishing returns when I am trying to learn what is not know-able. What has really helped me instead (aside from counseling, exercise, participating in HD community activities) is acknowledging my own uncertainty. I might have the gene\u2014but I also might not. There might not be an effective treatment by the time it is an issue for me, *if it is*\u2014but there might. From pridopidine to branaplam to gene editing, there is a lot of hope in the future. Even if it does not help me personally (if I have the gene!), reminding myself that there is hope in general helps me get out of bed in the morning so that I can focus on the things in my life that bring me joy. (And stop googling.) \n\nI hope that is helpful. Hang in there. I love it.

I wish I had advice for you on what comes next. \n\nI do know some jobs offer life insurance without needing medical information. It think that might be your best option at this point. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this. I just went through this a couple years ago. We have currently been trying to get long term care insurance and we keep getting denied. It is rough. \n\nPlease reach out if you want to talk. Where are you located? I am in Michigan and we had a guy who worked for MassMutual help us find life insurance before I got tested. Essentially, if the insurance company is going to ask about HD it is going to ask about family history anyway, so you are not in much worse if shape now than you were before. Not to say getting insurance earlier is not easier, it is, but you are not up shit creek anyways.\n\nThe thing is to find an insurance provider who does not ask HD screening questions on their application. This is where having an insurance professional came in handy. He was able to scan multiple application forms for us and recommend one that met our needs and did not ask about HD.\n\nWe found our guy through the local HDSA support group. Maybe try asking yours if they have any resources.  Good luck! I got love insurance recently and they basically told me it is it is expensive because I have not been tested. Actually if you have been tested and even if positive it can be cheaper because it is a known risk. I would recommend contacting an insurance broker and sorting out some insurance ASAP. Thank you. We were not planning on having kids for a few more years and his dad also just got diagnosed so it happened at a pretty good time for us. I am in Oregon. I tried talking to someone from policy genius but they could not find anything. Yea. I wish we had waited just a little bit but we were trying to get it done when his family\u2019s insurance had his their premium. Thank you. That is really interesting. That is been like the opposite of what I have been hearing. That gives me a little hope. Thank you. I get it. The system is against us and not for us unfortunately. It is hard to know what is the right decision when there is no right choice. It feels like no matter what it is always a lose/lose. \n\nI just went through IVF. I also have one kid from before our results. Again, let me know if you have any questions. How old was his dad at diagnosis ? My grandfather was 65 at diagnosis and my mom is nearing 60 and has never been tested His dad is in his low 50s/late 40s I think. My husbands paternal grandmother also has it (undiagnosed). His father is a little shaky with his balance and drops things sometimes but not showing symptoms too bad. Hopefully you all can get some through work as most do not require health checks", "Financial resources to help family member with HD? My sister is in the middle stages of HD and will soon need full time care. Right now her disability is not even enough to take care of her two kids and I am barely taking care of myself. Who do I turn to so that she has even basic needs met? She is in Virginia and we are the last two alive in our family besides our kids. Thanks for any advice. I am so sorry for what is happening to your family. I believe the Huntington\u2019s Disease Society of America has resources to help with physical and financial assistance but I am not positive. I would definitely reach out to them to see what help or information they can offer. Check with social services for ebt to help with food. If your sister served in the military the va hospitals are an option for care as well. Both for medical care and disability pension. In Virginia being on SSI automatically makes anyone eligible for Medicaid. Different plans have different fringe benefits like transportation to and from medical appointments for free. If you are the primary caretaker for you should get power of attorney to get through any red tape. \n\nHD is considered a catastrophic disease by the government now. Which means anything that gets applied for should have that mentioned and it speeds up the wait time drastically. \n\nAlso anything local like churches and food banks have more regional places for help. \n\nAbove all else, sit back and breath in as deep as possible. It might feel like the world is coming down but you learn how to dodge the falling pieces eventually.", "Feels like I am slowly losing it. Is my experience related to HD? I am 28 and as my age progresses I am starting to see a decline in my mental state. \n\nI am having trouble organizing simple things not remembering to do things. I really have an issue remembering where things in my house are located like pots and pans. \n\nMy works declining because I am having frustration with my brain feeling like it is foggy or like thinking feels like I am moving through molasses. \n\nI am also severely depressed with suicidal ideation which is progressing. Not really intending on killing myself or anything just having trouble controlling my thoughts and mood. \n\nSometimes I noticed I lose my balance when moving around or move strangely while I am walking. \n\nIs this in line with the beginning stages of HD? \n\nI started my genetic testing and am waiting to get counseling but I am afraid they will not tell me my results due to telling them that I was having a depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. A positive HD diagnosis would actually be a sigh of relief knowing why I am declining. \n\nI am physically perfectly healthy with perfect blood work. Big decrease in my gym performance due to the depressed mood and feeling weak. \n\nJust trying to get some thoughts.

I do not know whether I should relate it to Huntington\u2019s or not but it is growing evermore frustrating. I am making poor decisions and my constant depression is negatively affecting my relationship with my partner and my friends. \n\nTo my understanding the early effects of HD are varied and subtle and there is not a strict guide for what behaviors may or may not be considered early onset symptoms. The only real way to know is to get tested. I hope they give you your results and it helps put your mind at ease. Let us know. We cannot diagnose, of course. It sounds like you are heading down the path you need to head down. I cannot imagine someone witholding your results due to your experiencing depression. I say this mainly because depression is a common symptom of HD and knowing test results would be very helpful in determining any course of treatment. That is reassuring. I was being honest and was trying to provide accurate data for the research study. What you are describing sounds like depression. Hey u/ayyylma166!\n\nI am a mid 40s gent with HD who can tell you that while they all \\*do\\* sound  like a lot of the early on-sets I can identify with, I have to echo what others  are saying, there is no way to know until you open up the results.   A lot of these could 'symptoms' you are feeling could really be attributed to a ton of other things (from something  as mild as maybe a poor diet to something as  significant as HD).    \n\n\nI do not  think any of the councillors I saw would have prohibited from telling me the news, but it was nice to have them there when I did receive it.  Because the minute before I got that news I felt invincible, a feeling that  I have not had since.\n\nIf you have more questions, I am always happy to be someone to talk to if you need it, in the meantime, I hope your support group are there for you no matter the circumstance of the test, Could be HD but these also sound like symptoms of Lyme disease so maybe get tested for that as well if it is not HD. If you are feeling suicidal def get help immediately, no shame at all. I have been there and so have so many people I know. Life is hard.", "Supplements/vitamins for HD? Hi there, I am just curious if anyone has any advice or experience with any vitamins/supplements for their HD symptoms? Not clinically proven, but I would go for supplements that likely lower inflammation and are neuroprotective: omega 3, resveratrol and maybe coenzyme Q10? Regularly exercise, and go for food with anti-inflammatory properties (not always scientically proven but it is hard to perfectly control these studies): green leaf vegetables and broccoli, berries, whole food, garlic, curcuma, green tea, nuts, olive oil... Thank you so much :) I appreciate your response, that is really helpful I asked my neurologist about this a few months back and her answer was that the only proven way to delay onset and slow symptoms is daily exercise. That does not mean nothing else works, but that nothing else has been proven in large part because of how difficult it is to determine these sorts of things in pre-symptomatic people.\n\nThat said I am taking vitamins C and D, a multivitamin, melatonin, lions mane, and a blueberry &amp; spinach smoothie daily. Hm lions mane, not heard of that. I will do some googling, thank you! My mum told me blueberry too. (Dad has HD) I heard C0q10 and omega 3 can be helpful. I decided to see a naturopath today, why not \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Lion's Mane might be a long shot, but it is thought to increase neuro-plasticity and nerve growth factor in the brain and it is shown promising results in trials with Alzheimer's patients ((\n\nBlueberries are the top recommended anti-oxidant on ( though my understanding of the increased oxidative stress in HD patients is that it is likely that taking anti-oxidants will not slow progression as it is treating the symptom rather than the cause.\n\nThe CureHD blog has ( which is a really good read. Though in a ( he notes that he is since stopped taking all or most of those.\n\nI have sort of settled on doing things I know work - eating healthy and exercising - along with taking a few supplements that might not help but do not hurt. Hi there, I take N acetyl cysteine (NAC) twice a day. It is a precursor to glutathione, which is a powerful antioxidant. I also take alpha lipoid acid, another antioxidant. And Vitamin D and Vitamin B complex. I try to eat plenty of vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables, and cook with lots of extra virgin olive oil, which has neuroprotective qualities. I have tried to reduce refined sugar as much as possible, eating a dessert only twice a month, and pairing it with protein and fat to reduce a sugar spike. Refined sugar wreaks so much havoc on the body. The holistic nutritionist who recommended the above supplements said that refined sugar is the absolute enemy of the person with HD. He also recommended melatonin, although I have not incorporated that into my routine yet. That is fantastic info, thank you so much. I booked an appointment with a naturopath today so I am feeling positive about that. I have been doing lots of reading. Where do you get NAC? Online? \nLowering my sugar intake is a must but I am addicted it seems. I have bipolar type 2 and smoke weed so I do tend to get the munchies and feast on chocolate :/ I purchase my NAC at a local holistic supplements store. I buy the Pure Encapsulations brand, but it is a bit pricey. I would definitely do your research on the quality of the brands that you are interested in. \n\nI hear you about the sugar. I have always had a massive sweet tooth, so this has been a big undertaking for me. You might want to explore with your naturopath some ways that you can reduce your sugar intake, not necessarily eliminate it, which I do not think is a realistic goal in our society. But I do believe that every good thing we do for our body makes a difference in the long run. \n\nGood sleep hygiene is another massively important part of an HD support regimen.", "Questions about testing I have just found out that my bio dads father and also his brother passed from HD. I do not know my bio dad he left me as a baby and I have only met him once. He refuses to get a test done or say weather he is showing signs. After finding this out I am obsessing thinking everything is a symptom. I need to get tested so I know for sure   I am just not sure how to get the process started. If anyone has gone through this and can give me some insight on what happens and where to start that would be great!  I suppose this depends on where you are from. But maybe the protocol is similar.  Here in Germany you make an appointment with your local hd center, and go to your first meeting. You basically only get some infos about hd, no testing will be done. The next step was an appointment with a shrink who basically wants to find out if you can handle the diagnosis. Then there is a waiting phase of 4 weeks, after which you get your blood drawn. Now you got to wait another 4 weeks before you can make your final appointment at which you finally get the results.   I tested with 41 repeats which means I will develop HD. I am in Seattle, WA. My testing went quickly, I had an appointment to make sure I wanted to do it, the blood test itself a few weeks later, results a few weeks after that. My first follow up on dec 4th. I have known for about 12 years that it is in my genetics, just recently had the gall to get tested. Let me tell you...that decade did not prepare me for a positive result despite me convincing myself it had.  I would guess it varies but in Ireland anyway you go to your normal family doctor and they get you a referral for the department of clinical genetics then you do 2 sessions with a genetic counselor, 1 with a neuropsychologist then back to the genetic counselor to get bloods taken and finally back to them for your results. It takes the guts of a year or more to go through the whole thing. I had my blood taken last week, on the second appointment. \n\nI was referred to the genetics centre by the HD specialist herself (who works at the genetics centre) -- My Mum was in getting her diagnoses, they asked while I was there with her if I was interested in being tested myself, I was and had already booked an appointment with my GP to be referred, it just had not come yet. \n\nFirst appointment was, as others have said, just a chat, to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into. Second one started off with a chat and making sure I still wanted to be tested. \n\nBy the time I get my results, the whole process (for me) will have taken 3 months. Other family members have taken a lot longer, so I am not sure why I have been able to speed through the process, but I am not complaining. \n\nThe waiting game now is not ideal though.", "Washington University scientists are reprogramming human skin cells into brain cells (*were able to create medium spiny neurons) ", "Canadian's affected by HD Facebook group ", "Interesting update from the Roche and Genentech GENERATION HD1 study ( this morning regarding the Roche and Genentech GENERATION HD1 study. \n\nMy mom was part of the phase IIII trial that was halted, which was a huge blow to us and very sad.

Grandfather died very old, with pretty advanced HD, but maintained mobility until the end...I am gene positive with 40 repeats (as is my father, early 60s, and sister, early 30s).  I live in a small geographically isolated city, very far from family...we do not have a \\*bad\\* relationship...just not super close. We do not talk about our personal lives...we do not talk about HD...including among my very large and very at-risk extended famil...40+ people at risk and NO ONE TALKS ABOUT IT.  \n\nI had a few relationships when I was in my 20s and 30s and found out I was gene positive after my last one a few years ago.  I also contracted HIV a long time ago.  I  got my diagnosis mourning largely over with during that process, so I was kind of ::shrug:: about the HD result.  (not discount other's experiences). The one part that I have not really worked through with HD is the dating/how to approach relationships going forward.  The life expectancy/pathology with HIV is pretty much the same as a \"normal\" person with the drugs available today.  With HD, that is obviously such a wild card and I have not really processed the loss or change in what that might look like.  Then there is the whole caregiver thing, plus just subtle nuances that kind of color another person's perception.\n\nI go on dates from time-to-time, though being in a small area, the opportunity to do so with people I am attracted to is limited anyway. That said, I have met some really great people, but do not really know how to proceed.  Even those relationship prospects to whom I have disclosed my HD status and who have been supportive, I tend to push away. I just cannot get comfortable \"condemning\" someone to this life....\n\nAnyone else in a similar position? Should i just stop wasting time and focus on the relationships i have in my life.  I do not want caregiving responsibilities for me to eventually fall on anyone else. There is a good article in the NYT about this subject, generally ((  I figure when I get to a certain point of debilitation, when I can no longer do the things I love or derive enjoyment out of being alive due to HD, i will figure out a way to move on...i mean this is the most practical sense possible...I am not depressed or \"suicidal.\"\n\nI do long for regular intimate companionship sometimes...that support you get from having a positive, familiar and trustworthy partner that you can confide in, experience physical intimacy with, and provide the same, in turn, but maybe I can pull those things from other parts of my life? Thos really strong intimate relationships take so much time and energy to build and maintain and I already feel myself less and less capable of adjusting my routine, compromising, etc (maybe as a product of becoming older and set in my ways), but also I am definitely experiencing some of the early stage etiology...memory and mood things.

Admittedly, I do not think anyone in my family has Huntington's but due to some complaints I have been having in the past 6 months or so, I did some googling. \n\nAbout 6 months ago or so, I began to notice a lot of cognitive difficulties, and got a psychoeducational assessment which found executive function difficulties, word finding problems, and poor recall ability. This was new for me, as I was great at school but am having a lot more difficulties, which is why I decided to get tested.\n\nFast forward about two more months, and I have started to notice muscle twitches. They kind of happen randomly all over my whole body. Some are subtle, some are more prominent but nothing too drastic. They mainly happen in large muscles, not like my finger or eyelid. Some repeat quickly over and over, but most just happen once in one spot. Eventually the same spot will twitch again but it is not repetitive, if that makes sense. \n\nI have been looking up potential causes for muscle twitches and I can rule out dehydration and electrolyte issues. I just looked into the symptoms of Huntington's disease today. Of course, google tends to jump to more severe causes, but I guess I am wondering if I should be concerned? I am sure it is incredibly variable, and I should go see a doctor at least to see what they say, but I guess I just want to know what you all think as well. Thank you. It is impossible to say with certainty in a reddit comment, but it is probably not Huntingtons disease (HD). If you go see a neurologist there is some pretty simple tests they can do to determine if you are symptomatic with HD, and can then refer you for genetic testing if so.\n\nHD is very rare to begin with, and HD without any family history is extremely rare but not impossible. My Mum\u2019s diagnosis came with no family history which happens in about 10% of cases, so not impossible.\n\nBesides that, one of the symptoms of HD is blindness to your own symptoms. If you had it it is actually unlikely you would notice your own muscle twitches unless they were pointed out to you. Again, not impossible just unlikely.\n\nIf you are younger than your mid 40\u2019s or so that also reduces the likelihood because you would have to have a severe case to be symptomatic at a young age and that generally takes multiple generations for the mutation to expand to that extent.\n\nSo, I would say unlikely but ask a neurologist. Also see a neurologist because there is definitely something wrong, even if it are not HD and they can probably figure out what that is. That makes sense, thank you for the reply!", "Just got our COVID tests back... I have Huntington's Disease and have a caretaker that comes to the house to help take care of me and she tested positive for COVID, then a few days later I tested positive for COVID. Most of the symptoms are the same for Delta and the reg COVID, but we had a weird blip where we have not lost our taste and smell completely and also we have both a lot of head and chest congestion rather than mostly chest... I am running 101.2 Degrees of fever and have had a migraine, been coughing with chest tightness and wheezing, have sinus congestion that is making my head feel like a balloon, weird enough my hearing has also gotten super super sensitive. I also have stomach issues as well...so yeah very sick. We are waiting on meds right now and my elderly grandparents have been exposed as well. All had our shots and now we know that at the very least I have it... I always get a lot sicker than most people cause for some reason with HD that is just something that has come along with it and so I am on very careful watch and was told if my chest congestion gets worse I have to be hospitalized.. Caretakers should not be allowed around patients without a mask, this is ridiculous. If I had known that it was still possible for me to get COVID after having the shots I would have made the lady wear her mask but I figured since I have known her for a long time and she has been really close to me that she would care about my health but, I guess not because I found out that she never got vaccinated even so. Does anyone have any tips while I am sick to help keep me from completely having to be big time hospitalized? My grandpa is getting me Mucinex and Vicks and gatorade but idk what else I need to do. I live alone other than my caretaker coming over every few days... my grandparents cannot come over now too because we have to quarantine separately. :/ That really sucks.

I am 20 right now and I know I have my whole life ahead of me, I am just too scared about the possibilities of the future to focus on what is happening now. I am scared that I will be gene positive and if I am I am scared of not finding anybody to love and of losing people that I care about.

I make time with my family/friends a priority, I try to eat well/exercise, I save money over spending, and I am grateful for my life everyday. It is easy to get caught up in HD and let it impact every aspect of your life. You should plan for the worst but also pursue the things you want in life (relationships, jobs, etc.).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck with your decision. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk more.", "A really shitty weekend So, this may or may not be relevant to this group. I am sorry if it is not, I just need to talk to some people who might know what I am going through.\n\nI am 29, it is hard to get any family history past my grandparents or even for a lot of my parents' generation because they immigrated from a country that did not have healthcare the way we think of it. I do know my grandpa died pretty young.\n\nI had a seizure at work this past Friday (my eyes would lose focus and my face would go numb, then I would lose the ability to move, followed by convulsions affecting mostly my right side. I remained conscious the whole time) and ended up in the hospital where I kept having seizures every hour or two through the night. The hospital I was taken to is notoriously shitty, and it is not a surprise that I did not get a lot of answers there, but they did do a CT scan. The neurologist on call said that there was significant atrophy, but they were unable to determine a cause, or if that was related to my seizures.\n\nMy partner picked me up at 4am and I crashed at their place over the weekend so I could have someone keep an eye on me. I had seizures, periodically, Saturday, Sunday, and today, thought they have been decreasing in severity.\n\nSo all that happened, and I have been thinking back to see if I can remember having neurological symptoms before this. I have had a lot of panic attacks this year that I think might have been seizures, the symptoms being my eyes losing focus and my face going numb, followed by an overwhelming sense of dread and losing the ability to move. My memory is definitely going, but I attributed that to my narcotics problem when I was younger. The hospital neurologist did not think I was using long enough for there to be that much atrophy. And I have lost vision in my right eye a few times, the earliest I can remember being when I was 25.\n\nBecause this happened over the weekend I have really had nothing to do but stew with it. It took me all day today to get my GP's office to answer their phone and get me a referral to a neurologist. By the time that happened, the neurologist' office was closed. Things are moving so slowly and I just want to scream. I really really really need to have some answers.\n\nLike, I feel like I have to come to terms with the possibility that whatever I have is going to slowly kill me, and no one around me is taking that seriously. Like, the best case scenario for this is I have permanent brain-damage from some unknown cause that is going to cause major neurological symptoms for the rest of my life. And the worst case scenario is I have a degenerative disorder and I am going to die.\n\nAnyway, that is what I wanted to say.", "What do I do to deal with this as I am still young So my mother is 46 and has been diagnosed with Huntington's about 5 years ago but it is been running in the family for a while it is stopped going down generations now but at the moment my mother has been getting worse with her symptoms of Huntington's and does not realise that she physically cannot do the things that she wants to anymore and I try telling her that but that then pushes her away from me to the point where she has not talked to me in years because I do not want her to hurt herself but it is not just me that is been affected it is my father too because he is been mentally hurt by this and is showing his frustration too all of this in little outbursts of anger and he is been having to give his 100% of dedication to my mother so I basically have no one to talk to about this that would understand I have tried going to therapist but it did not really help I need someone that understands because I have not had a proper conversation with either of my parents in a couple months nor have they to each other this has been making me decline in metal stability but I feel bad for saying that it is affecting me because it is not her fault but I am only 15 so i do not really know what to do.\n\n\nif a-lot of this does not make sense i was very tired while typing this so sorry for u guys. You said that \"it is stopped going down generations now\"; what do you mean by that? My mom is 41 and I am 14, so we are around you and your mother's ages. She has HD and so far has mild chorea. I am hoping that some treatment or cure will come along to help her before it is too late but I honestly do not know. Some days the diagnosis affects me more than other days and it is just a shitty thing to live with. I am pretty optimistic that by the time it affects young people like us there will be a treatment or cure so I am not worried about myself, but I am very worried for my mom.\n\nStay strong &lt;3  Oh me and my sister do not have Huntingtons as we got tested when we where born so we both stopped it going down degenerately Do not worry I have been tested and I would not have kids If I did have HD I do not want to cause anyone the same that im experiencing now My thoughts on HD is that there is not going to be a treatment or cure for decades because Huntington's is just extremely destructive to the brain if u did not know because when ur mom dies she will have a hole the size of quarter in her head but u can still hope there will be treatment or a cure Congratulations! My brother and I have not been tested so hearing you and your sister won the coin toss gives me hope. Yeah get tested it is not going to hurt and there is still hope that u will not get it Some part of me wanted to enjoy my time not knowing, but lately it is been on my mind enough that I joined this group and got the ball rolling to get tested.", "The In-Between Years - Part 24: Conclusion and calls to action ", "Does my son carry the gene? Also is OCD correlated? His paternal great grandpa survived but his great grandpa's sisters and parents died of Huntington's. His grandpa and dad do not have Huntington's. His dad is only 26 and has never been tested. My son is 3. Could it be passed on? \n\nAlso, do people related to Huntington's get OCD? Because the surviving great grandpa and his dad have OCD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you! Huntington\u2019s disease can only be passed from generation to generation. If his grandpa for sure does not have it then there is not way your son\u2019s father or your some could have it. His grandpa not having it would have stoped it from being passed down If his grandfather does not/did not have Huntington's, then it is nearly impossible that your son has it. It is an autosomal dominant disorder, so the only way your son could carry/have the disease-causing allele (an expanded version of the huntingtin gene which we all have normally, just with a \"normal\" amount of repeats) is if either of his parents has the expanded/disease causing allele and passed it to him. It only requires this one expanded copy to cause the disease (unlike diseases like cystic fibrosis that need two recessive copies, one copy from each parent, to cause disease). The only way his father could have passed it along is if he got it from one of his parents. Since you have said that your son's grandfather does not have HD, if you know this for sure, then there is basically zero chance your son could have it. There is an extremely small chance that the expanded version can arise spontaneously in families with no history due to mutations over time, but the chances of this happening out of the blue is so unlikely that I would not worry about it. \n\nAs for OCD, there are a wide variety of mental health symptoms that can be manifested as a result of the disease, and this is technically one. However, based on the info you have given, it is probably not connected to HD. Hope this helps.\n\n***Keep in mind that I am not a medical/mental health professional, so while I am sharing what I know, I am not an expert by any means :) Thanks you all !! &lt;3 Thank you ! \nThere is a very common symptom called perseveration which is similar to, but different from OCD. \n\nWith OCD there is typically a physical component like obsessive hand washing, or needing to touch door knobs that you walk past. Or always doing things in the exact same order.\n\nPerseveration is totally mental. Their mind gets stuck on an idea and cannot let it go, but keeps coming back to it again and again. My mom currently has HD and one of her first symptoms we noticed was OCD.", "A survey on the impact of HD on life.  I am sorry, I am not great at titles, basically this is a survey for people who have had Huntington's disease impact them in some way.", "Has anyone done prenatal testing, received a positive result, and proceeded with the pregnancy? This seems very frowned upon within the HD community, and I am new to this so please forgive my ignorance. My intention is not to argue, just understand. The genetic counselors basically refused to do the test until I said that I would terminate because of a positive result. I am trying to understand, why would it be so terrible if the child's father and I knew he was positive? The issues the genetic counselor brought up:\n\n1. Taking away the childs right to find out later in life- we obviously would not tell him or anyone else\n2. We would treat him differently- I cannot see how?\n3. Health insurance or life insurance coverage. We are in the U.S. so this is the most compelling argument to me. \n\nAny feedback is much appreciated. I dont want to judge, I just dont understand: why would you do this to a child? Having to live with this diagnosis must be a terrible burden. Do you mean for us, the parents? Why would you want to pass on this horrible disease? I do not think I could forgive my parents if they knowingly passed it on to me. \n\nWhat is even the point of prenatal testing if NOT to terminate?? Do you mean for us, the parents? As an adult, the child would have to decide for themselves if they wanted to be tested. This is not something I have decided to do, I am just trying to understand why it would be so terrible. The entire HD community seems to be in agreement- do not test unless you plan to terminate. My HD+ partner is not of that mindset. He is in favor of testing. He thinks that a CAG 40 is a very different situation than CAG 50. When we brought this up to the counselors, they said, the number does not matter, HD is HD. I was under the impression that the number tells us something about the age of onset, which I believe correlates to quality of life. I mean why would you bring a human being into this world that has to live with such  a diagnosis? I guess my question is: why would not you terminate if the test was positive? I suppose because I am 16 weeks pregnant and cannot bear the thought. However, I guess that is the way we are going. Ok thanks for the reply I would think about the kid (who will some day be an adult) and their right to have sovereignty over their own genetic information. Secrets have a way of making their way out into the open and it could feel like a very real betrayal if a kids positive gene status was known and later revealed to them after years of secrecy. \n\nThe insurance question is also a very real one. Our health care system is constantly in flux and we have no clue what the landscape of insurance will look like in a few years, let alone when your kid is grown. Testing the fetus, having a gene positive result on file, and continuing on with the pregnancy potentially places your child in a sticky situation in the future. \n\nFor me the biggest question is this: If you would not terminate either way, why test? Based on what I have read, the CAG repeat length correlates to age of onset, so is not a CAG 40 very different from a CAG 55? My partner is CAG 40, his dad was CAG 43, started having symptoms in his 60s, and passed away at 79. When I mentioned this to the genetic counselor, she said it does not matter, HD is HD. It seems to me, it would make a difference if we are talking about someone who may have symptoms in 20 years rather than 60 years. Sounds like maybe I am putting too much importance on the number. The CAG repeat number often correlates to age of onset, but it is different in different people. \n\nWhy do you want to know your future child's CAG repeat number? I, too, would have a very very hard time terminating a pregnancy that was HD+ (I also have 40 repeats), so I place no blame there. I mostly think you should examine why you want to know? This little being already exists and will hopefully be a fully formed adult one day. His CAG repeat number is already determined. The decision whether information about his body is known or not is his own. Please reach out to your genetic counselor today.  Based on reading this and your last post, you need to sit down and have a very serious talk with the counselor and your partner right away and before the amniotic fluid is drawn.  If you cannot terminate, and I totally understand that, you absolutely should not have the fetus tested.  If positive they will have this in their record for life.  They will be precluded from life insurance, long term care and long term disability.  They are potentially precluded from health insurance if Obamacare is ever fully overturned and you are making an already very difficult life for your child much much harder. I also understand what your are saying in the comments about CAG repeat but the onset and severity of symptoms is not a linear function of the CAG repeat.  Though studies have shown some  correlation it is not something that you can create a guaranteed time table around.", "HDBuzz - Huntington\u2019s disease research news.

TLDR: no official family history but I am having symptoms as is my cousin. Anyone else have a negative family history with an HD diagnosis?\n\nAlso real quick, this is not me asking IF I could have it, I can, I am just wondering if anyone here got a surprise HD diagnosis? I am doing okay with knowing it could be a possibility and I will know in a few months.\n\nMy dad has something neurologically wrong with him and is on disability but has not gotten a diagnosis. He is in his early 60s but symptoms started at least ten years ago. His personality has changed, and he has other symptoms. We do not have a family history of HD so he was not tested for it. His father is the one who would have had the gene and he died of a stroke in his early 70s. He might have had very minor symptoms prior to that but nothing big. My grandfather\u2019s sister died of \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s\u201d but that definitely could have been a misdiagnosis. His parents died of heart disease.\n\nSo why am I worried? I have HD symptoms at 34 (started like 8 years ago very mild) and have been tested for everything under the sun. \n\nFinally my new neurologist referred me to a movement disorder specialist in April. He briefly mentioned it could be a few things like a Parkinson\u2019s plus disease or a very rare genetic condition I.e. HD.\n\nMy cousin on my dad\u2019s side has similar symptoms. \n\nSo I am going to get tested in April probably. I am just curious has anyone else gotten this with no family history or maybe just some suspicious ailments but nothing diagnosed as HD in the family? This is not my situation, but my neurologist did mention that it is not uncommon for it to show up unexpectedly because the family member who passed it on died of something unrelated before showing clear symptoms. Might either of your grandparents fit that bill?\n\nAlso, adoption can be the reason for sudden appearance in families. Adoptions used to be more taboo, and sometimes a person would know they were adopted. Since HD in families can cause instability that might lead to surrendering a child for adoption, it is possible there are quite a few adoptees who are at risk. I know my own HD+ mother had two children she gave up in her teens, partially due to family instability caused by my grandfather's HD. Both of those people would be in their late 40s now with no idea they could have HD.\n\nI hope it is not HD, but either way, I am sorry you are dealing with this. My Mom was diagnosed with HD last year with no prior family history - both her parents lived into their 80's with no symptoms and none of her siblings have any either. I since tested positive for the mutated gene as well, so I knew I had a 50/50 chance but prior to my Mom's diagnosis our family had never really even heard of Huntington's.\n\nSo my results were not a surprise, but hers definitely were. It is definitely possible for you or your Dad to be the first in the family to show symptoms, it is not common but it is definitely possible.\n\nWhat type of symptoms are you experiencing? The HD test came out in the 1980\u2019s, so there might not be much official family history in some cases. I got tested and the only shock was the number from my moms side, since there is absolutely no family history there. The number is not high enough to get HD but it does mean it is expandable when I have kids. My dads side is a different story and not unexpected. ADHD and depression I have had for almost my whole life but both have gotten much worse despite medication. I had a neuropsychological test that found abnormalities like mild dementia, and I feel like my entire personality is slowly going away and replaced by extreme apathy. Chorea and/or dystonia, facial muscle spasms, action tremor, muscle stiffness. So yeah I am not really in for any good news no matter what it is but I am dealing with it okay. My regular doctor is really understanding and gave me anxiety medication. What stresses me out the most is my cousin and her kids possibly having it. Edit to add: I have had soooo many diagnostic scans, bloodwork etc all with negative results but never tested for HD. Thanks I appreciate it. Please understand that a HD diagnosis requires that you meet a very strict diagnostic criteria. Having \"HD symptoms\" is so broad and vague, that what you are experiencing is very very unlikely to be a spontaneous form of HD. The symptoms you describe do not sound like HD, it is unlikely that your physicians suggested this, and I am unsure why you believe that a HD diagnosis is likely. There are many other possible explanations for what you are experiencing, and I would suggest talking to a neurologist to probe potential differential diagnoses and appropriate next steps in testing and treatment. Well I hope you find an answer and effective treatment, but hope it is not HD.", "Will there ever be a cure/treatment that will stop symptoms before it gets to me? I am 14. My mom is 41 and is starting to show a personality change, my grandmother started showing symptoms at around 50ish, my great grandmother has it but is 79. We are not close with her so I do not know her progression. I do not know if I have it but the thought is killing me. It is all I think about and I have cried 3 times today I sure hope so but there is no definitive answer.  You have better chances than a lot of people due to your age but there are no guarantees or answers.  I do want to suggest that you find a professional to talk to about this. I wish I could give you a huge hug as I have been there along with many others.  I found out when I was 13 that my father was positive.  I am 40 now and still untested. I let it worry me for decades.  It controlled my life in a lot of aspects and no good came out of worrying over it.  It was consuming for a long time.  I wish someone convinced me to seek therapy years ago.  Weather you have it or not, you are alive and healthy today.  Do not let the disease take more than what it is able to and at all costs do not let it consume you.  It is been a fight for me.  It likely will be for you too but you you have to be in control of it.   Get involved with the community.  Maybe help your family cope.  Maybe look at getting into genetics as a career and do something about it.  Be the cure we all want!\n\nAnother thing,  do not worry about twitches, ticks, weird body stuff, and extreme emotions.  Everyone has them.  I have convinced myself I was showing symptoms many times due to me having a very short fuse.  I have been the same asshole for 30 years (Ask my wife!) and I currently do not show any definitive signs.  If my short fuse or other odd neurological stuff was a tell I would have died of HD 15 years ago.  Hell my wife has worse involuntary body movements and bumps in to more shit than I do!  If you start falling down walking on a daily basis however,  maybe go see the doctor.  Much love young friend. HD researcher here. There are a lot of potential therapeutics in the pipeline. Some seem promising, some failed and need to be optimized (ASO lowering therapy from Roche or Waves). I do believe without being overly optimistic that some treatment that will slow the disease will be developed in the next 10 years. If you want to help, you can give blood sample to HD biobank. Depending on where you live, you can contact the HD Society of Canada or America to have more info and attend some online seminars providing scientific updates. You can maybe help raising awareness or funds. It can make a huge difference! As crazy as it sounds, the HD research field is small and finding funding is not always easy for researchers. I cannot even imagine what you are going through but I know so many researchers are doing their best to find some treatments to help. Hi, I have noticed a few posts from you over the last few days. While this sub and other forums are helpful, please please please seek out a therapist. Huntington\u2019s is a special kind of hell and this is an incredible amount of stress for you to be facing. That being said, generally you will experience symptoms on a similar timeline but not always. CAG repeat count is loosely correlated to onset age but not always. To be completely transparent with you, I am not holding out hope for a cure anytime soon. So many drugs go to phase I/II but are stopped for lack of efficacy.  Everyone in this community flips out when any mouse model data are released but it is challenging to translate to human trial. HDBuzz is a good site to keep up on the latest developments, and HDSA is a good resource if you are in the US. I would like to emphasize again that it will help you in the long run to seek therapy. Testing is a personal choice, but it will give you the ability to better plan your life and you will never have to live with the lingering stress of \u201cwhat if\u201d. Even if you do have Huntington\u2019s, you can still live a fulfilling life. At 14 it can be hard to see the forest for the trees (I am not trying to be condescending, I am speaking from my own experience), and what you feel now is very valid. You will likely experience the whole spectrum of grieving, and it will come and go at times. Right now it is still so fresh, and there are so many unknowns in your life. Know that the sea of emotion will calm in time. It will get rough again, but you are not doomed. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nIf you need someone to talk to or help finding resources please feel free pm me (now or in the future).

When you are older, you will be better with dealing with the scary stuff and there may even be a cure! Enjoy your childhood, you have got a long time before you need to worry about this and you may not even carry the gene. Any recommendations on the best place to donate to? HD society? Donate samples (blood/sperm) or money? But in both case, it makes sense to contact the HD Society to have the relevant info depending on your situation and location. Thanks for being willing to help :) Dealing with HD in your family can be tough!

He feels like that way he will still be able to keep hope if the test comes back negative and my mind can be at ease with having a HD-free baby.\n\nFor some reason this decision, one that would ultimately work for me, does not make me feel any better at all! I cannot help but feeling like he is the only one compromising here. My mind automatically goes to the worst case scenario of testing my 10 week old fetus and finding out in the same day that I have to terminate my pregnancy and that my partner has HD. If this were to happen, what is to keep him for feeling overwhelming resentment towards me?\n\nThen, I feel so guilty for even obsessing over this when this is something that he has had in the back of his mind since he found out he could potentially have HD.  Overall I am feeling like a crappy person and partner. \n\nIt is helpful to be here. Just concentrate on being happy, do not let that HD crap steal your sunshine, you really cannot worry about what may be, be proactive and keep happy \u2764\ufe0f I think choosing to terminate a pregnancy in this situation would be extremely traumatic for you both. Have you considered waiting a few more years to learn more about the treatments in trial? For example, if the trials are successful, your partner might not be as worried about learning how status and so you may be able to pursue IVF more easily. You are not crappy, these are difficult decisions, and sometimes you probably feel like you are choosing the best bad decision, and whatever you choose to do, it feels like the wrong decision. Being with someone that might have HD is difficult. You want to know if they have it, because it effects both of you, but its their choice to get tested, and you also know you dont have the right to make them get tested, or influence their decision. Its hard to talk about, and sometimes you just want to live in the moment, and to not remind your partner about their potential condition, but when you worry so much and pretend you are ok, it feels like you are not being true to yourself or your partner. Its not like cancer. If you thought you had cancer you would go to a doctor straight away to prevent it, but if you have HD, there is not much you can do right now and that is why people do not get tested, but that effects potential partners. Its a very unique disease in that sense, most people want to know if they have a disease, but most people wait as long as possible to get tested for HD. You are not  a crappy person, you are just worried about the future. If it makes you feel better, you are much less crappier than I am, I am sure of it. I feel like if you do not know if your partner has it, then what you have stated is probably the best option, but its very difficult. You are future children, and  your partner might not have to worry as there could be better treatment soon, but its hard to know for sure and it could take 2 years or more to actually see if treatment works. You are not a crappy person, you are not selfish, you are just having a hard time making decisions in a difficult situation. I wish you all the best. Thank you for this! You are not crappy or crazy.\n\nThere is no good option. My brother has not tested (yet) and his wife got oops pregnant last year. They chose not to test the baby because they could not face termination. By that point they had already fallen in love with their son. To say nothing of the finding out about your spouse in the same day! \n\nI tested positive (but am doing better now than I was before I knew) and just did IVF to have kids with my husband. So my kids (twins) are safe, but 1 it is hella expensive and more than we budgeted for (no one said how long after implanting we would have to stay on expensive drugs, plus more embrios then included in the package so we have a $5k bill!) And all the shots and procedures, even when well tolerated suck. And if not we will tolerated, well hormones will wreck you. No one wants to do it. \n\nOf course you could adopt - but most people do not realize how long an expensive it is. And heart breaking if a match mom changes their mind or you got through foster and the parent gets their act together. \n\nNo good option. Not one. Huntington's is gut wrenching and destructive of families.\n\nBut for future discussion you may want to remind him if you do test the baby and it tests positive he is effectively been tested - and on top of that misery you would be terminating a wanted baby. It is way better to test, with therapist support when ready. (Also if you both are not in therapy get into therapy. It really helps). I am so sorry for your situation. We found out that my mother-in-law had Huntington's 2 weeks before I gave birth to our first child. Two months later we found out my husband was positive. He decided to take the test so we could be aware for our daughter and future children. \n\nWe are considering IVF for our next child and have decided we will try naturally if that does not work out. Our genetic counselor assured us that even if our daughter has it there would be a cure or treatment out for her by the time she shows symptoms. \n\nThis is your choice. I will not tell you what to do. But I will say I am so glad I had my baby, Huntington's or no Huntington's. She is the light of our life and has given us a reason to get out of bed and keep pushing. I do not know what the future holds for her but I have hope that the medicine will be there when we need it. I do not have any other choice than hope for that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is cord blood storage. There is a lot of developing research out there with cord blood, stem cells, and Huntington's. It is all very promising. I would recommend storing it if you have any concern. It gave us a a peace of mind before we even knew if my husband had it or not. \n\nBest of luck. Your feelings are totally valid. My boyfriend is going through the testing right now (his mom has it) and we have had those same conversations! My problem with the PGD (in my own opinion and beliefs) was that I read they destroy the embryos that are positive. And to me, while I absolutely do not want my children to have to worry about HD, still consider the embryo my child. (Once again totally just my own opinion no judgement towards anyone who thinks otherwise!) it is such a hard decision to make, and also with testing the fetus, if you did not terminate the pregnancy, there is debates on if it infringes on the child\u2019s right to decide for themself if they want to be tested or not.\n\nYou are not alone and whatever you decide is up to you guys and you alone, everyone is situation is so different. You are not crappy you are wonderful Hi there, new to the sub. I am childfree myself (upcoming tubal ligation) but you should know that trials are going VERY well. My mother is part of a trial study at Columbia in NY where she gets gene suppressants.

The NZ Huntington's Disease Association homepage's last newsletter update was in 2012... Am not sure where to ask for help and advice for living with HD in NZ specifically. Any help would be appreciated I am in America, but maybe this is a good place to start?\n Where do you live? In new zealand I mean You should talk to whomever tested and diagnosed your mom. If they are no longer practicing medicine, they will recommend an esteemed colleague. Thank you for this! Auckland! \n\nThe Auckland association has a lot going on. They work with Dr Richard Fall at Auckland Uni to do loads of research involving HD patients and their families. \n\nThe Auckland association used to have a counsellor and a social worker, I am sure they still do. \n\nI would contact the Auckland office and see what help you can get. \n\nI am HD gene positive myself my father and uncle and grandfather had the disease and my brother is currently symptomatic in the early stages and I have had a lot to do with the Auckland HD Asso over the years.

", "New here, hoping for some advice Hello everyone, my name is James and Huntingtons has ran in my family for as long as I can remember. My great grandmother and her son, my grandfather both passed away from it. My mother is in the later stages of dealing with it as well. \n\nI am 34 and worried I may have it also. I am married to my wonderful wife and we want to have kids. I am afraid to get tested because in my mind that would change everything. I do not know if I could have a child knowing they may get this from me if I test positive. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with this kind of situation? Get tested. It is always better to know. I disagree. There are options! Lots of good info out there, here is one article that goes over some current options for family planning with hd risks: ( Thank you! I really need this. I would not even know where to start if I wanted to get tested. Maybe my primary care provider? Talk to your mom\u2019s HD doctor. This is such a hard and personal question! I am similar to you, 33 and really want to get pregnant. I was 100% against getting tested up until a few months ago, because I did not want to live my life with that hanging over my head. My husband is super supportive with whatever decision I make. \n\nI very recently changed my mind. I truly believed that the Roche study was going to be our cure, and have really struggled with the trial being cancelled. But it also made me realize that I want more control over my life. I am getting tested so I can make informed decisions about parenting and use IVF or foster care if possible. Have you heard of CureHD? They provide stipends to help potential families pay for IVF so you can make sure your future children are HD negative (you can also apply without being tested, FYI. My untested brother was just approved for one of their grants). Most importantly, I want to get involved in any clinical trial possible! To me, this feels like actively fighting against the disease instead of just letting it take over me. \n\nI am going to my first genetic counseling appointment this morning. I am lucky to live 20 mins from a HD center of excellence, so today I meet with the genetic counselor and the social worker and the doctors to discuss family planning, financial issues to work through, dealing with the future etc. After all that, if I still feel good about it, I will get tested and go back for the results in 2 weeks. \n\nI think this is such a personal journey that is impacted by thousands of different factors. I hope, whatever you choose, you are able to find peace and happiness. Feel free to message me if you ever want to talk to someone going through the same thing. This disease can feel very isolating because very few people truly understand how serious and shitty it is. Thank you for sharing your journey so far. I hope the best of luck for your upcoming appointments! \n\nI have not heard of CureHD but that sounds like a great program for people like us who are worried about having children. Thank you for recommending it! Sorry, it is actually called Help Cure HD. The correct name would probably be helpful if you want to look into it :) Welcome to the forum!! There are resources like Phil's Kids which help people have kids who are at no risk of having HD by doing IVF. If you are in Ontario you can qualify for a free round too. There are options if you do test positive!!", "Help, please! Hi guys, I am in desperate need of advice for my dad who is a carer of his girlfriend with HD. \n\nWe all currently live under the same roof: My pregnant self, my partner, dad and his partner (We will call her J from now on just to keep things simple). We are trying to move out ASAP for many reasons, ultimately for baby because the stress here is unfathomable and there will be no room when they arrive. If I could pick up my things and move out today just to get away from this situation, I would do so in a heartbeat.\n\nJ has been on a quick steady decline since the beginning of lockdown and more recently in the past few months has declined a lot quicker. Every day J enters psychotic episodes for hours on end wailing and screaming about how we do not care and everything is our fault which is unequivocally false, our worlds have to revolve around her. She is set off by the tiniest things, for example in the 27\u00b0C heat last week, we could only have the windows open a crack because she thinks she is cold when actually she cannot regulate her body temp and is sweating uncontrollably. Unsurprisingly she had heat stroke the next day. We are all kept under her thumb, we cannot do anything without it causing a meltdown.\n\nJ is a position where she clearly needs care from a supporting agency or dare I say it, needs to be in a home but dad will not chase up Social Services from their last meeting in Feb saying they would send a carer round while he was at work, after that meeting all correspondence with them stopped and J has certainly declined further since then.\n\nMy dad has just accepted that this is how she is now and is on the edge of a carer breakdown. He does not care about the state of the house (my partner and I try to keep on top of things as much as possible but we worry about how things will be when we leave), he is given up caring about himself too, it is almost like he is just trying to get to the end of the day from the moment he wakes up.\n\nEvery time I try to light a fire up his butt for him to get some support and make a log of everything J does as supporting evidence, I am shrugged off and he deals with it by making jokes or huffing and walking away, he will not help himself or us. Our collective mental health is in tatters, all of us suffering with depression, I have an existing anxiety disorder too which has been made worse by constant daily howling and pregnancy hormones, it is getting harder and harder to maintain a sound mind.\n\nApologies for the long post, but any advice on what to do, how to get him to seek help would be greatly appreciated because we are all at breaking point here :( HD has many faces and I hope j is seeing a HD specialist as being on medication can make a unlivable situation livable!! And we have been there and now situation is so much better. Please push for j to go to an HD center I hate to see her have to suffer and believe me she is not just the people around her\u2764\ufe0f god bless your dad it is as cruel road but one we all take at some point in our life cycle Call the equivalent of 911 in your Country. Ask for a welfare check from EMS next time she is in a psychotic episode and/or insisting it is cold when it is hot. Then have a copy of this post printed off and GIVE IT TO EMS. Tell them you fear an imminent family catastrophe could occur due to her psychotic episodes and your pregnancy. (Unless u are just disparagingly calling her psychotic and she is not measurably psychotic by a medical professional during these episodes.) Tell them you fear for everyone is safety in the house. The more your Dad enables her - the more combative &amp; frightening her behavior could escalate. Tell EMS when they get there she needs hospital evaluation as most psychotic episodes DO. Tell them you all almost died of heat stroke because of  J's medical issues and that you are very concerned for her and your whole family - especially the unborn baby. At the hospital get social workers involved to see how much &amp; what kind of care you guys can schedule for J on a recurring basis. Follow up on that planned care DAILY until it arrives. \n\nBut also evaluate how much your own medical/pregnancy/anxiety is contributing to your own suffering. If you need a break from the volatility of the house - take one. You and your partner could go camping for a week or to a staycation at an area hotel. If your Dad needs a break - and it sounds like he does - give him one. Offer to care for her while he has a night out once a week. \n\nBut ultimately - you are moving out. Your baby is due soon and you will be removed from this circumstance. But remember your Dad when you do move out. Caregiver fatigue is REAL and can have devastating consequences. Care for him, too. We have no HD centers here, their first appointment with a HD charity in UK is in October and J has been diagnosed for 10+ years. There is little to no support for HD in the UK, it is sad but the funding just is not there, we are having to rely on the GP but again he is absolutely zero help.\nHe is a good egg, we are all trying to support him as much as possible in these times, he is a Saint in our eyes, just wish he had the strength to fight for more support from officials. You have got to get out as soon as you can. That is the only thing you can truly control in that situation. Thank you so much for your reply, will definitely keep that all in mind!\n\nWe are in the UK so I am not sure if it would be the same process via the ambulatory service or what they would actually be able to do, also dad is very reluctant to get any sort of emergency service involved. We have called 111 mental health services a couple of times when she is been in an episode and the support offered is little to none, if they felt it appropriate they would send out an ambulance but they never have.\nShe genuinely does go into these psychotic episodes, albeit she is not violent but once she is been triggered she cannot be brought out of them until she calms down and can stop of her own accord which can take anything from 45 minutes to 4 hours, multiple times a day.\n\nI am unable to care for J as she thinks I am the devil incarnate and simply will not let me, equally things have happened in the past (when symptoms were very mild, she was fully aware of what she was doing) and I am now diagnosed with PTSD because of the way she treated me so it would be impossible for me to be able to care for her. My anxiety around her is extremely high, I am unable to have eye contact with her or even look in her direction. Also she is my dad's girlfriend, no relation to me and I would not feel comfortable to help with bathing etc. She has never liked me from the moment she met me even though I have given her no reason to dislike me. \n\nMy dad is my top priority, despite everything that is happened and my personal opinion of J, I just want the best support for everyone. I do not want dad to burnout and be overwhelmed when he needs the support of outside agencies and equally, I do not want her to not receive the care she clearly needs. She is still able to do basic things but soon I can see she will not. It is going to be a very rapid decline now and just want things in place for dad so it does not crush him when it happens.\n\nApologies for the mini rant too, it felt like I gave a lot of excuses but that is why I need the advice because of our odd circumstances :( Trust me when I say my partner and I are doing everything I can do get us out ASAP, just want more support for dad and how to go about getting it.

I myself do not take it but I have spoken with folks who use a charity called Caring Solutions to help with their co pays. If you are in the states you should contact your local state chapter, they could most likely put you in touch with some resources.  It is a common medication used for chorea and the price is out of this world, over 3k for one pill. Common copays can be 1500 every month. It should be a crime. Fuck your countries medical policies and lack of care. I wish you all the best, friend. They wonder why so many of us kill ourselves... Yeah, Shared solutions is not working with Teva anymore so I applied for a grant from Healthwell, but so has everyone else. It is very frustrating.  I have had those plans often over the past two decades. And in recent times those thoughts have returned. I am not going to say dont do it. Just really think it through. Really think about it.

Anyone out there have any experience with this that could share some insight?\n\n He is saying that I am not being proactive enough to combat against onset. Meanwhile, I have been tested, have a neurologist, go out of my way to maintain a healthy lifestyle, take supplements and even participate in HD trials. In my opinion I am doing all about all that I can do. I am not sure how the courts are going to see this but needless to say it is more than stressful and I am more than scared. Again if anyone has been here before please let me know what if anything I can do. How old are you? How old is your child?  In what way are you not being proactive by his argument?  What exactly are you supposed to do?  There is diet and exercise, but beyond that what does he want?  Does he expect you to slow it down by sheer force of will?   Hey\nI am also positive and pre-symptomatic.\n\nObligatory IANAL and this is just my experience, I am also in the UK, so YMMV\n\nI separated from my son's mother last year, she has used the diagnosis as a weapon in any and every arguement over the last few years, part of the reason we are no longer together.\n\nIn the UK, informal family arrangements are preferred to court proceedings so whilst I basically have full custody, whenever she has wanted something, or felt like she is not getting treated fairly she will play this card about me being a diseased spastic etc etc and how she has apparently spoken to a lawyer and could take the kids away from me in a heartbeat .\n\nI have spoken to a lawyer and social services and also the national HD charity who all think she is either misinformed, or misinterpreted something she is been told.\n\nAs it is been explained to me it would require a court order to remove the children from my care and they would look at what you are capable of doing. So in order to take custody away they would have to demonstrate that you are incapable or pose a specific risk to your kids.\n\nIn terms of primary and shared custody they should look at the overall picture as to what is best for the children, where they should stay and when the other parent should see them.  Idk if you are in the US, but there seems to be less consistency between states as to how they prioritise and reach that decision.\n\nHaving no symptoms means that the HD should not come into that decision just now. If there is a point where you are symptomatic before your child is older, then it would be taken into consideration, but it would not immediately label you as incapable of looking after a child.\n\nI hope he is just trying to use it to hurt you, people are shot. I  would suggest contacting a lawyer and local family services and the HDSA for advice though.\n\nAs for not being proactive enough, does he have something specific that he expects it knows would make things better?  Please ask him to share this wisdom with the world, along with evidence. \n\nI hope you get this sorted. Best of luck .\n\n man  I am so glad your condition has not been used against you in the custody issue.  I think it happens in the US sometimes, and then what recourse does someone have?  HD certainly sounds horrible, because it is, and it can sound scary if that is how someone wants to frame it.   Thanks,\n\nI am sure if i had shown any symptoms then it would be considered, but at this stage it does not affect my being able to care for the kids. \n\nThe system here is quite good for looking at capability rather than labels.", "Asissted suicide... How common is it for people people this disease to do asissted suicide. My dad has it and he was thinking about doing this. Since it is getting pretty bad and he does not want to live like this. What would be the conditions for this? I did not even know this was an option honestly. It depends on the country. It is illegal in many places. There is about 10 states that supports the DWD (death with dignity)\n Approximately half of all people with HD commit suicide via some way. Of those that are legally assisted I am not so sure, at least here in USA.\n\nThere is some other aspects of your question that are difficult to answer. My wife used to always talk about assisted suicide before she got sick, but since she started symptoms around 4 years ago she hasnt mentioned it once Where did you get that stat about half of people with HD commuting suicide from? Tbh idr. Some source when I was researching HD, this was a few years ago. They HD doctors in states with a DWD act cannot do it. The disease itself is not terminal, like cancer is. The way the laws are written they can only assist with actual terminal disease.

Because I know how scared of the answer she is, after all there was a reason she put it off for so long..\nAnything input is appreciated! It is a personal decision and I would not pressure her.\n\nIf you are interested in her prognosis in terms of yourself, you can always go get tested yourself, assuming you are over the age of 18. I am not actually pressing her on it, it is just that she is started showing potential symptoms and her life situation also changed dramatically (no more Partner or house (sold)). So now is the time she could still make plans for the future, both fun and serious (health pro-causations etc).\n\nAs for myself, it is not that important to me at the moment, I am 20, I also feel there is a good possibility this might not be as much of a death sentence once I get to that age.. I would not pressure her. The easiest thing is to get yourself tested since you are of age. Perhaps she does not want to get tested for the same reasons you do not. If you do not want to get tested, you should be understanding of why she would not want to either.\n\nIt is never too early to make plans for the future. She does want to do it now, I never pressured her about it, we just talked.\n\nThe problem about getting tested myself is not only my worries about my possible future, I do think I want to know before having kids though. The problem is also that a positive result for me would mean a 100% positive result for her too, so I could get tested and then not tell her? That is not right either..

I am 24 and expecting to start showing symptoms at 28/29. Since HD is a terminal illness, I believe I could pull the Accelerated Death Benefit on a whole life insurance policy. Does anyone have experience doing this? I believe I could buy a few (2-4) life insurance plans and get the death benefit in a year when I do an official test for HD with my name on it. I could draw the $1m lump sum and pay back the premiums in a lump (I saw this would net $400k per $1m policy). I am thinking of leaving the money to my wife and kids, obviously, and use some of the money to live up my life before I get HD symptoms. Does anyone have experience/advice gaming life insurance or disability insurance for having terminal illness?  This could be considered insurance fraud so I would not recommend discussing this in an open forum. I would expect signing up for multiple policies would be a red flag. In addition, if either of your parents have been diagnosed with HD then you cannot lie about that and doing so would invalidate your policy.

I am really scared and sorry if this post sounds stupid but symptoms seem to match to early Huntington signs. Check with a doctor. That could be caused by a number of things. Hi, its highly unlikely that your symptoms are HD.  Having no obvious family history makes inheriting HD quite unlikely and getting HD at a young age would almost always mean a strong history of HD,  as in one of your parents being heavily symptomatic with HD already.

Turns out I would gladly spend my life in that pain just to see her again. I am currently going through this exact same thing. The want to be close but far away at the same time is so difficult. Being around it constantly is so much harder than it seems when you usually live far away. I hope it gets better for you as well. I am in the thick of it with my husband, who has middle-late HD. Usually we have aides come in and I go to work. Now we are stuck in an apartment together. \n\nAll I can say is that for myself, things got better for both us when I stopped trying to distract myself with my phone, netflix, etc. Once I started facing my feelings head on and being as present as possible everything started to improve. Both of our anxiety levels started to cool down and we are doing OK. \n\nIt is still super shitty sometimes! But for me, living with the reality of the here and now has been better than my attempts to escape. \n\nI wish you both the best, I know how hard this is. My parents both had dementia and now my husband. It is very, very sad to live with.", "I am kind of an island and I do not know what to do. Hi! Back in 2009 I was tested for HD, and the test came back positive. My familial history, as well as my CAG repeats, indicates that I will not start seeing symptoms until later in life, so I think (and hope) I am okay right now. \n\nMy main issue is that I have absolutely no idea what I should be doing. No one at risk in my family will get tested, or even talk about it, and I do not know anyone else who is gene positive. I have never really talked to a medical professional about it. Am I supposed to be seeing a neurologist? Someone else? Or should I just keep sitting here, hoping that I am not showing subtle symptoms of it? Connect with the local HDSA, they will be able to put you in touch with a social worker and neurologists who can track the progression. Ideally you should start annual appointments to set a baseline on your cognitive and movement symptoms.\n\nThey can also put you in enrollHD, a long term obeservational study that can help you become eligible for drug trials and other research. Get connected with a therapist and a neurologist before you need it. Take things like vitamin e and fish oil that are good for general brain aging to possibly postpone onset.\n\nEnjoy the time you have. For the love of dog, stay away from alcohol. The comments so far are good for sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was diagnosed in 2013 I had the same thoughts and concerns. Eventually I got connected with a local HD chapter in my state. I go once a year for a Neuro exam just for monitoring of baselines. I am fortunate enough to be close to an HD Center of Excellence. I am also in the EnrollHD trial. Hi, I would be happy to connect you with local resources, I work for HDYO my email is  there is plenty of support out there you just have to reach out I am near a HD Center of Excellence where I participate in the EnrollHD study. I am asymptomatic so I participate in the study annually. I have a neurologist there but I have never actually had an appointment with him since I am not experiencing any problems, yet. Same with a physical therapist. I do have a counselor that I see occasionally and I see my own primary care physician for regular appointments, non-HD related. \n\nI feel more overwhelmed by long-term planning, especially financial matters.", "NEW STUDY - DNA damage in HD patient blood Hey guys! New study found DNA damage in HD patient blood - shows the potential of blood for monitoring disease!\n\n(", "Tampa area? Does anyone have a referral to a care agency (home health care, residential, or respite care) in the Tampa area that has HD experience? The patient is currently at home, but her condition is deteriorating rapidly and we need respite ASAP. The others are so we can have options as she progresses. Thank you in advance for any assistance. Have you tried contacting the HDSA in Tampa? They might be able to point you in the right direction. I am coming into the situation late, so I honestly do not know who has been contacted. I will check. Thanks!", "Found out yesterday the disease runs in my family. So I learned yesterday that my uncle was diagnosed with HD. My grandmother is currently 90+ and has no signs at all, so we are guessing it is my grandfather... He died at 81 of something unrelated. He was never diagnosed with HD but apparently he had some unvoluntary movements in the arms, did not have good balance, and was quite irritable... altough some old people get more irritable with age.\n\nMy mother died at 53 of cancer, and, as far as I know, never had any signs of HD. She had brain cancer and died within less than a year of the first cancer symptoms... If she had HD, is it something doctors would have noticed while doing brain scans?\n\nI am going to get tested as soon as I can, but I really feel like shit right now to be honest. I cannot think of anything else and just keep googling symptoms and feeling worse. I do not have much advice, but am in a similar situation. My great uncle was recently diagnosed. My grandmother, his sister, is in her late 70s and may be showing some signs. My father is almost 60 with no symptoms. This came out of nowhere for my entire family - previous generations died young of other causes or showed no symptoms.\n\nI learned all this a week ago and have been on an emotional rollercoaster since. Going back and forth on testing, family planning, etc. All I can tell you is that I have felt very differently from day to day, hour to hour. There is a lot to consider around testing and I am not sure if I will get tested at this point in my life. But I am getting referred to a genetic counselor and would suggest you do the same - this is someone with deep knowledge of genetic conditions, how they are passed, your options, etc. I am finding some peace in just writing out all the questions I will ask them and being careful what information I consume from the internet.\n\nI am also getting set up with a therapist and, having used therapy in the past, would recommend considering that. It almost certainly cannot hurt and could really help you sort through what you are feeling. I just keep telling myself - nothing has changed for me yet and I do not have to make any decisions today. Breathe and take care of yourself. I do not have much advice on mental preparation, my only suggestion is to seek professional help so that together you can work out strategies for dealing with anxiety or mood but before you get tested I suggest getting life insurance, you will not be able to get it after you get tested if you are positive. Thank you. Honestly it is just mind blowing at this point, I was not expecting this at all... But honestly I do not see myself changing my mind on getting tested. I am in the \"planning\" stage of my life (house, kids, etc.) so I feel like I need to know to prepare correctly. I also feel like living in uncertainty will just eat away at me forever. Not that knowing how I will end up when older will be that much better but at least I will be able to plan accordingly.\n\nTake care. Yeah ok I guess I could get a life insurance, altough I do not know how it really works here compared to the USA (I live in Canada, Quebec) Canada passed the ( in 2017, thankfully. Essentially this protects your privacy regarding your results. You are not obligated to disclose your results to an insurer or employer. \n\nTo be honest I am still a little unsure of whether or not an insurer could adjust your rates if you did choose to tell them you are positive. I have heard some people say that is still legal while others disagree. I would highly recommend not disclosing your results just to be on the safe side; once you do you cannot take that back My mom was is this spot because her grandparents hid it. She was diagnosed in her 60s. I did found some cousins with it and confirmed by talking to some DNA matches. For several cousins they also showed signs in 60s and the mother of one DNA match got signs in 50s sped up by a stoke. I would test as soon as possible if you have kids or plan to. Since am not carrying children I will not pass it on so I do not feel a need to test. Am actually trying to trace it back farther then my 2nd great grandparents. I can think of an aunt (in her 60s) that really changed mentally in the last years. She is almost a completely difference person and it weirded me out. So I am pretty sure it is huntington's... She also has weird upper body movements sometimes.\n\nIt is been a while since my mother has died from cancer, but I really cannot think of anything that changed in her emotions/physic before she started getting very affected by her cancer.\n\nI am trying to stay hopeful, but it is really hard. You might look at therapy or even a Huntington's support group I think the group is free. In Canada you will not be asked about your gene status or whether you have had predictive testing done, but you will be asked if either of your parents has been diagnosed with Huntingtons chorea. It is probably safer to look into insurance before testing, but legally your test results cannot be used by an insurance company, and in your situation since neither of your parents have been diagnosed you can honestly answer no to the HD question.\n\nI am in Canada as well, and had a similar situation to you when my Mum had a surprise diagnosis. I already had life insurance at that point, but if I had not her diagnosis would have precluded me from reasonably priced insurance or possibly any insurance. I got insurance for my child before I tested, but they only asked whether I or my wife had been diagnosed *not* whether we had been tested or out gene status.", "my gran has huntingtons - do i need to tell a potiential employer? oh and her brother had it and her mum before they both died. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy mum wont get tested so its up to me if i do or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbeen trying to find information on how the testing can affect you looking for jobs or if you have to tell your employer? I am U.K based.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njust not finding info how genetic testing could affect me negativly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmany thanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; Hey my boyfriend (U.S.) got tested anonymously under a fake name so an employer could not hold it against him. The genetic counselor helped him make that decision too so I suggest you see if that is an option. I think there is legislation in the works that will prevent employers from discriminating but not sure. I hope so but we would rather be safe than sorry. \n\nMuch love.  Unless there is some bizarre law in the UK that says you have to disclose your medical history to an employer, I would say no as long as you are not trying to join the military. You should not need to disclose it unless you are obviously symptomatic (which I assume you are not, given that you are talking about getting tested).\n\nI have recently had to speak to my manager about it, just due to the fact that I need time of for appointments and stuff (both for myself and my mum), but I have been here 2.5 years, and only recently had any of it come up. ", "How to go about getting tested? So I am at risk and I am starting to get to the point where I want to know if I have HD or not. I am 23 and I am about to start my doctorate in physical therapy in the summer/fall. I keep acting/feeling like I have it so I never really picture my life passed 36 (when my grandpa and mom started their symptoms). I hate this feeling and I want it either gone or confirmed. My grandmother is also very controlling when it comes to me leaving the house/living my life outside of her and mom,  due to how my mom needs 24 hour care now. So like, I kind of feel like it would be nice to know if I have it that I can break away a bit so I can enjoy what life I can before I become sympathetic? I know that is not a very good reason but I feel like I am drowning living with them and it is not the main reason either. Long story short is how do I prepare before I am tested, like what do I buy or register for? What are good things to do to prepare before the official diagnosis? I do not have a primary doctor because I just got back from school and my old one retired, so who should I look for to get the testing done? I am in the Chicagoland area if that helps! Thank you all in advance! Hey there, first of all I am sorry that you are in the situation you are in. It is tough. I just got tested this year. I am sure that there are more ways to go about it than just one, but here is what I did. Luckily in the college town I live in there are a lot university-associated medical resources and it happens that there is an HD center of excellence. I found a contact email on their website and emailed them saying that my mom and my grandmother had HD and I wanted to be tested. They called me, and first I set up a consulting appointment with a doctor who is a specialist in these types of disorders. He talked a lot about the disease, current research, and what it means to get tested and how to interpret the results. After this visit I could schedule a blood test at a lab. I made sure to go to a lab where I felt like I had a better chance of keeping my results private  \u2014 the HD still isnt on my medical record, in fact. Anyway after the blood test I had a follow up appt at the same specialist\u2019s office, where he told me the news in person. I brought my boyfriend; they do not suggest you go to the appointment alone, to find out your results. It is best to have someone with you who will be supportive. Unfortunately my result was a positive. The doc explained the CAG number, and reminded me that there is no exact science that determines when symptoms will set in. Some people go their whole life without symptoms. Others, like your mom and mine, got theirs around age 35 and it got worse from there. For me it was extremely difficult for a couple of weeks after finding out my results \u2014 just feeling like in a dream, or just upset, unable to focus. But I feel better now. I think that knowing the diagnosis, even if it is a positive HD result, is better than the agonizing feeling of not knowing. At least now, I can try to live my best life with some urgency and try to take extra good care of myself. I appreciate my friends and family more and I tip better in restaurants, haha. Im sure that everyone is different, and you need to do what you feel is best for yourself. I hope that in sharing a bit of my experience with you, you have a bit more of an idea of what the process is like. Good luck, and know that you are not alone. Sending peace and good vibes your way. I went to a neurologist to get tested. After a couple visits and some tests to see it I was symptomatic he ordered the blood test. That was just drawn at a normal lab (quest) although there was some confusion about signatures and privacy and the sample expired and had to be drawn again and something else dumb happened. Eventually I went back to the neurologist for the results.\n\nDepending on your insurance you may be able to just google a local neurologist and \"self refer\" to them. Or you may have to see your normal Dr for a referral. Your normal Dr may be able to order the blood test anyway. Most sources for getting tested for HD (as well as other neurological diseases, I assume) will strongly recommend genetic counseling of some sort prior to testing. Here are some resources I found. Also, as a note, definitely start by checking out the ( I do not vouch for any one org, in particular, these are from Google searches.\n\nThere are a couple of options here:\n\n* (\n   * ( \\- Chicago\n   * ( \\- Peoria\n   * ( \\- Chicago\n* (\n   * There are (\n* Neurologist\n\nAt risk myself and my first inclination would be a Center of Excellence if there is one close to you. There also seem to be many ( around Chi-town, which you may find some benefit in attending. I have not been through the counseling, as I have not officially decided to get tested yet, so I do not know what it entails. I have read it can be around two weeks, it helps to prepare you to receive the results, positive or negative. Kudos to you for taking the first step and I wish you the best. &gt;I keep acting/feeling like I have it\n\nYeah you need to stop doing that, because it is causing you to see something that does not exist. Involuntary muscle movements are normal, you are probably causing them yourself due to stress, which is just becoming a feedback loop.\n\n&gt;I never really picture my life passed 36 (when my grandpa and mom started their symptoms)\n\nAgain, stop doing this. You have not been tested yet, so why would you have that pattern of thinking at all? Also individual differences are real, (if you test positive) your symptoms could develop at a later age.\n\nHonestly it sounds like that pattern of thinking is a good recipe for giving yourself anxiety/depression. When you get tested, if you do test positive and those thoughts continue you need to go to therapy. What you are describing is a common thinking pattern in a few mental disorders I can think of off the top of my head, any worthwhile therapist can treat this.\n\n&gt;My grandmother is also very controlling when it comes to me leaving the house/living my life outside of her and mom, due to how my mom needs 24 hour care now\n\nAre you being forced to care for your mother in a caregiver role?\n\n&gt;I can enjoy what life I can before I become sympathetic\n\nThis is a clear example of you exhibiting self-defeating thinking. I think I have said enough on that topic.\n\nThere is some philosophy on this subject, but that is a question you will have to answer yourself.\n\n&gt;I feel like I am drowning living with them\n\nYeah I definitely suspect that you are being forced to act in a caregiver role for your mom. What you are experiencing is called caregiver's fatigue.\n\n\n\n&gt;how do I prepare before I am tested/What are good things to do to prepare before the official diagnosis\n\nNot much to do really. You just need to mentally prepare yourself to actually make sure you go to the appointment.\n\n&gt;like what do I buy or register for\n\nSchedule an appointment at the same practice/hospital as your former PCP. Tell them your family history and your desire for genetic testing and they will take it from there (if they do not then get a new doctor). \n\nIf you do not have health insurance do the same but just go to a free clinic (should not be too hard to find since you live in Chicago). From there they should give you a referral/take it from there (if the clinic turns out to be shit and does not do this, go to another one). It is important to see a genetic counselor first. They can talk to you about obtaining life insurance. Good luck. ( is a Center of Excellence. The link will take you to a page that has contact information for testing. Best of wishes to you! Others have already posted good advice about testing, so I will focus on what really jumped out at me in your post.\n\n\\&gt; it would be nice to know if I have it that I can break away a bit so I can enjoy what life I can \n\nLet us say you are found to be negative. Why would that be any justification for allowing yourself to be smothered by your mother/grandmother? We all get just one life to live, and you or anyone could be hit by lightning, die of an aneurysm, get run over by a bus, tomorrow. Your sense of being overwhelmed is not a sign of weakness or selfishness or anything other than a red flag that you are being given more than you are able to handle, and you need to start putting yourself first--or it will only get worse from here. Now is the time to start looking into more home care for your mother, or having others in your family pitch in as well. You are 23. If you allow your 20s to be usurped by this rather than getting out there and enjoying your youth, you will spend the rest of your life regretting it. You are only young once. I was in a similar predicament, but older. I opted to get my testing done at UC Davis in Sacramento because they offer an anonymous option with a pseudonym and to be honest...I do not honestly believe that there is any reliable privacy in electronic medical records.   There is a number of folks I do not want to know, including the federal government who has broad oversight of my profession.\n\nIn any case, I highly reccomend the team at Davis.", "Genetic Counseling Has anybody had success in skipping genetic counseling? It seems to cost an extra $1000 on top of the actual blood testing. When speaking to Johns Hopkins in Maryland they say pre/post counseling is mandatory. I can see how it may be necessary or more recommended for some. But is this legal?  Is there a law requiring counseling? I wonder if I could get lawyers involved...I am only asking this because I have a great support/knowledge network between family/friends and the internet. I have been putting off testing for 17yrs. I get real serious about getting tested every 2-3yrs then I get turned off from the cost. If it was $1400 for only the blood testing I would have paid. I just dont like being forced to do anything. Its a principles thing I guess. And, no, its not some subconscious underlying fear or anything preventing me from getting tested. If i want counseling I will pay for counseling. If I want to pay for testing I should be able to pay only for testing.  Sorry, I can rant on this.. It just irks me! ... Thanks... When I went to start testing at a public university\u2019s teaching hospital, they insisted on a lot of counseling and I could not feasibly get a result for something like three months, and then I would have to go back in to receive the result with a counselor present. When my mother did a few years later with a private practice neurologist recommended by her PCP, they did it with no counseling at all, told her based purely on physical exam that she was likely positive, and told her they could give her the result over the phone when it was ready. Based on this, I think it varies pretty widely.  Great question. Looking forward to an answer. I do not know about laws but we were told my wife had to do counseling before she could be tested and I think it is partly to protect the geneticist from any sort of liability. When my wife went to counseling it was one session maybe 30 min. I understand your frustration though.  Yeah - Had to go through that as well.  I got lucky, my sister and I both tested at the same time and we got to 'group up' for the counseling portion.  So we still had to go to the counseling together, and they let it count for both of our Counsel Hours.  California. When my husband wanted to be tested (9 yrs ago) his PCP put in a referral to a local neurologist and was able to be tested thru neurology at his first appointment. He was not required to have genetic counseling. I think it generally takes about a month to get results back, and in his case he had to return for another appointment with neuro for results. Hopefully you are able to find a neurologist that actually has experience with HD, because that was not the case with his first one (who basically just did testing) and we ended up transferring to a neurologist at a teaching hospital with tons of experience and that has made a huge difference in his care. Best of luck to you and hopefully you will find a less stressful option. When I went in for the test, they only required I sit down for one  free 30 min  counseling session. The only thing I paid for was the blood test. It was all done anonymously as well. This was through my local HDSA chapter I did it all through kaiser, they were great and very fast. Covered by insurance  I was seeing a Neurologist for an unrelated condition and I requested the test. I explained that I have known about HD for my whole life and my mom is currently symptomatic. I told him I have done recent research on how the testing works and what the results mean and I have spent 20 years going back and forth on whether I wanted to test or not and I was finally ready, so I really did not want to do the counseling if it was not mandatory. He had me sign a release form and handed me the order for the lab. I was tested that day. You can get tested at UC San Diego for $400. This includes an intake interview which can be done over the phone, first appt with a counselor (this can be done via Skype for out of town folks), and an in-person visit to get the results. Of course, if you live quite far away, travel costs must be considered as well. It may behoove you to talk to a counselor...they go over topics like family planning, potential problems with insurance, current research, etc. Let me know if you have any questions!  In MA I could not find a way around going to a big HDSA Center of Excellence, they said the whole process: 2x therapist, neurologist, sign up for new PCP at their hospital, blood test, and end therapist appointments would take over 2 years. Also I live far away and did not want to pay for that many appointments. I ended up going to a random fertility clinic and they did the test for like $10 (copay w/ insurance) in 2 days. Highly recommend! Just bring a friend on Day 2, it is still a shock even when you know what is coming.  Thanks for that info.  I think that I need to try talking to my PCP. I wonder if it stays anonymous that way... This is really good to know! Dont know why I never thought of just talking to a neurologist.. I assumed it was a a very rare test to do and that you could only do it by looking at one of the centers of excellence on the HD website. Thanks sassy Wow, i would have expected the opposite all the way out there! Yeah I imagine it can go pretty deep., I started the insurance talks already back and forth through email with a rep before when I was about to get tested some time ago. That is the most confusing part. Thanks for putting yourself out there and i will let ya know if I do have any questions Sooo frustrating. I like the idea some posters suggested of going straight to a neurologist.  Nice. I do not have another sibling. I am from a franken-family of 2 adopted siblings and 3 step! I am goin solo on this one ha. Thank you!!!! I think this route will be my best bet sounds like a good state to be in. i know its not Maryland! Holy crap! wow. a fertility clinic.... I am checking this route out for sure. I will explore this and the neurologist route and see which works best. Thanks for sharing!!! No matter how confident you feel, they still need to be knowledgeable of your situation and confident that you are good to receive such info. Regardless of how good you think you are, they are providing life altering info that could make people feel like they have nothing to live for and do very awful things. They cannot have those acts falling back on them for improper handling of information or other suits sue-happy people would try. \n\nAlso, by principle, taking up a lawyer against the HDSA makes you an awful person. Some people are not as lucky as you to have a strong support system in place or the financial means to get tested etc. Please do not take these things for granted.  I am in Alabama and they require genetic counseling as well. 2 years ago, my sister did pre-counseling and had to do a questionnaire and they told her that it was their decision if she would get tested or not. A part of me understands this reasoning but I also believe that we should be able to make that decision for ourselves. I have not gotten tested yet just because of the cost for counseling and that I do not feel that I need it. It has taken me along time as well to come to the decision that I do want to know my results. I have heard that there are other places that you can go that will take the blood test for you and send it off to be tested but I do not know how well I would trust that process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my sister's results came back, they did not allow me in the room with her and my family while she received her results because I was at risk. I thought that was very harsh and I was alone in the waiting room while my family was with her.  I think I know where you stand if you think standing up for individual freedom is \"awful\" .. By principle, forcing control on a person is reprehensible. So I truly disagree with everything you said, but thanks for your input.  That is utterly ridiculous! wow. Silly, restrictive system if you ask me.  I had one neurologist yesterday tell me that he will not provide testing if I am asymptomatic. I really do not understand the logic of that. IMO we should be able to get the testing if we wanted, no questions asked. I am not sure if there is an age requirement there but in Alabama, you have to be 18* to get tested unless you are showing symptoms  Similar to sassypants, I also walked in and explained that I knew all about the disease for years. Had my blood drawn same day. I tested positive. No matter how much you know about the disease, I do not think any level of genetic testing would have prepared me to get a positive result. It is something you have to live with and accept.  Agreed. I was not at all prepared for my positive result and I do not think a counselor could have changed that.  VCU in Richmond has a Huntington\u2019s center and they offer compassionate care. I do not know how much they cover yet and if I can get away with skipping counseling. I do not have insurance and would love to keep it cheap. I will post back here when they get back to me.", "waiting, waiting, waiting I posted here a while ago before starting the process. I have now spoken to a social worker, a genetic counselor, a neurologist, and have drawn blood for testing.  \n\nThey say it will be 3 weeks for the test to be run, but another month afterwards to find an appointment and discuss results. I was wondering if anyone else is in the same shoes. For years I have been afraid or in denial, but now I want to get on with it and find out the truth! \n\nHow has your experience been with this? How have you kept busy and sane during the time before your results are ready? A lot of waiting. I had to draw twice for some reason that was never clearly explained.\n\nHope you get a negative! I am currently awaiting my first genetic councillor appointment next Thursday, then a psychiatrist appointment in late September, then two more appointments sometime after that with results at the final appointment. I feel a time crunch because I was about to start trying for a 2nd child right before we found out my Mum was HD+ with no family history.\n\nI have kept sane mostly by not thinking about it, and trying to do productive things when I do think about it. So I have read The In-Between Years and Inside The O\u2019Briens, and some caregiving information to hopefully help my Dad. But mostly I am trying to enjoy summer, spend time with my family and friends, keep active, and not think too much about it.\n\nHow have your appointments gone? How are you feeling about and dealing with the uncertainty? Thank you, me too, obviously!\n\nAnd maybe they had to retest or someone messed up the first try? They only take a small tube of blood so I doubt they have any left over after if that happens. Total speculation but I used to work in the lab and know it can happen! Wow, your hospital\u2019s process seems more intense than mine! And I am sorry to hear that the timing was so unfortunate. At least you know before trying for your second, and can either wait or have genetic screening. Though it is still more complicated than normal.\n\nI totally understand maintaining your sanity by not thinking about it. I was able to sit in denial for years and sleep soundly, but once I drew blood it got real very quickly and I am often thinking about it late at night. Not really afraid, but obsessed for the first time since I have known.\n\nMy appointments have gone pretty well! I think that since I had so much time to process it, I went through everything ten times in my head before I met the counselor. She told me about how the disease works, did a family history, covered privacy and protections under the law, then set up the blood draw immediately. It is a painfully slow process though, since I cannot imagine many other diagnostic tests taking 3 months start to finish. It is hard enough to work up the courage, and you have to maintain it for a whole quarter.\n\nI think I am dealing with the uncertainty by planning for the worst. I am naturally a problem-solver so it is pretty painful that I cannot do much. Thinking through insurance and long-term care since I know the facts about every other aspect of HD.  And whether it is healthy or not, I am assuming I have it and asking the genetic test to prove me wrong. Oh - and you may know or not, but I believe the final appointment at many places requires you to come with a friend of family member. I do not like it, but I am flying a family member out to do that last part with me.\n\nGood luck starting the process! Let us know how your first meetings go. It is scary in your head, but when you get to the office, they are very good at presenting the information in a calming way. Yeah, unless we were already pregnant I am told there is no way to fast track this process which normally takes 6 to 9 months altogether where I am. It will be ~2 months after my initial referral before my appointment next week. You are right though, if I would found this out right after a pregnancy rather than right before it would be a much tougher spot to be in so that is a positive.\n\nIt is good to hear the appointments are helpful, I think especially when you have decided you want to know they can seem like a frustrating roadblock. There is probably a lot of people less informed than us, or with less time to prepare, and I would imagine the counselling would be even more important for them.\n\nI am with you on the planning aspect and feeling stuck in the meantime. It seems like there is a lot I could be doing, but I am sitting in limbo right now waiting to find out what I should be preparing for. I have some insurance questions, though I am covered for life insurance, but beyond that it is just waiting.\n\nGood luck to you, I really hope for a negative result for you. 7 more weeks seems like holding your breath forever, but time has a way of flying by...especially in hindsight. I had to wait for a year because I was 18 and they wanted me to change my mind. I was focused on university and enjoyed having a pet around :)", "im so lost My life has recently been turned upside down and i am finally finding the courage to share my story. My dad was diagnosed with HD about a month ago, leading up to this none of my family even knew what this disease was. My dad was adopted when he was 2 weeks old, his birth mother did not provide any family medical history so we had no idea that we were at risk. Usually people see the disease throughout their family growing up and have fair warning that it might be something they have to cope with in the future. That Is obviously not the case for my family. \n\nMy parents have two kids. First there is me, i am 20 and then there is my younger brother who is 17. My brother is autistic and does not fully understand what is going on with my dad. It is extremely hard to try and explain why my dad, his favourite person in the world, is acting differently. I will be devastated if my bother carries the gene, he has gone through so much already in the last 17 years. I am praying that if either one of us has the gene it is me.\n\nThe hardest part of all of this is that my parents are blaming themselves for putting my brother and i through this. My dad keeps apologizing to me because he thinks its his fault. \n\nIt is so hard, i literally do not know how to cope. All of the people close to me keep telling me that everything is going to get better, but i know its not, i am just going to get used to it. Every time i mention something about having the gene all i get back from them is \"you do not have it, stop\" i do not know if this is them trying to be positive but its making it worse!! I want them to help me accept that there is a 50&amp;#37; chance is do.  i know it is not their job but i just want the support. \n\nI have gone to support groups but it is too much. I just get anxious and sad listening to other peoples stories. \n\nI am just venting at this point. I had so much i wanted to say but now i am all worked up and my thoughts are not clear.  I just laid down to go to sleep, so this will not say everything I wanted to say to you about this. But I could not go to sleep without saying SOMETHING to you.\n\nFirst off, I am so sorry you are going through this. It is not easy. And it will not get better. Not until they find a cure. But knowledge is power. Get involved in the HD community where you can. Learn about all the research that is happening. If you are up for it, participate in studies. Having the knowledge and tools will better help you in supporting your family as you watch your father go through this. Again, I am so sorry. I married into a family with HD. Did not know it till 2 years ago. My husband and I have 4 children. I am terrified for them. \n\nBut you cannot live everyday in fear. Take a deep breath. You. Can. Do. This. You can. Right NOW you do not need to do anything....just get your thoughts wrapped around this without wrapping stress in it too. You will know the next step to take after that. One day at a time!!!! \n\nAnd remember- while this community is not super active (on reddit), we are always here. I hope you can find some peace and rest tonight. :) I am so sorry that this happened to you. It is an awful disease and hard to explain to people who think they know what they are talking about. It is not going to get easier, but the important thing is staying together with the rest of the family while you all figure this out. My mother has it and I am lucky that I am her only child. \nHD can make people with it say some awful things in the later stages, and you need to learn that it is the disease talking, not your dad. \nHDYO (Huntington\u2019s Disease Youth Organisation) may be a good place to look at first, they are on facebook so check them out. In terms of getting tested, I do not know where you live but there are usually some support systems in place for families who need it. \nKeep doing your research and stay close with your family during this time. I wish you all the best, it sounds like you are an amazing sibling to your younger brother and I hope he looks up to you in this.  I try to remember that none of us are promised another minute here, and every minute we do get is a precious gift...I am so sorry you and your family will have to struggle through this completely unfair disease, but how wonderful that you all seem to love each other and can lean on one another!! many people do not have that. And every day we get closer to a cure!  Im so sorry.  My dad has it as well. The hardest part was watching it change him before we really understood what he had. Major psychotic episodes, personality changes, depression... every day was something different. Now he has difficulty swallowing and we have to be very aware when hes eating so he wont choke. Its definitely extremely difficult to watch a loved one go through this. Im also trying to find out how I can be more involved in finding a cure. Even if its just fundraising for research or something. I feel so helpless knowing its only a short amount of time before symptoms start in either me or my siblings. Not sure who has it, obviously... also need to look into being tested. Im sorry, this turned into me rambling. Stay strong!! Remember everyone is dealing with some major struggle or pain in life. Try not to let it overwhelm you, although its hard.. Hey.. Im in a very similar situation as yourself. I am 20 years old, my mom was diagnosed 3 years ago. We had no clue what the disease was before my mom was diagnosed. My grandmother was an orphan therefore there is no medical history from her side, and my grandfather was paralyzed around the time his symptoms would have started to show up (presumably). Its a huge blow and its probably going to feel like your life took a screeching halt for some time. I dont want to say itll get better - because like the person above me said - it wont until there is a cure. However you will learn to cope with it. It may even help you cherish life, take more risks, be more outgoing, and learn to appreciate littler things. You can also be grateful we live in a time where medical science is groundbreaking so there is plenty of hope for a cure in the future. I wish you the best of luck my friend and do not be afraid to shoot me a DM.", "Mother in law with HD just moved in. What can I get to make life easier? Is there anything in your household that you bought for your family members with HD that make life easier, for either the family member or yourself to help take care of them?\n\n\nThanks in advance Not from direct personal experience since my Mom did not live with us. But one thing is to do whatever you can to reduce risk of tripping and falling. Changes in floor covering are one of the bigger risks, e.g. wood to carpet. Consider removing or at least taping down rugs. Things like that. Multiple Handles in shower. Plastic cups for drinking! We have sooo many plastic cups in our house now! My friend who has Huntingtons wants to contribute but his twitches can be bad. All plastic means he can wash dishes without worrying about breaking anything Lots of canes in different rooms so if they need assistance it is there Idk what stage she is at but a gait belt is extremely helpful for later stage when walking becomes more difficult. We use one with my dad and it helps us help him around the house. Also things with large easy to press buttons, such as remotes or phones. Aw, how nice that he is still able to help you with the plastic plates and cups! Small things like these really make a difference! We try and do things that let him have as much independence as possible for as long as possible. It is important", "DAE take Natural Meds For Huntington's? I take a natural supplement that allowed me to get out of my wheelchair &amp; work part-time beginning May 1. I am wondering how you pay for that which Medicaid will not cover? I am waiting on Stimuluscheck#3 &amp; my first paycheck in a year so do not really have the $109 for it + my post-COVID inhaler Medicaid will not pay for. I contacted the Huntington's Society but they said they do not pay for \"alternative therapies\"....Any suggestions? Anyone else on natural supplements? What suppliment are you taking? I presume u do not take any? Huntington\u2019s runs in my family but I do not believe I have it. That said I take a variety of supplements  that costs quite a bit each month Yeah it is kind of bullcrap that Medicaid will pay for 23 Big Pharma meds but not something natural. The pricey supplement I take is Kratom. I would not exactly call that a supplement but I agree with your overall point And THAT is why I do not tell anyone. Because of all the people who have fallen for the massive misinformation campaign against it. Drug addicts abuse it so it cannot possibly be any use as a supplement. A fourth of a teaspoon per day for the past 4 years made the difference between living a semi-normal life and not. But do judge what you do not know. Ok not against it. I am for it.", "My friend with HD lost their memory of me. Will it ever return? ", "Showing symptoms? So lately I have been afraid that I am already showing minor symptoms of Huntingtons but I feel like I cannot tell my husband right nkw cause he is already so depressed and anxious as it is and he even thinks about suicide (just thoughts as far as I know \ud83d\ude15). I am normally a very anxious person and it is really hard for me to sit still in a chair or couch or wherever. Now I am finding myself doing it a lot at night too. My mom had restless legs syndrome and I do get really anxious at night, but as I am sure you all know when your at-risk or know you have it, it is really hard to see anything but HD. I am consistently uncomfortable and finding myself shifting around a lot.  I feel like at times I feel my arms doing the same but it could just be my imagination. I know at times it is hard for me to drive and my husband will yell at me for going over curbs I did not see and sometimes revving up the car with the gas and then letting off a lot, sometimes for a few minutes and I remember that is how my dad drove when he first started showing.\n\nI have been having facial tics a lot lately. I call them nervous tics for now since they really come out more when I am stressed (it mostly happens at work which is weird cause I love it). It is been happening for 5 or so months and it is really embarrassing and fairly obvious. \n\nThen there is still the cognitive stuff. I really want to get off my anti-depressant and go on a new one but every time I ask my psychiatrist she says no! I want to at least eliminate the possibility of my issues being from me meds or HD related. If I cannot change my meds and find out the anxiety of it all is going to kill me. Does anyone know if you can have delayed side   effects on an anti-depressant? I have a very educated therapist who does a lot of different work and he said i can have delayed ones but my psychiatrist immediately said no. I mean has anybody here had that happen? If so, I might look into seeing someone else.\n\nI have had such a rough year so far and at the time, was in a span of 4 months - diagnosed with HD in February, had a miscarriage in March, and had my mom pass away mid- April. My mom dying has significantly taken its place as the worst thing so far since she died so suddenly and was my very best friend. But the damage had already been done from all the other shit I have been put through. It could be all stress  related but I just cannot stop thinking it is HD, you know? My mom was the only person I went to about it cause she lived it too taking care of my dad &amp; grandma years back. So I am here trying to be a more frequent user again trying to engage again with who have this too. Talk to the person who diagnosed you with hd and ask for brain scans. This is what my sister(who is positive for hd) did and she got scans done because she thought she was starting symptoms. She would been under a lot of stress and it was not the starting symptoms luckily - this might be the same for you. \n\nI am positive also, I understand the constant fear that is on the back of your mind always. I am pretty young but I fear the older I get the bigger that part of my mind will get.  So if I get brain scans done, my neurologist can tell me just by those if my symptoms HD related or not? I had my first appointment in March I think and he just had me A few little physical tests Ok I just spoke to my sister then and she said the brain scans came up normal but were also done so that they can compare them further down the track because if her symptoms got worse etc the brain scans should be able to pick that up.  Ok gotcha. That makes send I guess! I have not had a single scan done yet so it would definitely be a start! How often does she go in?  She said she is meant to go every couple of years or she can just go when she feels prompted to because of being worried about having symptoms. She said to me that when she goes to get the brain scan next that they should show up if she is started being symptomatic with hd or not. In that way it will help you be able to know if you are symptomatic or how much you are progressing. Or it might show you are not symptomatic at all. Regardless good luck :) you are not alone  Yeah that is what mine said too, except he said once a year for now. He did not notice any symptoms but that does not mean over the course of a few months it cannot change. I might look into calling again, just out of curiosity. Thanks! \ud83d\ude42 You could be showing symptoms, but you could also just be stressed! There are many things you should consider before landing on that explanation. \n\nI get really shakey a lot and have a big problem with twitching, but I recently found out I have hypoglycemia and I forget to eat a lot. So, my guess is my symptoms are because of that! I do not suggest you assume what the issue is, but you have to try and expect the worst but hope for the best! Talk to your doctor about it and they will be able to tell you how advanced it is I suppose you are right. I am just  a little nervous to find out  That is completely understandable. HD is not easy to deal with, so it is normal that you would be shaken! But, we are a strong group of people and we WILL face this devil head on! You got this! Take it one day at a time! Thank you, I really appreciate it! \ud83d\ude42 This is really interesting! My dad also had hypoglycemia and I have recently started experiencing similar symptoms. My doctor mentioned that it might be related to HD, so I looked it up and apparently there \\*is\\* some connection between glucose metabolism and HD. (( I forgot about it until I read your comment, but now I wonder if this is more common in the HD community than I thought.    My father is not the parent with HD, though! My mother was. Maybe we are just more likely to get it?? Ahh possibly! Does your dad have hypoglycemia? Maybe it is just genetic, then! I am not sure.  He has hypoglycemia that eventually developed into Diabetes, which is a genetic thing. My genes must hate me lol You said the tics started around the same time as your mom passed... Could the facial tics possibly be related to the stress of losing someone you care about? It sounds like you have been through not just one, but three huge events in the past few months. Any one of those alone would be incredibly stressful.       \n\n\nI know that the months after my dad died are just blanks in my memory because that period of time was so difficult. For months I barely slept and I started getting all these side effects \\- like I lost a lot of hair and weight, had a bad case of lockjaw, and noticed that one of my eyelids started twitching all the time. (All of which have gone away after several years.)       \n\n\nAlso, testing positive can have a \\*huge\\* psychological impact even if it does not feel that way at first. When I tested positive, I developed panic attacks for the next 3 \\- 4 years. At their worst, I was having at least one panic attack a week.       \n\n\nI thought they would never leave, but eventually they did clear up and I started to feel more like my old self again. Now I almost never have one. But it took a long time to get here.       \n\n\nWhat was the reason your psychiatrist did not want you to go off your meds?       Oof, I feel you on that. HD on its own is already a lot to deal with. Hopefully you will not have to deal with both at once!      ", "Another Huntington's study! \n\nThe $500,000 funding is not nearly as much as Roche's current $190,000,000 study, but it is still another step in the right direction. I am so incredibly happy with the exposure HD has been getting recently and I hope it means we are on the right path to a cure", "Mother-in-law has Huntington\u2019s. How do I support my husband? My mother-in-law was diagnosed with Huntington\u2019s on Friday. This was not a huge shock to the family as it has claimed her sister, mother, grandmother, and great-aunt. Her nephew was also recently diagnosed as well. \n\nWhile I want to do all that I can for my mother-in-law, I also want to turn my attention to my husband that now has a 50% chance of having it. This comes at a horrible time since our first child is due in a couple weeks. We are scared for what this means for the future of our family. My husband is 30 years old and is now in the age range of showing symptoms. He is scared. We all are. He plans on taking the test after he is met with a genetic counselor. We plan on signing up for life insurance and getting a will put together. \n\nWhat can I say or do to best support him during this hard time? Are there any programs or services we can connect with for support whether it be for his mom or him? What are some things I should not say or do? I want to be as supportive as possible.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks! The best thing you can do is be there by his side no matter what comes.\n\nWhen I first got my + results I pretty much did not get off the couch for days for anything except my therapist appointments.

That is still possible. Do not give up hope, because even with a positive you still have years and years together, and science advances fast. It is going to be better for me then it was for my dad. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f Java has many great points. The future for us HD folks is brighter now than it ever has been.\n\nYour husband is just as likely to be negative as he is to be positive, so keep on the bright side. However as they say, hope for the best and plan for the worst. \n\nIf he gets a positive, it is probably best if neither of you have to go to work right away. Maybe schedule a vacation for immediately after you get your results either way. I was in way too much of a fog to be productive after I tested positive. \n\nI have a blog post I recently wrote on this topic thay I posted to this sub a couple days ago. Check it out! \n\nThe most supportive thing my wife has done for me is keep me grounded since getting my result. Reminding me that I am well RIGHT NOW. She picked up more chores around the house as I got depressed. She kept me active, going on walks with the dogs and her. She kept me socialized by planning zoo outings and stuff with her sister and our niece. She made sure I knew how much I am loved and made me feel safe and secure. She also supported everything I wanted to do as a result like go to EnrollHD, HD support groups, and attend the HDSA convention at the end of this month. Practical tip: get your life insurance BEFORE you get your test results. That way if it is a positive result you have already got insurance and you can fill out all your life insurance paperwork honestly and legally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmotional tip: try to support your husband however he needs it, whether the result is positive or negative. When I got my \"best-case scenario\" positive result, I was still pretty depressed for about a month even though outwardly I was fine. Even if the result is negative for your husband I could see some survivor's guilt come up. Either way it is going to affect his, and your, life a lot. So just try to understand that and be committed to work through it. Thank you! Great advice. We are meeting with a financial advisor next week to discuss life insurance for this very reason. Any recommendations on what company to use? Thank you for the advice and encouragement. He is acting like he is already been diagnosed and is convinced he is seeing all the signs. It is breaking my heart. His feelings are completely valid but I also want to help him see that some of it could be paranoia. Where would I be able to find tour blog? And that is great that you are going to the convention. I just learned about it recently. I look forward to seeing what comes from it. Thanks! No, I just got mine through my financial advisor. As long as the price and coverage is good I think they are all the same. I am sorry I should have linked it before. ( The symptom hunting is really really common. It is sort of like after watching a scary movie you notice all these sounds in your house except the feeling does not go away. My husband always has to remind me that I have been clumsy forever, walking into the corner of the bed is not a symptom. Lol. If you want to know if your baby has HD, get them tested now. Once it is out of the oven, doctors will not test until the baby turns 18, unless they have JHD. Make sure to discuss life insurance with a genetic counselor as well. They tend to know more about how this works legally. For instance, you may need to wait a year or two before getting genetic testing or some companies may void your policy. M/38/At Risk here. Just a few of my thoughts on this, from my perspective, being in somewhat in your husband's shoes. I am not sure how his shoes ended up at my house, but PM me and I will send them back. o\\_0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis could have easily been a post that my wife would have made, had we been active redditors about 15 years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe (mostly I) held off marriage for several years based around this issue. My concerns were (partially still are) that I would turn into a complete f\\*cking asshat with no way to control it as I would witnessed in my mom knowing I now had a 50/50 shot of following right down the same track. Why the hell would anyone want to drag another person into that kind of world willingly? Cue montage of taking care of my mom for a few months (at home), having her placed in a nursing home, to her passing in 2008. Through all of that, my girlfriend (now wife of 7 years, gf for 12 prior) was an advocate. She had the drive and sometimes more balls than I did to point things out, make sure my mother was getting the care and things she needed. She pushed me to become more vigilant and outspoken in certain areas. She also got involved with the state chapter of the HDSA to learn more, she ended up running a support group shortly after. We have both followed the medical trials and successes since. She is a badass. My mother passed away in 2008, she still holds support groups once a month. She still takes calls of families that are where we were at when we first took my mother in back in 2004. She still goes to the HDSA convention nearly every year. She goes to the Woody Guthrie Festival every year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that to say. You are not my wife. I am not your husband. We will react to situations differently. I have had times where I have had the same reactions thinking that shit, this thing happened, must be the HD. She is supportive, but she does not walk on eggshells around me. She is strong in her own right. She runs the support group on her own. I have no part. It is not something that, at this point, I am comfortable in joining in on. I distance myself from most of her HD related activities, like the convention, group, and Woody Guthrie Festival (which is going on this weekend). I have my own stubborn reasons for doing so. I have not been tested, so, I suppose there is that slight idea that it may not be an issue, but it is always in the back of my head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess if anything to get out of my ramblings, get this. Do not believe the hype. The bullshit thing about this disease is that it absolutely does affect everyone differently. Which makes it unpredictable by nature. Certain symptoms may not arise for many years. Support, seeking out possible treatment (there is some good research on the horizon, ( do not walk on eggshells. I think the worst thing my wife could have done is to treat me like a fragile egg that could break if not handled correctly. Be strong. Continue life, knowing it may change at some point, just not right now.", "Huntington Upgrades Floodwall Infrastructure from EDA Grant  Wrong subreddit!", "Would it lessen your fear of testing if the results were a bit more vague? Most children of parents with Huntington's Disease prefer not to get tested because of the perceived finality of it all. However, researchers at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology came up with an idea of combining the results of multiple people so that they would give you a more vague answer. \n\nFor example, 10 people who are afraid of seeing absolute results get tested and the result given to all of them is a combination of their blood. So if all of them had zero risk then the result given to everyone would say that they had no risk. But say if 2 out of 10 people showed that they were at risk then the results would show that for each individual there was a 20% chance of being the at-risk person.\n\nSo my question is this: \n\n***Would such an arrangement where obscurity was purposely added to a test:*** \n\n**A)** ***Make you more likely to take the test than otherwise?***\n\n**B)** ***Make you less anxious to take the test than normal?***\n\n**C) Neither**\n\n**D) Both**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the study in case you are curious:  ( C) Neither. Would just seem pointless to me. Would leave me with the same worries I had before about developing the illness. Unless it came back with a 0% chance, but in that instance, I might as well get it done by myself. C) If I am going to test just tell me if I have it! People test because they want to know. Maybe they have big future plans or want kids. These are important things to know with finality. If you do not test, that is fine too, but I do not think making it more vague would help. I think it would just give more questions. These answers are really enlightening. Would there any changes that you think should be made to the testing process to make it less anxiety inducing? No. That test is basically a 50% chance at a life sentence. There is no way to make it less than it is. I would like for it to be more accessible though, less expensive and hard to get to. I do not get it. The point of testing is to eliminate the mystery. There is no vague, eh you might at that point. And why would you want that if you went to the trouble of testing? It feels patronizing to put a false fog around real results, like u cannot handle knowing about my own body of I choose to?\n\nClearly I am getting worked up so checking out now.\n\nIf someone does not want to be tested that should be respected. As someone from outside the HD community I can see that there is a disconnect with the researchers and the patients in some ways. I think the goal of this study was to make testing less traumatic and more prevalent. This particular solution might be a dud as many have suggested but I hope the community can help suggest possible solutions that can be tested. very much no. that just adds more numbers to an already confusing numbers game. 50% chance of having it. 50% chance of it affecting me. and now theres a 30% chance i could be the one affected with it? no thanks", "Would anybody like to review my video on the psychology of HD testing? Hi everybody, I hope this is the right place for this.  \nI do not know anybody with HD, and I am not at risk myself, but the psychology of HD testing has fascinated me since I studied it in bioethics last year.  \nI have spent the last 6 months researching and writing a video-speech on this topic (as a case-study on broader questions of how people respond to risks), and after 10 drafts, I have reached a stage where I feel it is ready for review. I feel there is nobody better qualified to comment than members of the HD community (though the target audience is just the scientifically-literate general public, so a lot of this video will be fairly obvious to you).  \nThe piece is meant to be persuasive without telling anybody what to do -- so just informative. I currently have the view that people at-risk are *usually* better off getting tested (although the reasoning may not be true for some older people in particular). I aim to share my reasoning here.  \n\n\n(\n\n  \nIf there is anything I have misconstrued, gotten wrong, or failed to note, please feel free to share it with me, because I will definitely be re-doing this piece when I have collected enough constructive criticism. Whether it is something I have said that makes you mad, or a small thing you would like to point out, it is all helpful to me.  \n(Sorry for the disembodied camera framing and the rushed delivery -- these things will be fixed in a future version. The excerpts from the HDYO channel and from \"Do You Really Want To Know\" etc. are used under fair-use provisions).  \n\n\nRegards,  \nTed I will take a look! HD+ guy right here A very interesting video and a lot of research went in for sure. Nice work. You seem like a very smart guy. I founded and work for HDYO so all the HDYO videos you used I actually was interviewing those young people. I have tested myself, I got a positive result. We actually did a new video seeing how young adults coped with their hd results some years after their results which I would recommend if you have not seen it. You must be Matt yeah? I was going to use some quotes from ( video of you, because I thought that along with Wayne, you were one of the most inspiring, resilient and courageous people. Unfortunately the video was already ballooning in size and I had to cut it down.  \n\n\nGreat work with the interviews; they really help an outsider like myself to better understand what you all must be going through. I will admit I shed a tear when you said you tested positive -- it all seems so unfair. But I absolutely love the way you have channelled it all into this HDYO project; it is very admirable.  \n\n\nThe next part of the video will be looking at an analogous situation that every person has to go through, which is whether to educate ourselves about political threats (which can sometimes seem just as life-threatening and just as impossible to fix). I think a lot of people watching will be thinking \"gee at least I do not have HD\", but my aim is to help people to realise that even the most fortunate of us are faced with similar choices in life.  \n\n\nI will have a look at the new video! Much appreciated. You will surely know a lot about the testing process, having presumably gone through it yourself :) I will take a look - I have HD. My initial just-after-viewing response (I will probably have something more thoughtful later):\n\nI have at-risk cousins who have absolutely no desire to test and have not told their kids it runs in the family.  I understand - they are living in families where substance abuse, addiction, and domestic violence are more pressing issues.  They are not really keen to add the stress of inherited genetic disorders to already strained family relationships.  They seem less focused on their own potential outcome and more on how it will affect their relationships. \n\n  \nThat being said, it is not my perspective.  I did not know about HD until I was grown - my mother was misdiagnosed.  The two years between her diagnosis and my test results were MUCH more anxiety-provoking than knowing I have it.  It was something of an ordeal to get tested, having to wait a month or more between each of these events: initial contact about testing, the blood draw, and getting the results.  Genetic counselors emphasized that it was my choice to continue toward having this knowledge, attempting to be empathetic.  \n\nThe only thing I saw in the video that did not sit exactly right was when it seemed to characterize John's(name?)  irritability as resulting from the \\*knowledge\\* of his diagnosis rather than as a direct result of the disease.  Best as I remember, there is some research out there that shows depression and irritability related to structural changes in the brain in HD, far exceeding what you see in patients given other 'death sentences'.\n\nIn general, I would definitely give a thumbs up and recommend it to HD support groups and genetic counselors alike, as food for thought :-) Thank you so much for the reply!  \n\n\nThat first paragraph is something I will try to mention when I re-do the video; that sometimes the question of testing is really the lowest of peoples' priorities, and is outweighed by questions such as how it is going to affect relationships. I guess I am almost assuming that the audience lives in a vaccuum to some extent; so it will be good to build that in.  \n\n\nYeah I think that if it were possible to somehow avoid even knowing about the existence of the risk itself, then the weigh-up changes significantly in favour of not knowing. Interesting to hear about the misdiagnosis! And yeah, in my bioethics class we talked a lot about how medicine has been shifting away from paternalistic treatments, and giving people a lot more choice in the matter. I think it can only be a good thing, but when other people are involved (genetic conditions) it becomes a more sticky question, as I touched upon.  \n\n\nThanks for picking up that point re. irritability; that is not something I was aware of (that structural changes can have those effects). I will make sure to research that and fix it up in the next video!  \n\n\nThanks again! If you wish to share, I would be really interested to hear your own thoughts on whether getting tested was the right move for you, and on whether you use certain strategies to deal with such knowledge?  \n\n\nI am just finishing off part two of the video now, which is about how people deal with living in a world that is at risk for nuclear war (and other political threats) also using information avoidance. I know I have my own coping strategies :) I will send you more via DM later, but I love the investigation of the nuclear war threat.  I am older than you and went to an ancient school that still had a bomb shelter and rations.  When we would have tornado drills, usually on really dark stormy days, we would sit in the halls covering our heads and all I can remember is the pit-of-the stomach fear, confounding the local threat with the more global one.  Whew, I had some coping strategies, too, haha. Thanks for sharing this. \n\nMy mom was very recently diagnosed and she was against the idea of me or my siblings getting tested, so I watched this with her on the weekend and used it as a launchpad for further discussion. I do not have much feedback for you, and may need to watch it again because my thoughts were really swirling through most of it. But it fostered some good discussion for us, so thanks. Thanks for watching :)  I am really glad it was useful.\n\nIf you do have any feedback at any point, feel free to let me know. \n\nPart two is out now if you are interested:  \n( This was so interesting to watch, thank you for posting. On the one hand it opened my eyes to what my boyfriend must be going through (his mum has HD and he has not wanted me to meet her) and on the other hand I empathise with the hurting other people and causing them anxiety by not testing. I have to say, certain clips brought tears to my eyes as it is such a cruel disease, but amazing to see how some people cope. The determination of the cancer scientist to continue keeping active and running, it was very emotional to watch. \nI will try to share this with my boyfriend for more poignant comments. Thank you so much :) I am going to remake the video later on, taking into account any feedback I receive (there are a few things I want to change even now). So think of what you watched as like a draft :)  \n\n\nFor further context I highly recommend the documentary \"Do You Really Want to Know\", which some of those clips are taken from. It is freely available here: (  \n\n\nOne of my friends phoned me the other day with her own review of the video, and pointed out that whilst my video changed her own perspective a fair bit, she still thinks she would have no reason to live and that she would kill herself if she got a 100% diagnosis. I wrote down a quote from her: \"I have got so much anxiety about other things, so anxiety about HD would not \u201ctip the scales\u201d, whereas loss and grief would be more significant\". She also said she is never really experienced much loss in her life, and that might be why loss is more significant for her than for others. Whereas anxiety is a fairly regular occurrence for her.  \n\n\nPersonally I reckon she is just so scared of loss because she is never been through it before. I lost my dad to cancer when I was 15 and life went on. I am sure it would be the same if I was diagnosed 100% certain with HD. Plus there are so many benefits to knowing, so for me it is not even a question; of course I would get tested. Haha, anyway, those are just a few of the thoughts I would like to incorporate into the next version of the video. \n\n  \nIf your boyfriend has any comments I would love to hear them! Hope you both are able to successfully navigate the questions that this disease bring up :)", "I hate this disease - vent post My brother got diagnosed with HD when I was 12 years old and he was 24 years old. He had been exhibiting symptoms for about 5 years in the form of clumsiness and speech being a bit hard to understand. I just need a place to vent. I fucking hate this disease. I am now 30, almost 31 and he is 42 years old. He can still walk and talk but I feel like only I can understand him well more than most people. He was my best friend growing up. I have been grieving since I was 12 without even realising it. It is a fucking hard road especially since my parents denied us any support groups I was never able to process it as a child and teenager. Hell, I can barely process it as an adult. My brother is amazing and I wish I could take it all away. He lives in a care facility since 2014 and it is really been great for him. He is well looked after but I feel so guilty as before then he lived with me for 5 years. I wish things could be normal again. I hate this life he has to live but I guess at least he gets to live. Does anyone understand where I am coming from? I have days, weeks, months where I am fine then out of nowhere I will break down like he is already dead. No amount of therapy helps with this for me as you can never truly understand it until you have lived it. Thanks for letting me vent. I watched for years as my grandfather declined. It was painful and enraging when people assumed he was drunk. We understood him most of the time until the end. Hating the cards they were dealt is normal i think. With my grandfather he not only had hd, but survived polio. So the anger over how much crap he was dealt is still real for me. As for your relationship with your brother i think it is huge how close you are. When i become symptomatic, the relationships I will have will mean everything to me because when the later stages hit, that is really all I will have. \n\nTldr, yes your anger is just. I think your relationship will be more precious and necessary than most people can understand/ appreciate. Thank you for your reply. I am very sorry to hear about your grandfather. Also sorry to hear you have the disease too - would not wish it upon my enemies. I really appreciate your insight into this. I sometimes feel selfish feeling so angry but it is really because I love my brother with all of my heart. That is not a bad thing. That anger can be put to good. Some people find comfort in using it to drive them. Like using that energy to try making a difference. Like proposing charity donation programs at their work where a fixed percent of their checks get donated to charities. Doing that and promoting charities that support research and care for those with hd, might be one way to use that energy. Or even simply using that energy to help him/ do what you can to help him have a fulfilled life. Just my thoughts. Definitely all great ideas! I have looked into volunteering where he lives, I would really like to help out. Thanks for taking the time to talk to me, it really helped a lot. Of course, feel free to dm if you ever need to talk. Im on daily. Good luck You are not alone. I am going through this only with my husband. I have joined a local support group. I was surprised to find that it was primarily filled with people that knew someone with HD. I would look into joining one. Many are virtual right now. It helped me learn I am not alone. \n\nGood luck. You sound like a good brother. I am so sorry... 24 is such a young age to start showing symptoms. That must have been so hard for you being only 12 yourself.   \n\n\nI think grieving is complicated when you are a caregiver for someone with HD, because there is often more than one death.   \n\n\nIt is almost like... Each time something major changes, you mourn for a while. But then eventually you adjust to a new 'normal'. And then, a few months or years later, everything is suddenly deteriorating again... and you are once again adjusting to a new 'normal'.   \n\n\nAnd at each stage you miss the last stage of normalcy... Like, I remember crying every time my dad lost something else: his job, the house he spent his whole life saving for, his car, his ability to feed himself, his ability to walk, and so on until his death. Right before he died, I remember thinking that I would give anything to just freeze time on that moment if it meant at least having some tangible reminder of him left in the world.   \n\n\nSo I think it is completely and totally normal to be grieving even if the person still gets to live for a while longer. That is part of what is so painful about this disease, it spreads things out over so many years.   \n\n\nAnd yeah, I feel you on the therapy thing. I tried a bit of therapy over the years after getting a positive test result, but I found that the only things that actually helped were time, medication, and talking to people who understand HD.    \n\n\nThe first support group I went to, I remember like bursting into tears when they came around the table to my introduction. I was so embarrassed I did not go back for a long time... Took me maybe 3-4 years to able to talk about this without choking up to some degree.   \n\n\nYou said your parents limited your ability to go to support groups as a kid, have you had the chance to check out any of the ones in your area (or online) recently?   \n\n\nThere are some chill groups over here at the HDSA website:  (  They meet online, so they are still accessible even during lockdown. Just in case you have not seen them before!   \n\n\nI hope you are able to find some support. I am also always open to chat if you ever need a place to vent. Hey thank you for your comment and totally acknowledging my feelings. That feels pretty awesome! Also, it is great yet sad that you understand where I am coming from. I will check out the support groups, I have not been to any or checked out any online so I think it will be really helpful. I am sorry to hear about your father and yourself :( would not wish this upon anybody. No prob! I hope you can find something that is helpful. &gt; It was painful and enraging when people assumed he was drunk.\n\nMy mom had the cops called on her when she was at the vets to have her dying dog put down. It is so fucked up. Was scrolling through this and saw your comment and it broke my heart. \n\nMy mom had the cops called on her while sitting outside her dentist office after an appointment, waiting for my sister to come pick her up. It is bad enough having HD but to have this shit happen to you because of it is just unreal...", "Testing process I (18 F) am getting my blood test tomorrow to see if I test negative or positive for HD. I am not really sure what to expect/how long it will take for my results (if anyone knows please let me know). A part of me does not want to know my results but at the same time I really need to know. It is been bothering me for years (my mom has Huntington\u2019s and has had it since she was 26). For those who tested either positive or negative.. how did you handle that? I seriously have no idea how I am going to handle it. Thank you for taking the time to read or answer this.  I will update this post once I get my results. It sounds like you have not talked to anybody about this yet. I would highly recommend talking to a genetic counselor. I have not gone through the process yet myself, but from my understanding they will fully explain what testing entails as well as talk through the possible results with you, as well as the options available. While I am not sure anybody is every 'ready' to be tested, they will also let you know if you are NOT ready. I.e. if they think you can not handle the results at this point in your life. I do not think anything can prepare you for it, but whatever the outcome remember that there is hope in the medical world, great stuff is happening, try to make peace with it, it is not easy to do but you must make peace with it or it will consume you. I believe it takes about 6 weeks for results to come back, make sure you have therapy and talk about your feelings and fears, good luck \u2764\ufe0f I would not get tested unless you have both short term and (especially) long term disability policies in place. At your age, the coverage should be quite inexpensive. If you have not gotten tested yet, you have no ability to lie on your applications. But if you test gene positive, that could come back to haunt you if you apply for insurance after you know your results. I would also read the fine print on those policies too, just in case you have they waiting period in place. Proper disability coverages can quite literally be a life saver. Definitely check your insurance, also make sure you have friends and family to talk to or therapist. When I did it my doctor did not even know what Huntingtons was, and called me and gave me my results over the phone. Now I am pretty sure they require therapy beforehand. it took about 2 days because they had to ship them for the testing. I dont think this is true. When I tested positive my results were kept separate from any other records and I dont think there is any way an insurance company could know about my results unless I told them. I was assured of this by my doctor at the time.\n\nYou should not have to disclose to anybody that you are preHD. Technically, you are right. \n\nBut it does not always hold true. When my ex got tested her Dr. told her the same thing regarding confidentiality and records separation. But then it did not wind up being true, as her results were entered in plain text into the Dr.\u2019s file. We asked the Dr. if those notes were sent into insurance when claims were filed, and he could not answer definitively. \n\nI am just saying it is better to be safe than sorry, as at the end of the day your Dr. makes more money from your insurance company than from you. Talk to a therapist.  Friends and family are great but they are emotionally very connected, a therapist can help you process your results either way much better. Well that is unsettling! Good to know. I also looked into getting tested when I was 18 (22 now). Before you are tested, as has been said above you should see a genetic counselor to help fully understand the process. There are quite a few clinics that can help with this. But one of the other things to think about (and why I did not go through  with it) is insurance. As said above, they may keep this information a separate paper file but it is something your regular doctor, or doctor in the future may need to know about so it can come back that way. I would look into GINA and see what protections there are in place for health insurance. But GINA does not apply to life insurance. So that is something to think about. But in the end always talk it out and do what is best for you, if you have any questions I can try to answer to the best of my ability. But like I said do what is best for you. &gt;her results were entered in plain text into the Dr.\u2019s file. We asked the Dr. if those notes were sent into insurance whe\n\nI thought you could get tested anonymously. Maybe I am not recalling correctly. I have not been tested, but I thought my brothers chose to do so in a way that kept it out of their medical records. If you are reading this DO NOT GO IN FOR TESTING YET!!! As others have mentioned there are lifelong consequences to being diagnosed with HD. One mainly being life insurance policies. What is your mother's CAG numbers? Yes, one day you should get tested, it will  be the most valuable news you will ever receive, positive or negative result. I say that because knowing you have it allows you to plan and live life accordingly, with no wasted time. I hope to God that you get a negative result, but put your ducks in a row first. Too much at stake. Please ask questions if you need more help. Where do you live?  I agree with others... you need to get more info before testing if you can.\n\nBest of luck :-) Thank you so much for taking time to comment, sorry I did not respond earlier I was trying to avoid thinking about my testing. \ud83d\udc9c Thank you! Sorry for the late response, but I am from Canada.", "Went to a HD research center and told the researchers collecting my information that I was currently depressed and had suicidal ideation. Is there a chance the doctor will decide to not move on with my testing. My cheek was swabbed and blood was drawn. I am not depressed because of anything HD related I have developed a depressed mood because over the past 2 years because of the military. A positive hd result would actually alleviate a lot of stress.", "What Would Dr. Huntington Think Today? - Huntington's Disease News ", "My experience of the testing process in the UK so far... Throwaway account as very few people outside my family know about all of this.\n\nI thought I would take some time and relate what I have experienced going through the testing process in the UK. I am late 40\u2019s and not symptomatic (I think!) although I have a minor twitch that could be something random or the very earliest sign of HD.\n\nIn the UK we register with a particular doctor\u2019s surgery, and all appointments and referrals are made through them. Usually you see the same doctor each time, and I saw my GP in May to request that I get tested for HD. They sent a referral through the NHS that went to the regional genetics testing facility closest to where I live.\n\nJust over 3 weeks later I received a letter at home saying that my request could not be handled by some particular department and it was being forwarded somewhere else. Within a couple of weeks of that letter I received a follow up with an appointment date in August, from the same place that sent me the previous letter. Oh well, at least the journey was underway.\n\nThere was no interaction between the appointment letter I received in June and my first appointment, not that I expected there would be. The letter was literally turn up at this place and time and you will be seen by a genetic counsellor.\n\nSo come the day of my appointment and I meet with a genetic counsellor for the NHS. I outline why I am there (to be tested!) and that I am quite keen to get the whole process over with sooner rather than later, mainly because waiting for the results I said I would probably not be patient about, and it would be overly frustrating.\n\nA bit of background \u2013 my mother had HD. I have known since before I was a teenager that I was at risk and it was 50/50 whether I would develop HD or not. Of my mother\u2019s siblings, exactly 50% developed HD and eventually died from it. So I was acutely aware of how it works, how HD progresses, what symptoms could manifest, the genetics behind it etc etc.\n\nI relayed all of the above to the counsellor and said that in my 20\u2019s it was discussed with me if I wanted to be tested, but I declined as I at least had enough self-awareness to realise that a bad result would probably ruin my life, even though I could have another 20+ years symptom-free. And that now I had reached a stage in my life when, for me, it was a complete no-brainer to get tested.\n\nI say a no-brainer as I am at the age when I would expect symptoms to start presenting now or within a couple of years, 5 at most. And that an adverse result would change nothing for me save giving me the opportunity to do things now that I might not otherwise be able to do later on.\n\nAll that was taken on board, and I asked if I could get the blood test done that day. My counsellor said that usually they ask for people to be seen three times and on the third time they would do the blood test and then about a month later be given the results. But in my case, she was happy to proceed with taking blood at my next appointment.\n\nSo there was a mixture of frustration and relief, but for them it is a non-negotiable condition that people are seen twice before any test is done. And I understand that now, certainly with more clarity than I did in August.\n\nDuring that first appointment I related my family history and we also discussed who else I had talked to about this. My family has been quite open about HD and we have not kept it under wraps between us as I have read that some families do. Hence the awareness from a young age. I can only speak for myself when I say that I want to know these things and being kept in the dark only to find out later would have had a hugely detrimental effect on my relations with my family.\n\nThe other point my counsellor asked me was to bring a member of my family along or a friend to the next appointment. For the counsellor, it gives them some basis that I have support while going through this and in case I have an adverse result. And let us be straight here, it is not exactly something everyone will deal with objectively. I am sure people have harmed themselves or worse after testing positive for HD. \n\nThat was something I was happy to comply with, however I asked that a friend of mine come with me to my results appointment rather than the testing. I have recently moved for work, so I needed to travel back to the testing centre and the friend I wanted there is someone I work with currently who I have known for several years. \n\nWe left it there where I would see if my friend could make both but otherwise definitely be there for the testing. The other thing I was asked for was to provide some demonstrative evidence of HD in my family, so that they knew they were testing me for the right thing. I could have provided a number of things, but in the end it was easiest to send a copy of my mother\u2019s death certificate, which of course had HD listed on the certificate.\n\nThere were a couple of emails back and forth between my first and second appointments but mainly just scheduling. Most importantly I had an early appointment date set for my test and also to receive my results. I confirmed with the counsellor that it was ok to bring a friend to the results appointment rather than the testing and they were fine with that.\n\nCome the day of the second appointment I am seen by the same genetic counsellor along with an NHS doctor who is within the genetics team. The role of the doctor (other than to take blood for the test) was also to answer any further questions I had. I did have a couple of minor queries, mostly to do with the 36-39 repeat range and what percentage rates of HD applied to those values.\n\nIn both the first and second appointment we touched on what an adverse result would mean for me and what, if any, thinking I had done about how my life would change in that circumstance. I talked about how I currently drive to work and the type of job I do, both of which would have to change at some point if I have HD. I said that I identify quite strongly with my work and have made a lot of friends at the different places I have worked, so losing that self-identity would be a blow. I was honest enough with them to say that prior to losing my independence I would be likely to visit a facility in Switzerland where you can end your life legally. The counsellor took that at face value and did not offer any opinions. I have mentioned that to two friends, neither of whom took it really well \u2013 but I do not blame them and hopefully it is a bridge I will not need to cross.\n\nNow I say hopefully but as I explained to the counsellor, I am of the opinion that I have HD. My coordination is fine, but other than the twitch I have noticed a couple of little things that I feel are likely to be the very earliest first signs. However, I accept I could be completely wrong about that. And that is part of the reasoning for wanting to be tested, so I have some certainty because otherwise you would go bananas thinking about stuff like this assuming it is HD when it may be completely innocent things. They said from their point of view coming into this with an attitude like that is not necessarily a bad thing as the adjustment from there to knowing you are getting HD after an adverse result is more easily dealt with than hoping nothing is there and finding out you are mistaken. So I am almost adopting an attitude of \u2018I have this and the testing process is just going to confirm what I kind of already know\u2019. And that was ok with them both.\n\nDuring the appointment we also phoned my friend just to touch base and ask if they had any questions for the team prior to the results appointment. Apparently some people have turned up with their support person to get results and the support person does not really know what is going on, leading to all sorts of questions that are probably best left alone until the adverse result can be processed mentally. So they had a chat with my friend and were happy that I would explained what HD was, what the test did and all the details around symptoms, progression and so on.\n\nAfter the call we talked a little about what would happen on results day. I asked them to just tell me the number of repeats. It is short, sharp and explains everything in an instant without any drama or delay. I have asked them not to copy in my GP in my results, which they were happy to do. If I have an adverse result I will be immediately referred to the nearest neurological dept where they have a team that specialises in HD and I will go through a battery of tests. They said I would be welcome to come back and speak to them as often as I want afterwards, and usually the neurological visits are done once each year. I said I would want to explore any clinical trials that are taking place, which was fine and we left the discussion there as no point getting into details unless I have tested positive for HD.\n\nFinally it was the blood test - which if you have ever had a needle to draw blood was exactly the same. They filled two vials and as I mentioned earlier, they noted on the form the date of my results appointment which is in mid October. I asked when they usually find out and they said often just a couple of days prior. So 4 weeks in the UK is the usual processing time to get DNA results back.\n\nI will say both appointments were handled really well and I did appreciate having both testing and results dates confirmed early on after my initial appointment. Having that timeframe locked in has helped a lot as I see an end to the waiting. All along I have seen the testing as an opportunity, as whether I test positive for HD or not, I will still develop it or not have it, but now I have either the chance to do things in my life before it takes hold, or move on and live my life knowing I am free from it.\n\nI will come back on here to let you know how it all went and what happened, and to detail what went on during my results appointment. I imagine that will be probably about a month from now. Thank you for taking the time to write this up. Makes the process of testing, when I get there, a little bit easier to imagine. I managed to avoid going through my gp for my referral and test. I went directly to my local HD centre so that nothing would be on my medical records until I chose for it to be there. \n\nWhat part of the UK are you in? Thanks for the write up. I hope you get good news in October but it sounds like you are well prepared for either outcome. I am in the Midlands. Sorry do not to be more specific than that! . \n\nGood point about going through HD UK. \nExpect that I will probably have a referral letter on my records but I suppose i could ask for that to be taken off. \n\nHowever for an adverse result I suspect it is moot anyway as I will be seeing the neurological department which I assume is done through the NHS. And at some point afterwards it will be obvious to all and sundry there are issues. I think at that point I will \u2018come out\u2019 as it were \ud83d\ude00 I wish you all the best. Only you know if or when you should be tested. It is a hard burden to carry. Go well!! Thank you. I have found sharing this with close friends highly cathartic. I will share the results with them also and then I have some time off work to process it before I am back. \n\nI want to be prepared but I feel deep down no amount of imagination can immunise me for a 40+ result. But I am trying \ud83d\ude00 I meant I contacted my local HD specialist clinic without a referral. I am lucky to have one close by, my gp\u2019s were likely to get alarmed by something they do not really understand, based on previous experience so I dodged them altogether. It was then my choice when I decide to let them know. Good luck with your testing. I have since set up a local support group Very good write-up, and more similar to my own experiences than the American process that is posted about more often seems to be. \n\nI am in Canada and there is a 4 appointment process to go through to get results: first a meeting with a genetic counselor, then one with a psychiatrist, then one with a neurologist and genetic counselor together, and then the results appointment with the neurologist and genetic counselor. I have to book each appointment after I complete the last one, and the clinic will not follow up with me if I do not contact them in case I change my mind and decide I do not want to know. You can have your blood work done anytime after the first appointment, but you cannot get your results until the fourth one.\n\nI have my third appointment next week, and I am hopeful that I will be able to get in for my final one in the next month or two. It is been a long process, my initial referral was in May just like you and I got lucky with a well-timed cancellation otherwise my next appointment would not be until late November.\n\nThanks for sharing, and good luck with your results appointment. Thank you for writing this. While I may not have HD or suspect I have it, I have been researching it ever since my boyfriend claimed he has it. He had a blood test and he got his results by text.

These memories run so deep that they are no longer remembered in the usual sense of the word, but are rather simply part of who the person is.\n\n", "No one else to talk too Hi guys,\n\nI will keep this as short as I can, but I feel like I really want it off my chest.\nSo, my dad was diagnosed with HD in 2016, we never knew about it previously until my grandmother was diagnosed with it at 60. It was then that him and his siblings were told about the 50/50 chance. I was quite young and had no idea, we never really spoke about it but my dad put off his testing for awhile.\nBut then came 2016 and my dad was tested, again I had no clue. Then I googled it all and it was what sent me all the way down hill from there. The first reading all about it made me physically sick. It really messed up my health, I went to the doctors and was diagnosed with depression. And because I started reading about the 50/50 chance, I thought I was seeing symptoms in myself, twitching, shakes. Turns it out was due to anxiety and stress, as I was getting stress headaches quite often.\n\nI have explained it to my friends but I do not think they really understand it that well, or what it really means for the future. So I cannot really talk with them about it. I try not to bring it up with my family at all.\nI am currently seeing a councillor, I am in my 3rd session.\n\nHe asked me about my testing decision, the only way I could explain it was that I did not want too because I thought that if an animal had HD, they would euthanise them. Or at least that is what I would want for myself if I tested positive, but tbh in the long run I am still uncertain about testing. \n\nI have days where I can put it to the back off my mind, and feel \"normal.\" But other days like today, it can get really get to me and I do not know where to turn. So I have came here.\n\nThat is all, thanks for reading.\nLook forward to reading your replies, as it would be great to speak with others.   Teach your best friend about it, they want to support you. It is scary, but there are things you can do. Exercise, learn a new sport often, mental exercise. Look into Wave life science and other CRIPR techniques.  HD is not present in most people's lives. Give your friends a chance. Learn and share what you learn. Some days you will fixate on it and some you will not really think about it. That is entirely normal.  i am in your same boat. make sure to stay up to date with the news too.  this always gives me hope First thing you must do is make a short term plan to travel!  It is key to your thought process!   You should not live in the past or future my friend.  You are not special to the world of disease but you are special because your one of kind no doubt about it!  I take care of my sister everyday with Huntington's but we talk about funny things, fun things, never about her dis ease!  Meditation every morning for 30 min is key,  fuck going to counseling,  your pure energy and light believe in yourself, laugh, listen to music, run when your pissed off,  and most of all stretch 2 times a day!  Do not live in chaos, live in the now that you can control!  Try some elicit drugs if you must their not as bad as people say!  Have fun and smile, and laugh as much as possible!  I personally do not think you should bring your friends into this,  that is what meditation and yoga are for!  In the end we all meet our maker, it is what is in between now and then that matters!   trying to explain HD to other people is basically a waste of time. I do not even bother telling friends about it, and aunts/uncles/cousins the same - do not care or do not care to know. My dad also has HD, putting me and my two sisters at that 50% risk as well. He is pretty deep into the stages, and i have just learned to cope. I look at it as something you just have to deal with on your own. I do not know your age, but you seem young. Do not bother getting tested, it is only going to create depression and bad feelings. If you are young, you have plenty of time. Do not think of yourself as any different than anyone else, and do not think of it until it is a direct issue in your life. Why waste the energy thinking about it? It is only going to do you bad. If you ever want to talk to someone who knows what you are going through do not hesitate to message me. It sucks, and it is traumatic, but we face soooo many other forms of mortality every day that you should not get hung up on it. Live your life as you would normally my friend, do not forget about it but do not let it take you over. \n\nDo not listen to the guy above me either. Illicit drugs are a terrible way to cope. I battled with addiction for years, it does not help anything, ever. \n\nHope this helps!  Hey man, \nso my dad got diagnosed in 2013 I think and both my brothers were tested positive last year. But (I guess, sorry if wrong) just like you, we are not being open about it at all in our family. Like my mom talks about the progression my dad is showing with me but that is about it actually. My brothers are pretty much silent about the disease at all. \nI have not tested yet as I am still 17 but I feel like this is not the way to deal with this situation. None of my friends know what I am dealing with on a daily basis which makes it hard for them to understand me.\n\nSo my advice is to be open about it as much as possible (my first post/comment here so also my first step forward) and try to teach the ones you most hold dear what it actually means for you and that you struggle to explain the whole situation. Yeah, I find seeing the stuff about a \"hopeful cute.\" Helps me see a little bit of light. I used to exercise quite a bit, but the depression knocked me off. I am slowly getting back into the gym, going to look into that other stuff as well. Thank you. I feel a bit better knowing other people are in the same boat as I am, good days and bad days.  Thank you so much! My fun side is a bit hindered right now because of the depression, but I will ease back into the partying and being with my friends slowly but surely. Thanks for your advice, it is true, time waits for no one. I just need to take control while I still can. Thank you, that is my biggest issue right now. I think about it often and seem to let it control my life right now, I am mentally and physically trying to reprogram myself to get back to living normally. I was just a year older than you when I found out, but it hits hard at any age. You are right about the struggling with it being an open discussion within the family, it is something that is sort of sweeper under the rug. My dad has not shown any symptoms yet, but I think he has accepted it at this point and my grandparents try to flat out ignore it and pretend it is not a thing. I always wonder if they are the same as me, putting on a brave face but fighting it mentally. Is this the same with you are family? Pm if you want to talk more, I find it a lot better speaking with someone in the same boat as me rather than speaking with a counsellor. \ud83d\udc4d  did you find out at your current age? It may be a bit different for us because i found out very young, maybe 13 or 14? I am 21 now. I guess at the time maybe it did not resonate as much with me as it would now so for the past 7 years that i have known, it is just kind of been there. Once in a while ill ponder on it and let it get the best of me when it is late at night and i am trapped in my own head. But by the time I wake up i am usually able to shake it off. As my dad gets worse and worse into the stages it kind of hits me harder but he is doing really well for where he is at. He is 65? and was diagnosed about 8 years ago. People see him and think it is bad but I guess since i have watched it progress it does not seem as bad. \n\nLife's always going to throw shit at you, that is a fact. It is just a matter of how you handle it that defines you. If you just found out I can see why it would be so devastating, but over time that feeling goes away and you learn to accept it and cope, just as you would with anything else.  how far along into HD is your dad? Let me tell you first hand that those videos that you see about HD can be terrifying. I let that scare the shit out of me too when this was all still new to me. However, take it from someone who is living in the same shoes. Those scary things are far away, and sometimes exaggerated. I know every case is different but my dad is \"in the final stages\" and he is still very normal. He can hold a conversation, cooks his own meals here and there, cleans the house, still is active, goes out and plays fetch with the dog, goes grocery shopping, just went to the Paul McCartney concert with my mom and sisters a few weeks ago, etc. He is still there mentally 100%, just takes him a second to get out what he is trying to say... and they say these are the \"final\" stages, lol. He is still an asshole and that is how i know it has not gotten the best of him yet, so i am somewhat appreciative of it. He can still do basically everything anyone else can do besides drive &amp; work. \n\nThe medications they have nowadays drastically slow the process of the onset of HD, and who knows? Maybe by the time we are a bit older they will have found the cure. Just stay positive.\n\nAs far as getting yourself tested - I have chosen not to. My sisters have also chosen not to. You have to ask yourself - would you live your life any differently despite the outcome? The only way it would make you live differently is if it were a positive test. Then that is just all the more ammunition to add to depression, and the stresses life brings already. To me, it is not worth it. \n\nThere is people that die of freak accidents and random diseases all the time. At least with this you know what ya got coming. I used to think i would rather just have my dad die in a car accident or something quick and painless than to watch him progress through this disease, but today i am thankful for it.\n\nYou could go out tomorrow and be shot over $20, or hit by a car and killed, or be exposed to poison, bit by a venomous snake, have a heart attack or a brain aneurysm while you sleep, get mauled by a bear, so many other forms of death to fear. This is just one more uncertain cause of death added to the already seemingly endless list you face everyday. &amp; if that happened, what is testing for HD going to matter? It is not. Just live your life as to would. That is how I think of it at least. Hope this helps you.  My dad is very early, he shakes very slightly but it is unnoticeable unless he holds his hand out for a long time, as well as his memory being terrible. But that is the only symptoms he appears to show, I have learned to stay off the internet with HD unless it is to speak with someone or to find out if a cure is being readied, like you say hopefully there will be one in our lifetime. \n\nI like what you say about the testing, I think if I were to go into testing I would probably do everything to avoid going. And like you said, anything can happen tomorrow.\n\nReally enjoying these replies. They have helped me greatly. Big hugs OP!! My wife has mid to late-mid stage HD. We have been seriously dealing with it for about 10 years now. The last 5 have been rough, but I got to say, her attitude has really made all the difference. She does not really let it get her down. She just does whatever she wants to do. She has not worked in 10 years, but she has still contributed a great deal.\n\nMy advice: \n\nDo not Panic! \n\nHD is not an instant death sentence. It just means that (if you have it) your life will change and your body and mind will become less functional over time. Guess what? That is going to happen to everyone! \n\nTravel now!! Such a big beautiful world out there. Get up and go see it. My wife and I did several big trips abroad once she got diagnosed. \n\nJesus, whatever you do, do not sit around and obsess about HD. If HD does not kill you it will be the drunk bus driver, ISIS, or a nuclear tsunami. We all inhabit these glorious ape meat suits until they wear out. Come to terms with that fact sooner rather than later. \n\nGetting tested is your call, and yours only. The only way somebody should coerce you into getting tested is if you knock somebody up (or get knocked up.) \n\nExcercise! \n\nMy wife started doing yoga on a regular basis and her neurologist is constantly impressed with her physical condition. \n\nDude (or dudette) please do not let this fucking stupid autoimmune disease take your youth. Grab life by the balls and own it. This is your life, not HD's life. \n\nWe love you OP! \n\nFeel free to PM me if you would like more of my insane ramblings  That was a damn good rambling!\n\nI honestly appreciate and really enjoyed what you are said, your wife sounds like an outstanding human being. I am trying to adapt this attitude, and your story is truly inspiring. I am now starting to catch up on opportunities missed because of HD within my family.\n\nAgain, thank you for the support. And I will take what you said on board.\n\nPs. I am a dude. \ud83d\ude01 You could get tested and be negative &amp; have relief. Or if you test positive you will be going through the same stress and emotions it seems you are currently facing so why not find out? \n\nJust IMO", "Should I get tested? Hello\n\nI am a 20 year old male, my grandad had HD but my dad never got tested and as far as I am aware has shown no signs up to 45+, I fear however that I am currently developing the disease. My grades in school from the age of 16 have gone from near-perfect to mediocre. I feel slow to pick up on things and learn new skills, I misremember things often and find it hard to come up with things to say in conversation. As far as I can tell my movement is fine, and I have no tremors. I have constant migraines and am irritated by everything and everyone, my brain feels like its being stabbed when i hear people eat and I wonder if this is anything to do with HD.\n\nThanks I do not know what to suggest other than therapy before hand man\n\n22 yo male untested, if ever want to message me and talk I am here :) Hey, obviously it is a very personal decision so no one can tell you what you should do. But its something to consider. \n\nI think if you were to get tested tho you probably should discuss it with your father too because if you have the gene, then so will he. So you will know he has Huntington's before he does which if you did not discuss the test with him before, woudl put you in a difficult position.\n\nWhat your experimenting is not for sure Huntington's and I think we tend to notice those things more becusee we know were at risk. But it could be nothing. Have you been able talk to any professionals about how you feel?\n\nI am 20 m untested so I can relate to what your saying honestly. Happy to chat anytime. I would say many of the symptoms you are experiencing would fall under depression/anxiety, which is also a symptom of Huntington\u2019s. But I would try to treat yourself for these first before considering getting tested. \n\nIt sounds like there is a decent chance you do not have it if your dad is 45 with no symptoms.\n\nIt is good that you are aware of what is going on though. You should keep track of everything and talk to your doctor about seeing a therapist and possibly meds for depression. This would be waaaaaay easier than the Huntington\u2019s route. That test should be a last resort in my opinion. \n\nBest of luck! Getting tested is never going to be a simple decision to make, but based on your situation, your chances of being symptomatic at such a young age would be unlikely, since your dad is not showing symptoms.\n\nIt sounds like some of the problems you are having could be due to general anxiety or depression, in my opinion, though I would recommend seeing a therapist if you are in the position to do so.\n\nYour mention of being irritated by people eating, however, made me think that you could have misophonia. I am by no means an expert, but my close friend and roommate has misophonia so I have a bit of experience with it.\n\nIt is different for everyone who is diagnosed with it, but one of the main triggers is eating sounds. It is often more than an irritation and more of an intense flight or fight response that is mostly involuntary. It can also come with other sensory triggers, which might seem completely normal and not irritating to other people.\n\nAgain, I would recommend getting an expert's opinion if possible. Being at risk for HD is never easy, no matter the likelihood of having it. I wish you all the best.\n\nFeel free to send me a PM if you ever need someone to talk to. At 20 I would say what you are experiencing is just a bit of anxiety. Talking to someone professionally would help. I found out at 17 that my dad has it and did not get tested until I was 30. It was a tough decision and I talked it out with a bunch of close friends and family members. \nIf you are going to get tested just make sure you have a few things in order. I know it is early and I was not thinking about it at that age but you might want to look into life and health insurance first, since they may give you a hard time after the fact. Always around for a talk, and I am happy to hear your father shows no signs. My dad\u2019s in the end stages and it is hard. Do not sweat it, most of what you are feeling is in your head. Hope this helps. If you are at risk, I always say, unequivocally, get tested. It is always better to know. Absolutely! You might live in fear of a disease you might have or not your whole life, while not recognizing  the real problems. You might even find out you have nothing to worry about. &gt;It sounds like there is a decent chance you do not have it if your dad is 45 with no symptoms.\n\nHate to be the bearer of bad news but chances are still 50/50. I would say you may want to avoid the test for now but if you feel you should or need to, talk with a Huntington's counselor about possible ramifications, re: medical insurance, ability to obtain a mortgage  etc. Would not want any unforeseen consequences.\n\nFor the record Huntington's is only part of my life because my wife is living with it. Her Mother, Grandmother, one brother and several aunts and uncles had it. One brother tested negative. Her children (M 42 &amp; F 38) have opted to not test at present.\n\nI wish you and your Father all the best. Yes, but that is only if the dad has it. Based on what the OP said, as of right now the dad does not have it. It is very promising that the dad is 45 with no symptoms. Of course there is still a chance but most show symptoms by that age. \n\nThat is why I said there is a decent chance they do not have it. Hmmm... TIL\nThanks My mom's symptoms did not show up until she was 48.  I got to be honest and get a little pissed at your dad, there is no reason  he should not have gotten test at least for your sake, and that of any  siblings you may have. I did it immediately because I knew my kids would  be at risk. When I found out I had it, I got fixed so I could not have  kids and we used a donor after that. It was too late for my 1st born  tho, who turned 21 yesterday. We found out shortly after his 18th bday  (his choice of course), he also has it. Sucks, but man I cannot imagine going through life worrying about myself and all my kids. And mine did not show up until she was almost 60. All I am saying is that it is not as common. Most get diagnosed in their 30s and 40s. \n\nI am trying to help this person stay positive and see there is a chance that their dad does not have it. And if the dad does not have it, then they do not. HD usually will not come on this early in life unless you have extremely high numbers, or a childhood form but that is much more intense. Your dad might not show symptoms until much later in life, my dad got visibly sick around 45-50, his dad 55-60 so the timing really depends on the individual. I still think it could be a good idea to get tested just to be sure, and ease that anxiety that you have about this, especially if you want to have children in the future. \n\nEdit: also if you want to talk about the testing process or need to just talk about anything, I am always available! These are possible symptoms of HD, but they could also be caused by so many other things. Depression, anxiety, and so on. If you have migraines often, it is pretty understandable that you would feel irritated, as well. (And afaik migraines are not a symptom of HD.) Can you see a neurologist? They might be able to ease some of the worries you are having about HD.   \n\n\nTesting is an extremely personal choice, so I cannot give you advice on that one way or another... but if you would like to chat about the testing process at any point, I would be happy to talk about it.   \n\n\nI am 29 now, and I got tested when I was a bit younger than you (19) and had a pretty hard time afterwards. I would say it took me a good 5-6 years to begin to be able to cope with the diagnosis. And there are, of course, things to consider at such a young age (if you do happen to test positive). For example, your peers will not be able to relate to a lot of the struggles  you will be going through. Everyone will be thinking about college, careers, and getting married while you are planning what to do with the time that you have left. It can feel very isolating to experience that.   \n\n\nThe only big advice I have for getting tested is to make sure you have lots of support (genetic counseling, therapy, a medical team, family, etc) if you decide to get tested. I underestimated my need for that kind of thing when I was younger and suffered a lot because of it.   \n\n\nGood luck, and feel free to reach out anytime if you want to chat Assuming your dad is positive, if he has not shown any symptoms at 45 then it is highly unlikely (almost improbable) that you would be experiencing symptoms now. Like others have said, it is most likely going to be anxiety/overthinking. If you had what we call juvenile HD, you would be experiencing severe symptoms (in a wheelchair with a feeding tube) from a very young age. If you do not have juvenile HD, it is very rare to develop symptoms between that 20-40 year range.\n\n(I study HD for a living).\n\nThat said, there are many individuals who develop HD symptoms in their 50s and 60s and even 70s, so your dad is not out of the woods, but I am hoping you both are negative!", "My twin tested positive today. I always thought we would get tested together but things are different this year. He called us earlier to let us know. Mum has Parkinson\u2019s, Dad died when I was 18 to this fucking disease. I am the only one of four brothers who has not been tested.  So far only one good result. My life is screwed up enough that I would take his place in an instant. I would give anything to take his place but I cannot. I am sorry this is happening to you and your family. I would start trying to look into trials, see which ones are available in you area/ your brother\u2019s, and just be there for support as best you can. Also looking into going to a psychologist to talk about these things is incredibly helpful and I cannot recommend it enough! Again my heart goes out to you and I hope I have been of some help. Is he your identical twin or your fraternal twin? I am assuming fraternal since OP believes his status is still unknown... Fraternal. He is the best brother. Married and about to have kids but this has screwed up their plans. We have twins and one tested +. The other started thinking she had it, but some study led her to question that. She is clear so far and the twin is 2 years into physical twitching. That is what I was getting at... That is so painful to see the one you love most in pain, and having that unknown for yourself. I am so sorry for this cards you got dealt  in life.  A very hard trial indeed. Stay strong. Keep progressing, life is still beautiful and meaningful. You guys can still do so much, live so much, serve so much, grow so much. Stay strong and persevere until the end. Even siblings that have it often do not progress in the same way at the same rate.

I pray that you are able to eventually heal. If it is ok with you I will share your comment in my circle of friends so J is visible to others too. thank you for the kind words, I will be OK, more importantly her suffering is over...please share Done Here is a big hug for you. Oh that sounds great! What do you like to cook? My partner and I have decided to cook something new every week for a while. Today is homemade bao buns and sticky pork. Thanks for the post.

So sorry to hear. Virtual hugs. I lost my Bubee in 2020 to HD. \n\nYour friend was lucky to have you. Being an HD caregiver takes so much emotional energy, patience, and love. That sure sounds like family to me. Yeah the bus thing is technically correct but utterly unhelpful. And the fact is that unless something else takes you out, like a bus, \ud83d\ude10 then you *will* get symptoms if you have the mutation. And there probably will not really be better and worse days. The decline will start and go from there. HD differs from a lot of diseases that way. I would you have not yet, you may also get tired of being an HD evangelist, helping the world understand better.\n\nFor a little irreverent distraction, you could take a listen to  a song my brother wrote a while ago. \n\n\nWith my Mom it helped a little to remind myself that her mental decline was a real actual thing and her inability to remember or manage basic things was an actual fact. It crushed me at times, yet it did help me focused on what would work best with her. Sad as it is, you might want to just move on when she cannot remember something. If she cannot remember, she cannot remember. Thank You, I think only ones who went through this can truly understand. Thank You", "A probably typical vent. Hi everyone,\n\nI thought I would message here because I suddenly find myself in an unexpected and hard to comprehend place. Sorry if it is long: it is all a bit of a vent.\n\nMyself and my partner were going to start trying for a baby during lockdown after our first home purchase fell through. Later that week, we had news that Huntington\u2019s \u2018might\u2019 be in the family which came about after my dad going through neurology appointments for stroke-like symptoms (slurring speech, choking, stumbling, some cognitive slips)\n\nI pushed through my concerns about Huntington\u2019s. I will not ethically have children until I can rule this out. My family initially assumed I was being overly sensitive, but I am glad I persevered with relaying my concerns. At this time, my only thought was my future children. I am the wrong side of 35  so the last thing we want is to delay this. It is disappointing, but the right thing to do.\n\nMoving onto this week, I moved into my new (future family) home on Wednesday with my partner. The sad news is that the day before, my dad was confirmed as having full penetrance Huntington\u2019s. I was really hoping having gotten to his 70\u2019s he most likely had a stroke.\n\nI feel rubbish that the first day of the rest of mine and my partners life started with the news that it might not be for as long as we would hoped. \n\nI feel angry. I am concerned about my partner and being a burden to him and our hopeful kids. Im angry that I have to put that on hold when we are not so young any more. I am concerned for my siblings. At least one of us statistically will have it, though I hope it is none of us. \n\nThere is so much going through my mind right now. I am trying so hard to focus on the house and the excitement, but the reality of what we may have to face creeps in as the initial excitement wears off.\n\nIt is like a fog that creeps in. I bat it away, and it dissipates for a short while. Eventually, the fog creeps in with increasing frequency. I expect it will not go away until I know what my result is. What does batting your hand do against the fog anyway? The fog is just there right? It is just a matter of fact that it is either there or not there. It is just fact. It is either or. I am either going to have to deal with this or I am not. But what I do know, is that it feels like a trauma even having to question whether it is a thing.\n\nI am ok this week, but I feel like I am riding on the new house adrenaline. What will happen next week when I am back at work and do not see the point of it until I can digest the gravity of a shortened and not very nice end of life? It seems a lot to deal with.\n\nI understand there is a 50/50. I feel angry that the choice (if positive) will be \u2018this will take you out slowly and cruelly assuming nothing else does.\u2019 It means it is the best I can hope for. Or if I am clear, I can expect it will be likely for a sibling to have to experience this instead. I have spent since my teens struggling with depression and anxiety to varying extents. I finally feel like I have got a handle on it and this is what happens? It just does not seem fair.\n\nI feel sad that my partner has cried too. He feels like he cannot protect me. What can I do apart from give him the option to leave if he wants to? It is not what he signed up for. He does not want to leave, however, and would choose to have no children if it meant a fuller life together. I would like children, but even with IVF I would be aware of burdening teens with a potentially sick mother. It is not a choice they would have. I have suggested we both get counselling, and that he also he involved in the genetic councelling at every step. He is as impacted by this as much as I am. \n\nI am not the kind of person that can ignore this. Thinking positive did not help my dads results, so the only way is a harsh reality of what may or may not be. It is blunt, it is harsh, but those are the cards I have been dealt right? All those unknowns. I am just in between right now. \n\nI do not know what I am asking right now. It is probably too fresh to collate into questions. \n\n I know I want to get tested for the sake of my family, and for the sake of my own mind. I do not want the stress of wondering if every small blip is a sign of Huntington\u2019s.\n\nI get the 50/50, and I get the clear benefits of councelling. I also feel like the odds are the odds, and nothing changes that except for my own decision to worry or to make the most of things. I will choose to make the most of it soon I am sure. I WILL be ok no matter what. That I can be sure of, because my previous mental health experiences have set me up to be stronger and more resilient.\n\nI suppose if I could ask anything:\nIs there anyone that can share with me how they felt during the initial discovery and subsequent \u2018unknown\u2019 time? I expect this is all completely normal, and I hold no guilt over how I feel right now. \n\nThanks for listening! I really appreciate the vent! The range of emotions you are experiencing in light of this news is valid, however, if your dad made it into his 70s without showing symptoms he likely has a relatively low # of CAG repeats, which means if you or any of your siblings has inherited HD you will also likely have a low #. This means you have 30+ years ahead of you, symptom free, and in that time there will no doubt be dramatic advancements in treatments for HD that you will benefit from. An effective treatment and maybe even cure are somewhere from 2-10 years away. Even in the worst case scenario you will be in a position to benefit, which is something most people living with the disease now or who will develop symptoms in the next few years might not get. You are lucky - even if you do have HD it most likely will never affect you. Get the test to see if you are gene positive and use that information to determine whether you should conceive your children with IVF. You can still have the future with children you imagined for yourself. With IVF they can test for HD before transferring an embryo. It is not an easy or cheap journey, but worth it. I am positive for Huntington's and just had IVF hd-free twins, and it was worth everything.\n\nAlso, your path, if positive will likely be like your affected parent, so to your 70s which is like, average lifespan anyway.\n\nNot trying to minimize your justified raw pain, just hoping you can find comfort in information. I totally understand how you feel. Living life is difficult enough, to have it taken away from you, it is terrifying.\n\n&gt;It is like a fog that creeps in.\n\nI feel this same psychological phenomenon. A wound that is growing in my mind, that feels like continual screaming. I can hear it echo sometimes and it is a frightening thing to feel. It makes me think that perhaps being tested was not the right thing to do. That knowing of your status is just another psychological doom. Thanks for your reply. How did you find having twins? I can imagine since it is a long process that it would make sense to have two kids if possible. What made you choose to have two over one? Thanks for your reply. \n\nMy dad has 40 repeats. From what I understand, the gene is a lot more unstable at 40+ and is more likely to expand in the subsequent generations. \nI have also read that anyone with 40+ repeats can be inconsistent comparatively in their experiences, whilst 35/39 or low penetrance are the people like to a) follow their parents and b) most likely to not experience symptoms? \n\nThe trials are interesting and you are right - medical advances may well benefit me and I see hope there.\n\nPlease feel free to correct me if I am wrong - it is all new to me. I can understand where you are coming from. Did you go through the councelling prior to getting tested? I am open minded that I may change my mind. None of how I feel is set in stone right now. I would say I hope you come to terms with it, but it is ok if you do not too. After all the genetic testing we had two embryos. We decided we were not afraid of twins and were not likely to come back to use the second embryo if the first took. Mostly because of cost, but also timeline. I am 35, I will not be fertile much longer. More importantly, i want the kids to be old enough when I get sick that they have Good memories of before I was sick. \n\nThe twins are 12 weeks old now. And I was right about not wanting to go back for more. It was a rough pregnancy and birth (possibly mostly because it was twins). I had a nightmare delivery, including the epidural not working on the operating table... So glad I have no reason to consider doing it again.\n\nTwins are really hard though, so do not take that choice lightly if you have it. Holding two happy or sleeping babies at once is the most amazing thing ever, though. No regrets. Thank you for sharing, and huge congratulations to you and your new family!! \nI have had similar thoughts around whether I would opt for twins since you are there you may as well, but I do have concerns about the various impact as you say.\n\nWe will cross that bridge when/if we get to it, but I am reassured that my concerns are rational. We can loosely plan some what ifs now, which will make things easier down the road.\n\nI hope you have many happy years of making memories together. Would you mind if I message you in the future around your genetic testing and IVF journey? I will probably have some questions if it comes to be the route we go down. I would be happy to talk about it. Yes I did but I already knew too much about the disease itself and I made the mistake of not listening. Congrats on the new place! Celebrate the wins, especially when things feel rubbish! \n\nI have so much I am happy to share! I decided, this year, at 25 I wanted to find out. For context on the process, I am in Australia. \n\nI had long and emotional conversations with my close friends, family and partner (and asked them all to keep this quiet) about how I felt and how they felt about getting tested for HD. I started seeing my GP and Psychologist regularly and was referred to the genetic testing clinic in my area. This process get terrifying! They did 3 sessions, each an hour, with a social worker and examined my family history, mental health, suicide risk and so on before referring me for the blood test. All very important but daunting. \n\nOnce I had the blood test, it was a few months wait to find out the result. Unfortunately with COVID this also meant everything was on zoom and was a slower and less personal process. I found out I have 41 repeats and I was absolutely shattered at the time. I honestly feel like I went through the whole 7 stages of grieving and started to get really anxious and sad all the time. I kept up the psych regularly and took 2 weeks off work from results day. \n\nA few months on, I am much more balanced again. I have seen the neurologist who will be managing me and he is a guru in the HD world. The appointments with him have been incredibly optimistic and insightful, I am asymptomatic and will check in with him every 1-2 months. I have been in contact with IVF clinics that specialise and it is largely rebatable through specific places too (I am talking around $200 a cycle + medication). \n\nMy brother is yet to find out and that is tough and comes with other fears too. \n\nAll in all, I am so happy I know now. Huntingtons comes with so many unknowns but I now have a different appreciation for the life I have and the wellness that is in my control. You will be okay, humans are more resilient than we realise. In saying that, it is so important to establish support networks that are sustainable.\n\nI have good weeks and bad weeks. I avoid tapping into the injustice of the disease because that is a downward spiral for me. The research in HD and the possible interventions are extremely promising and the research findings will be available within 2 years! \n\nI am sorry if this was a big word dump! I am more than happy to chat about any part of the process!", "26 years old and thinking about getting tested. Hi all I have been struggling with this thought for a good chunk of my life as I am sure many of you do as well. My mother passed away from Huntington's disease and it has been a constant millstone around my neck ever since she was first diagnosed. I have become increasingly depressed and withdrawn recently thinking about my future prospects and the constant fear of being tested positive. The depression has greatly impacted my ability to work at my job and I am at a loss of what to do. My family constantly tells me that I should not test myself but I am not sure what I should do. Hey man, sorry for your loss \u2665\ufe0f Have you tried writing down the pros and cons for yourself and how each would make you feel, maybe pre-testing therapy is an option or speaking to a support worker? \n\nGoodluck boss I would say do not get tested because you are depressed you might be positive. This will only mean if you are positive you are going to fall even further. They also say irrelevant of the result most people are depressed for 6months after so this again would not bode well if you are already not well my mental health wise.\n\nI (f26) have not been tested yet but I plan to when my life is as stable as it possibly can be e.g. ideally: When I own a house, in a career where I have finished my trainin, and have a partner who I think I will be spending the rest of my life with. That way I will be ready to have a huge spanner thrown at me.\n\nIt is also important to know that there is really promising human trials going on for a drug that will help and even stop symptoms. If you do have it by the time you are showing symptoms there might be something to stop it.\n\nSorry for your loss. Just remember it is one day at a time. Thanks for the advice. I have been thinking about seeing a therapist as I have become increasingly depressed. I never spoke to a professional about my feelings and I think it might give me better insight. Thank you for the advice. I am worried about my depression increasing as well, but it is already pretty bad as it is. I think I should seek a therapist to help me navigate these feelings and perhaps to get on some anti-depressants. It sounds like you are thinking practically and going in the right direction. Invest in yourself. Therapy and anti ds are a great shout. Also if you can talk to friends and family. It is a tough time and if you can do not go through it alone. Thanks for the kind words, they truly mean a lot to me. Having witnessed the disease and living with the fear of having it makes you feel truly alone. I commend your strength and optimism, hopefully I can reach that feeling as well. My advice, if it is something available to you depending on where you live is genetic counselling. I found it very helpful at the beginning of my testing process. She was very kind and we talked through all the outcomes, my feelings about getting tested, how I might react with certain results and talked about some family stuff. I think talking even talking to a regular therapist might benefit you as well, but if you are able to see a genetic counselling I think that would be a good starting point to get more informed about the testing process and can decide from there whether or not you want to continue. Do you\nMind telling me what supplements you take NAC, vit E, biotin, fish oil, vit D, chlorella and L-argine Oh! And also CBD Thank you so much!! I am gene positive so far no symptoms but want to start taking care of myself!! I am also not having symptoms. I hope the supplements help you! (And me too haha) I also have heard of this mushroom supplement called lions mane ( something like that)  \n\nA film director named marianna palka talks about it I actually was making my own lions mane mushroom supplements for a while! I just have not been due to COVID and not being able to get the mushrooms from the mushroom grower. Wow your doing great!!", "Research: Allele-selective transcriptional repression of mutant HTT for the treatment of Huntington\u2019s disease  Super cool. Zinc fingers \u2014 very interesting! Would be cool to read more than just the abstract. Oh I did not even notice it was not open source :( I have a little commentary from one of the authors: \"Work started at Sangamo in 2011. We discovered the very first allele-specific ZFP-TF to selectively downregulate the mutant allele in Huntington's disease. Something we did not think would work, as both alleles differ in number of CAG repeats.  8 years later it is finally in print! There are now promising allele-specific ASOs from Ionis that are looking good in the clinic, but this therapy still has a chance to be more of a 'one shot' treatment verses needing repeat doses of ASOs.\" It is so crazy as someone outside the realm of research how long all of this takes to develop. The ASOs have taken decades to get to where they are today and they are are still working on proving their efficacy. Makes me worried if I think about it too much - so I try to just maintain a casual curiosity. you can never think too much about science", "My wife was diagnosed recently and I do not know what to do. I cant handle it. I was going to start a family. I am having trouble not thinking about it and I am starting to lose hope.", "New here- new to HD Hi all,\nI do not have HD. my fiance's mother has HD. my fiance believes she may or may not have it, and does not want to get tested. She is open to talking to a genetic counselor. My question is, if she has it what does that mean for us? Would he have our children? Would insurance cover IVF in America of she had a diagnosis? Reading about IVF sounds very expensive and low success rate but successful at elimination of the gene. Thanks What is her mothers CAG count? That is the level of mutation on the gene. It will give you an idea of when symptoms can show up. Expect mental symptoms a decade earlier than physical symptoms. A lot of variability though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can delay onset some with healthy living. Keep stress low. Sleep high. Lots of vegies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy lady has it and we are 50s. She has a 37 CAG, one of the lowest that will show problems. Physically she is a bit unsteady on her feet and her sleep is very poor. Mentally she is quick to anger and criticize. She can not solve many problems. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne son looked at IVF embryo selection, insurance did not cover. It would have been 25k. If she does get tested, do it anonymously and pay out of pocket. Sign up for life insurance and long term care insurance. Do your best to keep it off the medial record as long as possible. \n\nYou can do IVF do completely remove the chance of passing it on to your kids. Otherwise they have a 50/50 chance. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this. Your situation is what I went though about a year ago. \n\nBest of luck!", "Huntington's awareness twitter page  If anyone could drop a follow it would be much appreciated, this is for a school project and it would be great to have a couple followers on the account! I know I misspelled awareness in the username, so please disregard that! Just for a little background information, my grandfather suffers from HD and it means a lot to him and my grandmother when people share information on HD, so I thought I would kill 2 bird with 1 stone and create an awareness twitter page for HD for my citizenship class, and share it with my grandparents! Any suggestions would be a big help! Thank you very much! Dropped you a follow.", "SO got results on friday. Hey there, this is mostly a post about me venting. My GF got her results on friday and they are not good. 42 repeats.\n\nAnd what is even worse, suddenly I am able to see symptoms. In the evening when we are chilling on the couch, her toes will twitch every now and then. This shit scares me.\n\nI was always rather optimistic because she is still young (28) and I am rather confident that scientist will find a cure within the next 10 years. But now I am sure she already is in early stages and now I am wondering if her progress gets worse way faster than expected.\n\nWith my optimism gone I feel so fucking bad, I worry so goddamn much about her, I lay awake at night not being able to let go of all those thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nI dont know how to cope with my feelings right now, I have to be strong, for her.\n\n\nThat is all.. Have a nice day, boys and girls! Man, that sucks. When you know they have it, every little twitch, every little stumble, every little slurred word or slight mood swing makes you wonder. All I can say is relax for now and enjoy what time you have, no matter how long that might be. I know it is not easy though.\n\nGood luck to both of you. I am very sorry for this trying time but please OP do not loose hope. Before you start diagnosing symptoms, help her find a neurologist. They will go through a series of tests and see where she lands on cognitive, psychological and physical scales. Drugs can be given to help with symptoms and believe me, good treatment early one can do wonders. In the mean time, try your best not to look for symptoms. I know this can be next to impossible. We all do it. You drop a coffee cup and you wonder, if you are have an off day or losing dexterity. You have depression symptoms and you wonder if its HD depression or just a blue day and maybe you should take some vitamin D. HD symptoms can be so wide and varied that you will go crazy and convince yourself that the worst possible outcome is eminent.\n\n\nAnother side note. If you can, find an HD support group please check one out.  I am in the US and some of our local charters are amazing. I have gotten to know a lot of folks from my state chapter and its helps immensely to talk with them and share experiences. See about a hope walk in your area. The first time I saw a few hundred people gathered together to help people and families who suffer with this disease I wept tears of gratitude. I know that right now the road looks rough, but she has so many great years left. I myself was diagnosed 8 years ago with a repeat of 43. I still work full time and run a household for a family of 5. The only difference between me and anyone else around is a few medications and the knowledge of how blessed I am for every good day. \n\n\nGood Luke OP Thanks man. Yeah I am actually doing a lot better right now. In the end the diagnosis did not change anything. She is in the same condition she was in one week ago. The only thing that changed is me being super observing right now.. True dat.\n\nI am really grateful for your comment, put things into perspective, at least a little bit.\n\nHang in there, the cure is close :) I feel you man.\nIn a very similar boat. Just got to take everyday as you can and recognise that its special and unique in its own way. With a CAG of 42, it could easily be a couple decades before she is symptomatic. I would highly suggest some professional counseling for both of you. Yeah I know it could be, but I am pretty sure it will not be that long, unfortunately. Sorry to hear the news, but I appreciate your optimistic perspective and hope for the future.  I write this in a lot of these threads, but please reach out to ( who has professionals to work with \"young people\" which includes anyone under the age of 35.   They can provide professional support or connect you with many other resources no matter where you live.  They will also be hosting their inaugural international congress in 2020 in Glasgow Scotland, calling young adults from around the world to congregate to provide support, education, connection while also getting everyone on the same page with the future of HD treatments.  Wish you the best of luck! She only has 42 CAG, which is a low count. She should not have symptoms yet. The twitching is probably something else honestly. Wait until she is in her 40s or 50s until she really starts showing symptoms. Based on some lab tests, a CAG count of 42 has an average age onset of 49 years old. (  I wish it would be that simple, but there are outliers both ways of the median. This charts is by no means a guarantee for age of onset in relation to repeats... She should be lucky that she only has a low CAG count. My mom also has CAG 42, and she is 58 years old and doing great! If your GF had a higher CAG count such as around 44/45 (which makes a HUGE difference in symptoms that come up earlier), then you could actually be more concerned. But luckily she has only 42 CAG.\n\nI myself am 28 years old. I have a higher CAG count of 44. I have zero symptoms so far. And I am a full-time university student taking 6 classes (at a top-ranked school). \n\nI volunteer for a private Parkinson's Research lab. Because I sometimes work closely with scientists who are working on the Parkinson's cure, we talk about Huntington's quite regularly, as there is a huge connection between Parkinson's and Huntington's.  (They do not know I have the HD gene myself.) **They told me that there will be a guaranteed cure for Huntington's Disease that will stop/halt the gene in 5-7 years. Before that, there will be a different cure that will just \"slow down greatly\" the Huntington's Disease in 2-3 years.** (They even disclosed that there will be a cure for Parkinson's in the next 10 years.)\n\nSo... as you should be more hopeful! Your GF is alive today in a decade where medical technology is advancing very rapidly. We will see cures for many diseases in the next 2-10 years! I wish that people did not view HD as a negative disease, when we are so close to a cure or medicinal treatment. It is not the end of the world!\n\n&amp;#x200B; Well her father is 58 too, with a count of 42 and he are not that good, I know that even though hey do not have contact...\n\nI really would love to believe what you are saying but I am definitely sceptical when it comes to statements like that... ;/\n\nBut on the bright side: we got her checked and apparently she is without symptoms,  her motorscore is perfect. My wife (27) is at risk, has not been tested, and I am afraid I have started to see similar small twitches that do not stop when she is sleeping. Her posture, although always a little weird, may be getting worse to. Plus she is convinced she does not have it, so I feel afraid to bring it up, not wanting to get her down. I am really beginning to get overwhelmed and just afraid for the future. I keep trying to be optimistic and pointing to her behavior which has not changed (like being irritable or whatever), but it is really starting to hit me now that she probably has it, and it effing blows, like a lot. I wish you well.", "Putting mother-in-law in assisted living soon. We plan to tell her our plans this weekend. Any advice? My MIL (59,F) has been showing symptoms for many years. She lives on her own and we have more than enough reasons to place her into assisted living. \n\nI am hoping to get advice on how to approach her with this plan and how to keep her calm. She is very emotional and stubborn. She is in total denial of her symptoms. We fear we will have to file for guardianship if she does not cooperate. She is also a bit of a hoarder so we will have to work with her on getting rid of about half her things before the move. \n\nWe are having a meeting with her therapist tomorrow to discuss how to best communicate with her, but I would love the community\u2019s feedback as well. \n\nThanks! Blech. I feel this so deeply. I do not know that I have much advice but I will describe our experience. \n\nMy Mom had HD. Dad was in reasonably good health and of reasonably sound mind until about a year after Mom *should* have been in nursing care. Instead of moving her there, Dad continued with her in independent living and we were mostly powerless. He rejected all reason, all encouragement to look at things differently. He continued like this until he noticed one night that she was no longer in bed and he found her in the garage in most unfortunate circumstances. Nothing immediately life threatening. More like devastatingly humiliating. She was in nursing care almost immediately after that.\n\nHe fought us every step of the way, even when it was clear that *he* needed to move into assisted living.\n\nSo maybe my advice is to approach this not as a Huntington's specific challenge, but more of a situation where your loved one is living in denial. She just happens to be denying her HD symptoms. Maybe you and your therapist can work with that? \n\nI wish you all much grace and patience and am so sorry you have to deal with this. It sucks. Thank you for your thoughtful reply. I am sorry for the experience you had with both your mom and dad. Like your experience, I believe my MIL should have been put in assisted living a year ago. If you were to replace your dad with my husband, our stories would sound fairly similar. \n\nWe have been trying to get her to see rhyme and reason but it is just not working. So when we sit her down this weekend we know it is going to be a total shock to her. She has no clue how much we help her out. She thinks she is fully functioning. We are at the point where we have accepted that this will be a messy time that will be full of pain and hurt feelings. \n\nAny advice on how to make her more comfortable in her new home? We made a point of decorating my Mom's room with items we knew were important to her. Some art with special meaning. Her Mom was a painter so we had one of those paintings repaired and professionally framed. Paid way too much for Grandma's skill level but it was worth every cent. Also photos of friends. Tried to make it feel a bit like home, which is hard to do in a small nursing home room. We put a bird feeder outside her window. \n\nShe was not able to communicate very well at that point but she seemed to like the room well enough.\n\nTry to make it feel special and do it with her input if possible.\n\nIt sounds like it may be challenging for your MIL to choose a relative handful of items. Maybe there is a way to make it into a game or something? \"If you could pick one thing in your house that defines/describes you, what would you choose?\" \n\nKeep us posted! You have a hard decision, I thinks it is easy if your financial situation allows you to have someone help with care at the house for them. \n\nI can only give you my dealing with nursing homes and they are not good. My sister has been to multiple ones, most are not staffed correctly with most patients being neglected and even abused in some cases. And regulated what is that for a nursing home, it is a shame and one of our nations biggest disgrace to our loved ones that should be cared for in their time of need. I feel bad telling you this and hope you have the options of good care in your area. Also I have found that many places will not take HD patients.", "Another article on the HCL Study ", "How do you casually explain HD to somebody who is not aware of the disease? I think as we all know, HD has a relatively low awareness rate. This results in many of us having heard the question \"What is Huntington's?\" numerous times.\n\nPersonally I avoid the subject among friends and acquaintances, as I find it uncomfortable to discuss and a kind of depressing topic to talk about. But sometimes that conversation will lead towards the other person mentioning that they have heard that a genetic disease is running in my family, or that my mom is sick. Or sometimes I will be busy due to having to take care of my mom, and I will have to explain my reason for why i will be absent from a social gathering, meeting or whatever. You get the gist, there are many situations where the conversation might lead to that question.\n\nI could decline to answer, of course, but that just seems rude. The question generally makes me uncomfortable when it is from somebody I do not know too well and I do not want to make a bad impression on them. Responding with \"just Google it\" seems kind of rude aswell, if I am not in a hurry.\n\nI have been looking for something short and concise to avoid the convesation from steering any further into the topic, but have not had great success so far. I have been thinking about using \"It is like ALS combined with Dementia\", but I do not know if that is an accurate depiction of HD since I do not know a lot about those two other diseases.\n\nI guess I am a bit socially inept so I am probaby overthinking this lol, but I think it is important to spread awareness aswell so I do not really want to avoid the topic altogether. Any tips for this sort of conversation is welcome. My go to scientifically inaccurate but functionally helpful explanation: think of it as the worst of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS all mashed up together.\n\nThis is more descriptive of common symptoms than explaining what is actually going on. But it helps people apprehend the impact of HD. They can follow up with their own research if they want. Same here. This is my exact description when people ask what HD is. I usually also explain that it is a brain disease that is slowly breaking up all the connections in his brain, causing his unexpected movements and his behaviour. My stock answer is that it is like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and ALS, but worse, and it is turning my wife\u2019s brain into Swiss cheese. \n\nThat usually shuts them up. Saying it is ALL OF THOSE THINGS (because it is) generally increases people's perverse morbid curiosity about it, just in my experience. So I say: \"It causes me to be neuro-divergent due to the degenerative neurological nature of the disease but I am doing my best. So please try to be patient with me.\" THAT tends to stop people abruptly and they immediately become more invested in a) trying to help me b) overlooking any deficits I have in order to be polite - rather than focusing on the devastating nitty gritty of the catastrophic medical condition Huntington's is. I had a friend that I told about my positive test. He did not really get how serious it was, and tried to be positive. Talked about science advanced so fast, replacement parts. I said, you think I can get a replacement head? He went... Ooooooo. Kind Of helped.\n\nETA, it is also perfectly fine to say 'i would rather not talk about it\" I usually just say, kind of like Alzheimer's but younger. We call it a soup made from ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's with an extra dash of dementia thrown on top for added flavor.  The people who run the HD research center near us have approved that as a short and sweet answer to general laypeople.  We say it is more complex than that, but that they can research on their own if they want, or we can schedule some time to go into more detail of they really want to.\n\nMost people have enough of an understanding of those diseases to get the basic idea.  But I am always willing to make time to talk about HD with people who are interested.  Spread the awareness! I say it is a genetic time bomb that causes neuron death. It is bad enough that I do not like talking about it. If it is something you want to know more about the Wikipedia page is a great start. Can you tell me what you observed early on?  I am so afraid... This pretty much sums it up.  \ud83d\ude15 Neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormally shaped protein Parkinson\u2019s plus dementia plus Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease all in one Hey I am sorry I did not mean to scare you. Are you at risk? Yes.  Found out this weekend I was the product of an affair (Ancestry DNA) and THEN found out bio dad, his siblings and my new half siblings all had/have it.  I am a 52 year old mom with two kids trying to keep this rage and terror under wraps while I get insurance in order to then go for testing.  It seems bio family\u2019s symptoms began at my age and they were either dead or in a nursing home by 60.  Waiting is terrifying.  Worrying about my children is devastating.  There seems to be no checklist of symptoms-all symptoms sound like every middle-aged person I know! I am just crumbling.\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\udc94 PM me I typically compare it to ALS after a constant battle with my mom who always compares it to MS.", "Is it a symptom I am 21. I have this thing since my early teens at least where when I am lying on my bed, my feet move unconsciously. It is a steady movement (up and downs and up and downs) that happens to one foot at a times. I can stop but I feel a little discomfort when I force my feet to be still.  I only have this when I am lying down, and I have no other symptoms of HD. Should I worry? What do yall think? Do you have a family history? Were you genetically tested? If the answer to the first question is no, then you do not have HD. If you have a family history of HD then you can become anxious about every movement your body makes, and convince yourself that you have it. I would highly recommend getting tested with genetic counseling. do not overthink it. i am 22 with a family history of HD and i do the same exact thing... but so does my boyfriend who does not have a family history of HD. and so does my best friend who also does not have a family history of HD. humans twitch. \n\nif you are really worried though i suggest looking into getting tested because the thought of \"oh god am i having early onset symptoms?\" will never go away unless you know for sure :( at least that is how it is for me anyway Hi! I am 21 and at risk too. It is very common for those of us at risk to fixate on things and create symptoms. I know how you feel and I do it all the time.\n\nMovements like you described sound more like symptoms of anxiety, especially if you have no other symptoms of HD.\n\nIf you can talk to anyone in your life about how you are feeling or if you have access to therapy it could be beneficial to managing \"symptom searching\" as I call it.\n\nWish you all the best. If you do not have a family history of HD, you have nothing to worry about. This may indeed be symptom-seeking. Have you been thinking through getting tested for HD recently? Is this something you have discussed with anyone in your life?\n\nFor what it is worth, it could be restless leg syndrome. I have RLS, and I do not have HD. It could be worth checking out. It is like an irresistible urge to move your feet or legs. I am 45 (CAG 39) and started having face twitching and had the same worry.  It was stress.  \n\nI have been watching my mom die of HD (68 / CAG 40) and things like chorea, mental / psychological decline, slurred speech, poor balance, trouble swallowing, etc develop slowly over time and is not an overnight thing.  Also, there are usually other symptoms that accompany chorea (or due to chorea) such as poor balance, dropping things, and emotional instability. For me and my family, HD is a slow killer.  Your mileage may vary.  I think I remember reading that your CAG repeat # is a good indicator of how early you will show symptoms and how quickly it will process. \n\nWe started noticing symptoms with my mom when she was 56.  Twelve years ago.  She is still with us but is deteriorating at a steady pace.\n\nWant to know for sure or have a history of HD in your family?  Take the steps to get tested and surround yourself with support before/during/after the genetic testing. \n\nI am not a good resource on how \"fight back\" but I am sure the hdsa.org site has some info on how to join a study.  In the past, they were always looking for people to enter various studies. I doubt that has changed much.  You DID NOT need to have HD to enter the study. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3", "Resources for caring / care help?

We are at loss, waiting on results from CVS on the placenta to determine if your future child is affected. I do not know what we should do knowing that there is a chance that our future baby has the possibility of having HD.... Hey man, I suppose there is nothing you can do really besides hope for the best, be there for your wife and her there for you. Maybe try and contact your countries Huntington Association if you have not already they might be able to help. If your wife has 38 repeats, honestly I feel like you should not be that worried. Typically when the child inherits the gene from the mother they inherit a similar CAG repeat (when it is from the father the number is CAG repeat number is higher than the father.) This means that even if your kid does inherit the gene they likely will not exhibit symptoms for like 60 years (and maybe not even at all). Given the state of the medicine today, in 60 years I am thinking things will likely be pretty manageable, if not completely cured. Even if the medicine is the same, someone can live a valuable life in 60 years, my aunt just died at 59 and I am certain she does not regret anything.\n\nFor the record my wife has a repeat of 51 (onset about late 20s early 30s, we are 28 now) and cannot get pregnant at all because we are participating in clinical trials. I say go for it and do not even feel bad about it! I am so sorry. There is nothing to be done but to have faith that everything will be ok, the good news is that by the time your baby is old enough to even have onset symptoms there will probably be a cure. Have faith, you guys are not alone. I am sorry buddy, in my opinion living with a 50 year old loosing her thinking abilities; if the child is positive; abort. It is a heart breaking thing to do, but you can do IVF on the next one and remove this disease from the next generation. 38 is pretty low and your wife can be a great grandmother as she may only see bad stuff in her later 60s, but mutations have a &gt;10% chance of increasing. Most abortions are delaying child birth, for the small solace that provides. My cags is the same as my dad, where I got it, so I do not think that part is true. It is definitely not an iron law, but on average it does seem to be the case. See the table here: ( , specifically the row \"Mean Repeat Length Change\" and compare females to males. It is partially to mostly true. The repeat is more likely to expand when passed from a father to child; it is more likely to stay the same when passed from mother to child. Sometimes it even contracts. Longer repeats are also more likely to expand. All of this is just probability and likelihood though; a mother can pass down an expanded repeat and a father can pass down the same repeat or a contracted repeat. \n\nBecause citations matter: ( is a UC Davis info site for non-scientists. ( is paper from a scientific journal that is not behind a firewall. Table 2 is likely the most relevant here. Ooo fascinating. I did not know the chance of dropping CAGs was so high. I mean I knew it was possible... \n\nAnyway, this thread is probably the wrong place to get crabby about perceived misinformation. (My dad's sister swears to this day women cannot get it. Which is... Well... I am female and have it, so. Yeah.)\n\nSorry OP. For everything you are going through. If the fetus is positive but you have fallen in love and cannot terminate, that is ok too. I hope it is negative though! 38 repeats is actually not as devastating as it might seem. That is low when it comes to The number of repeats. \n\nWe found out my husband has 43 repeats 3 months after we had our daughter. Now we have to wait until she can make the decision for herself. \n\nI know this is hard. I am still mourning this news. Please rest easy knowing that with her number of repeats she may never show symptoms in her lifetime. Either way, I know this is hard. You are not alone. The bright side is that is a very low repeat number meaning incidence should be later in life.\n\nAs far as the baby, that is a personal decision. Given your wife's low repeat number, personally, I would be inclined to go through with the pregnancy. I would definitely pursue IVF if you desire any more children, though. First, I am so sorry if your wife\u2019s diagnosis. I truly hope there is a cure before your wife has any symptoms.\n\nPersonally, I would not test the baby unless you would abort if the child was positive. There is a reason the majority of people do not get tested (they do not want to live knowing they would get it). \n\nAlso, I know the general consensus is that a mother passing HD to a child is the same number of repeats, but not in my family (CAG 43/44 for my mom and 47 for my brother). It is the same thing every doctor told my brother and I when we were testing, so it was a harder pill to swallow when the count went up. Hi, I work at HDYO, I am guessing that your wife has not been diagnosed with symptoms of HD but has taken a genetic test to say she will get HD in the future? As others have said, 38 repeats is low for someone with HD, she will likely be symptomatic at an older age than most who have HD. It would of course be great if your baby does not have HD but even if it does the repeat will be very similar to the mother's 38, so they would not get HD again until they are much older. Research is going very well for HD with gene therapy trials happening now in humans and looking promising so your baby, if it does have HD, would have many  decades for research to advance along. \n\nMatt My wife is 38/15 , hoping that we will get lucky on this genetic lottery :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we knew earlier, would have done IVF, but that has a lot of other complications, never thought that I would have to face such difficult decisions in life.. Thank you all for kinds words! I really appreciate it. We got results today...we both passed a low number of repeats to our baby: 15 and 19, there was also another chance of SCA8 high number (another terrible genetic error that leads to ataxia), and we got lucky on that one. Basically, we hit the 25% chance of getting lucky with getting these two good genes passing through. It is a massive relief, this was definitely the hardest week of us being together for almost 15 years... Now we have to hope that everything else is going to go well with pregnancy and the onset of HD for my wife will come at a later age, but for now, we will cherish this happy streak of luck. we got extremely lucky! 15/19! I am so glad for you. As for the wife, keep things really healthy and low stress. Push her to take up a new sport every year. If you can, get her to start spyrometer training early to build up the throat and breathing.  With the way drug trials are going she might never see symptoms and just have a shot in the spine every month (perhaps less often).", "Younger sister (27) diagnosed with HD without any family history As the title says, my family just found out my younger sister has HD (51 CAG repeats). She is 27, and has been showing symptoms for a couple years, but was not able to get diagnosed because my family has no history of HD. She was actually initially diagnosed with MS, but as her symptoms changed they decided to test for HD to \"cross their t's and dot their i's\" not expecting a positive result because of our lack of family history. The youngest age of death of any of my grandparents was 79 (died of glioblastoma, other three lived into their 90s), my parents are currently in their 60s with no symptoms, and no aunts/uncles/cousins have shown any symptoms at all. \n\nWe got my sisters diagnosis 4 days ago. It feels like I was hit by a train. My younger sister and I are very close, and her progressive, previously undiagnosed illness has been very hard on me, my other two sisters, and my parents. In the last 6 months it feels like it has really ramped up, with her now showing some cognitive loss and her motor function really decreasing (now recognized as very textbook chorea form movements). And to find out for sure what it is and that she is not ever going to get better is hard enough, but now I may eventually go through the same thing.\n\nMy two older sisters (32 and 31) have both already gotten their blood drawn to be tested and so have my two parents. I (29) just had cancer genetic screening done a couple months ago, so I was able to talk with my genetic counselor a couple days ago and was referred to the HD center near me and am in the process of setting up an appointment. I thankfully already have life insurance and I am trying to not make a knee jerk decision to get tested before speaking to an HD expert since I cannot un-know the result.\n\nBut right now it is just so hard. I am sad about my sister and I feel like my future is gone. I know that it might not be, but I am a very future oriented person and my wife and I were planning on starting our family at the end of next year. I cannot stop myself from thinking of all the things in my future children's lives that I may miss, and leaving my wife behind. We are celebrating our first wedding anniversary this year. It feels disingenuous to hope or dream of the future anymore, because it may all be gone.\n\nI am sorry if this is too dark, I am just really lost right now. I have not been able to find a lot on people who have no family history at all of HD. I am not sure how to get through everyday without dwelling on all of these feelings of loss. Any tips on how to change my mindset or good strategies for compartmentalization, or what the grieving process was like I think would be helpful. First time I have ever commented on anything on reddit I think but if I can offer any advice I will. I have never heard of a case like the one you are talking with no family history but I do not know much about that side of it so I will leave that to someone else.\n\nI am similar in that I would never met my dad or his family at all and suddenly found out when I was about 23 that he had HD and the implications for me. For 5 years or so I did not get tested or really tell many people including the family I knew. In hindsight that information impacted me in a lot of ways for that five years and I did not deal well with it - i had given myself symptoms even which made me sure i had it. I got tested last year and thankfully it was negative. I got tested because I felt I had more to gain than to lose - I had accepted that I probably had the disease and my life was the worse for the worry and anguish anyway so a positive test result would not have hit me so hard at that point. \n\nThe only advice I could give is that it is very personal a decision - I always thought that if the information that I may have it starts to seriously detrimentally impact my life, then I need to get tested. But I think most people do not get tested and some are able to live with that information positively without letting it impact them. \n\nAnd one thing that as I was coming up to my test result that helped me - start thinking about the things you will do after your result no matter what it is - what are you going to do in your career, what holidays will you take, even where are you going out for dinner next week. It helps to remember that life goes on after a test result. I actually was a big fan of a tv show where one of the characters had HD and as silly as it sounds watching that actually helped me - it made me realise you can have the disease and still live life and be a positive or interesting person. \n\nHopefully given the lack of family history, you and the rest of your family are unlikely to have it \ud83d\udc4d I am sorry to say this, but if there is not any family history it means that your sister's mother cheated on your sister's father with a man that is positive for HD. Or a relative died before symptoms started showing, or their repeat was very low and they attributed the symptoms to some other disease, could be something else other than that (hopefully for their sake) From OP:\n\n&gt;The youngest age of death of any of my grandparents was 79 (died of glioblastoma, other three lived into their 90s), my parents are currently in their 60s with no symptoms, and no aunts/uncles/cousins have shown any symptoms at all.\n\nIt looks like OP's sister should get a paternity test. 51 CAG is pretty high, someone else should be showing symptoms. It is insanely strange that she has a CAG repeat that high with no family history - absolutely baffling in fact. There are random cases of HD, but the gene is relatively stable at lower repeats, and if a parent did a repeat range where there is risk of expansion, I would not expect it to expand that dramatically.\n\nI hate to suggest it, but as another user posted, she may want to get a paternity test to verify that your dad is actually her father. That would honestly be the most straightforward explanation. If he is not her father, then that might provide the rest of your family some relief. I agree with this sstatement. Paternity is the most likely explanation for this. People unfortunately cheat. This disease is fairly well understood in many aspects. It is going to be an awkward thanksgiving to say the least Spontaneous mutations are rare but do occur. Not necessarily. Even if we rule out a random occurrence (which is not unheard and is HOW the disease enters families to begin with), it is very possible that one of the grandparents and parent has a borderline number of repeats. 36-39 may or may not develop into HD but is much more likely than lower repeats to increase in the next generation, particularly if its passed down from the father. \n\nMy MIL was not diagnosed until her 60s so her children did not know until they were in their 30s. The father could have it and just not be symptomatic, or be attributing small symptoms to old age. Yes, or parents in the grey area of 27-35 repeats can pass on the gene without actually having symptoms themselves. Does not necessarily one of his parents cheated. I hate to say it, but I too would question her paternity with that many repeats. If she was a spontaneous case, you would expect it to be far lower. Having received it from her father would also explain her relatively high number of repeats.\n\nI would not be terribly concerned about having it if I were you, unless you have the same biological father. I suspect you do not and thus have nothing to worry about. One symptom of the disease in about 5% is hyper sexuality ( most go the other way ). This. OP could have a parent in the gray area. If the gene carrier is OP\u2019s father, then genetic anticipation was more likely to have occurred, which would result in a high repeat count and JHD symptoms in OP\u2019s sister. \n\nAKA - It is possible to have HD show up in your family with no family history. It does happen, quite a lot actually. That is why we need to therapeutics to treat Huntington\u2019s Disease and disease modifying treatments and not to simply rely on PGD IVF as the way to eradicate HD. Hi, I know everyone is saying that your mother cheated but I am going to answer this as though you are at risk because you very well could be. \n\nI tested positive last year. It sucks, but it does not mean your life is over. If you test positive, life is not over. It just means more to you. We all die. The only difference between me and someone with ALS or MS or any other neurological disease is that I know what is coming for me, and I know roughly when it is going to happen. You might not get HD but you might get something else, down the line. You just do not know and you never do. Even when you do test positive, you do not know exactly when it is going to start or what your symptoms will be like when it does start. So just be sure that you want to know if you have the gene (wise for family planning) because like you said, you cannot \u201cun-know\u201d. This is completely false. Genetic anticipation can cause an increased number of glutamine repeats during slippage in meiosis. Slippage in meiosis can be caused randomly due to the amount of repeats that are below the liability threshold. The higher the number of repeats, the more likely slippage is to occur. This explains why their parents may not show the disease phenotype, but the child does. Either parent can have below the disease causing number of repeats, but if slippage in meiosis occurred in either parents\u2019 gametes, this could cause a higher number of repeats in the child\u2019s genotype.

I can tell you this; at least you will know. You cannot prepare for something you do not have, but it is up to the individual on whether or not to take the step. Something along the lines of 20% of at risk people end up getting tested. My personal opinion, I think you are doing the right thing either way.

I would like to be tested but privately/ without going through genetic counselors/ PCP, etc...? I do not believe there are.  Some people choose to use an alias and pay out of pocket to avoid it being associated with their identifying information. If you are in the USA, look for your nearest HD Center of Excellence here: (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCall them and tell them you would like to test anonymously. You will have to pay out of pocket, but it can be done. I am sorry to hear. Speaking with a generic counselor may be helpful (at least in my experience) We went to Houston and paid cash for anonymous testing I went through the University of California San Diego. 100% anonymous and they are a great resource. It is a bit of a long process because they will require you to do video or in person talks with them to make sure you are prepared for the results. They will then mail you a swab kit and you send it back. You have to get your results in person in San Diego, so just be aware of that. Here is there info: \n\nPlease feel free to message me. I can help find cheap flights to and from there as well as help set up accommodations. I am also willing to make the trip with you if you need some extra support. All the best. Thank you very much for this information. What is the benefit of being tested anonymously versus going through your insurance? I am sorry to hear about your parent. I second the recommendation to contact your closes Center of Excellence and ask about anonymous testing- not every center can do anonymous so you might have to consider traveling to a different state/location. I work in the HD space and HD Reach also does anonymous testing but travel to NC or SC is necessary. I actually currently am living in eastern NC! Thank you for the response, it was definitely helpful! :) Thanks! Do you recall the price range? Wow thanks so much! I found this very helpful!!!

(a neuro-doctor told me that not everyone progresses to the last stages, some might just have chorea, not sure if he said that just to be nice)\n* Could a healthy lifestyle (exercise, diet, cold baths, meditation) help?\n* How did you cope with news like this?  \n\n\n   \nI know I should live in the present and not think too much of \"what could be\" but since HD is a 50/50 (at least that is what they say) I cannot stop thinking about it from time to time. \n\nI really hope there will be a cure soon, even if my wife might not have inherited the gene, I feel sorry for everyone who has to deal with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest regards,\n\nfaith9x9", "I am looking for help regarding a family member suffering from HD. Both my (half) brother and sister inherited it from their father. We lost my sister 2 and a half years ago and now the symptoms are becoming more pronounced for my brother. \n\nOur main problem is that he refuses to acknowledge the problem and we are all worried about him hurting him self. He has always been difficult, he is an ex soldier and an alcoholic. Very headstrong and stubborn. \n\nHas anyone had a similar experience with a loved one. How did they get them to seek help. Dose anybody know of any organisation that cold help?\n\nLive in the UK.\n\n My wife also has HD, and we have had some similar struggles with her on certain topics.  While alcohol is not an issue in her case, she is very stubborn and independent so we have had a bit of trouble trying to convince her it is time to let someone help with specific things.\n\nMy first thought was the ( but then I saw you are in the UK - not sure if you have something similar.  They have many resources for both the veteran and their family - hospitals, mental care, social workers, etc.\n\nBe careful - trying to force him to do something he does not agree with will not benefit anyone.  It will create resentment on his part, and may make him less likely to open up to you in the future.  That said, there is a fine line between giving him time to make the decision on his own, and stepping in and being forceful. This is the line I walk with my wife on a daily basis.  If there is no immediate threat of harm you can give him time to come around.  If there is an immediate need to avoid injury you have to step in.  This is a judgement call on your part, and is not an enviable situation to be in.\n\nAside from that, does he have anyone he is really close to?  A significant other, close family member, close friend, someone he served with, maybe even a doctor he trusts?  It would have to be someone he trusts and admires.  See if you can get that person to talk to him.  You would be surprised how much difference the person delivering the message makes.\n\nIn my wife's case her doctor has been able to convince her on some topics.  For some reason to her the opinion of a professional seems to weigh heavier (even tough that professional is a relative stranger).  On other topics she will listen to me, and on others her Grandfather (who is more like a father to her) has been able to reach her.\n\nBottom line is there is no golden bullet.  HD by nature changes the situation over time, and something that works now may not a year from now.  Every person with HD is different - there is no guidebook that will tell you what works and what does not - which is one of the hardest parts of dealing with the disease.\n\nGood luck - and I mean this from the bottom of my heart.  Thank you for remaining engaged, and for looking out for him.  Many people (and I have seen this first hand over and over again) do not know what to do so they just disappear.  Those that remain by his side, whether he admits it or not, are very important to anyone dealing with HD - the patient or the caregiver. This is really, really common.  People with conspicuous chorea sometimes do not even think they are presenting at all. His personality likely does not help, but its a common feature of the disease that people are not aware of the ways in which they are presenting symptoms.\n\n\n\nGet in contact with the HDSA or your local HD support group.  They will have good advice for you, especially families with personal HD experience, they are a wellspring of strategy ideas.   Thank you. Iv never spoken with anyone els outside my family that has went through same thing. Sometimes I think I need reassurance or advice from somebody who fully understands what it is like dealing with this illness. I can tell people do not know what to say when I try to talk about it with them  which is totally understandable, it is some heavy shit to drop on someone. I sometimes feel like I should be doing more but it is so hard sometimes. The guy was my idol when I was a growing up and to see him fall on such hard times, and to see him slowly deteriorate with HD brakes my heart. \n\nThank you again for your advice and giving me a chance to vent.

Thank you. good luck man, thanks for standing by him.   I can echo /u/Hanawa on the HDSA local support groups.  We have been involved with our local group since my wife was diagnosed, and the information we have received from the local families walking the same road has been far more valuable than anything we have learned from any of the numerous doctors we have seen over the years, or any website.  HDSA as an organization does great things in the disease research arena, but we have not really seen or heard of any local support provided by the organization.  The local support groups (sponsored by HDSA) on the other hand are all about education, awareness, and support.\n\nI know there are other groups and organizations out there, but do not have any first-hand experience with them as there are not any in our area.\n\nHappy to chat if you ever need it.  Cannot promise I will have anything valuable to offer, but happy to listen if you are ever in need.  Again - good luck, and good on you for sticking with him through this. Thank you. The truth is I have not seen him in a few weeks. Iv been saying I am really busy with work which is true, I have been, but Iv been putting off seeing him because I find it difficult to be around him. And it is hard to talk about this with family because you feel like you have to be strong. It is bad enough that my mam has to deal with it, and she dose in a way I cannot believe. She has never given up and this whole thing has been harder on her than anyone els. I am just kind of rambling now I know but it feels good to talk about it. Your attitudes toward this have given me some much needed perspective. I am going to be more involved. I guess people do not know what to say because they feel powerless.  But you do too, right?  So let them know.  \"Hey, I do not know what to say either.\"  \n\nI once sought to confide in someone who immediately changed the subject.  The brain is funny, you know?  It hurt me to my core, but yet I know it was not personal?  I know her, and her brain just pushed her to click into a happier gear.  I could hardly blame her.  It *is* a heavy burden, but that is why sharing it lightens the load.  \n\nI hate that for so many HD stays a dirty little secret.  A taboo that you cannot talk about.  It only makes it worse.  It keeps people locked in the HD closet, the sufferer or their family members.  I wish it was not this way.   Yer, I know. That being said I am not known, even amongst my closest friends and family, for being a particularly serious person. So if and when the subject dose come up it is unfamiliar territory for both me and them. It gets uncomfortable and we both end up trying to change the subject. My Girlfriend has been a good helping me confront my feelings and I can confide in her which obviously helps. but I can see it worries her. That in turn makes me worried about her worrying about me, if that makes sense.\n\nI have not been on Reddit for that long and usually just browse the front page. I thought I would take a punt and make this post because of text my mam sent me concerning my brother this morning. Now I see that there is a lot of people on here in the same boat and offering support in one way or another. \n\nMy point is I think, for me anyway, it is perhaps better  to seek help from places like this sub. Just food for thought...  My wife looks forward to every visit from every person.  Even if they do not talk, just being in someone is company lets her know they care.  Not sure if that makes sense...\n\nFor example...  She has a half-brother that also has HD.  When he and his wife come to visit it is one of the most awkward things to watch, as they both just sit on the couch and watch the kids play.  They really do not even speak to each other, but she still looks forward to his visits.\n\nShe has had so many people disappear from her past that she really values the relationships she has left.  Previous coworkers, past friends, and even family all started to fade when she was diagnosed.  Most do not know how to react to a difficult situation, so they simply avoid it.  I do not fault them for it completely.  It is tough.\n\nI guess my point is, do not try too hard - just being there is a start, and at the very least lets him know he has someone to turn to when the time is right.  It is a difficult situation for you, but it is also difficult for him.  Families are built for getting through tough times.  \n\nWhile no one except your mother can possibly know what it is like to be in her shoes, I can promise it has not been an easy road.  Being a primary caregiver in that situation is not easy, and she could use some support as well (though she will never ask for it).\n\nYou are already doing more than most by talking about it and being involved.  Let that be enough to open the door and the relationship will go where it goes from there.  Jump in where you feel you can, but most importantly be there for when he decides to reach out. Amen.  I have had similar situations play out.  People ask how you are doing, but they REALLY do not want to hear the truth.  They want to hear \"I am fine\" so they can feel like they have addressed the situation.  It is a terribly awkward social situation...\n\nAt this point I do not really talk about it outside of a very small circle.  I have one person I reach out to occasionally, and everyone else gets the \"I am fine\" response.  Luckily I found another gentleman (met him through the local HDSA support group) that also has a wife with HD, and it is been helpful to be able to vent back and forth.  While we both know we cannot do much to help the other, it is nice to be able to talk to someone else that has some idea about your situation. Just talking about this and having some input has cleared my head a bit. I know their is not much light at the end of this tunnel but just got to get on with it. Iv text him and we are going to see Star Wars on Thursday my day off. \n\nThanks again. Your wife is lucky to have someone with your attitude looking after her.

Hello everyone. I am 23 and currently finishing my second year of medical school. My school is 2.5 hours from home. My mom is currently 59 and was diagnosed about 8 years ago.

She is alone with her dog most of the day but my dad comes in and brings her supper and hangs out with her at the end of his work days. I try to get home as much as possible. I worry about her when I am gone of course but lately it has just been increased. I feel like I am on the very of a panic attack 100% of the time with my skin burning and chest tight. I am worried something bad is going to happen and I feel guilty that I have abandoned her to focus on other peoples health instead of hers. She really does not like going to doctors and taking medicine. Please I just need some words of reassurance of people who have been here before. Thank you &lt;3 Huntington's patients require a lot of care in late stages. Statistically, patients live - on average - 10 to 15 years after diagnosis. I would worry more about what stage of the disease she is in. If she is in late stage - and it does not sound like she is - she will require more care. If you are experiencing panic attacks it may mean you should focus on you FIRST. You cannot help her if YOU are a wreck 24/7. If all of your anxiety is surrounding your Mom's health &amp; your guilt for not personally taking care of her - maybe sit down with Dad. You both are going to need to devise a long term plan for her care anyway as her medical needs become more than you can manage. It was horrifying watching this disease rob my mother of her vitality &amp; of her mental function. I do not wish that on any child. But I am glad I saw it because it made me determined to seek out every available treatment, therapy &amp; option for my own continuing full function. But this disease MUST BE MANAGED. To ignore it often guarantees an early death from it. Hi there! Also a medical student, and my mom was diagnosed during my second year (now in my third year). It is a hard place to be in in general, and it is made even more difficult by the demands on a medical student. \n\nI took a month off for my mental health and to spend time with my family immediately after the diagnosis \u2014 my medical school worked with me to figure out logistics. I am super glad I took the time off! I just want to share that it can be an option, even in medical school, to take time for your mental health! \n\nI also agree with what JusticeAvenger said above. It is important to address this disease head on.\n\nSending you hugs! Feel free to DM me as well :) I wanted to agree with the point, that this does not sound late stage. You have years to focus on yourself. Nothing is going to happen to her tomorrow. \n\nWatching my dad die was a long horrible road. But it was long. \n\nGet a therapist, if you have not already.

Hi everyone, 26f here. My mom (56) has HD, and obviously I am choosing whether to get tested and I am leaning towards doing it. My mom did not get tested until she was 54 and already had symptoms - I think if she had known earlier she could have planned a lot better and tried to save a lot more money. \n\nMy question is - is there anything I should do now before I get tested? I was thinking about things like taking out a life insurance policy on myself or any other savings accounts in the event I am sick (401ks not going to do me a whole lot of good if I do not live to 60). I was thinking getting confirmation of pre-existing condition would really change things and I would be a lot more limited.\n\nThanks in advance. I am scared, but I need to plan this out so I do not burden my family and so I can have the life I choose after I cannot take care of myself anymore. First, I am sorry about your mom. That cannot be easy to witness. \n\nSecond, if you get tested, take someone with you. Someone not blood related to you. A good friend or significant other. \n\nWhen I got tested the genetic counselor sat with me and explained what all the numbers and stuff meant. It would be good to educate yourself on that first if one is not available. \n\nI got tested. Let me know if you have any questions. For sure get all your insurance settled first. Life insurance, critical care, disability etc. \n\nI was tested in 2019 and it came back positive..but I feel prepared now which is good at least. \n\nI turn 30 in September. \n\nAlso having a support person is a good idea. I had my Aunt who has HD, my Uncle and my Husband eith me. I am a freelancer so I get health insurance through my state. Any advice on how to navigate that? I do not know 100% because I am Canadian. But I would go for getting secondary personal insurance. Your HD center should be able to help you some more. I would absolutely get life insurance before you do this. It will be MUCH harder to get and more expensive if it comes back positive. \n\nI am some states you can pay to get tested anonymously without insurance involved so it is not on your record. You would have to pay out of pocket. I know someone who did this and paid $400. It was worth it. \n\nI am sorry. Good luck. Here (NZ) once you start the process, it takes 3 appointments over 6months, with physiologists, a neurologist , and a genetics expert before they will tell you the results. Make sure you have a good support network in place, and a plan to process your results, better or worse, survivors guilt is very real, so is the spiralling of a positive result. Honestly, you will be fine. Unless Obamacare is overturned and preexisting conditions are not covered. Goodluck x I would highly suggest you contact HDSA or a HD center of excellence and talk to their social worker. You do not have to actually go to a clinic, you can call them for help over the phone even if you are not currently being seen at a clinic. They can help you navigate insurance and testing concerns. Once you are tested (unless you are doing it anonymously) it goes into your medical record and insurance companies can ask to view it. \u201cHonestly, you will be fine\u201d is not a great way to look at this. Insurance is so complicated in America and it is imperative you have all your ducks in a row before you make your next steps. Hahahah that is what I was thinking. \u201cHonestly you will be fine\u201d uh no I might have a horrible illness and be thousands of dollars in debt. I would love to avoid that. Thank you for the advice! I will try to contact a center to get more info. Hi there! My dad (58) found out earlier this year he has Huntington\u2019s disease my brother (30) and I (29) both decided to get tested. I could not live with the uncertainty and had to know either way.\n\nI found it helpful to make lists- what do I want from life in the long term? how will this change, or how will my approach to these wants change, based on my results? It gives you something to reflect on once you have your results. I find having a plan keeps me on track and focussed and less over whelmed.\n\nI think needs in terms of insurance differ between countries. I am in Australia where there is no need to disclose genetic results when applying for health or life insurance up to a certain threshold. In my experience, the genetic counselor was really great at helping me walk through my options, what the possibilities might mean, etc.   \nLife insurance can be tough - I had a plan at one point, but they do ask about your family's medical history, and it is possible to be denied once they learn you have a parent with HD and that you have not been tested. And you cannot keep it from them, because it would invalidate the policy. That was my experience, anyway.\n\nI think my advice is to surround yourself with support, more than to make a pragmatic to-do list. Get in touch with the Hungington's society in your area, and see if they can match you with a mentor or someone to talk to about the testing process and being at-risk. That helped me tremendously.", "Anyone here know someone with repeats around 46? Loved one has 46 repeats, closing in on 30 with no symptoms yet.

My uncle told me in 2012 that my father has Huntington\u2019s disease after he was admitted to a facility to take care of him. He said my grandmother had it as well. \n\nFor a long time it was tough for me to cope with that. Not only could I be at risk for having it but it suddenly gave an explanation to the horror I would suffered through as a child. My father regularly beat my mother and self medicated with alcohol and drugs. He kicked us out of our home when I was ten years old. My mom, my autistic brother and I lived with friends and with relatives in their living rooms and basements for years until I got accepted into college and moved away. \n\nI had thought the horror was finally over and I was recovering emotionally from the pain my father had caused me and my family. I was angry. I had lots of issues developing relationships with others. I wanted nothing to do with my father and I had not spoken to him or seen him in years. My dad\u2019s brother called me in my senior year of college to tell me that my dad was at the va hospital. The fire department had him admitted after they condemned the house I had grown up in. He had torn it to pieces, written insane things on the walls about my mom. He was not paying the utility bills and was living in the home without water or electricity. The fire department found him trying to tap into a fire hydrant to get water. The house of horrors was repossessed and my father went to the care facility he is living in today. \n\nI went to visit him in 2013 and his condition frightened me. The man I had always feared was now small and fragile. He looked horrible. He said mean things to me and I left, not returning again until just now after Thanksgiving of this year. \n\nI am 28 now and I feel that I am better equipped to handle having something of a relationship with my father before he dies. I cannot exactly forgive him for what he has done despite knowing he has an explanation. But I am at peace with what happened now. I am married happily and I have a job that I love and am very good at. My wanting to reach out to him now was to scratch the itch of knowing what this disease is doing to him and how it could possibly affect me some day. \n\nThese days his involuntary movements are much more pronounced. He cannot walk very well and he can hardly hold a cup of water, put clothes on, or feed himself. He is able to speak and we have conversations on a shallow lighthearted level. When he called me and told me he loved me over the phone, it nearly killed me inside. I feel tremendous amounts of guilt at times for taking so long to see him since 2013. The feelings are complex and difficult to put into words. These days I am just crying almost at random all of the time. \n\nDespite everything that happened and all of the emotional pain of bringing an abuser back into my life, the biggest challenge for me is facing the reality that I now have a 50% chance that this could happen to me. And making the decision to get tested is a tremendously painful one. I think seeing his condition in 2013 shocked me enough to not want to return. I have been living blissfully ignorant throughout the rest of my twenties. Here I am getting closer to 30 and now I need to know if this condition could affect my life in the near future. My father started the personality changes when I was very little, in his mid thirties. I could show symptoms soon. \n\nThank you for reading my story. I just needed to put my feelings into words. I am seeing my primary care doctor on Wednesday for a referral to the local genetic testing facility.  Im in a similar role but without the bad parenting. I can tell you though, that I went to the huntingtons study group conference in houston last month and got to meet Nancy Wexler, she is basically the mother of Huntingtons Disease. One thing she is a BIG advocate of is actually not getting tested ever. Her mother had it and she never tested for it herself. **I am not here to tell you what to do or what not to do**, but I would suggest to also listen to other viewpoints and why she suggests that. My mother has it, I am in my 30\u2019s and I went from being curious to rest for it to also never wanting to test for it myself.  My thoughts on this, and the mental loop/rabbit hole this may take you in... \n\nYou know that old saying \"what you do not know will not hurt you?\" Well, there may be some truth in that. Now hear me out, Homosapiens have this wonderful way of dwelling, sulking, and become depressed.\n\n This all depends on the person and if they are an internal locus or external locus of control. For those who do not know, an internal locus is someone who handles situations with optimism and believes they are control of their circumstances. An external believes their life is controlled by an outside force and has the \"why bother, I give up\" approach to situations.  \n\nSo in my opinion, if you are an internal locus, finding out may push you forward. But for how long? You could go into a rabbit hole, depression, and or \"give up.\" \n\nIf someone told me today I was going to die in 2 years, I would probably quit my job, take out my savings, and spend as much time with loved ones as possible. What is stopping me now? My thought process. Although I know I am eventually going to die, today, tonight, tomorrow, or in 50 years,  even thinking about it takes away from the present moments. From right now. \n\nUnless I can do something about it right now, there is no reason to dwell. My sister taught me an important lesson when I used to dwell. She gave me three options in every situation, \n\n1. Accept it   - If you cannot (see 2)\n2. Change it - If you cannot (see 3)\n3. Leave it    - If you cannot (see 1&amp;Learn to accept/cope)\n\n The fact I am going to die should be a great reason in itself to live life to the fullest and not take our time for granted. A lot of us, HD, or not, still have the potential to develop other fatal diseases or die early due to other facts.  You cannot LIVE thinking like that. \n\nMany people maintain a healthy diet, never smoke, never do drugs, or even a sip of alcohol and STILL develop terminal diseases, Alzheimer's, and other illnesses- \n\nBefore getting tested write down your pros and cons on if your results are positive... \n\nAsk yourself, how this information will positively improve your quality of life, and why you cannot act on these improvements without that information.\n\nExample, now I know, so now I can finally \\_\\_\\_go to Europe\\_\\_\\_.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not let the worry of tomorrow take away your life today... you will cross that bridge when you come to it. \n\nTo those who are all experiences Huntington's symptoms currently, and families,  we all love and support you, you are definitely not alone. \n\nI am a biology major taking accelerated online classes to join the team to find a cure. \n\nGodspeed...  Could not have said it any better. Great post. I just got tested and faced these same questions while awaiting my results. For me not knowing was eating at me everyday. I questioned every little thing I did. Every mood swing every twitch. My one peace of advice that I would add is to not go through the testing process alone like I did. Either way, (pos/neg) I knew that I wanted to be apart of the solution to this horrible disease, and that is what got me through it alone. The testing process is not for everyone, but if you do do it, make sure you have a very strong support system.  You are really brave for going at it alone. I could not even imagine how agonizing not knowing must have been. \n\n I second the support system. I hope you have that support system now either way. I am always here if you need someone to talk to.  Do you have any sources for Nancy\u2019s reasoning? My brother and I have just found out a few weeks ago that my Dad is positive and he is already rushing to get his results but I want him to think properly about it first.  There are several reasons, again this is just the opinions of myself or others so not saying what you should do or not do, just giving a different perspective.\n\nSome people want to go get tested to enter clinical trials. Well, it is not a guarantee that your positive result will give you admission to one. You may not be a good candidate.\n\nInsurance and everything else will go up. \n\nYou cannot unknow it. Some people do not stop to think that once you get that positive result, your life will change FOR EVER. Then any little thing that happens, forgetting the mail, tripping, chocking on food, a tick, all that, will make you panic. And one thing about HD is that you may be positive but will not know when you all start, some people go well into their 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s without showing much symptoms. In addition, suicide is a common end of life way for many with HD, you will not know how you will react, how you will feel and what you will do when you get hat result. \n\nI was told, do not test for it, and live your life as if you do not have it or else the thought of that will make you go insane. If you do test for it, just live your life as if the symptoms will not come out until later. \n\n Hi and thanks to everyone who responded to my post. I appreciate the kind words from many of you. I just wanted to say that I got my blood drawn today. Deciding to go forward to test is a personal decision and I am aware that the majority of at risk individuals choose not to test and that is ok. For me, if I find out that I have it, I know that there are steps that I can take to ensure that my quality of life is what I want it to be before I can no longer make decisions for myself. And then again I am just as likely to not have it, so I could learn that this weight can be entirely lifted. ", "Entering the New Year with Huntington's Disease ", "Looking for anyone in a similar situation My (m32) wife (f25) has mid stage Huntingtons disease just trying to find anyone around that age in a similar situation, genuinely never felt this alone ever My situation is different, I am 18, and my dad has Huntingtons disease. (also mid stage) If you ever want to talk, feel free to message me! Have you been tested? No, I will get tested as soon as there is a cure, but until then I do not want to know, since a diagnosis would have a huge impact. Where I live, I could not even buy a house if I have Huntingtons disease, even if I do not have symptoms yet. Yeah I understand that, I live in Scotland and it would mean you would also need to declare it on your driving license and stuff Hey, I am not in a similar situation to you necessarily. I am 20, untested but my mum is late stages. I noticed you said your from Scotland. Have you had any contact with the Scottish Huntingtons Association? They are really good and could provide you with support if yous need it. Yeah we see them regularly they are good but it feels like alot of the support stuff are all set towards older generations Fair enough, have you been able to go to any of their events? That way you could meet some folk your age in the same situation. You are not alone that is for sure, even if it feels like it sometimes. Although I think I will benefit, my wife freaks out a bit at stuff like that just now Yeah I totally get that. Hopefully she will come round but sometimes people with HD can be really unreasonable My daughter has early to mid-stage and is 22. She was diagnosed at 18 and was already showing some mild symptoms then.  She currently holds a job but is on her 5 job in two years.  She has moved back home right now so I hope that will improve her ability to keep her job. Is there no options for her to go onto benefits? My wife stopped work 2 years ago, there would be absolutely no chance she could work just now My 43 year old brother is mid stage and he developed symptoms at 19-21 years old. So I understand the young age and the pain of seeing a loved one going through this. Feel free to message me. Not yet.  She can still work and she will be denied the first time anyway.  We will probably look at filing in about a year.  She drops things so if that becomes a problem and she loses the job we might have to file sooner. Seriously? Blech! Not with HD, it is approval is mandated by the book they use to determine eligibility. I am mid stages and 36, was diagnosed at 28. HMU if you like. Not the same situation at all but i am 24 and I was just talking to a girl (26yr old female) whose mom has huntington\u2019s disease. she has not been tested herself because she does not want to know at this point. but she is amazing and spends basically all of her time with her mom, helping her, and just trying however she can to improve her mother\u2019s quality of life. anyway things were going well at first. she checks all of my boxes and really was an amazing, beautiful person inside &amp; out. but she ended up saying that she felt like she had to stop seeing me because 1) she does not have the time, energy, or patience for a relationship right now. i cannot argue with that. her mom should and would always be #1 in her life and i respect her for that. but her second reason was that she did not want to burden me with her problems, and she felt it was unfair to ask me to have to \u201cdeal with her family\u201d and her problems. and i tried explaining to her that eventually if we were to start a relationship down the road we would be a team and in a way her problems would becomes my problems and i would help her and be there for her and support her in every way possible. but long story short things did not work out between us. we are still friendly but it is a huge bummer because she really is an amazing person and i would have loved to give things a shot and see what happens. but i understand where she is coming from and i have to respect that. just makes me think so often about the burden she has and all of the uncertainty that comes with being the daughter of someone with Huntington\u2019s. and she has 3 siblings so the odds are that 1 of them definitely has it and 2 probably do. scary shit man and i do not feel sorry for her because she is strong and she is good about just playing with the hand she is been dealt but i do feel for her and want her to be happy. sorry that was a super long unrelated tangent but yeah that is my expensive and through speaking to her i became a lot more educated on this disease and how it wrecks lives and families, because i had never heard of it before I met her. Do not you still have to prove they cannot work?  Her bio mom was turned down twice before finally being approved. Yeah, that is basically the line between gene positive, asymptotic and symptomatic in this case. 5 jobs in 2 years sounds like she cannot work. Similar just a bit older. My wife is 36 was diagnosed about 6 years ago. She cannot work anymore and has trouble with alot of day to day things. We have 3 kids. Things can be up and down. Hey man. My (m29) ex (f29) has Huntington's. Not sure how helpful I can be, but feel free to reach out. My cousins are all around the same age, and at varying stages, anytime you need to talk to someone about this I am available. Have you though about anonymous testing? Is that something available in your area that would interest you? For me I would like to know just so I can plan for children. I also totally understand not wanting to test until there is a cure, I have hope it will be soon! Anonymous testing is not available here, and by the time I have children, the cure will probably already be there. That is what the last generation said, back in the 90s. And again in the 00s. They kept saying a cure was just around the corner and \"our kids likely will not have to worry.\" There were news stories coming out claiming it was \"cured in mice!\" every year or so. Fast forward 20-30 years: same claims, same news, same failures. I am not trying to be a debbie downer, I am just posting up reality here. I would absolutely start looking online for the nearest clinic where you can get it done anonymously if you plan on ever having kids. A 21 year old guy did not get tested, had kids, he came down with it and died a few years later, his daughter came down with it in elementary school and will be lucky to see her 18th birthday. Anonymous testing is not an option where I live. However, it is possible to tell if the child has Huntington\u2019s during the pregnancy. There are a lot of options, please respect my decision not to get tested yet. I am not saying I never will, but I have only known my dad has it for three months. I am very young, getting tested is just not the right thing for me at the moment. Hi! Just reaching out to see if you found any support. I am 29 and I got tested back when I was 18 with a positive result (45 counts) so I know what it is like to be young and live with a positive HD result. If you all need someone to chat with I am always available! I also def know how lonely it can feel at first.   \n\n\nIf you have facebook, the National Youth Alliance and the Huntington's Disease Youth Organization Hangout are both good groups to chat with people in our age range. There are even conventions you can go to every year just for young people, which I have been to and are a good place to find support.   \n\n\nThere are also online support groups for people of different phases of the the illness / caregiving on the HDSA website:  (   \n\n\nIs your wife signed up for any clinical trials? How did she find out she has HD? Did she have a family history? Do you remember what kind of symptoms he was showing at 21? How long has he been in the mid stages? I totally get this, and this is how I felt for most of my early 20's. I do not like to delude myself and pretend that reality is better than it is, so I spent about 10 years after testing positive assuming I was going to die before any treatment became available. \n\nBut in the past few years, research has been advancing at really crazy speeds that I could never have imagined 10 or 20 years ago. Back in the 80's and 90's, gene silencing in humans was still just a theory; but now we have actually tested it in humans *and* primates and seen positive results. We have also seen a very similar gene silencing drug work to successfully treat SMA, another genetically inherited condition; which indicates that it could also work in HD. \n\nAdditionally, the first trial of gene silencing drugs in HD patients has shown that the hutingtin protein level was lowered in the spinal fluid of people with HD. And there are multiple pharmaceutical companies tackling this same problem from different angles. So, for all of these reasons, I am actually cautiously optimistic about our chances of finding a treatment in the next 10 - 20 years these days. But I do understand wanting to not get your hopes up after seeing people's optimism from earlier generations lead to nothing. This is really sweet. I get where she is coming from with not wanting to burden other people with the disease. As someone who grows up seeing a parent degenerate from it, you know how brutal that is and there is this fear that potential partners, no matter how well meaning, might not truly know what they are getting into. But I think it is really amazing that you care about her this much. I hope you two can at least be friends and maybe work things out sometime in the future. Do you know what her CAG count is? When did she start showing symptoms? He was having clumsiness and balance issues, speech was a little hard to understand at that age too. He is been in the mid stages I would say for almost a decade. I hear the earlier symptoms start, the longer it is drawn out but I am not sure on the accuracy of that. Yeah low 50's. She started having physical symptoms 18 months or so before diagnosis. Mental symptoms are harder to put a time on but looking back there are times that I wonder if HD has affected her mentally for a while.  Wow, I am so sorry. It is scary to hear that as someone who is in the same age range, but I am glad she has people in her life supporting her. And yeah, the mental symptoms are hard to pinpoint to HD since they can occur with other conditions, as well, but I think they typically show up a while before physical symptoms. If you guys ever need someone to talk to, I am always happy to chat. Maybe you could start a group chat with people that are going through similar experiences? Like people that have Partners with HD or people that had partners with HD. I dated a girl with HD and I was always worried I would offend or upset someone with HD or someone at risk when talking about it on these forums. A private group chat would have made me feel more comfortable talking about these things and I would be happy to join one. Maybe hearing people\u2019s experiences at varying stages could help and would offer some support. Thanks Whoa", "Enroll HD I had my first session today for it. I just wanted to know if anyone else had taken part? I am taking my SO for the first appointment next week. Yes. Been involved for a few years now. SO? How have you found it? I started it last year when I was 18 at the wake forest baptist medical center. It did not feel like I was doing a super supportive role with trying to find a cure, but it was the least I could do. My thinking going in was that it would be better to get a feel for the place and get to know the staff a little bit better for when the time comes to actually be treated and or do any other study\u2019s. significant other!  I have! I switched to Enroll-HD from Predict-HD a few years back. I have actually enjoyed the visits so far, although the drive can be a bit of a hassle in a state as big as TX. It is cool to get to meet some of the scientists doing research into HD, though. Everyone I have met so far has been really genuine and thoughtful.    \n\n\nHow was your experience with it?  Ah yeah, I can imagine that is a bit of a trek for you, I am glad it is going okay for you tho.\n\nMy experience was alright, it was my first visit because I only recently turned 18 but I knew the woman doing the testing of me well enough so it went pretty smoothly. Thanks or asking. I am working on scheduling my fourth visit now. I have no complaints about the previous visits. Everyone is friendly. I go to the university in Edmonton for the visits, they pay for my parking and I get a fuel allowance because I have to drive over 100km from home to get to the appointment.\n  \nIt is been the same tests each year and you can see last years results, it is neat to see exactly how good/bad you were at the different tests. Just had my third visit yesterday! How was it? It was alright, went pretty much as expected. My genotype is unknown, and I am under 30 so pre symptomatic. There is no issues doing the questions or movement/cognition tests. I really like the ladies who go through the big binder of questions with me and the doctor who does the movement stuff. We usually touch a little bit on if I ever want I go through the formal testing to find out and they are very helpful and comforting. ", "Abusive childhood due to HD? This is really hard to find the words for, so I am going to do my best. So I have known about HD since I was 9/10 and I am 23 now. While I was around that age my father passed and left me with only my mother. She was unknowingly showing the beginning stages of her illness when all this was happening and became a bit abusive to me. It only was physical a few times, but it was mainly verbal and basic neglect. It stopped when we were able to move in with my grandmother and she was able to be a caregiver. In the process most of our stuff had to be thrown away and a lot of my late father\u2019s stuff was thrown out too. I know of course my mother loves me and everything is due to the illness, but I still feel resentment years later. I feel childish for it but the emotional wounds are still there. I just feel awful because she is almost at the last stage and will not be around much longer. I worry about regretting being resentful because she does not remember doing any of the abuse anyways, so there will never be any real closure for me. The worst part about this is that I really do not feel attached to her as a mother because of the abuse and I just want to move out and wash my hands with it for my own mental health. I know this has been long, but I figure that those who know the disease well would have a better insight on how I feel.  Long story short is that I was wondering if anyone else has had an experience like this and how they went about everything? I am sorry if I offend anyone for being so negative about it I was apprehended by CAS and then lived with my Grandparents as well because of neglect related to the HD. \n\nHowever now that I am older and I see my other Aunt getting sick I wonder if maybe my Mom was just not the best Mom in the first place and the HD just made that magnified. She was/is a kind woman and loved me. But she just chose parttinf and having sex with degenerate men over her kids. \n\nIt sucks and it is confusing. Okay see my mom kind of did that too. She had a thing with the neighbor after dad\u2019s passing and it was very clear because she would tell me details that I should not know about, especially as a child. But I am glad (not glad you had the experience) that there are others like me because all I have been seeing on the support group sites is positive parents becoming ill. I will admit that their children might not say that they were abusive, but it just made me feel a bit alone with it all. But you know what there is hope now. The Huntingtin protien lowering trials are looking awesome. There are two that go by spinal injection and one that is a one time brain surgery all in human trials. My neurologist told me treatment should be available on the market in five years. That is really good! I have heard snip-its but I did not realize it was that soon. I have not been tested yet because I am scared to, but that makes a positive result a bit easier to take! Yeah I am 28 and was just tested this year. The team told me that being able to tell me treatment is coming makes their jobs easier and that right now I just need to focus on staying healthy while I wait for it! My dad had HD and his behavioral symptoms were out of control. He was deeply awful, especially to my mom and my siblings, and home was a nightmare so much of the time. It was SO HARD. I was so angry at him, and hated what he was doing, but knew he was dying, and wanted to appreciate every moment because I missed him, but wanted absolutely nothing to do with him all at once. My mom also got sick, so I spent my 20s taking care of the family. It was rough. \n\nI think the first thing to do is to stop beating yourself up.  You are *not* childish for being resentful. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being negative or upset about this. It is okay to be angry. It is okay to leave your mom in competent care and distance yourself. It is okay to leave things in the past. It is okay to try and seek closure. Your feelings are valid and just because she is dying does not mean those awful things disappear. \n\nI really, really recommend checking out some therapy for this, and soon. There is so much to unpack here, and a professional can help you sort through your feelings and help you clarify what it is that you want and need. If your mom is in any kind of hospice care, the hospice organization can likely help you find someone. The first step for me was absolutely forgiving myself. That made it easier to forgive my dad- for my sake. Carrying that anger was exhausting. That made it easier to have a more balanced picture. People are not black and white, and finding the right perspective on people can be challenging but worth it. Therapy can help so much. I hope you are able to find something that works for you. The behavior aspect in my dad with the disease has been hell too. And I hate him for it. I hate him for what he does to my mom and for the stress he causes and that we cannot do things we want because 1) he will not like it 2) now his mobility sucks so it is hard to bring him along and 3) we will not have fun with him around. He spent $18K on strippers on a credit card and my mother paid it all off once she found out about it. They are blessed that she could afford to do that, but that was an emergency fund or new car fund or whatever the hell she wanted to do with it besides pay off his debts. She could not kick him out or divorce him because well, how would it look if a wife divorced her sick husband. He is essentially a toddler that we have to lug around and throws fits on about the same level. \n\n\nSo I guess what I am getting at is it is okay to be negative. Shits hard. People do not get it. Their behavior changes so much that the person is not who they used to be, so it is almost like hating a different person. Not saying that as a justification, but as a it is hard to not resent somebody that you do not know anymore. I completely understand what you are saying, having a parent with HD onset pretty early in their life is very difficult. My father never physically abused me and my brother, but when he would get red hot angry he would yell and say things that should not be said. It is a miracle that my mom has stayed with him and us after all that he has said to her. Now he is pretty mellow, but he is loaded up on all sorts of pills. I love my dad more than anything in the world, and whenever he says something that should not be said I always have to stop and think about the fact that it is not really him saying those things. I do not want to excuse everything that he has done, but at the same time I can look at everything from a new perspective where I know what is causing him to do the things that he does. I can imagine that you often have memories that make you cringe (I do all the time), but I look back at it with a different understanding where I know the reasoning to his past behavior. It does not make anything better thinking that way, but I just pray I do not act and behave as he did whenever onset sets in for me. If you need someone to talk to, you can message me anytime. My mom was pretty much awful as well, but I do not think it was the HD. I think she was just a broken person. The HD had definitely made it all worse and more complicated though. It took me years to figure out how low key abusive my childhood was, that I had a right to feel however I felt about it, and that I could still distance myself from her. Her being sick does not excuse her years of crappy behavior - this was all before she was symptomatic and well back even into her childhood. It is a shit way to die and I am sorry she is lonely, but I cannot let her light me on fire so she can be warm. \n\nGood luck to you.", "Looking for some guidance My mom (who is positive) was recently dismissed from her work. She is a NYS employee (for context) and was told that she needs to be evaluated by their doctor before she can return to work due to symptoms. Has anyone been through this/know what the next steps should be if she is dismissed? Thanks in advance peeps. Talk to your doctor about filing for SSDI, assuming she is less than 65. If greater than 65, retire. My MIL was let go from her job of 27 years because of her showing HD symptoms. They knew something was wrong with her but did not know what. \n\nWe immediately signed her up for insurance so she did not go uncovered. I also immediately started the process of getting her in disability. Since HD is so severe, they fast tracked her and she was approved in a few weeks. \n\nI am not sure was NYS means but having her evaluated by their own doctor seems odd to me. HD is a private matter and frankly it is none of their business what is wrong with her in my opinion. Are they saying they will give her the job back if the doctor says it is okay? I do not see this ending well because unfortunately she will only continue to get worse. Shes a state worker in NY and from what I am gathering they think her symptoms are impacting her work and want her to be cleared by a state doctor Thanks for explaining. The unfortunate news is that they might be correct. That was exactly why my MIL got let go. \n\nYou might want to start thinking about applying her for disability. It is a long process. However, those with HD can sometimes get fast tracked. \n\nBest of luck. I am sorry this is happening. The comments below about the very probable realistic need to apply for disability are good.\n\nBut also consider that HD is covered by the ADA, so your mom would be well within her rights to ask for accommodations to allow her to continue working. In many cases, disability insurance/SSDI are going to want to see that the attempt to accommodate was made before applying for disability. As an example, one of my family members with HD (working in an office job) was not able to learn a new computer system for files when the company transitioned, due to mild cognitive impairment. But she could still work the old system just fine, and they had plenty of cases that still needed to be handled/closed out in that system, so she was just the assigned person for all those (while all the other office folks went to the new system). That allowed her to keep working for over a year beyond when she might have otherwise needed to go on disability. And when she \\*did\\* go on disability, that we were able to show the attempt to accommodate her had been made/reached its limits, it helped expedite her approval. This might not be relevant (depending on your mom's degree of impairment and/or the specific nature of her job), but if this is a possibility, disclosure &amp; accommodation might be an option for her! Thanks my dude for the help Does she have long term disability at work? If so sounds like she needs apply under that while she sees her doctors so she can start the process of disability.", "Huntington's: Advice and opinions on having kids Huntingtons disease runs in my husband's family. We are both 30 years old and thinking about having kids. We would ideally like to make sure the baby does not have the HD gene through IVF, but know that ivf is extremely expensive, among other things. \n\nMy husband has not been tested and has no plans to as of now. His grandpa and uncle are the only two confirmed positive diagnoses in the family that i know of.\n\nPlease share any and all experiences/opinions about having children in a huntington's disease family. \n\nDoes insurance ever cover genetic IVF?  \nArguments for and against IVF?\nIVF in other countries?\nWhat did it cost you? With or without the help of insurance?\nArguments for having kids without any testing or intervention? \nAny regrets or things you wish you knew?\nBeing sensitive to the emotions of the possible carrier through these difficult conversations?\nTruly, anything at all.\n\nI feel that this is such a huge decision. And although i totally understand what a difficult, personal and sensitive topic this is, your experiences and insight would mean the world of you are willing to share them. \n\n\n\n\n My mom has HD. She avoided getting tested for quite a while and was already symptomatic when she finally got her confirmation. I always knew I would get tested, as I strongly preferred to know so I could plan accordingly. I tested around age 23ish? and was negative. My personal opinion is that I could not imagine having children either not knowing or possibly passing it on. There are so many trials and research opportunities and establishing care plans financially is so much easier with time to plan... I could not live with just winging it. On the flip side, my aunt recently passed from HD, leaving 3 kids and 8 grandkids and none of them have been tested and as far as I know, have no plans to test. \n\nI wish you and your family well, whatever you decide.\n\n Does your husband have a parent with symptoms of HD? If both parents are healthy past the age when his grandpa/uncle were diagnosed, then likely they do not have the gene to pass on to your husband. Your husband would not have a chance of getting HD or passing it on if neither parent has the gene. \n\nIf there is a possibility a parent does have HD (if they have symptoms, despite no formal diagnosis, or if they are still younger than the age when other family members were diagnosed) then I would highly recommend IVF. Yes it is expensive, but in my opinion worth it to avoid the possible 50% chance your child gets HD. \n\nGood luck with your decision! Speaking logically here, surely having your husband get tested will cost far less than going out and getting multiple IVF treatments. If your husband is negative that there is no need at all for IVF treatment unless you are having fertility issues.  \n\nIf your husband is positive, yes IVF with pre-implantation diagnosis will work but it is very expensive especially when you consider you may need multiple treatments.  On top of that a positive diagnosis with a higher CAG count could mean that your husband may become partially or completely disabled while raising your children. \n This can put an enormous stress on your family - physically, emotionally, financially.  IVF will protect your kids from HD but if your husband is 30 years old now and positive for the gene the odds are that he will start showing symptoms before your child or children reach university age.\n\nSpeaking personally, everyone is different and I understand that getting tested is a huge life changing decision but I feel strongly that as soon as you add having children into the equation then the genetic testing should be done first.  It does not remove your possibility for children but at least you are aware of your partners future and can guarantee your children are HD free.  Still, I can understand why someone would avoid testing and nobody in the HD community is going to judge you if you just jump right into the IVF instead. I assume you are in the states, in which case IVF is not going to be covered by any insurance companies that I am aware of. One of my friends is talking about going down to Peru for IVF but she has some kind of dual citizenship so that probably makes it easier. Honestly, and I know this is hard, but if you want to have children he should probably get tested so that you can plan appropriately.  Do not make that assumption. I live in NY and my health insurance covers 2 rounds of IVF. It is entirely dependent on your policy. You have to go through the coverage information with a fine-tooth comb.  I am at risk and have two bio children. One Inhad at 18 the other I had at 25. I do wish I had of tested before having them sometimes. But I also do not think I would even know what it is to love someone so much as I love my boys without experiencing being a mother. However, I refuse to have anymore children not knowing my status. I can not put anymore at risk. And if I am positive I will help my sons pay for their IVF when they choose to have children. And also be very verbal about their risk of passing it on when they get old enough to talk about choosing to have sex. \n\nThe risk of the CAG repeats getting higher also increases with a Male passing on the HD gene. Which means a higher risk for juvenile HD. Which is a horrible thought for your child. So even more reason for your partner to be tested. \n\nThere are also a lot of reasons that are positive to be tested! New treatments are coming out, he can also become part of study groups to better understand HD and help with the making of new treatments. There is one that is being trialed which lowers the production of the Huntinton protein which causes the brain deterioration. It showed a lot of promise in animal trials and seems tolerable in humans! \n\nAt the end of the day it is his choice. Maybe ask him to see an HD clinic, tell him to go to the bone his family goes to.  Interesting. Does your insurance cover all of it, or are you expected to pay a percentage? They cover all of it. I have not personally used it, but I have many coworkers who have. After you have been trying to conceive naturally for a year (prove that, lol) my insurance will cover the IVF drugs, the extraction, all the testing and lab work, and the implantation. And once the woman is pregnant, they cover the pregnancy-related medical costs. (I am a public employee in NYC, fwiw, so this is pretty standard here.)  Oh wow, that is awesome! Minus the conceive naturally for a year part anyways... Yeah, there is no real way to enforce that.  The only thing I think it really does is exclude people who are trying to avoid passing on something like HD since it is not that you necessarily have a problem conceiving, it is that you have a gene shindig you do not want to pass down.  I am 28 and have HD, but I would love to start a family one day after I get my degree. My SO is in full support of me getting IVF treatment done. His family is friends with one of the best IVF specialists in the world, for that I am lucky. I have met with her and created a plan for the future, to have IVF done internationally in the next 5 to 10 years depending on how I feel while I am working in the medical field.\n\nIVF is an incredible tool that allows families to bring a child into this world, who will not have Huntington's or any other genetic disease that IVF can screen for. The only issue is the cost... In the UK, people get 3 rounds of IVF for FREE. This is how I wish that the US would treat IVF. Making the choice to start a healthy family, should not cost thousands of dollars!

I have gotten myself a therapist to hopefully cut off or lesson the damage of any upcoming metal / behavioral problems and I have gotten myself a neurologist to also keep tabs on my physical  and cognitive status. During my first visit I was asked a series of questions one of them being if I have any uncontrolled movements. I have noticed nothing that I believe to be out of the ordinary but in this area it is hard to detect what would be an emerging symptom to what other people may experience from day to day.\n \nThe main reason for this post is that recently I have been noticing slight tremors in my calves as I fall asleep. I am a runner and I work out regularly and I know muscles can behave differently when stressed. I have also done me research up and down and I know the symptoms of HD front to back but what seems to be lacking in data is a patient perspective. What I am hoping for from you fine people is a first person perspective to help me gauge what my level of concern should be at this point. Any insight would be helpful. Thank you.

Hi all, \n\nI had known early on that my husbands Mom had HD. Her symptoms started showing around mid 30's I think. Her mother ( his grandmother, also had it, but his great grandmother did not). From what he had told me, he told me males were less at risk, and that they were more worried about his sister ( but what I have read since then tells me it is wrong)\n\nCan anyone explain this: inheriting the gene does not mean you will get the disease, right? it just means you inherited it? \n\nDoes he also have a 50/50 chance of getting it? \n\nAlso if his great grandmother did not have it and just his mom and grandmother did, how did his grandmother get it? I thought it had to just be passed and passed?\n\nWe just got married, I feel incredibly lucky and blessed to have found and even just know him, he is my whole heart and now I am becoming more and more afraid, as he mentioned just yesterday that he did not want to tell me, but sometimes he is afraid he might have it. \n\n\nThank you all Male and females both have a 50% chance of inheriting this disease. So if could be possible that his great grandfather had it, since his great grandmother did not. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me. I do have another couple of questions, I am going to PM, thanks I was actually way wrong about it. His dad says that his mom actually had symptoms when she was 19-20 maybe before, and he knew there was something going on but did not know that was it, neither did she. So my husband is now 7 years older than his mom when hers started and he does not have any of the real symptoms, just fidgeting sometimes and hyper focus on certain things ( an not focusing on others) like adult ADHD but he says he is been having them since middle school age. \n\nI do not want to say we are in the clear,but for my longevity and not just mentally driving myself to my grave, I am going to choose to believe that right now it does not mean anything. I have not been able to eat the past couple of days, and I am chronically ill with gastroparesis so I am sick almost 90 percent of the time anyways, and it is amazing but even my husband is mentally much better off than I am, he just has such a positivity to him. It makes me feel selfish that I am falling apart and he is not. \n\nAny insight you have into when symptoms usually start would be helpful, in your opinion and experience, would they already be developing? Thank you She was 44 when she died...so maybe the true start of it was early 20s. That makes more sense if Im thinking correctly. \n\nThank you. Were in the us.  I will see what he wants to do. If he would rather not bother himself with it and just chooses to not dig for anymore info then I want to respect that. If I still feel this deep pain on the level I do now I might seek out some of those resources for myself in conjunction with my counselor. \n\nAlso, you say a later age of onset is more common with mother to child than father to child? \n\nThank you so much\n\n Generally speaking, the younger you are when you get it, the faster the disease progresses. It is impossible to tell, but, if she died at 44, it would be a pretty long duration from her early 20s. Maybe it started more in her 30s? If her disease followed a typical course, that would be more likely. Does not mean it is impossible, though.\n\nAs for the age of onset: genetics can be random, so it is important to remember this is just what is likely, not what is. A later age of onset is more common from mother to child than father to child. That does not mean it is common though, and that does not mean the reverse does not happen occasionally. \n\nOf course, it is your husband's decision to not look further. But I want to point out how much this affects you, too- not just emotionally, but financially and legally. You and your husband can learn more about the disease without finding out whether your husband has it. You can also look into getting long-term care insurance, or getting life insurance, or starting to save aggressively, or writing wills, or designating medical proxies, or staying in shape and eating healthy without finding out if he has HD-\n they are just good things for everyone to do. And, if you are considering children, they have procedures like IVF to make sure that the trait is not passed on. \n\nMy dad had HD, and he had children before you could test for the gene. He stuck his head in the sand and refused to believe he could have it, even when he was sick. Then my mom got sick and I had to handle all the legal and financial stuff that my parents could have taken care of. I was 20. By the time I was 25 I was writing checks for more than $13,000 a month for their nursing homes. Knowledge would not have saved my parents, but it could have made our lives easier and allowed me to focus more on my parents in their last years instead of focusing on how to care for them.", "In love with Huntington\u2019s Hello all, I am new to Reddit so I do not know how this all works but I am looking for a community of people that know what I am going through. \n\nMy (F23) boyfriend (M22) have been together for about 5 years. I love him dearly. A few years ago we found out that his dad had Huntington\u2019s. He told me but his dad was not overly symptomatic so I did not really think about it. I did not entirely know what it was and just thought when he was older he would basically have Alzheimer\u2019s but that would be far away. Maybe 2 years ago we talked about it more and I researched how bad the disease is. That is when I started realizing him much trouble my boyfriend was in. Throughout the next year I worried about it and we slightly talked about how we would want him to get tested before we had kids. (We have known since we were 18 or 19 that we are getting married one day). Then last Year he was tested and tested positive for the disease with 44 repeats. It was terrible and 3 days after telling me that he broke up with me. I was heartbroken and my world was shattered. At the time he said that he did not want to ever get married or have kids or live a life with someone. We spent a year apart but talked a few times and in the last 4 months or so have decided to get back together. He says that he wanted to give me an out and that breaking up with me was to make sure I knew I could leave and would not feel trapped. I understand his logic but it still was traumatizing. I feel so guilty for being hurt though because I do not even have the disease. I am not supposed to be the one that is upset and depressed.. i want to be supportive and strong but I am more emotional than him. I love him with everything and I have come to the conclusion that I want to spend the rest of whatever time we have left with each other. My family knows everything and we are very close and I also feel like they think I am throwing my life away because it is going to be a long hard life with him and We probably should not have kids. I have always wanted kids and I feel confident in my ability to be a really good parent and people have always said that. I know there is other options like IVF or foster or adoption but they are expensive and I do not want them to grow up to love their dad and then he dies a long and painful death. I just feel alone and literally no one in my life understands. I try not to bring it up with him either cause I do not want to hog all the emotional drama when he is so nonchalant and level headed about the future. Granted he was a mess when we were broken up, he seems so collected when it comes to his diagnosis. \n\nSorry this is a long and unstructured rant, I just could really use some words and reassurance that others are going through this.  It is not uncommon for someone with a terminal disease, especially a younger person, to push away loved ones thinking they are (the one) doing it for them (the many). He does not want you to remember him that way, or he does not want you to have to live that life, etc. etc. In the end, most of the ill people regret having pushed away their very support net and are quite relieved if/when they get them back.\n\nAs far as biological kids go, yeah there is a chance they would have it. Nobody can really promise one way or another. Adoption is always an option.\n\nYou guys have stuff to work on, no doubt. Honestly it would be best to do it with a councilor with expertise in this area. A third party can give you both insight that can help. He should see a councilor on his own as well so he can start acclimating himself to his situation.\n\nYou guys are not alone and the support net will only get bigger. I read this book to get the experience of other people in the same situation.\n\n\n\nIVF does not have to be expensive.\n\n\n\nFind local community groups. There are thousands of other people going through the exact same situation. Reaching out to your local HDSA chapter or other HD group could be a good first start. \n You have every right to be dramatic and depressed. You should definitely talk to him and let him know that you will always be there for him and find a counselor or therapist for the both of you. It could seriously alleviate a lot of your stress to talk about it. HD affects everyone close to the person actually with it. Something that my movement disorder doctor said is that he completely believes that, within 5-10 years, there will be a cure. I do not want to give out false hope, but at this point, that is all we have to look forward to. This bit of hope is the only thing getting me through this with my family. Sending you all the good vibes I have! Thank! I used to see a therapist on my own for anxiety and clinical depression. I stopped cause I ran out of stuff to talk about. He went to counseling with his family but we have not talked about going together as a couple. Is that normal even though we are not married? I am moving in with him soon so it would probably be a good idea if we can  I have heard the 5-10 years thing and that makes me feel better but I am also scared to get my hopes up. \n\nThank you for these resources! I will look into them  Thank you so much! I have heard of the 5-10 year time frame for a cure and that really gives me hope but that is also scary... I am going to look into counseling I think when I move in with him in a couple months. Thank you for all your words  What IS *normal* nowadays? You are a couple and you are wanting to make it work so yeah - It will be worth it. It can help you both learn to deal with what is coming; something that likely will not be for a long time. You mentioned he does not want his kids to go through his ordeal, but honestly as long as you are upfront and honest with them from the beginning it probably will not be as bad as he thinks. They may be grown by the time he starts getting worse. They may not. No certainties with this disease, but if you all do it together I promise you it will be better for all of you. I guess when I said normal I was thinking the logistics of insurance. We are separate so idk how to go about couples therapy. I think having kids is doable but I am not entirely sure that is what we want yet. I am probably getting caught up in the future and need to slow down but I am just nervous and anxious and want to plan everything  5-10 years could be before your boyfriend even develops symptoms. This may even be a non-issue for you. At least, that is what I keep telling myself. That is definitely a possibility and I pray that that is the case. With 44 CAG repeats it looks like he will start getting sick around early 40\u2019s? His dad has 40 repeats and he got sick around 50 and my boyfriend is 22 now so I hope there is time. Do you mind me asking how old you are and when you started showing symptoms? Also is it acceptable to just have kids once there is a cure knowing they can just be cured when they are older? Again, I feel like I have to plan our whole future right now  WOW. You just described my current situation. I am pretty sure my ex dumped me for this same reason. We dated for 15 months and he dumped me over text. His mother has Huntington\u2019s. She is wheelchair bound, cannot go to the bathroom on her own, cannot bathe on her own, can barely speak, etc. It is horrible. I always treated my ex\u2019s parents and especially his mother with the upmost respect. Most people that came around were scared of her and to interact with her but I was not. I always hugged her and talked to her like she was just another person. \n\nMy ex is the spitting image of his mother, I know that does not mean a lot but it still freaks me out. We went on a cruise in January of this year and one night we went to take pictures and he refused. I angrily said, \u201cI want to document this time in our lives because god forbid you are sick one day.\u201d He left the room, went to the top deck and cried. I knew I was wrong and I apologized, but he was unsettled. When he dumped me the most concrete thing he said to me was, \u201cI do not like that you worry about me being sick like my mom one day.\u201d None of it made sense. He said he still cared about me and that he thought splitting up was best. He said, \u201cI am trying to get you to realize I am not what you think I am.\u201d It scared me because I think he may know he too could have Huntington\u2019s. The weekend before he broke up with me he said, \u201csee this is why I could never date anyone else I know I am never going to be this happy again.\u201d\n\nHe has done the same thing your boyfriend did. He apparently does not hangout with his friends anymore and refuses to speak to me. He is had my number blocked since June. I said to him, \u201cif this is about your mom - you cannot hate me for worrying about you and your health. We dated for over a year, that is what girlfriends do.\u201d He said, \u201cget the fuck out of here with that shit, fuck you. Move on.\u201d \n\nIt hurt, I still to this day do not know what to do because I think this is a mom issue. I think it is an intimacy issue. I think it is a scared to get close issue. \n\n Oh my goodness, that is so sad and I am so sorry. It sucks being pushed out and told that you cannot care about them. I logically understand where my boyfriend and kind of where yours are coming from. It would be a hell of a lot easier if we could just move on and fall in love with someone else. In my case, that is not possible. After five years I cannot imagine or even want a life with someone else. Its taken over a year of self reflection and alone time but I have come to the conclusion that I want as much time as he has and I will be there for him for as long as he allows me. We had to have the discussion that he is not allowed to push me away anymore though. If he wants to break up for a specific reason obviously that is okay but he cannot decide what I want or what is best for me. It broke me a year ago and my family is extremely wary now of how this will work but i trust him and want to make the effort. How old are you guys? It sounds like he is at risk and has not been tested?  Oh my goodness, that is so sad and I am so sorry. It sucks being pushed out and told that you cannot care about them.

It sounds like he is at risk and has not been tested?  He is 25, his mom was diagnosed when he was 5. So he is literally watched his mom slowly rot for 20 years of his life. I am 22. I have told him that I would never leave him if it came down to it, I think that terrifies him. The one time I tried to sit down with him and talked about it he started to tear up, could not look me in the face and said, \u201cI cannot do this\u201d and left the room. \n\nWe never had serious problems in the relationship. There was no cheating, lying, mistrust or anything of that nature.\n\nSince we broke up, he has ACTED OUT hardcore. He has talked shit about me on twitter, seeks attention from girls anywhere he can get, turned my friends against me, spends absurd amounts of money on things, talks down about women and their bodies - he was never ever like this prior and while we dated. It makes me scared because I do not know who this person is. He literally acts like a child.  I am sorry. that is terrifying because it just makes you worry more. My boyfriend has gone the opposite direction ( graduated college, got a full time job, extremely responsible,) which I am thankful for but his sister is acting out and she is younger so I get it. Everyone involved with this fucked up disease needs counseling it feels like.  I would say late 30s/early 40s, likely no later than 45. Unfortunately, those who are passed the gene paternally usually have an earlier and quicker progressing onset than those who receive it maternally.\n\nIt sucks, but in a sense, you do have to plan your future right now if you are committed to him. No one can tell you how to live your life, but conventional wisdom would be to ensure your offspring do not have it - either through IVF or adoption.\n\nThe bright side is, you guys are young and it could be twenty years before he is symptomatic. A lot can happen in 20 years.", "Denial as a way of life Ever known someone who is in denial about some fundamental aspect of their life \u2013 or worse yet, ever been that person? Yeah, me too.

Hello, my best friend was tested ten years ago and is 28 now. She is pretty much my platonic life partner and she and her daughter mean everything to me. I plan on being her caregiver when things progress because she does not have much family, and the family that does also has Huntington's. I understand the disease and just need guidance from other people who also have this disease.\n\n-How can you appoint someone as a caregiver and what was the timeline for getting a POA? How far into the disease is someone capable of doing so? I feel it should be done as soon as possible but I do not want her to feel as though she is losing her freedoms.\n\n-I am mot married. Currently I have had to use my vacation time to care for her, is there any way to legally be able to assist her with medical insurance/assistance with her child/pto things like that without becoming her spouse? Personally not opposed because I feel it would make things easier. I just do not think that is necessarily... legal?\n\n-Progression of Huntington's from knowing her mom was gradual. Her mom recently died, she was 50. Lately my friend has been having episodes of tremors that are intense or require an emergency room visit. They last from 2-6 hours and have peaks where they are worse and then subside. Is this Huntington's or possibly something else? Everything I have seen I have not heard of someone having episodes like this. \n\nWith this post I am really just trying to find guidance in the best ways to support my friend. I am her real only support that can help her the best financially and emotionally, and later when that time comes I will be her daughters guardian. I just do not know if there are any other legal steps I can take to assist her better. I have great insurance and she currently has no way to see a neurologist or better psychiatrist. My employer is thankfully understanding, but I cannot give the reason I am missing work is because of my best friends health concerns for very long. I feel they or any other employer I may go to will not see that as serious because she is not a spouse or blood relative. \n\nI appreciate any advice, this disease is bullshit for anyone it affects and my heart goes out to all of you. Everyone with a terminal illness deserves the best throughout their life. I do not really know how to answer your questions  on finances and the like but I will say that you are a saint to embrace someone with Huntingtons like this.\n\nHD is a lot to deal with and for the people who have it in their family, they have no choice but to deal with it. You have the choice and it is admirable that you are picking the difficult path.\n\nRegarding those intense tremors, that does not sound quite like HD. It is often quite consistently gradual, as you saw in her mother. The tremors do lessen during sleep and some medications/substances. Is your friend on medications that would have such an effect? Sounds like something the physicians at the emergency room should have picked up on. I am not a lawyer, but marriage would be a perfectly legal solution. As far as I am aware, such a marriage would only be illegal if the purpose was to sidestep immigration laws. Honestly, I think you will face an uphill battle without it. I hate to be advocating for such a thing, but it is the way things work. It would also help with custody issues too.\n\nMy mother-in-law had it, and my brother-in-law is getting into the bad years. He used to walk to work every day. Now he cannot because of falls. Unfortunately for my wife and I, he is pushed just about everybody out of his life.\n\nI agree with Pbadger8 though, the tremors you describe do not sound like a normal symptom. Uncontrolled movements are very common, but what you describe sounds more like a seizure. Seizures are common only in juvenile-onset HD. Those episodes would be my most immediate concern. It is not impossible though, and  seems relevant. Hello! I do not have much to add, but I wanted to mention that my mom had intense tremors when she was suffering with Huntington\u2019s. She was diagnosed at 22 and it progressed until she was 30. My grandma suspected that she began showing symptoms at 13 however. Her tremors were very aggressive and sometimes would lead into seizures. \n\nYour friend is very lucky to have someone like you in their life.

You cannot let the inevitability of deterioration bring you down.  \n\nThis is not a death sentence at your age and where we are at with potential treatments. I have a family member who has RA. She goes and gets her treatments once a month. People who are one generation older than her there will often be wheelchair bound and almost crippled. She has one finger that gives her issues. That is it. Treatment changed that fast for RA, who knows what could one day happen with HD.  It seems more than that though, he seems cold and uncaring. He is probably given me two half hearted cuddles in these past few months. I love him but I never expected him to react like this.\n\nIt is not so much about having gene-negative kids as it is me leaving him with the responsibility of taking care of both me and kids, I love my dad dearly and he is an absolute hero but we were sometimes left by the wayside for my mother and now I am older I completely understand why, I do not think I could do that to my own children, not that I disagree with anyone one here who makes any other decision, it is just the way I look at it.\n\nThank you though, you have talked me down a little, I will try not to panic for now. I really hope so. One thing that always strikes me about HD is that until recent history, it was rare for people to live long enough to even know they had it! It is a bit morbid and comforting at the same time.\n\nEnjoy every single day you can. Do the things you love. Life is impossible to understand and even harder to plan for. Have fun and just focus on being happy.  I am glad to have stumbled across your post, it is been over a week now, how are things going?\n\nWhile later in life you will be developing HD, it is usually the 'thinking about it' that is more stressful than the actual changes that HD causes. As HD progresses, you will likely have less insight into the changes that are occurring, and may even be largely unaware. Your family however, will be. Please consider supporting them as much as you can now, as their memories of the caring and supportive person will be a strong motivation for them to continue to care for you even when you cannot care back.\n\nPlease continue to share your experience so we can all learn together. I have been here with my partner and he has gotten a lot better. I have just tried to be very vocal about my feelings around HD and how I am the one who has no choice to leave if I am postive. \n\nMy Dad left my Mom when she got sick. And part of my deepest fears are having spent the best years of my life with someone who will leave me. He used to get angry at this notion; as if it was offensive to him. But we reached a common ground through communication (mostly me telling him how I felt; and that he was gaslighting me and taking away from a serious fear by making it about himself). And we are a lot better now. Every six months or so I get a bit low and just need to be told \"I will be there\". \n\nOther conversations that need to be had are what about end plans? Will you go into a home at a point? Do you want a DNR (Do not recesitate) These are all things that your partner will need to discuss with you. Even his family. My husband says he would not be able to sign off on taking me off of machines if I was ever in that position; so my MIL said she would be my power of health. That way she can make the call and my husband would not have to. \n\nThese are all still hypothetical for us as I have not been tested; but I too am a planner.

I have grown up my entire life watching and caring for people with HD. My grandmother, uncles, aunts, cousins, and my mom have all had HD. Just a horrible horrible disease. I currently just placed my mom in a care home because she was to hard for my fianc\u00e9e and I to take care of.  Now I am battling my own demons with being tested. I have a test date of October 25th, but as it gets closer it seems like my life is falling apart at the seams.  Maybe it is just a coincidence IDK. My relationship with my fianc\u00e9e is unbearable, as my mood swings are so erratic and unpredictable. I do not know what to do. We were on the verge of breaking up before I got the test date, but now I am scared that if we break up I will not be wanted by anyone if I have a positive result (which I think I will have). I do not want to be damaged goods. I want to be loved and cared for like everyone else. I do not want to die alone. Are there places or groups to talk to others with HD?  Cannot really find anything local. Just want to talk to others that have gone through the process. Maybe someone can steer me in the right direction and help me sort out my thoughts. Sorry for rambling. I just feel so lost. I do not know where to go with my life.  1, Dont be sorry. 2, You are not alone. Everything you are feeling is natural and normal. You are you. The result is just that. An answer to a question. If you have it, you have had it since birth. So you will continue to be you. \nYour relationship has nothing to do with HD. And trust me from experience, you can find happiness. If you let yourself. Good luck for the 25th. I will be thinking of you and crossing my fingers.

If it is any consolation, when I got out of my 6 year relationship, I thought no one would ever want to date me knowing I have HD... but I have found over the past year since the break up that I was totally wrong about that.   \n\n\nIf you ever want to chat, I would be happy to exchange contact info with you!

I have not seen one but I am a part of a general HD support group. We meet once a month. The surprising part is that about 75% in the group are spouses. I think they often need just as much support. Oh man I will join in a heartbeat! You might find something on Facebook Is it possible you could DM me a link? My husband's mother has HD and he refuses to be tested and I am nervous about the future. The one I go to is through our local chapter so it is for people that live in or near our city.

I was wondering if anyone elso who is presymptompatic are hesitant to get the covid19 vaccine? I feel like my neurologist gave me a placated answer, but it is not good enough for me to roll the dice. What are your thoughts? There is zero data gathered from long term trials on humans. There is literally no evidence against a possibility that everyone who gets the vaccine goes blind in two years time.\n\nRemember that a guarantee is useless when whatever is guaranteed to not happen does happen. My mother, who has HD and also had COVID last year, got the vaccine and she is had no issues.\n\nI am not aware of any evidence that folks with HD are at any greater risk than the general population. I understand your point about the lack of long-term trials, but I do not really understand the rest. I am not sure how \"there is no evidence that X will not happen in Y years\" is a compelling argument. That argument can be made against literally anything and would, by your logic, be an argument to never do anything in life. I mean, there is no evidence that humans who took the Polio vaccine in the '70s will not have great-great-grandchildren who mutate into cows. But that is not really a compelling argument to avoid the Polio vaccine, is it?\n\nOf course, we all have to weigh the risks of any choice we make, including taking a vaccine. But we do know that vaccines, in general, are effective, and the risks of side-effects of vaccines are infinitely less than the risk of getting the underlying diseases.\n\nSo no, we do not know that people who took the vaccine will not go blind in two years, but we do know that over 3.7 million people who *did not* take the vaccine are dead. My mom has HD and got the vaccine earlier this year (so did everyone else in the house). We have seen absolutely no adverse side effects for her or anyone else. She barely even had a sore arm after getting the shots. I feel like the short term benefits of being protected from COVID outweigh the possible long term side effects of the vaccine. I would rather my mom is protected from a virus that would most likely kill her soon than worry about something that may or may not happen in the future. I am presymptomatic and got my vax as soon as I was eligible. Eta, no issues so far. X.

Since this diagnosis, she has become very aware of her mom and aunts day to day, mannerisms, memory lapses, nervousness, fidgeting, etc. As well as her own. She is also a bit of a hypochondriac so whenever something happens she tries to connect the dots to a diagnosis. \n\nEven though no one has gotten tested except her grandfather she is convinced that she has it. We have had numerous conversations where I am trying to convince her she does not, otherwise, she gets extremely pessimistic. I understand that this is scary to hear in any one's family. It could potentially affect all of our loved ones down to the children in our family. I have tried numerous times to convince her mother or aunt to get some testing done to be able to know for sure if it is going to affect anyone else but they have declined. My wife will not do it because she is scared of the diagnosis. I really do not know what to do about this situation. \n\nI know with this disease the symptoms vary from person to person. Are there any hallmarks or concrete indicators that the disease is present? Is there any advice anyone can offer in this situation?\n\nThank you for reading. if she is that worried, the only thing that will ease her mind is a negative result. \n\nif you dont have constant experience with it, the little signs are hard to see. mostly its a tension that they have, and the jerky kind of movements that are very different from a worried person has. like their internal spatial awareness calibration is out of whack. it is not just that they move it how they move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhat was her grandfathers repeat count?

They doctors tried a few diagnosis until they did a genetic test and I was a positive for HD. I did not think too much about it because I did not want to worry about it. 1 year ago, 5 years into the disease, it is was clear to me that the tremors had worsened to an extent and I was being much clumsier compared to the previous years. I would get severe panic attacks from thinking about the future and despite therapy nothing has helped. About 1 year ago during lockdown I was basically losing my mind and I decided to make some changes in my life. I do not have any family and nobody depends on me so I decided to quit my job and sink into drugs, alcohol and promiscuous sex. For the past year I have only hung around with low lives from Tinder, did a lot of cocaine and I have been having a lot of good time. I have a house I inherited from my mother when she passed away from cancer and I have been living off my saving that can last me a few years still. My days boil down to eating junk food, finding someone on Tinder to fuck me like I am some kind of blow up doll, doing drugs and sleeping when the sun in rising. I am not stupid and I know this lifestyle is not healthy and that kind the point. I want it to kill me before HD. I am also not telling anyone to cope with the disease like I am doing, this is just how I decided to end it. Every time I get tremors I smoke weed so I can stop thinking about it. Despite being shitfaced half the time I still prefer this over being sober and aware of what is going on. Feel free to judge me. No judgment here. I am sorry it is affecting you at such a young age.

Do you have access to any clinical trials? Has your thinking been affected? Are you a spiritual person? What do you want people to know about HD?  I am 28 and from an HD family as well and I have not been tested for this exact reason. My mom started to get her symptoms at 29. There is no judgement here because I would prob do the exact same and try to burn out in a blaze of sex, drugs and glory rather than be reduced to a trembling schizophrenic deranged homeless person. \nI understand where you are coming from. As long as you are okay with how you are going out, the rest does not really matter because we are all eventually going to die anyway. I try to take it one day at a time but any twitch or anxious feelings and i feel like I am getting the disease.

I know her whole family and this is obviously devastating for them. She has not decided yet whether she wants to get tested, and the only reason she does not want to know is because she does not know how she will be able to handle it if she tests negative and either or both of her siblings are positive. She is not someone who is super forthcoming with her emotions or personal issues. I am fairly certain she would not have even told me if I had not asked her point blank how her family was doing during the quarantine. I do not know what to do for her now. \n\nI am curious if there is anything specific that people said or did for you that was helpful or meant a lot to you. And on the flip side is there anything people said that was upsetting? I want to be respectful, but I also want her to know she has support. Is there anything I should avoid saying to her? Or anything specific you wish someone had done for you while you were coming to terms with this? Thanks. Aw, you are a good friend. I would say the best thing you can do is listen and do not give advice unless she asks. Her best bet is to seek out genetic counseling to help her really weigh all the factors involved.\n\nOther than the testing aspect, what has been most helpful for my family is friends who do not disappear when things get uncomfortable. Advanced HD is really hard to watch, and even the earlier stages can cause unpleasant personality issues and disconcerting physical changes. People often naturally shy away and stop showing up because they just do not know how to act or what to say. Just being there and acting normal is huge. Like WestwardWoah said, be there to listen and provide support. Do something to show your support instead of just saying \u201cif there is anything I can do...\u201d\n\nThe friends most helpful to me did just that. They offered to take me out for beers or just come over to talk after my Mum\u2019s diagnosis, and then followed through on it. When we were out they listened and did not judge. The day after I told them I tested positive they left a 6 pack and supper on my step. When I told them I was going to do the 10k HD Run this year, one of them joined my team and started training right away to run with me.\n\nI think that is all you can do, be there to offer support and listen. Do not be pushy if your friend does not want to talk, but support them how you can. Knowing that someone has your back is really helpful. Most important thing, imo, is to let them know they are not alone. I felt SO alone when I was diagnosed, mainly because my family immediately treated me like I was dead in a week. I had to explain to them that I am still the same bloke. Do not keep reminding them, but show them that they are not alone. Keep being there. Keep checking in. A lot of people disappear when things like this happen. It gets disturbing. Just keep being there. I second that people shy away or stop showing up. Anything offered is awesome-- a grocery run or load of laundry for the family member, a convo over beers or funny movie night to laugh away some stress. This disease is so unique--no survivor walks or huge support groups. It is very lonely and isolated at times. I was surprised the tv show \"House\" had a storyline with a main character realizing she had it and showing how she decided to deal with it. \n\nOur support group dried up as people passed or worsened and could not make meetings. Oddly enough, in my job in LTC, I used to take care of a lady who had HD and I remembered her from the assisted living home where we used to meet. Her ex-husband was the only one I ever saw visit and they were brief little visits, so yeah, your friend will need you whichever way this all goes. When my friend's dad was in the nursing home for HD (at 53), I used to go visit with him, and we would watch tv or listen to music, just hang out and talk to him, tell him about our week. I respected when he did not want to go, and hung with him when his mom (who visited daily) could not make it and he needed to lean on someone. We had parties with rock music blaring from his boom box, and balloons and silly string were everywhere, and all the nurses and aides would come hang out and eat and talk, so every day is different.

He is on several types of anxiety meds and other meds to help control the chorea. That is a lot. Poor guy. Honestly it sounds like his current meds may not be a good fit. A doctor's appointment is probably a good starting place. Oof. Yeah. My boyfriend's father went through that phase this fall. Yes, it sounds like he needs a change of meds (and honestly if you can afford an in-home healthcare worker for at least a few hours a day, that might be worth it).\n\nBUT. If his doctor suggests he go to a psychiatric hospital to be monitored for a week so the new meds can be evaluated properly... let me just share our recent story.\n\nThe psychiatric hospital had a lot of addiction patients. Therefore, no one was allowed to visit him and he was not allowed to have his phone. They did not have ER facilities or anything beyond a basic nurse's station, because they are not a regular hospital, and they do not even have basic things like IVs because of suicide risks. Also, apparently hospital ERs do not like accepting psychiatric patients because of the suicide/violence risks. Therefore, psych hosps are supposed to do a full health screening at admission for CYA purposes. They did not.\n\nSo after a bunch of unsatisfactory update phone calls from staff in which it was clear that their initial \"everything's fine!\" was uninformed (he is not being violent with staff or refusing to take off his hat? Because he always does that. Would you check? Oh, it is taking three grown men to help him shower? So why did you say everything's fine??)\n\nNext thing we hear, he is in the hospital with pneumonia. Turns out he must have aspirated a piece of food before going, he was not scanned upon admission, and staff did not notice until it got really bad.\n\nSo... he was already doing really badly, and after 3 days in the hospital with pneumonia, (upon which we were informed that he suddenly had MRSA and we could not touch him without being completely covered in plastic PPE, he was moved to hospice, where he died a few days later.\n\nI am sorry if this is horrendously depressing. But, basically, his wife trusted a doctor who recommended a hospital which turned out to be a totally inappropriate and dangerous place to send a person with extremely advanced Huntington's.\n\nTL;DR: I recommend his wife does a shitton of research if she asks for his meds to be changed and his doctor recommends a stay at an unfamiliar facility.

Watched my mother and her brothers and my sister suffer and die of the disease. I have another sister in middle stages. Suffering from massive depression. Deep in debt from taking care of family. Feeling close to looking at ways to ease the pain. Cannot cope anymore, life has been nothing but pain and suffering. No money or credit left to help much less take care of myself. This disease is a curse for the poor. No one gives financial help. Too much greed in the world. HDSA does not help individuals and look at their financials, most money is going in their administrative pockets or to pay for awareness. I am done. Maybe there is peace on the otherside. Hey man, it sounds like you have worked incredibly hard to support your family, and that is a true reflection of you as an individual. This is a cruel and greedy disease that impact people and their relatives/friends so much harder than what people realise. I cannot give you much advice, but please remember what means the most in the world, and despite it can being a huge stress money and debt should not shadow that. It is hard, but you sound an absolute credit to your family, and yourself. Please take care of yourself, get support from people who can help, stay strong. Hey, I have recently started caring for a man with Huntington's disease and I have been truly humbled. \nYou have done an incredible thing caring for your family, be kind to yourself and remember what a wonderful difference you make to their lives. I am so sorry for everything you have been through. I know you said you have tremendous medical debt, but are you seeing a therapist or psychiatrist? Psychiatrist only pushing me pills. On high dose of clonozipam just to stay settled. Just got a $35,000 medical bill for myself for a procedure that ended up being out of my network. On top of that I am over 50 grand in credit card debt from taking care of things through the years. Good job but will never get ahead of enough to help family at this point. Maybe if I do it right my life insurance will at least help family. Please PM me if you want to talk, or call the suicide hotline in your area. \n\nNothing is so bad that you are out of options, certainly not debt. This is exactly what bankruptcy is for, maybe post to /r/personalfinance and ask for advice on your situation. I know things seem bleak and desperate, but there is help and options available. You have certainly been dealt a rough hand. Life can be very unfair.\n\nSounds like you saw a really shitty psychiatrist. I would suggest keep looking for a good therapist -- they are hard to find, but they are out there.  \n\nI agree with you about the HDSA. It is not very clear to me what they do other than print pamphlets. But maybe call them and see if they can help out at all? or if there is a center of excellence nearby, call the social worker and see if they can help (or even if they are not nearby)?\n\nPotentially stupid suggestion, but can you take a day or two off? Or even an afternoon? And just do something you want to do? Even if it is just a walk alone? Even if it means your sister having a shitty few days without your help. I think you need to put yourself first for a beat here.\n\nDebt sucks. I have had pretty good luck just ignoring it, and letting my credit get fucked. Then, when times were better, I got my shit together again. After seven years, you can start all over again!\n\nAnother potentially stupid suggestion: any chance of getting your sister on medicaid, or in a state-run home? I know that is not ideal, but it is better than what you are looking out now. \n\nYou are obviously an incredibly brave, compassionate, person. I know it is hard, but the world really needs people like you. It would be a tremendous loss if we were to loose you. I am crying just thinking about it. Please give it another chance? Please find some help.  You have given so much.  I hear you about the financial situation.  Sometimes resources will even mention that HD ruins families economically, but when they talk about fundraising it is all about sexy crisper research, not medical bills.   That is all great for the future, but does not fix the immediate problems that families have.  I do not have solutions, but your worth is immeasureable and I hear your pain.

I think there could be huge risks. Even if these websites do not test for HD (or release medical data because it is against FDA regulations), they could store the data. Government agencies are already accessing the genetic information to solve cold cases through genome mapping --- the Golden State Killer was identified because his distant cousin submitted DNA to 23andme. What if medical insurance/credit agencies are given access to the store genetic data? Even if the genetic material was not supplying the HD documentation, public death records in the family trees could point to what living family members could possibly have HD. It is possible that we specifically all share a common ancestor, way, way, back. 10 million Americans have already submitted DNA and there is a projection that by 2021, 90% of Americans will be able to be identified through genome mapping even if they have not submitted their own DNA. it is estimated that around 800 people typically share a third grandfather and that only 1 or 2 people in that familial group need to submit their DNA for everyone in the group's DNA to be able to be known. The commodification of DNA and genetic data is already dystopic enough on its own --- but even more so when dealing with a fatal hereditary disease. Even if only a handful of us were to submit DNA to a database, it could be possible to determine *everyone* who carries the disease (and might carry the disease).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I first started getting support for HD (thank you everyone here for helping me), the most common advice I got was to avoid having anything on my medical record that states I have HD. I do not know yet because I have not been tested. But people said it could affect my capacity to get insurance or a good job in the States --- I did not know  this was possible and since I did not know HD was in my family, I have not firsthand heard/seen family members experience any kind of repercussions of that kind (I have never had health insurance anyway, it was always too expensive for my family to get). Have you seen it happen? Do you know how do insurance companies or employers get access to that information? What kind of things do you do to protect your privacy? Thank you for posting this because this topic has been on my mind a lot recently, especially  since I found out how the golden state killer was found. I am very hesitant to do ancestral testing (23andme, ancestry.com, etc.) because I am at risk for Huntington\u2019s. \n\nI have not even gotten tested for the simple reason that I do not want insurance agencies to find out. Years ago, it was possible to get tested anonymously in the United States and that is how my brother did it. But as I started calling centers and different testing places, it does not seem like they do it anymore.  I do not know how I should go about it, does anyone have any advice? I even looked to getting tested outside of the country and that (as you might have expected) seems to be a huge challenge in itself... A thing I learned researching this is that when HIV patients applied for testing through a government-operated clinic, they have to sign an agreement that if found positive, the doctor would contact their spouse or partner \u2014 they had to sign this in order to get access to cheaper (public/not private) means of testing \u2014 basically, not allowing HIV positive people to disclose their fatal disease to their life partner and loved ones. Whatever, we know they should disclose, because a lot of people here deal with anxieties over disease disclosure constantly. But the policy did not happen at private clinics where you could test anonymously, and the rate of personal disclosure was the same because believe it or not, most people do not want to kill other people.\n\nThis is a different disease, but what is troubling about compulsory non-anonymous testing is that data about this also-fatal disease could be used to prevent people from \u201cspreading\u201d HD \u2014 I.e. reproducing. That is only a hypothetical situation, but imagine if your genetic data was publicly knowable and attached to you on like future dating websites and future LinkedIn profiles. That everyone possibly affected by your sickness somehow has a right to know your future is absolutely absurd!\n\nI am kind of a hobbyist true crime lurker, and I love when violent cold cases are cracked and Jane Does are identified. I just do not think that we know yet how this data will be used, and we know from cases like Cambridge Analytica that technology can outpace ethics and regulation if it is new, misunderstood, and profitable. So, having Huntington's disease in the US will affect your ability to get long term care insurance (helps with costs associated with long term care, nursing home, etc), disability insurance, and life insurances. When I was tested, I was advised to have all of these coverages under my belt BEFORE the results were disclosed to me so I could not be excluded from coverage.\n\nThere is a law called Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) and that is a United States federal law that protects individuals from genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment. Genetic discrimination is misuse of genetic information, including family health history, the results of genetic tests, the use of genetics counseling or other genetic related services, and participation in genetic research.  has a lot of good information. Thank you! I did not know about HD before finding out I might have it, so I am missing so much of this type of advice and background knowledge. Anytime! I know how scary it can be to face this... If you have not looked already, definitely check out resources on the HDSA's website. They have a ton of helpful information.", "Underwear dilemma Hi! I need advice on a pretty gross situation so, TMI I guess, sorry. My mother is declining pretty fast right now and it is at a point where she kind of refuses to wear underwear, but she is sitting all day so she needs something down there. Also when she is on her period she just tried to use washcloths or other weird things like that to catch the blood instead of underwear and pads, or tampons or anything. I was wondering what some good alternatives to underwear there are for her so that she does not get an infection or anything, but it is not uncomfortable enough not to wear. She is not very keen on diapers. Ask your doctor Would she be open to adult diapers? I would talk to her caregiver as well as her doctor. Can the dr bring on menopause early to make the period a non issue since she is not capable of properly dealing with it anymore? I feel like if she has a hangup about underwear she is not going to like an alternative, like diapers.

For those of you tested and positive, KEEP HOPE. Keep as healthy as possible, treatment may be only a few years away. I may not have it, but you bet your ass I will be spreading as much awareness as I can, giving as much support to the HD community as I can. Thanks so much for this.

I am afraid. Any advice on how to deal with all of this while destitute/impoverished would be welcome. I do not know where to start and feel the clock is ticking. There are probably some resources around some of the studies. There are several support groups in CO as well.\n\n\n\n Also, I personally know how easy it is to let the mind drag you into a bad place.

I hope that for once he can move around freely, walk and run for miles with no complications. I hope that for once he can express his thoughts and communicate with his voice freely with no complications. I hope that for once he can feast on whatever his heart desires. I hope that for once he can think, conceptualize, imagine, and understand things on the level of intellect that he used to be at.  I hope that for once he can be normal, and live how he would have wanted.

I could care less about a cure for myself, but I hope that a cure comes in time for him and those who I do not know who are also suffering from this monstrous disease. I also hope for a cure for those who are also impacted by this disease such as a person's surrounding family. I kind of get angry thinking about how people can be subjected to such a cruel disease and having suffered so much. I feel like my dad and those like him deserve courtside tickets to whatever they got going on in heaven just for how bad they had to suffer for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThinking about my father's death is very strange. When I was first told that my father had some disease in his brain as a young child I thought he was going to die very soon. When his death is drawn out over many years through different stages of debilitation it has made me think about the whole situation differently. The week leading up to his death I thought he would die each day so after a couple of days my tear supply dried up after a while, and I was able to be more content/calm about the whole situation. Though I was not prepared for the moments right before his death. He continued to worsen and it started to sound like he was struggling to breathe. I held his hand for hours and hours every day hoping that he would die while holding my hand like what he did for his dad, and I am so relieved that I was able to do so. Every day that I got to spend with him whether it be a bad day or good day I am glad that I went out of my way to spend time with him in some way shape or form. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad is the most wholesome person I know, often told he has such a big heart. The ironic part about it is that during the week where he was declining at a rapid pace, all of his organs gave way but not his heart. Up until his final minutes, his heart was pumping fast and hard. After that, I will always think of my dad as a big-hearted individual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot being old enough to know what I do not know is what gets to me thinking about my childhood. When I started getting to the age where I needed advice, wisdom, and guidance is when my grandfather and my dad started to rapidly decline. At the same time, I have to hand it to my mother who has kept my family grounded and has taken care of my father better than anyone else.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this time I have realized how thankful for all of the people that have loved and cared for my family.

My husband (42) just went into a long term care facility and I dread the day I have to say goodbye.  He too is such a wholesome man who loves God wholeheartedly.  He used to say \"I see it this way...either they find a cure or good news-I go to heaven and see my mom.\" Thank you for your reply I really appreciate it. My dad(46) knew where he was going, the thing that makes me sad is that I do not know for certain that his dad will be there to meet him, but I know for certain his mom is there. We joked with my dad by telling him that he had his mom worried sick about where he was at because she was expecting him a couple of days ago. I was very close to my dad and the idea of his inevitable death was always in the back of my mind. I hope you can come to peace with your husband's situation. I try not to be sad because I know that he was released from his prison sentence of a diagnosis. I wish you and your husband the best of health&gt; thank you :) This one heck of a nasty disease, but it has made me a very tough woman.  I took care of hubby for 6 years.  The last year has been brutal.  In February he took an overdose of over 200 pills and they did not think he would pull through, but he did.  God was not ready for him yet.  Since then, just the amount of medications he  is on made me 100000% burnt out.  His HD has balance issues, which from what I understand is not common.  One night, he had to go to the bathroom, fell into the toilet and shattered the whole thing.  There is a verse in the Bible I hold very dear and know I will be using it at my husband's funeral:   He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\" Revelation 21:4. I am glad that your husband is well, or as well as someone with his situation can be. My dad has definitely taken a toll on me and my mom over the last couple of years with taking care of him. I am starting to feel weird during the day thinking that I have to help take care of him as it has been part of my daily life for years and now gone. Oh and do not get me started on his balance and toilets. He walked and talked like a drunk so much that when he was walking around the neighborhood someone called the cops on him. He had also broken multiple toilets. He was pretty heavy due to his psych meds making him eat a lot, and liked to let gravity do it is work whenever he went to sit down anywhere. Multiple couches, toilets, and other pieces of furniture have been broken. We even have an extra toilet for spare parts now. The idea of heaven letting everyone free of suffering has been the main thing keeping me calm right now, as I know my dad is normal now. I still tiptoe past the bedroom door, worried I will wake him up....then I cry.  It is weird not having him home, but I am also sooooo glad he is not at home anymore, it would have killed me to have him home any longer.  Now I can relax, knowing he is being taken care of.  I see him getting worse, which really sucks, but I know because he had such early onset that it is going to go quick.  I learned quickly that nothing is Huntington's-proof.  Toilets, walls, anything not nailed down haha.  My only comfort is that this he will be free of this illness one day.  In the meantime, I deeply grieve the loss of my husband...I have not felt like his wife for a very long time.  Even know when I go visit him, I do not see my husband, I see someone I have taken care of.  Sounds bad, but it is the truth.

How much did it cost you financially, mentally, and physically? Are you glad you did it? \n\nI am starting to do research on IVF to grow my family and would love to hear first hand from those that have tried it. \n\nThanks! My wife was diagnosed with HD in 2012 and in 2013 we decided to try starting a family via IVF with PGD. At the time my insurance covered $20k toward IVF.  Our first cycle was extremely unsuccessful and the second only yielded three viable embryos and sadly all three had HD. With the clinic we used we only got two cycles for that $20k. One thing also, when we started to do IVF, we had to send a DNA sample to a third party clinic in order to map out exactly where the HD gene is located in order for them to accurately test the embryos. It is not a fast process. It took almost a full year from start to when our insurance ran out. We have our own theories about why IVF failed for us and the clinic we used. At that point our clinic suggested that my wife\u2019s body just was not responding to the medication and that we should consider an egg donor. Then they quoted us $30k for an egg donor and insurance was not going to cover any of it. We felt completely broken, helpless, and defeated. My wife started looking into egg donors internationally. We found an extremely reputable clinic that was a fraction of the cost. It was a long emotional process. But that process gave us a healthy child.  Financially, for us it was a lot to be honest. I really hope I am not sounding discouraging.  We are proof it can be done! The egg donor process was so easy and the clinic we used was so much more affordable. Thank you for sharing your story. I am so sorry that the process was to hard but it sounds like it was eventually well worth it. Congratulations on being a father! I wanted the honest truth and you get it to me. Thank you. We met with a fertility clinic this year and it has already been really discouraging. We have to fight with my insurance to try to get them to cover anything, otherwise it is so oppressively expensive there is no way we can do it. I am not feeling up to the emotional task of battling our insurance, or the drugs, or any of it.

My husband and I are starting the process now to try it. Best of luck! I am so sorry for all the hardships you have experienced. I cannot begin to understand how you are feeling. I hope that happier times are ahead for you. I am currently pregnant from our first cycle of ivf with pgd. My insurance only covered the genetic testing of embryos - we paid about 20k out of pocket for the rest. \n\nI am thankful it is an option and rage filled that it is so expensive. I have to luck of having had it work on the first try, which is not the case for many. \n\nCome take a look at /r/infertility where lots of people are doing ivf for genetic reasons. It is a great and supportive community that will be happy to answer your questions. Post in the daily chat thread rather than a standalone post for the most helpful responses. Hi... Yes we did. I am diagnosed with the Huntington anomaly (Cag count of 38), and since someone said, that it had the tendency to get worse for the child, when Huntington is inherited by the father's side, we decided to go for IVF and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. I now have a 3 year old son, and it was worth every penny.  \nThat being said: we tend to suppress the memories, because of how happy we are now, but it was an incredibly stressful situation. From taking the medicine, the ovum extraction, the drive to the clinic without knowing if we are having healthy cells to reimplant and finally the waiting for the pregnancy test. In not even complaining about the Money (we have paid around 15000\u20ac for four extractions, two genetic analysis and two reimplantations), but it was a huge stressful situation. What made matters worse for us was, that the test for Huntington in a preimplantation genetic diagnosis is illegal in Germany, so we had to go to Prague, which is a 3 hour drive for us. All in all my wife had 4 egg cells implanted (2 * 2) and we are now as happy as can be!  \n\nAgain: stressful, but it was worth it.", "How to handle delusions within someone with HD? So I am separated from my mom right now due the whole COVID-19 scenario, but she calls me almost daily asking strange questions like how my girlfriend is (i have no girlfriend), if her friend has called me (whom i have not spoken to in like 3 years), and she makes weird claims that I really do not know how to refute. I am really troubled by this and do not really know how to act. Should I just play along, or tell her that she is imagining things? Telling somone they are wrong and their memory is failling them/they are confused/wrong could be a bit stressful for them (it would be upsetting for anyone to be told their reality is wrong) - unless you can correct them in a trivial/friendly way. And you might dig yourself deeper playing along too much - \"yea GF is fine... oh you want her to come and visit?\".\n\nDeflection seems like a reasonable option all round - \"How is friend XYZ?\"  \"Yea all good, so what have you been up to today?\". It helps with my partners mother if she gets confused. Dwelling on a point does not help anyone I agree and this has worked for my family 100 percent. This is exactly what I do with my mom. She is 59 and is experiencing some of the late stage symptoms. I always learned to just change the subject as if what she is saying is completely normal. Sometimes she says some really strange things but I just smile and change the subject. No harm no foul. In general, when someone has dementia and is having delusions it is useless to try to correct them and it may upset them. Just try to live in their world.", "Huntington's Disease and Medical Marijuana - What Works? ", "Oldest person with HD Does anyone know what the oldest age someone with HD has lived to? I did not do too much research into this so please do not take my word as law, but from what I can see 86 years old is the oldest recorded. Hope this helps. Thank you so much and yes it does!! There is a gentleman in my support group that is in his 80s.  My wife\u2019s grandmother lived to 85 with it Omg that is awesome!! Thank you Thank you so much! My grandma was 73. She handled her disease very well until she was like 68 ish (Did not even notice it when I was younger), then every step came rushing fast and she died. My grandmother was 84 I believe. My Grandfather died at 80 with HD My Nana was 82 or 83 when she died. she was 40 when she was diagnosed The age is not the issue - you can start suffering at a late age and die from some other crap. The thing to look at is how long has someone lived with the symptoms for. I always hope that it will be a short time. My papa was 90 - he had progressed quite severely as his symptoms started at 50 ish. But he was happy and \u2018dancing\u2019 Omg I love to hear this!!  As we know medicine was limited back then so how wonderful he was 90\u2764\ufe0f Thank you Thanks! It is funny how a disease like HD can be so sad and scary but also so sweet and sensitive.

I have no family. And I think I just lost the love of my life because of this damn disease. I have known I have had HD for 8 years. I have been in a relationship for 3 years and I never mentioned it to him. I was petrified ever since my mom died from HD and I found out that I would die the same way, but being with him made me feel hopeful instead of just fear and anger. \n\nLast night he proposed to me and I told him I could not marry him. I told him that because I know he wants children and I know he is expecting a long and happy life. But I am 30 now. I could wake up tomorrow and start slurring my speech and lose the ability to control my arms. I will die slowly and I know he loves me enough to be there through every minute. He will watch me die and then raise our children alone, all the whole terrified of the 50% they will have to die just like me. \n\nThen in all likelihood he will watch at least one child die in the same he he will watch me. And I just could not do that to him. \n\nI am falling apart. I hate this disease. I just want to scream  The amount of empathy and love you clearly have just blows me away. \n\nI have nothing else to say. I wish you the best. And I am so sorry for this tragedy.  I am so sorry. I hate this disease. It ruins everything. Sending you all the good vibes. I was going to post this before your thread got locked:\n\nA lot of people in the comments here do not understand the trauma of a parental figure dying of terminal illness or suicide, and you went through both. You are obviously in denial about your diagnosis most of the time, with reality only sinking in from time to time when moments about your future (like this proposal) come through. You do not want it to feel real because you do not know how to cope with it.\n\nWhat you did was understandable from an empathetic position; I do not approve of it but I get why you did it. Telling your boyfriend would have popped the bubble of denial that is currently the only gift you have, because at some point the disease will rob you of the ability to live life, and before that fear of the disease destroys so much if you face it. You did not know how else to deal because you did not see anyone with a terminal disease live a full life as a child.\n\nI have seen someone with a terminal disease live a full life, raise children, be married. More than one person in fact. I think you should join a support group of people with terminal diagnosis; whether this relationship works out or not, it will help you cope with your Huntington's and learn how to both face the disease AND live without denial. The denial is a temporary coping mechanism at best.\n\nMeet other people living lives like yours without constant fear, and you may come to understand that no matter how many years you have left, they are still years, and yours is still a life worth living and being loved by others. I think he deserves to know. Or you deserve to know how he would handle knowing. But I am just a random internet stranger sympathizing with your position. He clearly loves you, and i want to believe that he would still want to marry you after you told him. \n\nYou are only thirty. It could take decades before your first symptoms start to set in, and maybe by then there is a cure in sight? You never know. \n\nI hope the best for you. It is a terrible thing to be cursed with, but we live in the moments of life we have been given, and it seems to me that you might miss out on the best moments of your life yet to come, if you let the fear of what might happen get the best of you. \n\nPlease down vote me to hell. I do not know what I am talking about. But it is from the heart. Hope it made sense.  Mod here.  Thread is not locked.  What makes your think it is? I was mentioning OP's post in a different subforum, sorry it was not clear! No problem.  Just wanting to make sure we were not overlooking something.   I really hope you got ahold of him and told him. Pretending like the disease isnt a reality will only make things worse. He deserves to know. Doesnt matter how hard it is to talk about. You will both feel SO much better if you just talk about it. I am at risk. I took a different approach and was upfront with people I dated super early on so they could bail if they wanted. I got married and I have a son.  I have religiously followed scientific research and I can say pretty confidently we will see a real treatment if not a \u201ccure\u201d for HD.  You definitely needed to tell him earlier on, but you should also know I left a woman for the same reason: she wanted kids and I was not going to take the risk.\n\nThen I got over myself and realized the whole problem could be avoided with only $700 using a sperm donor.\n\nWe had two beautiful, %100 biological kids and I love the bejeezus out of them! It is heart wrenching to hear how HD has affected you. I cannot imagine how awful this must feel for you. I do not have any great advice as to how to handle your situation, but I am thankful you are putting your story out there for other people to read and become more aware.\n\nI did want to suggest one thing you may not have considered. That is in vitro fertilization, whereby eggs are screened for the HD mutation prior to fertilization. If you went that route you could potentially have a child that definitely does not have the mutation and will not get HD. The main caveats to consider are cost (although some countries cover the first attempt) and time (it can be an arduous process).\n\nI hope the best for you whatever you decide to do. you got to tell him. my wife told me, and i did not leave. we just did not have kids. big hugs op.  I cannot imagine the pain you are going through right now. I am on the other side of this, my boyfriend is HD positive. He had gotten tested a while back, and we were friends before we started dating, so I knew about his HD on our first date. I do want to marry him and have children with him, even though I know there is a lot of uncertainty in the future. The truth is, there is uncertainty with any one, but I want to chose a future with him for the moments of happiness we do have together. I would rather do this with him, than with anyone else. And he has not asked me to take care of him, but he does not have to. That is part of loving someone. \n\nWe are both 33 and we are talking about In Vitro Fertilization, as others have mentioned there are options for having kids without the risk of the disease. \n\nI guess I am posting because I wanted to say that if he loves you, he might choose to have you through the good times even if it comes with difficult times. I hope this situation works out in the way that is best for you. &lt;3", "2 drugs already in use in humans had neuroprotective effect  From a quick first read the drugs are ( and this DBM system which ( is described as\n\n \"The Di Bella Multitherapy includes:\n\nSomatostatin, an inhibitor of growth hormone\n\n\nMelatonin, a hormone that mediates the sleep-wake cycle and is also an antioxidant.

There is a long history of high-throughout screens yielding results in animal models that do not work when given to humans. This research does not involve HD directly anyway, but is very unlikely to produce a meaningful treatment for HD.  I agree with you.

His mother died from HD around the same age.  I am a 37 year old male and have tried to be na\u00efve to the fact that I might be HD positive (never been tested), however, over the past few months I have been experiencing what might be early signs of HD. \n\nThe biggest issues I am having are brain fog (I feel kind of dumb lately), and trouble focusing my eyes while driving.  No chorea or anything like that.  This all kind of came out of nowhere and its to the point that driving gives me anxiety.  I know HD is slow progressing and my symptoms have come rather quickly.  \n\nMy question to the world...Can anyone who is HD positive tell me if they experienced similar issues in the early stage?  I would ask my father but he is not verbal anymore.  I am trying to not get tested. I am a 30 year old male with HD genetic test and everything. My mom was diagnosed at around 55 and I experience similar things. That DOES NOT mean that these are related it could just be something most people experience and we are similar ages. For me the biggest thing that I feel is related to having HD (I have no proff of this) that I experience is that sometimes I just cannot focus my vision goes blurry and I cannot get it to come back for 5 sec or so.\n\nAgain I think it is important to realize that I know very little about the subject, and corilation does not equal causation. That said you asked so I felt like I should answer. Thanks for the reply, and sorry to hear about the HD positive. I appreciate the insight, especially from someone around a similar age. \n\nThe only thing I find odd about my current symptoms is they came so sudden. I have notice a drastic change in the past few months, while watching my dad, his decline was MUCH slower. \n\nI guess it is just something that will always be on the mind when you have a parent with HD", "North American HD Youth Camp 2016 is coming ", "Questions My grandma, her sister and my 2nd cousin all died from Huntington\u2019s at 45.\n\nMy great aunt, aunt and cousins are negative. My father was never tested because he died from cancer. Him and my aunt ( who tested negative for HD) both developed cancer. \n\nI am curious about my chances. What age should I start showing symptoms. I am 22 now.  Sister is 26. Neither of us have been tested. I have also read about the HD gene cause a break down in cancerous cells resulting in less or a complete disappearance of cancer in HD patients. My father was 35 when he died from cancer and even at his weakest never showed any signs of memory loss, or muscle spasms If you do not know your father\u2019s status, your chance is 25% with a grandparent that was HD+. I do not personally know of any correlation between cancer and HD, so I cannot comment on that part. \n\nIf you would like to go down the path to get tested, you do not need to rush into it and I would highly recommend talking to a counselor. \n\nAs for the age of onset, I have had family members show symptoms in their early thirties and others show symptoms in their sixties. If your dad did not have symptoms in his mid-30\u2019s, that is fantastic and I am really hoping that meant he was gene negative, but it is no guarantee. Best of luck \u2764\ufe0f Just got an update. My grandma and my dads brother both started getting shakes and memory loss at 25 and 27.\n\nIdk if I want to get tested. But I did have kids before my mom filled me in so I feel super guilty From what I have read, the HD gene reduces chances of cancer by 40-60%, depending on the study. So it does not eliminate all chance, especially of the most common cancers. However, if your father made it to 35 with no symptoms AND died of cancer, that seems to lower your chances.\n\nIf you are having these questions, there is no downside to just having a conversation with a genetic counselor. It does not mean you have to get tested. But you can talk to someone who is familiar with the current research and thinking. As someone who is comforted by having the information, it was really helpful for me.\n\nI see that you already have kids and are worried about them. I would encourage you to learn about all the research and clinical trials going on - there is a lot of hope there for you and definitely for your children to have a meaningful treatment if you do develop HD. Do not feel guilty. You had no chance of knowing. My parents knew, did IVF without embryonic selection (while they could have) and the only reason I knew is because I accidentally opened a letter I was not supposed to read. Those are the parents that should feel guilty, not you. Yes! They are my biggest fear. I barely knew about it being in my family. Just whispers about my grandma until I had kids. Then my mom spilled the beans. I know they are will be a cure or at least a treatment for them. There 2 and the other is 3 months. So they have got 30 more years before they have to worry about it. I want to get tested when I turn 30. So if I do have it I can save for my kids to get ivf so they do not pass it on to there kids I am so sorry to hear that. Have you been tested. I pray they do not feel resentful towards me. I am tested. Did it as soon as I found out, at a professor of mine (I am a medical student). I do not have it, fortunately. My twin sister however is not tested yet because my parents have not told her yet. I gave my mom an \"ultimatum\" to tell her or I will, since I find it immoral to keep such important information to keep from a legal adult.\n\nI am praying for you to not carry the gene, I cannot imagine your kids to feel resentful to you, since you could not possible have known. I feel resentful for never being filled in completely. But my dad was to sick to be tested. There train of thought was not Huntington\u2019s it was his cancer so I get that. It just scares me because age of onset of everyone else in my family who has it is between 25-30. Death in there 40s. My great great aunt died at 29 from it", "Just saw my Grandmother with HD for the first time ever since I found about my mother's diagnosis I was a bit anxious to see her. My mom has very mild symptoms as of right now but my grandmother is very far along and I was scared that seeing her would remind me of how my mom is going to end up.\n\nIt ended up being really nice.\n\nShe is 62 and has had symptoms ever since she was 40. She was using her little walker for about half of the day but was able to stand up fine. Her speech is very slurred and she cannot talk clearly at all but she was speaking clearly enough for my 7 year old brother to understand what she was saying so that is good. She seemed happy and was joining in on conversations, making jokes with my grandpa and just seemed to be having a good time. She really likes watching the parade and the dog show and kept pointing out which dogs were her favorites.\n\nHD is awful and I would never wish for anybody to endure it, but I do think my grandmother is living the best life she can with it which gives me and my mom some comfort. Not a day goes by where my mom is not praising my grandfather for how well he takes care of my grandmother. He has a job that supports the two of them but only has to work about 2 or 3 days a week. Whenever he is not working he is spending time with my grandmother and their dog (they call him their youngest baby). He takes her out on the boat a lot and takes her on drives around town. She does not get to leave the house much due to COVID but she still likes to get her hair and nails done. She always makes appointments according to whenever me and my siblings are coming over so she can \"look nice for her grandkids\" which I think is absolutely adorable. I love her so much.\n\nHD has not taken her personality away much either. My mom and grandpa both say that she was a very feisty lady during her younger years and she still is :)\n\nI hope my mom can be as happy as she is whenever it comes time (or if, since I have been trying to remain cautiously optimistic about a cure or treatment coming before its too late for her). I think today really helped me understand that HD is not a death sentence and that you can still be happy.", "Could this be promising? I found this article while looking through HD related news\n\n Definitely exciting but I think given the definition of FDA fast track any HD drug would fit considering there is really nothing on the market to treat it. I am trying to be less optimistic given the Roche situation though so maybe I am just being a downer :) I understand. I did not know of my mother's HD diagnosis whenever the Roche situation happened (my parents wanted to keep it hidden from me as long as possible since I am still a teenager, I only found out because I overheard her talking about it with my aunt) but I do know that Roche recently launched a new $190,000,000 study. Hopefully given what they know with their previous trial and the amount of funds there is hope? Very interesting! Hope this leads to something..... ;) hello, excuse me for prying and do not answer if it is too personal, but how do you  feel about them having waited so long? thanks for posting this, btw! I do not know. I have not been researching HD for very long (only since July) and only know about the new studies and such because of stalking news pages due to my anxiety lol. I think it could be a good thing that they waited if it was for the purpose of gathering information before they performed another study i have only been researching since about then too! sorry for my confusing question, but I actually meant your parents holding off telling you! I am a new mom of a surprise baby, and after she was a year, boyfriend found out from his estranged father that he was diagnosed with HD. So now we are at this weird stressful standstill. Anyway, again, feel free to ignore. Hope the best for these studies, and for everyone here. &lt;3 Oh, np! As for my parents, they did not even tell me, I found out after I overheard my mom talking with my aunt. I was in denial for a solid minute until I hid and started to cry. I was upset that they did not tell me at first but honestly it was a really good thing that they did not. I cannot even handle knowing about it now, I could not imagine knowing at a younger age (I am 14 btw). Whenever I talked to my dad about it he told me that he and my mom were either going to wait until I was an adult to tell me or they would let me figure it out on my own and then once I did learn about HD they would be open to talking about it. I know that HD is a very sore subject for them though so I do not really being it up and tend to vent to communities like these and do my own research. They are both very sure that there will be a cure in 5-10 years and honestly I really hope there is too, but I tend to be very pessimistic with medical issues because I do not like getting my hopes up on serious things so I cannot really say that I share their optimism about a cure. \n\nIf you are wondering about telling your kid, I would say to wait. Take my advice with a lot of salt since I am a child myself, but since I am a child I can give an account from a child's perspective. I am glad that I can support my parents and understand what my mom is going through, but knowing has caused me so much anxiety and tears that part of me wishes I did not know. I figured out that my grandmother had it whenever I was around 11 but my mom always told me that she did not have it. Try to keep it from her until she is an adult, but if she figures it out then do not beat yourself up over it and try to be as transparent and open with her as possible without scaring her. It sounds like you do not know if your boyfriend has it yet and I am hoping for all of you guys' sakes that he does not.\n\nSorry for the essay btw \ud83e\udd2d", "I am 37. I do not know if I have HD. My dad passed away from HD 13 years ago. I am 37 now. Every birthday after 35 has made me nervous, but I have been pretty content not knowing if I have HD.  I just do not want to make different decisions than I would if I had HD and knew it. I live life like there is not a chance that I have it because there is not anything I can do right now if I do.  \n\n\nI have a daughter who is 11. Sometimes I wonder if I should have gotten tested before getting pregnant, but at 25 years old you do not really think too much about the future because its so far away. And I figured by the time my daughter was older there would be treatments. The doctor chastised me in the hospital the day after I had her because he found out my dad had HD when he looked at my records. I made the mistake of telling the OBGYN my dad had HD when they asked for my family's medical history. He could not understand why someone would have a baby when they had a 50/50 chance.  \n\n\nI am also divorced. My partner has been with me for 7 years and we want to get married. Sometimes I worry that I will be a burden if I do have HD. He wants a baby, but I am scared if I do have HD that I am older now and would not have much time with the child and he would have to take care of both of us.  \n\n\nSometimes I get random twitches in my toes that last for a week and go away a couple times a year. Sometimes I get a little down due to anxiety. It is scarier because it makes me wonder if it is the start, but it is most likely nothing. It probably would be scarier if I did have HD and knew I had HD. For me 29M being single, I got tested because I would think about it all day. My emotions were a rollercoaster every single night. My test came back positive and honestly as much as it sucks wang, I do not regret getting the test done. I feel like trying to hide from it just makes it worse. \n\nThat Is just me though Because you have a child and potentially want another I would test. Am not able to have a child and part of me thinks maybe I have HD. We only found out about HD a couple years ago mom was in her 60s and since then found out others in family with it. Since it usually happens later in my family. Several of my grandmother's 1st cousins also got it in their 60s. I am not testing because it would bring me worry. My Mum has HD and her condition is, as it does, slowly worsening with time. In a way, she was in a similar position to you. She knew her Dad had it when she had me (though I was not planned necessarily), but she was never tested before she started to show symptoms -- which was around 50 - she never really wanted to know, and I was not in a rush to find out either. If I had been tested before her, and was found to have it, it would have confirmed that she had it. \n\nI have been tested since and have found that I do not have it, but unlike you ( living life under the assumption you do not have it), I had convinced myself that I did have it, like you mention, I had little twitches and stuff that I attributed to possible early signs of the disease, however, I never thought of it (and still do not think of it) as a death sentence. \n\nI grew up with my Granda (Mum's Dad), in the same house,  and watched him decline and eventually die, but even toward the end, when he was at his worst in terms of the disease, he always had a smile and his own way of showing his humour and despite the care he grew to need, it never felt like a horrible thing, it was just part of life. \n\nI am not sure when it comes into your family, but as I say, it tends to hit around 50 for us. I never once resented my Mum for having me with the possibility that I might have it and as I said to the counsellor during the testing process, if I did have it, I would still have a number of healthy years ahead of me, no point of life is guaranteed. You could get hit by a bus and die tomorrow - an extreme example, perhaps, but true nonetheless. &lt;3 Thank you for sharing. My mom said she knew my dad had it when he was in his 30s. I guess his personality changed before anything else. He did not struggle with it until his late 40s. I have no desire to get tested either. When I was younger I thought maybe I would want to do it, but as I get older I do not want to know. I think it would be too difficult knowing and right now it is not something I think about on a daily basis. If I do decide to have another child, I would test. I am 38 and have HD. I found out over a decade ago and have gone different stages of grief. Thankfully, I do not have a child and chose not to because of it. While knowing has been an incredibly hard journey it is pushed me to live more and be more ambitious. I am working on retiring in the next 5 years. Turns out you do not have to save as much if you have a shorter timeline.  \n\nKnowing that I have it means I am hyper observant of when things like twitches or memory issues arise. Just remember to be kind to yourself. Not being hydrated can lead to muscle twitching. So far it has not progressed to anything worse. An early symptom you can be mindful of is slower tracking eye movement. \n\nWhile we are getting better at being more sensitive as a society and someone is circumstances, I feel that rare diseases have a way to go. I am sorry to hear that you got chastised the day after having your daughter. It must have taken a lot of courage to speak up and I wish they would been sensitive enough to let you enjoy that moment as a new parent. We spend our whole lives worrying about it. We should be allowed to celebrate what is important without being overshadowed. I am a few years older than your daughter. My mom is HD+ and my will to live is gone some days, but I will be alright. She is 41 and has mild chorea and is a bit irritable but other than that she does not have any symptoms. I am not too anxious about myself because as pessimistic as I am, I do believe that some sort of treatment will be out before its too late for me and my younger siblings. Medicine has made some very huge leaps in the past decade and it is only going further. I have around 25/30 years before the symptoms hit according to my family's history of it, so there is not much of a reason to worry for me. If you are worried about your daughter, I would not worry too much, but I also would not make the decision to have another child without testing based off of this alone.\n\nI am very close to my mother though, and I worry a lot for her. I am predicting that she will be as bad or worse than my grandmother in her early-mid fifties which does not seem that far away whenever I think about it. She and my dad are constantly telling me that a cure or treatment will be out in the next 5 years but I have a hard time believing it. My mom can be very anxious or sad about it some days so I think they may just be telling me that to relieve my worries lol. I stalk HD updates like no tomorrow and there was just a trial that made it to phase 3, along with multiple other treatments  in progression so I would not lose hope yet. I post update son this subreddit about any news I find on treatments or cures if you are ever curious.\n\nStay strong, this disease is awful to deal with.", "How were you told about your health condition?

Donations go to the OK chapter of the HDSA for research, education, social workers, etc... It is a good opportunity to learn more about the organization and Huntington's Disease in general.\n\n", "My wifes cannabis and LSD treatment for HD So far so good. The CBD is working wonders and she dropped anti depressants and replaced them with microdosing LSD. Her outlook on life is wayyyyyyy better and her mood is great. She is walking almost nightly now. I have introduced a new cannabis compound called CBN and it is helping her get to sleep better. awesome! were her symptoms mostly in temperament/communication or did she also have chorea? All of the above. The CBD is helping with Chorea  and mood. Less aggressive on CBD. LSD is helping with mood, productiveness and well being and the CBN oil is helping her get to sleep. Wow. Wonderful. Thank you for putting this out there. Are you using actual lsd, or the semi-legal 1p-lsd? (Last I checked.) She is using actual LSD. A small tab and cut mini pieces. That sounds really interesting. How much cbd does she take? She needs to be on it 24/7. \n\nShe takes tinctures and a dose lasts 4-5 hours and each dose is about 40-60 mg roughly. What stage? My dad is in late stages, he can walk but it is quite hard, a friend suggested CBG(?) has been show to help symptoms in ( His mood overall is quite good. I think she is still in early phase. Diagnosed 2014 Yes, I am sourcing out some CBG seeds to grow How much CBD does she take? And how do you figure out what dose to use? I am not symptomatic yet, but I have been looking into CBD stuff lately as something I might take when I do get there. She takes roughly 20-30 mg every 5 hours with tinctures. \n\nWhether it is tincture, pills or smoke, it does not really matter what it is just get it in you.", "PGD/IVF and HD This is my first time looking into any online support for HD, so bare with me and be gentle! \n\nMy partner's mother has HD. Her symptoms started in her 40s and she has been in a long term care facility for around 10 years. \n\nMy partner does not want to know his status and I 100% support that. We are both \"glass is half empty\" kind of people and have discussed that knowing his status will not make his life any better since he currently lives life to the fullest as if he is negative. This decision does not sit well in particular with my support system ( which is what brought me here!) but they are very respectful as I have explained to them it is very easy to say that someone SHOULD do something, such as get tested,  especially when that person is not you or your loved one.\n\nWe were looking to start a family next year but I am feeling a little lost after a recent consult with our Reproductive Endocrinologist. We were looking into IVF and preimplantation genetic testing which would result in only HD-free embryos to be implanted. Apparently this is not able to be done without knowing his status. Yes, they could technically not share our genetic results with us, but if by chance all of the embryos were positive for HD, they would have to tell us that there are no embryos to implant, giving away his status (we should have no issue conceiving because we are both healthy)\n\n   \nMy insurance would possibly cover some this treatment with only his mother's confirmed diagnosis but like I said, apparently it becomes obvious if the embryos test positive. \n\nTo be honest, I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place with no answers that will make both me and my partner happy. My partner absolutely does not want to know his status. To be frank, I feel like my options are to:\n\n1. Get pregnant naturally, test the fetus without my partner's knowledge, and decide whether or not to continue the pregnancy. This nonoption is dishonest and lonely. \n2. Get pregnant naturally, do not test the fetus, and spend my life obsessing over my child's potential status. This option seems like a recipe of me harboring resentment towards my partner. \n3. Get a sperm donor. This option will allow me to carry my own child which is something I look forward to but then I wonder how that will affect my partner in the long run. Will he ever look at them one day and not feel as much of a connection as I do? \n4. Adopt. This costs a lot of money in my area and I will not get to carry my own child. Not the end of the world but still something I would be missing out on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am basically looking for ANY advice. Are there ways to successfully complete PGD/IVF without obviously confirming status? Am I putting way to much thought into this? I would also love to hear from any HD+ folks who decided to have children naturally and what helped them come to this decision. \n\nI absolutely love my partner to death and I am with him through thick and thin, but with that being said,I want to protect my future children from anything I can, if it is in my means to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for any input, \n\nLJ I dont know much about this, but you should look for the foundation the baseball player started for this for HD individuals. \n\nAlso, as far as worrying about giving away the diagnosis, I think there are other reasons why there would not be available embryos, so it would not be confirmed (i.e. low sperm count, lab error, etc) I just saw another person post about that foundation, I am going to do some research thank you! \n\nAnd in my head I thought it would be easy to remain blissfully ignorant through the IVF process but my doctor mentioned that other reasons would not necessarily be an issue since we are both generally healthy and in our mid/late twenties. I would prefer if they would just tell me it was a lab error! I do not think the dr would like that idea lol. This is a really hard one for me to answer but I will because I think it might help.  I am raising two step-daughters whose mother died of Huntington\u2019s when she was 37 (so we have always known they could inherit early onset).  Both daughter\u2019s have ended up resenting their mother for \u201cletting God decide\u201d.  They both suffer from depression/anxiety from watching her die and knowing that they might have it.  Knowing she had options to prevent passing it on compounds this. \n\nShe technically did not know she had it when she became pregnant with the oldest but her mother was already in a nursing home, so she knew there was a chance.  She 100% knew with the second.  My husband and I have had conversations about why he agreed to have another child with her... young, stupid, trying to save a fragile marriage... blah blah blah.  It is something he regrets... not the wonderful girls it created but the horrible situation it put them in.\n\nI cannot get my oldest to stop referring to her mom as her broken egg donor.  Honestly the anxiety for you is nothing compared to the affect on the child once they understand you had options and it sounds like you can afford them.\n\nI cannot speak to how you might handle the IVF options and as for the secret abortion, some states require spousal consent (or have at least tried to).\n\nHonestly if your spouse insists on not knowing then a sperm donor is probably the easiest and best way to guarantee no Huntington\u2019s in children and no way of your spouse knowing his status.  As a step-parent... loving a child that is not genetically related is easy! Thank you so much for this insight! \nMy partner has a sister who has so much resentment towards her mother that she isolates herself from the rest of the family. Her mother knew her diagnosis and suffered with mental health issues so she was never really there for the kids even before the onset of her symptoms. \nMy biggest fear is exactly what you have said, the effect it will have on them once they know I had options. We are going to discuss the donor option once the blues from this appointment pass. \nI am sending positive vibes to you and your girls and hope they find peace I read this article recently about how it is done to protect both the at risk parent and the potential children.  Please listen to this, OP. Of your options, eliminate #2. I know it is something a lot of people still do, especially those in their twenties who do not feel their own mortality yet or have not yet seen the very real, very cruel end stages of HD, but knowingly passing on a 50% chance of this disease to an innocent child is wrong. Aside from that, consider that men who pass on the gene have a higher risk of passing on the juvenile form, which is heartbreaking. Consider that your husband could begin to show symptoms in his thirties, leaving you to raise a child at best  without the type of support you are hoping for, and at worst with a partner who is difficult or requires caregiving of some sort himself. I had an aunt whose children ended up becoming her caretakers in their early teens, and three of the five of them have tested positive. They are all bitter and depressed, one is psychotic, and one has attempted suicide.\n\nI respect that he does not want to know. I was not ready until my 30s and did not work out the logistics for a few more years. But that means even though he is living like he is negative, you have to plan and secure your future as if he is positive. Jobs with excellent health coverage, life insurance, a healthy savings, preparing for potential loss of income at some point. Do not mention it to any of his health care providers without very good reason, since even having mention of it on his medical record can cause problems. I have a cousin who is currently having an organ transplant held up because his wife mentioned our grandfather's HD  to his doctor. There are so many things to consider.  \n\nGood luck! I know testing is a tough decision, and I hope you can find a doctor who will do the IVF without it. I think it is worth checking around. Policies surrounding HD can vary wildly. I (female) have a possibility of having HD from my dad\u2019s side. I have done IVF/PGD to screen embryos. The clinic where I go does not test the embryos for HD. What they do is collect saliva sample from myself, my husband, and my mother and father. They then determine which of my Huntingtin genes I inherited from my mother and which is the one from my father. They do not look close enough at the gene to see if I have HD (ie they do not count the repeats). \n\nThen for each embryo they see the Huntingtin gene from my husband along with a Huntingtin gene from me. If the gene is the one I got from my father it is affected.\n\nDoes that make sense? PM any other questions. \n\nI have two lovely girls via IVF/PGD.

He has Huntington's, and just recently stopped taking haloperidol (for his chorea, but it was keeping him pretty much catatonic). His nighttime chorea is back, and he is windmilling around the bed. I have magnesium lotion coming tomorrow, but wonder what to do tonight. Has anyone had any luck with a calming med that will allow him to fall asleep?? What about a long term medicine that will work to kee him calm? The go to drug for chorea is Austedo. It is rather expensive if is on Medicare, but the Healthwell Foundation was giving grants. Some states let Medicare patients get  Medicaid too, that will help. For tonight I would give hike some CDB edibles. If he cannot eat, get it in tincture and thicken it for consumption. Make sure it is the real stuff, there are many fakes out there right now. Get it from a dispensary if you can, they are highly regulated. If you cannot get any of this, I have relied on melatonin. That is easy enough to get at a 24 hour drug store. My mother used Austedo and it worked very well for her. It can be expensive but you can get grants for it to help pay the costs. Thank you! He finally fell asleep at about 2 am. I did not even think about CDB! Have you ever tried homeopathy? I will run that by his doctor! Thank you both so much. One of my fam members works for big pharma. You can always call the customer service line and say you need the drug but cannot afford it. They can sell it at a large discount directly or even give it to you for free. Try giving them a call and see if they will send you. No, I literally do not have the time in my life to waste on something that may not work. Austedo is tried and true. My mother was on the precursor to it, Xenazine, so I trusted it. Austedo it is been a life saver along with Zoloft", "Should I tell my family I am getting tested? I have my appointment this Monday about getting tested. The only person who knows I am getting tested is my husband. I am debating on telling my family about my decision to test. I feel like they should know, but at the same time I feel like I should tell them once I have my result. I am just nervous to tell them. What did you do, and how did you tell them? Its completely your decision, you are the best person to know what to do, I told most of my family although I really do not think that they understood fully, I never told my dad he was in a care home at the time and I knew it would have broken his heart seconding! maybe wait until you have your results and have fully processed what the result means for you, whichever way it goes. that way you can process without pressure I did not tell anyone until after I had my results. It was positive, and I think if I had told people I was testing and they followed up before I knew or was ready to reveal the result, well, it would have been hard. Although telling a positive was hard anyway. It depends on how close you are to people. You might have to tell the family member who possibly gave it to you, due to \u201cethics.\u201d I got tested when I was 25 and have 42 repeats. I have only told certain people how many I have and I have told my mum who is 52 and has mild symptoms that I have 20 repeats. Sometimes little white lies are for the better You got to judge this based on your family, and who will be supportive of you/your choices. I told my husband &amp; my mom (who I knew would be supportive) and hinted to one aunt (who I also knew would be supportive). I did not tell any of my other family members until post-results, when I knew no one would try to convince me of anything one way or the other (even given that my extended family is generally supportive &amp; open about HD in our family).", "Trying to spread awareness My wife's grandmother was the furthest back we could have the HD gene in her family. She actually ended up dying of breast cancer. Her father tested positive for HD and died in his early 50s. My wife showed symptoms heavily when she was in her mid 20s and tested positive a couple years ago. She is now 32. She has 53 alleles. We do not know if she will make it past 40. \n\nI am the general manager at a small resort and when people come in, a lot assume she is drunk or tweaking. We are trying to change that (short of putting a sign around her neck saying I am not high, I have Huntington's). She has decided to create a Facebook page to feature videos about daily life with HD. She is wanting to raise awareness and try to encourage those who have it. It is a really small page because she just started, but I hope it grows and helps.\n\nIf you would like to share her page, that would be great.\n( Sorry to hear that but that is such a great thing to do. I tested negative but one (maybe two) of my siblings have HD and my dad passed away from it. I cannot tell you how often I encounter(ed) looks and assumptions from people when with them. It is aggravating. Definitely has turned me into a huge ass to people when this occurs (or someone without a handicap placard parks in a handicapped spot). Will definitively share this around. Awareness is key to help improve quality of social outings/interactions. Thank you My wife tested positive in 2011 at 36, coming down from her maternal grandfather to her mother  In the 9 years since then we have started taking mini-vacations to go to concerts, about 6-7 hours of riding in a car is about her limit and she has to *really* want to go if it involves flying.  The few flights we have taken I have been grateful that the airport/airline staff was understanding and willing to help with a wheelchair.  Anyway, other than the few venues we go to regularly (or did go to regularly before this accursed year!), at least once per trip we hear something along the lines of \"geez, how much has she had to drink?\", and usually she is the one who has to talk me down before I go into righteous indignation mode.  She is mentioned several times that if she did not need the concerts and socializing so bad, it is almost to the point where she wants to stop going, because she does not want to embarrass herself or me.  Even though I keep telling her I am not embarrassed at all to be out with her, if anything I am embarrassed of the judgemental people who whisper and stare. Most times once she tells me to chill, I can casually mention to whoever made the comments that she has Huntington's, following up with its like Parkinson's and alzheimer's mixed together (not entirely accurate I know, but it gets the point across to the general public), and their attitudes usually do a 180. I think it helps that we both wear Huntington's awareness bracelets everywhere we go too. She has talked about making a t-shirt that says \"I have Huntington's Disease. What is your excuse?\"\n\nI think the page is an excellent idea! I do not use Facebook much, but I will certainly make an exception in this case to share her page.  The more people who know what it is the better!  Has she thought about using twitter for this too?  I do not know about her day to day condition, but managing two social medias might be too much. It would be for me anyway!\n\nKeep up the fight, even though it is a hard one. Thanks for the support. What is happening to your wife is very similar to what we deal with as well. Added Christine on Facebook. I sooo so support her endeavor. My mom suffered my entire childhood, when I was 5 and then she died when I was 25. 20 years of hospital visits. I decided to get tested at 29. I have an appointment for getting tested in 2 weeks. I really want the results ASAP but I have to attend some pre testing consultations. So much love to all of you sufferers and carers. \u2764\ufe0f This has been in my family for decades. My whole life had just been HD destruction. I know it is cliche, but hang in there! Remember whichever way the test goes, Huntington's does not have to own or define your life.  Like in my case, when my wife was diagnosed, we realized we had a reason to do all the things we were putting off until life calmed down.  We cannot afford a lot of them (river cruise in Russia for instance lol), but the ones we can afford we do, mainly concerts and little weekend trips here and there.  If we have to go out of town for a medical appointment we plan something else to do so it is not all about that, even something as simple as going to a movie or out to eat.  It is hard to believe sometimes, but in regards to quality time together her Huntington's has actually had a benefit. I just want you to tell her from someone with a family member with HD that she is not an embarrassment she is an amazing individual who just so happens to have a disability, the embarrassments are those who question her sobriety. People often asked my dad if he was drunk, a police officer approached us once, probably trying to see if I was okay, but my dad was the calmest person and would explain he cannot help his movements. I never once felt embarrassed by my dad because of HD, and I am sure you do not feel embarrassed to be around your wife! Good luck, I know the consults can be annoying! I hope you find out soon and that it is good news! The sideways looks and snide comments from strangers suck to be sure, but what I really think is worse is the friendships and relationships that have been lost simply because people do not know how to process it for themselves.  What they do not realize is, when people stay away because they do not know what they are supposed to say, do, or how to act around her, it is abandonment.  They might think about her, wonder how she is doing occasionally, but at the end of the day if they do not call or message to check then they do not really care.  I can only use the \"they have things going on in their lives we do not know about\" excuse for so long before it sounds fake even to me. I tell her that almost every day!  We almost got refused service at a casino we went to for a concert a while back, the security guard stopped us because her gait was especially bad that day, and asked how much she would been drinking.  I managed to stay calm enough to explain the situation to him, and asked about the venue, how far away from the doors etc. while we waited for his manager.  Found her a stool while we waited and the guard stepped away. When the manager got there, he actually had brought a wheelchair for her, and pushed her all the way to our seats!  Before he left he said after the concert, find someone from security and they would bring the chair and take her back out again. Part of me felt like it was a \"please do not complain about discrimination\" statement, but I chose to take it at face value as a gesture of human kindness.", "I fell in love... Hello redditors!\n\nI am desperately looking for some advice.  I met a guy and fell in love after spending time with him almost every night for two months.  He told me about a month and a half in that he has Huntington's Disease (pre-symptomatic) and has completely disconnected since he told me (he already knew for 5 months before we met).  He is seeing a therapist and he keeps telling me that he has really strong feelings for me but he needs to \"get his head on straight.\"  He is clearly struggling with the idea of being a burden on someone later in life and told me that he is not sure if he ever wants to get married.  I have tried so hard to tell him that I still want to pursue a relationship despite this.  I am hoping someone in his shoes can help me out and just let me know what you think or tell me about a similar situation you have been in.\n\nThanks!", "The Nrf2 Protein ", "Not sure where else to get advice on this... I apologize in advance that this is long.\n\nMy husband (45) has Huntingtons in his family. His mother died from it, and his brother did too, just a couple years ago. When we were first dating, I asked hubby if he would been tested for the gene, and he said that he would rather not know, and that if he did find out he had it he would probably kill himself (please bear with me). I never agreed with that sentiment from him, but I know that it is not something I will ever have to face, so I did not judge.\n\nWe have been together for fourteen years, and married for a few years now. We have been trying to have a baby. I have had two miscarriages (which were very hard), but we are still trying.\n\nHowever. In recent months, I have started to notice what I think are Huntingtons symptoms in my husband. I am not a doctor and by no means an expert on this, but I have noticed things. His personality has changed a little. He is become more clumsy. He now struggles to play the guitar (previously he was very good at this). He often has difficulty swallowing and chokes on his food. He gets little muscle tics in his face and hands. And the biggest change has come in his sleep. His sleep has become very disturbed, and he now makes a lot of noise in his sleep (like he is having the worst nightmare ever, every night). In his sleep, he sounds like his brother did when he was awake.\n\nI am obviously worried about this, but (thanks to his earlier statements about suicide) I am also worried about raising the issue with him. He still works full time, and I do not know if anyone else has noticed anything.\n\nComplicating all of this is that I know he wants to have a child, and I do too. I do not feel like I can talk to family or friends about this because (if my husband really does have Huntingtons, and I get pregnant anyway) I think I will face a lot of judgment. I worry about having a child who might barely get to ever know their father. I worry about having to raise a child alone (but I know I would cope with that if I had to). And I will admit that I desperately want to keep a part of my husband alive, even if this is in the form of someone else. My husband is a very good man, and I want his goodness to be able to carry on in the world.\n\nI am coming to this group because I am hoping you guys have experience with these complicated life questions, and you might be able to offer some advice on what I should do. I think the best option would be to get profesional help, therapy and find a neurologist. Easier said than done.. I wish you all the best. Hey there. My wife has HD and is in the beginning stages herself. I am sorry to say this but every symptom you mentioned is exactly what early HD can look like. I am so sorry about your situation\u2026 I would not worry about what people will think if you want to have a baby regardless of the HD gene. You can get prenatal testing done very early to find out if the baby is carrying the HD gene. As far as getting your husband tested\u2026 The baby will be that test. When you get pregnant again (god willing) and get the baby tested for HD if the baby carries the gene then your husband is likely positive. I know that if I was blessed with the arrival of a new baby regardless of the outlook of my health I would table that and focus on my baby. I think your husband will too. I wish you all the best. There are a lot of new treatments hitting the market every month that could be game changing procedures for people with HD. Hold out hope! And most importantly. PMA all day every day. Positive mental attitude goes a long way with this disease. The mind is a powerful thing\u2026 All the best! (If you have any other questions about anything regarding HD I will answer to the best of my knowledge. Just send me a private message.) The swallowing n choking part sounded just like wen my mom showed symptoms she has Since passed now.  I have not got tested myself becuz I would do wat ur husband said... but now I am 8 months pregnant I rly should reconsider Tell him to get tested because passing that shit on to a kid is not fucking cool. My husband is gene positive and asymptomatic so far. One thing to think about is, if you choose to get prenatal testing and the baby tests positive, you are also making the choice to terminate that pregnancy because you are taking the choice away from your child to know whether they are gene positive or not. Also, testing occurs around weeks 12-14 but at least in Canada, the results were going to take 3-6 weeks to get back, which meant if termination was happening, it would be close to 20 weeks. These factors made us reconsider prenatal testing. My ex has it, I am his care taker. Sounds like his early symptoms too. We have two daughters and we did not know he had it when we had them. If your husband has HD then you will already have your work cut out for you. It is emotionally and physically exhausting. I worry and pray everyday for my daughters 27,23. Please RE consider the baby thing. It is a nightmare of a disease. No cure! Deterioration from here on. I am so sorry. Please also make sure life insurance and health insurance is set up before you get a diagnosis. Sounds like he has it.  It is impossibly selfish to want to produce children.  Any child will have a 50 percent chance of developing the disease as well.  Literally 50 percent.  That is so unbelievably high.  Why would you put anyone else in that position.  Why would you put yourself in the position of having to watch your adult child decline and die? Please please please get prenatal testing done. This disease is an *awful*  thing to pass along to a kid. \n\nIf your husband has it, do you want to watch both your husband *and your child* deteriorate and die decades too soon? Do you want to see the look in your child's eyes when they find out they have got it? While they are dying inside as they watch their father waste away and die? Do you want to force them to be front and center for an agonizing preview of their own death? \n\nDo you want your child to have to give up on their dreams, because they know the only way they will not end their lives in a bottom-tier nursing home rife with patient neglect is if they can get a boring job they hate because it has a pension/retirement plan? \n\nDo you want your child to have to tell the person they fall in love with that their lives might end decades too early as an unrecognizable person? Do you want to have to hold your sobbing child as the person they love walks out of their life forever because they cannot handle a future filled with that much pain, stress, expense and early death? \n\nIt is *horrible.* \n\nMy boyfriend just watched his father die and he is not okay on so many levels that I cannot put it into words. He has up to 12 nightmares a night about his father and is terrified of going to sleep. He is never been this depressed and can barely make himself function, because all he can think is that every moment he is less competent than the moment before, and he is run out of time to do anything with his life, and he is been a pointless existence. And *he does not even know if he has it*. He is more terrified to find out than he is of anything in this world.

So incredibly happy for you!! Thank you so much That is what I was thinking too I did the same thing. I convinced myself I was positive for years. I was definitely symptom hunting.  I finally got tested back in December (thankfully I am negative). It is hard to wrap your head around, and my psychologist said that its normal to to through an Identity Crisis.

My husband is currently going through HD genetic testing, and we are trying to set up insurance coverage before he gets the results in case of (God forbid) a positive diagnosis. We  already signed up for term life insurance (a no brainer, with two mortgages). However, we are also looking at long term care insurance and long term disability insurance. I know the difference between the two, but I am wondering if anyone here has HD-specific experiences with either of these kinds of insurance. The genetic counselor suggested long term care insurance, but a) it is really expensive and b) we will not need it for at least a decade, even conservatively, and c) I think a healthy person in their early 30s signing up for this might throw up a red flag, since it looks like that type of insurance is really marketed to people in their 50s. Any advice is very welcome!  In my experience, the insurance companies have caught on to so many at risk Huntingtons folks picking up insurance before their diagnosis.  They now ask on the application if there is a family history of Huntingtons.  It is worth it if you can get it, but I gave up trying.  Best of luck to you Through many support group meetings, long term disability insurance is the one I have gotten most recommended.  I looked into LTCI when I was being tested. First of all, based on my research, as of February 2018 (when I got tested) there was only one company that would even consider it with a family history of HD. Second, if he has not had the test yet and you think you might want it, STOP!  The person I talked to said I could get LTCI as long as I did not have a definitive diagnosis, so it was fine if I got it while awaiting results, and I decided to go with it...then when I was in the final underwriting stage, it came out that I had had my blood drawn and was waiting for results, and it came screeching to a halt. They said they had to wait until I got my results and would only issue a policy if I was gene negative (um, I am 36, I am not going to pay hundreds of dollars a month for this if I am gene negative). Anyway, it was super upsetting and frustrating in an already upsetting and frustrating time. TLDR: Do not get any blood drawn till you have got an underwritten policy in hand or you have decided you do not want it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLemme know if you want to chat re my experience! Thanks! Yeah, we are doing exactly that - waiting for the blood draw. We want to set up the policies first. Did all the LTC companies actually ask about a family history of HD? Or just if either parent had been diagnosed?  Thanks for the info!  I think they asked for a family history of genetic diseases... but I actually only called one other place before the social worker from our support group hooked me up with HDSA's \"guy\" who knew companies (there was only one) that would still issue policies for individuals with a family history.

I have no idea what it would cost now, tho. I wish I could help more. Thank you, i will dig a little deeper and try to find more info. Check the resources on ( and see if there is a local chapter you can tap in to Just a small word of advice, I would get tested only after you have obtained health insurance. When trying to open a new policy after testing you legally have to report this under preexisting diseases, which can bring up quite a few issues. By not getting tested they cannot hold the possibility of you having HD against you.  Yeah inwas wondering about that. Thank you for clarifying. And has anyo me every posted anything about Medical marijuana. Was curious if that would help with any symptoms  I have seen videos of it instantly helping with Parkinsons (very similar body movements). You can look it up on YouTube, it literally worked instantly. My dad who has HD refuses to use marijuana to help him, despite being a stoner from his teen years through his 20s. So I have no firsthand experience seeing it work.  Cost of test is going to depend on where you go.  I agree with the other poster about trying to find a local support group, likely through HDSA, to help answer these questions on a local level.  \n\nMedical marijuana has not fully been studied in HD (or many diseases) so you are going to get answers across the board from \"amazing\" to \"it did nothing\".  Like every medicine, it is going to affect everyone differently, so the only way to learn is to give it a try.  If you find a testing opportunity at a HD Center, it is a great question to ask their care team for advice on. Insurance cannot classify as a preexisting condition unless she is fully symptomatic and it is documented. I paid for my testing out of pocket, so I was able to keep everything confidential. This was about 5 years ago and close to $1000, I think. Instead of focusing on medical marijuana, I highly recommend trying CBD which has no THC and does not produce a high.

But the I added my great grandfather Albert Byers III and his siblings profile to the project. The website can give your relationship to people. I am a cynic. And I have a deep seated hatred for discrimination of any kind. So with that in mind, please just be careful. I have not read the terms of service on this site. And it maybe completely innocent. But it is hard to predict where and how detailed info like this could be used in the future.  \nI could imagine insurance companies would very much love access to a well developed database like this. They have very deep pockets and would easily be able to support a free website until it grows large enough to give some quality data analytics. And maybe not on you but on maybe your grand parent\u2019s distant brother who maybe did not disclose that their parent was a HD carrier on a policy that has now come due.  \nI do not know.

We are obviously going to talk everything through with a genetic counselor beforehand, but I am interested in seeing what others have done &amp; their experiences.\n\nWhen deciding between IVF + PGT vs traditional conception + CVS (with termination if positive result)\u2026\n(1) what went into your decision making process?\n(2) what method did you choose?\n(3) do you/your partner have any regrets about the method you chose? We did IVF + PGD bc I was 38 by the time we started (so the time required for possibly multiple pregnancies was not something we felt we had), and also a little bc I did not want to emotionally deal with terminating an otherwise wanted pregnancy. But if I had been younger, I might have gone the CVS + term route. I have family that did the latter and I do not find it morally a problem. And it is definitely a LOT less costly especially if you have insurance that excludes all coverage for IVF related treatment regardless of reason (as mine does). \n\nJust be sure that you and your partner are in agreement and mutually all-in before you start. Either route is a big commitment! I am HD+ and did IVF in 2019. There is def. Stuff in my post history about it and I can answer questions. Busy though, got twins. :) Best decision ever, btw. Happy to have them and delighted to know they are protected from at least one night mare.\n\nI knew for a long time I wanted children, but would not pass on the HD gene. Of I got pregnant oops before I could afford IVF I was going to genetic test and abort no matter how much I wanted the baby (and I had bad baby fever) because I was protecting my future kids. If I could not afford IVF I would adopt when that became clear or not have kids. Not me, but a close HD+ friend (thus why I follow this sub) decided to have a child with her husband. Because of the costs of IVF, they conceived naturally, did the genetic test, and terminated their first pregnancy because of HD+. Second pregnancy came quickly, thankfully, and their little boy tested negative, again thank god. I do not believe they have any regrets, but I know they committed to stop trying if they had two HD+ pregnancies' in a row. My wife are going through it right now, we want to have twins, but are nervous it might be unhealthy for either her or either of the fetuses. How was your experience? There is a slightly higher risk of something going wrong with twins, right? There is. And pregnancy was awful. But part of the balance in favor of twins was, we both wanted a larger family but did not see being able to afford IVF a second time. My twins were a month premie, which is common. If she has health problems now, like diabetes or high Blood pressure you might want to pass on the twins. I got lucky and they only spent a couple hours in the NICU. The rest roomed I am with me until I went home. They were tiny but mighty. And are absolutely amazing 15 month olds. My partner is HD+, and I had an accidental pregnancy last year. We had always agreed to terminate an HD+ baby should we get pregnant at any point, so I had CVS testing done (thankfully tested negative and I now have a healthy 8 month old baby). I absolutely recommend against intentionally going that route. I am as pro-choice and rational about HD as they come, but trying to stay calm and collected until we got results was truly truly awful. I am still dealing with the fallout from the emotional toll it took and now that I have my baby with me I keep thinking back to the \u201cwhat if\u201d knowing I still would have terminated and I still spiral. You can technically test at 10 weeks but no one will test until 12 because of the MC risk, and results take another four weeks because they have to culture enough cells to test so I was facing an abortion at 16 weeks along. I was feeling movement. I cannot stress just how awful the entire process felt. Should we decide to have another child I will go with IVF + PGD. There is IVF funding for HD couples through a private foundation, I will look for it and edit with a link when I find it\n\nETA: ( I am in a similar position to you, although we still do not know if my husband has HD or not - we are currently waiting to start the genetic testing process. \n\nIt is so difficult to decide what to do for the best. I got pregnant and had a miscarriage at 10 weeks earlier this year, before we knew about the HD in my husband's family. I am not sure if I could face having to deliberately terminate my next baby if it turned out they had HD. But at the same time, IVF+PGT is a massive undertaking, physically, emotionally and financially. Until we know my husband's status we are having to put baby-making on hold, which sucks when all I want is to be pregnant again!\n\nHopefully talking to a genetic counsellor will help you decide what is right for you. Wishing you all the best of luck on your journey, whichever route you decide to take. Same boat, probably not going to do IVF again because it is expensive and we need to get her on an HD trial. She is healthy in other respects but it still makes me nervous. Glad everything work out for you! My partner has HD and we will do IVF.

Hey everyone! About 2 weeks ago my wife found out that her mother has tested positive for HD. The tests confirmed that she received it from her father but her dad never showed any symptoms or they just did not know any better to think anything of it. With this new knowledge my wife is now stuck with the decision of what to do. We both kind of feel like we are in limbo until we come to some sort of decision. We were trying to have kids up until we found out about her mom but have put that on hold. If my wife is HD positive then we do not think we want to have our own biological children and adopt instead.(We were always going to adopt at least one anyway.)\n\nMy wife and I have talked a lot about this and I am trying to understand how she feels and where she is at as much as I can. I understand what kind of burden this could be. You can chose not to be tested and just live your life but then always have that suspicion that this or that might be a symptom. Or you can decided to get tested and maybe you turn out positive for HD and she will be able to see first hand thee effects and symptoms through her mom and think \"That will be me soon.\"\n\nBasically I have come here because I want to help her as much as possible, I can only offer support and encouragement but I would love for her to be able to hear from people in her situation. Did you get tested? Why or why not? How did you come to that conclusion? Any advice you could offer my wife as we try to navigate through this new territory?\n\nThank you for your help and for listening! My wife is in the same situation as yours.\n\n&gt; You can chose not to be tested and just live your life but then always have that suspicion that this or that might be a symptom.\n\nSadly, the only way not to have those suspicions is to get tested with a negative result. If you get tested and find out it is positive (as we did), then it is still a mentally-anguishing guessing game every time of, \"are my symptoms already starting now or is this just normal.\" \n\nMy wife got tested because she wanted to know so she (we) could prepare better for our future. We wanted to have biological kids without the risk of passing the disease on, so getting tested was the only way to try to achieve that. If we were not planning on having kids, maybe it would have been a different decision, although she is the type of person that would prefer to know rather than always second guess.  The mantra that there is nothing you can do, I feel is wrong. Besides healthy eating and exercise there is learning new physical mental things. I have told the next generation of 20 year olds to take up a new sport every year. Build those neural pathways through the Occipital lope. \n\nYou already mentioned children, we are fortunate to live in an age in which we can selectively implant only non-HD embryos. If everyone did that we could remove HD from the gene pool (except for spontaneous mutations). \n\nThe diagnosis on my wife has changed how I respond to her memory lapses and irritability, I no longer try to \"fix\" the problem, instead I roll with it and try to change the environment. \n\nMeditation has been effective. The decision to be tested is just so personal, I find it hard to reply to comments like this. \n\nFor me, once I knew I was at risk, it was a no-brainer; I had to know my status. I was already 40 years old and already had two kids when I was tested. I had to know for them. \n\nI have often thought about what I would have done if I knew I was at risk when I was in my twenties, and I do not think it would have been so clear cut. I am kind of glad in a way that I was able to live in ignorance for so long because I think I would have lived differently with the knowledge I was positive than not having it in my life at all. Who knows though. \n\nYou have only known about your wife's diagnosis for a couple of weeks. My thoughts are with you and your family. It is true, you can have in vitro fertilization with eggs that are tested negative. This way you are guaranteed your own gene negative offspring. \n\nJoin a support group. HDSA or HSC or HDA. Wherever you are located, there is likely something near by even though the disease is quite rare.\n\nAnd most importantly, learn about the research and clinical studies going on and in the pipeline. A treatment to delay the onset of HD symptoms is not far away. \n\nTake care. \n\n-Steve.  My dad was diagnosed 6 years ago. I finally made the decision to begin the testing process this past year. I already have a son and another on the way. I used to think that I would not have children if I was positive, but it is too late to think about that now. I just hope if I am, I do not pass it. \nI just completed my physical exam a few weeks ago and while the doctor did not feel like I am showing any symptoms yet, just rigidity in my reflexes, he wants to go forward with genetic counseling and the blood test. \nI have been a nervous wreck since the appointment because even if I am not showing symptoms now, I could still have it and I am not sure I want to know now. I do not know that I would live my life completely different but I do think that I would be far more emotional and sad thinking that I will not be lucid enough to watch my children grow or that my husband will have to endure watching his wife slowing turn into another person. I feel guilty that my husband and children would eventually find me to be a burden but would never say so. That one day they may have to choose to place me in a nursing home and feel guilty for that forever no matter how many times they visit. \nWhile it is true that there is more and more research on the Huntington's gene and gene silencing is being developed, it is still incredibly terrifying that this could be your life in a few short years. \nYour wife knows that you could not possibly know what she is feeling, though you may think you have an idea, but being there for her, encouraging her to search into the trials they are doing now, and being patient with her while she goes through so many emotions will be more impactful than you know. I appreciate the input. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If you ever want to chat, send me a PM. Awesome comment.   If you plan on adopting she cannot get tested until afterwards. If it came back positive, you  would no longer be eligible candidates for adoption in most countries, nor even fostering. (Though you could, of course, still adopt privately from abroad - most likely from Russia or somewhere in Asia). Really? That is quite disappointing.  My mother had HD, as did a couple of my uncles and my grandfather. I grew up living with this disease as my reality. I go back and forth between wanting to get tested and not. While of course I want to know if I have it, I also know that for me, it is going to be incredibly hard to accept that as my future as a for sure. My only advice for you is to just be patient during this process. It is a roller coaster of emotions, and all you can do is try to be understanding, and not judge too harshly.

Huntington's runs in the family, my grandfather passed away from it in his 60's, my Aunt is in her final stages of it in her late 50's (started symptoms in her mid 30's), and one of her son's recently tested positive and is showing symptoms at age 32. My mom never got tested for it, however, she is 55 years old and has never shown symptoms. I always thought that because she had passed the age of when my Aunt got symptoms that she must not have it. But now I start thinking and wonder if it is possible that she could have symptoms just show up later in life or would it usually start around the same time among siblings? Every person is unique with their symptoms, onset, progression, etc. My MIL\u2019s sister exhibited symptoms much later in life than my MIL. My mother did not start getting symptoms until in her 60s, and she has far outlived her mother, who passed it to her. My uncle, who also had it, just passed away at 77.

My life is lacking in intimacy and connection. I want someone who choose to stay by my side. I met my husband through Match.com 13 years ago and have been married for 10 years.  He did not include details regarding HD in his profile.  I cannot remember when he disclosed HD ran in his family but I remember having a serious conversation probably six months into dating when his dad died of HD.  I never met his dad because they were estranged for about 5 years.  I remember my husband explaining to me that there is a chance he could have it.  We met in our early 40\u2019s and had kids from prior marriages.  I was not concerned because my dad has survived cancer and felt that as we get older, we are all at risk for something.  He is a great stepdad to my kids and I have no regrets getting married to him.  My husband and I both were on the dating scene for a while as we both did not want to jump into anything serious right away.  I think it is easier to connect with someone when they are keeping it fun and more lighthearted, especially in the beginning. Are you symptomatic? I feel like this is a very important question. If you are not showing symptoms I feel like you have some freedom to wait until things go well to disclose your status.  But if you are already showing symptoms that becomes an aspect of dating you. \n\nEither way I would leave it off the dating profile. Perfectly said My fiance, when we first met, disclosed it within a month of us meeting. She asked why I never asked about her mom since I knew she was not around anymore.  She told me everything. How it is inherited,  family history, etc. She told me I should talk it out with someone before we actually started officially dating and got too deep.\nI did.  I researched.  I learned.  I accepted the chances.  \nFast forward, She told me she wanted to be tested before I proposed so I knew what I was getting into. \nWe did the appointments together. I was there for the positive results.  We cried together,  me more then her.\nWe left that day for a 2 week road trip to national parks. Did so many amazing things, saw great sites.\nWe are now engaged and I cannot imagine life without her.  Maybe we will get 10-15 good years.  Maybe we will get 20-25.

Just wanted you to know that I am on the same boat and you are not alone! Thanks! My father and brother both had it and passed away from it, my dad in 2008 and my brother in 2019. I got tested and do not have it. I am in my early 50\u2019s now, but was in my 30s when my dad got diagnosed and I learned what HD was and how it affects people. If there is any part of my experience that would be helpful please feel free to DM me any time. My mom was diagnosed in her 60s a few years ago. Am almost 40 and not testing right now because I cannot have kids. One thing that am doing is trying to trace it in the family. I was already into family tree research and was expanding my tree out to help figure out DNA matches. I found an obituary for grandmother first cousin that asked for Huntingtons donations. Then a couple months later DNA match confirmed others in the family. My great grandparents hide it and am not sure my grandmother knew because her brother was surprised when we told him. Am trying to trace descendants of my 3rd great grandparents to see if I can place it to them since am at 2nd great grandparents level. I did found another surname in my tree with HD so am probably going to 5th great grandparents on this branch next. I am concerned it is under diagnosed. I feel we have a common ancestor aka patient zero. Go far enough back we are all related I am so sorry for your loss! I know my dad has it for 2.5 years now, and its been quite the challenge seeing what is been going on. I know he can live like this for a very long time, but that does not make it less hard for me. How did you deal with your dad changing? How did your mom (if she is still in the picture) deal with it? What worked, and what did not? Hmm, maybe, but we are all over the world, so I wonder how that happend hahah. I know that in my dads family, it is very common to have it, sadly... I am not sure if it is under diagnosed, but I do think it is hard to make a choise to get tested. I am only 19, and to know it right now, it seems kind of scary to me. I do not think I want to get tested, all I know that if I ever want kids, that I do not want them to be scared that they have it. Incoming wall of text, I will try to TL;DR at the bottom. I had to split this into two responses because it was too long. Some of my advice may be tough to read, it is meant from a place of love and caring and I hope it is helpful to you in some way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiagnosis for my dad was really tricky because \n\n1. We would never heard of HD before; \n2. There was no documented family history of it; and \n3. He was diagnosed at age 67, much later than you might expect. \n\nWe think that his mom might have been just below the clinical threshold (say with a CAG score of 38), but will never know as she passed away some years before his diagnosis in her eighties. Even as we knew my dad's diagnosis we all had some denial around how far and fast things were progressing. We kept trying to keep him in the least restrictive living situation possible, but it quickly became clear that he was losing the ability to dress himself and toilet unassisted due to loss of executive planning. I was visiting him once a week on Sundays after having moved him up from San Diego to the Los Angeles area where I was living at the time. In between visits I was researching different facilities to find a place that could care for him adequately that were within our means. There were plenty of places that could take him in at a relatively low cost, but none of them really knew what HD was and were the kind of place where the smell hit you when you walked in the door, and I did not want my dad to live there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually I found a convalescent hospital in Santa Monica that was not cheap, but had very capable staff and was very clean. They were not familiar with HD, but showed a strong willingness to learn and interest in providing good care. It was a tough decision to make because I knew the monthly cost would run out the remainder of his pension eventually and there were no resources after that to pay for it, but I wanted him to be in a good place and be well cared for. I was able to get him in to see a neurologist who specialized in HD who was able to tailor his medications to mitigate HD's effects as much as possible. I talked to her about how long I could hope for him to live and the dilemma of money available for his care vs. monthly cost. While she obviously could not tell me what to do, she told me that HD patients who are not diagnosed in childhood or adolescence will often live 10-15 years after diagnosis/beginning of symptoms. My dad started symptoms some years prior to diagnosis, but it was hard to pinpoint exactly when as he would always suffered from depression and it was hard to distinguish when HD took over from depression in making it hard for him to do things. In the end I gambled on his being comfortable and hoping that the money in his pension would last long enough to keep him in one place. My fear was that things would run out when he was in an advanced stage and he would have to move when he would be least equipped to deal with it, but I made the best call I could at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a wife and two small kids in addition to a more than full time job as this was going on so I could only really visit him once a week, but every Sunday I went out to see him. While he was in a senior independent living facility I was able to do more with him, but when he transitioned into the convalescent living facility we became a lot more limited in what we could do. He was able to walk for a while as long as I held onto his arm, but eventually he became confined to a wheelchair so instead of taking him for a walk I would take him out in a wheelchair around the neighborhood and tell him about what was going on with my family and various happy topics. After the walk I would read Harry Potter books to him but the combo of work plus kids meant I would fall asleep while reading after half an hour or so. After every visit I would drive away for a block or two and then pull over to cry for a bit. It was really hard seeing him go from being an erudite man with a PhD in biology, to being bed and wheelchair bound and struggling for words to capture what he was trying to say and getting frustrated. He only really ever got mad once, though. It was before his diagnosis, we would moved him up from San Diego to live with us because even though we did not know exactly what was wrong with him we knew he was not safe to continue living on his own. He was trying to write out the alphabet in print and was deeply struggling with forming the letters correctly when he slammed his pen on the paper and yelled FUCK! That was literally the only time in my life I ever heard him swear in anger. For the most part though. he stayed the same sweet man he would always been his whole life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my wife's favorite memories was one time she was taking him to a doctor's appointment with our first son in tow while I was at work. My son started getting fussy on the ride as he did not like the car seat (he was a little under one) and they were stuck in bad traffic. My dad started singing Gilbert &amp; Sullivan showtunes to calm him down, and my wife joined in. From what she told me it worked like a charm and they sang to him for the whole ride to the doctor appointment (this was pre-diagnosis). I wish I could have been there to see it, because from my wife's description it was incredibly sweet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was intensely painful watching the disease progress and take a little more of him each time I saw him. While he was mentally the same person in terms of temperament, it got harder and harder for him to speak and physically he became more and more bed bound to where I could no longer take him on walks. Him being stuck in bed all the time meant he started getting the kind of maladies that lays you vulnerable to like pneumonia. He had to be hospitalized a few times for that, which in turn led to him catching MRSA which prolonged the hospitalizations. Each time got a little worse until a hospital social worker eventually took me aside and told me it was time to start thinking about Hospice care. It was a hard thing to accept, but at that point I just wanted his suffering to be over and it seemed to be clear it was time. Unfortunately the convalescent hospital could not handle hospice and he had to be moved to a much less nice facility, but Medicare paid for all of it and he was kept comfortable for about three days before passing. I visited him daily there and on the day he passed I could tell things were getting close and told him that he had been a great dad and always done everything he could for me and that I loved him very much. He could barely speak at this point and it took all he had to force out a very garbled thank you, but I knew he heard me and understood me and that is a memory I have treasured ever since. I got the call that night around 10pm that he had stopped breathing. Part 2: I just saw that Part 2 did not post properly, trying again:\n\nI am sorry if that was way more than you would ever hoped to know, it is hard to edit myself when talking about this stuff. As far as what was most helpful and what I would wished I would done during that time, here are a few thoughts:\n\n* Get your dad to give someone power of attorney. We did this just in time with my dad, he was only just barely still competent to do so and his signature on the paperwork was an illegible scrawl, but it was hugely useful for me to be able to make all decisions for him once he was no longer capable to do so. Fortunately I would been caring for him for a long time before he was fully unable to do so and he trusted me, but I cannot imagine how much harder that process would have been if I did not have durable power of attorney to make all necessary decisions for him. Research the laws on this where you live, but there are plenty of forms that you can print out and have your dad sign in the presence of a notary that will suffice (assuming you are in the US, YMMV in other countries)\n* Have your dad complete an advance directive while he is still capable of doing so. It will be a very difficult conversation to have, but it is vital to do so you know what he would and would not want done to prolong his life in case he is no longer able to tell you or make that choice when the time comes. Modern medicine can prolong people's lives by heroic measures, but with HD the end is really bad and may not be a life worth living. My dad knew he would not want to be put on a ventilator or have tube feedings to prolong his life. He knew that when he got to the point where he could not breathe or eat on his own it was time to say goodbye. He also chose a Do Not Resuscitate order as if someone stops breathing modern medicine can bring you back, but it will often require chest compressions that will break ribs and intubation, both of which cause a lot of pain and discomfort and he did not want any part of that. It will be a very hard and painful conversation, but it is absolutely best to do so you know you are honoring his wishes rather than wonder if you are making the right choices when he can no longer do so. One tricky thing about advance directives is that a person's wishes may change and you need to be ready to update the advance directive to reflect it. My brother initially did an advance directive saying he wanted to be resuscitated as he was in denial of his eventual prognosis, but once he was farther along he updated it to forbid heroic measures to prolong his life.\n* I apologize in advance if this is offensive to you or any faith you hold, but a corollary to the above is research assisted suicide laws where you live. If it is something you and your father wish to consider it should be part of your advance directive conversation. HD's progression varies from person to person both in its speed and precise effects, but it will inevitably lead a person to a quality of life that they may no longer consider worth living. While my dad was a catholic and this was not a conversation to have with him, my brother very much wished he could have pursued this option. Unfortunately by the time he was ready to do so he was no longer considered competent to make that decision and the laws for where he was living at the time did not permit it. Please note, medical advances are made all the time and there may come a day where this does not have to be a part of the discussion, but I would much rather know a person's wishes on this topic than have to make a best guess or worse be unable to assist their wishes when the time comes.\n* Make sure that there is a plan for your dad's possessions whether that is a will or living trust. You will have to research your options depending on the laws of where you live, I can only speak to choices in the U.S. Your dad should definitely have either a will or living trust (of the two the latter requires less work post-mortem by the survivors and is preferable). You want this taken care of in advance as it is the last thing you will want to deal with once your father father passes. If he passes away intestate it becomes a long and expensive process and you will not know for sure that you are honoring his wishes.\n* MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL: Have a solid plan for self-care. Make sure you are seeing someone in therapy if at all possible and whether you think you need it or not. I always told myself I should just be grateful I did not have HD and should do whatever I can to take care of my dad, but in hindsight I truly wish I would gotten in therapy years earlier. The emotional weight of watching a parent sicken over the course of years and eventually die cannot be overstated. The emotional baggage I took on from that and dealing with my brother's HD progression made me such a mess that I almost lost my marriage. It took years of marital and individual therapy to recover from that, and with hindsight I am certain it would have taken a lot less if I would just done better self-care while I was going through it all. I really cannot say this strongly enough. You are going to feel like you should forget your own needs to attend to a loved one who needs all you can give and more, but please please PLEASE take concrete steps to take care of yourself. \nI did not touch on my experience with my brother and all that involved, but if you have made it this far I will spare you those details unless you really want to know them. The short version of it is that I felt a lot of survivor's guilt that he got HD and I did not, and did not set nearly as good boundaries with him as I should have. This also contributed to my marriage almost going up in flames. \n\nIn answer to your question, my mother divorced my father when I was 4 years old and they had a very bitter and contentious relationship so she was not much of a factor in my dad's experiences. She wanted to visit my dad when he was very advanced in his progression because by that time my brother was diagnosed and she wanted to see what my brother would be facing. I asked my dad if he was willing to see her and he said he was at the time, but I did not let her because I did not think he would have wanted that if he was still fully competent. In retrospect I wish I had allowed her to do so as it would not have hurt him, but I would always felt very protective towards him where she was concerned (long story) and at the time it did not feel right. \n\nTL;DR: \n1. Make sure someone has power of attorney for your father while he is still legally competent to give it. I cannot overstate how important and useful this will be when he progresses past a certain point.\n2. Have your father complete an advance directive to ensure you are honoring his wishes with end of life decisions. If local laws permit it, you may wish to consider under what if any circumstances your father would not wish to consider living.\n3. Make sure your father has either a will, or living trust, or whatever estate planning is appropriate to your jurisdiction has been done. It may feel ghoulish to talk about, but it is important and will allow you to know that you are fulfilling his wishes for his worldly possessions after his passing.\n4. Most important of all, HAVE A PLAN FOR SELF-CARE and adhere to it no matter what. It is far too easy to ignore your own needs when confronted with the overwhelming needs of someone suffering from HD. You cannot care for someone else if you are not taking care of yourself and if you try you will pay a price for it whether it is now or in the long run after they have passed. They would not want you to burn yourself out for their sake. You deserve to be happy too.\n\nI hope some of that is helpful, my apologies if any of it is offensive or redundant to what you already know. My brother had a very different HD journey than my dad, let me know if you would like to know about that or if you have any questions about any of the above. Yep. Found out my mom has 39 repeats, grandma passed away in January. \n\nI think I want to get tested but I am not sure my parents would like it. I am 20 and still live at home (I commute to uni and am in 3rd year). Probably will get tested in my early-mid 20s after I move out. I have 3 siblings and 3 cousins all at risk too, so even if I am not one of the unlucky ones with it it is going to be a hard life watching some of them deteriorate. All we can really do is hope for a cure by then.\n\nIf you want to dm me feel free I do not have many friends to talk about this with (bringing up my potential terminal genetic disease kills the mood). My parents do not like talking about it either so I turn to Reddit \ud83d\ude00\n\nI only found out about this disease last December when I was 19 and a lot of things about my family made more sense, but it was a total loss of innocence. I feel unmotivated a lot of the time and tell myself what is the point of getting a job and working until I am 65 if I am going to die before I can collect my pension. I want to live my life but life is expensive and I cannot help feeling like I have so much less time than my friends and people around me My mom passed away in 2014 with it. I believe she was 23 when she first started showing symptoms. I am not sure of how many repeats she had though. When I was in the process of getting tested, I found out that it is been in our family for about 4 generations that we know of. But I decided to get tested last year, and I also have two siblings at risk and I am not sure where they are on their decision to test or not. I am in the same age category as you, and I am here if you need to talk about anything. You are not alone in this! I am so sorry. This is such a sad story, that it almost made me cry, and I almost never cry. I hope you and your family is doing well at the moment and that you are now experiencing less stress when it comes to work. Thank you for sharing your story!\n\nAll the things you are talking about are already taken care of I believe. Luckily, my dad is still early in the process, and can still act like my dad. I know what this disease can do to a person, and I am not offended. I see it when I visit my aunt, my dads older sister. It is not nice visiting her, it is very confronting. \n\nI did not know that this might have such an huge effect, and I am very happy that you could save your marriage. I already go to therapy due to me having ADD and Autism, and having therapist finding out about it very late...  ( Depends on what you think is late, I think it is since they couldve done it earlier, but no one was listening to me) I have the last diagnosis since 6 months now. This also has an effect, since you know as a kid you are different, but you do not know what in the world is wrong with you. As you can imagine, this has had huge effects on my mental health. I am sorry about your mom and your grans. A good thing to remember, is that you are only AT RISK. This does not mean you have it yet, and that you should live your life to the fullest. If you already have that mindset of being unmotivated, it will only make you feel depressed, and I think you need some help. I was reccomended by therapists not to get diagnosed, until I show symptoms, or until I want to start having kids, and I totally agree with them, it is to avoid this mindset and falling into depressive thoughts. I am 19, and you are 20, we are both so young and  we still have our lives ahead of us. No matter what, we should make the best of it.\n\nI hope I am not offending you in this post! Thanks! Please reconsider testing though! Since were both so young and have our lives ahead of us, it might only cause depressive thoughts if the test is positive... Getting tested is a very personal decision, and I would be wary to make testing recommendations to strangers one way or another. I tested positive, and I think for me the certainty of the result is better than the uncertainty of being at risk.\n\nA lot of at risk people convince themselves they are positive and live life that way, even though there is a 50% chance they are negative. For me simply learning I was at risk let the genie out of the bottle, I could not live the rest of my life with just that partial knowledge.\n\nI was 37 when I tested though, and already had a child when I found out my Mum\u2019s diagnosis and that I was at risk. My story is a lot like /u/capnmalreynolds above, so my experiences are very different from yours. Do what is best for you, but know what is best for you is not necessarily what is best for everyone. That is also a good way to view it. If it is best for you, it is best for you. I am just a bit scared, that some (young) people without symptoms yet might get tested, without considering what would happen if they would be positive. I am doing it with the best intentions, and I do not want to pressure anyone into not testing. Hey . I have set up a group on Facebook where people in the HD community can come together,  make friends,  help and support each other. Were just having weekly video chats,  where we aim to rotate the time and date to allow all time zones and participate at some point.  \nWe are all different age groups some in there early 20's , some 30s etc , feel free to join in if you are interested . It is all really informal and friendly ! \n Hey, I am 24F mom has HD, I will message you! Would love to have a regular point of contact. I actually did get my results last December, negative. Even though it is been almost a year I still am processesing these results. It is weird, even though it is negative I am still not as happy as I thought I would be. I think it is because I convinced myself I had it for so long and now that I got my result, it is like.. what now? A little bit of an Identity Crisis going on haha. \nBut getting tested is a very personal choice and should not be taken lightly! I only continued with the testing process when I was 100% sure I was ready.\nAlso I had the same process of \"I will have more depressive thoughts if I am positive\" for the longest time. But weirdly, something my husband said to me while waiting for my results that really helped put it into prospective. He said \"you may already be positive, you just do not know yet\"  which I found oddly comforting. I am looking forward to your message! Yes, I get that too... I sometimes talk with my boyfriend about the fact that I might have it too, and I am preparing him for it etc. I have basiclly set my mind on the worst scenario possible, eventhough I do not want to get tested. I think it would be the same thing when you get tested positive, with the mindset that you do not have it. (The same thing happend with my recent Autism diagnosis, since I already have ADD too but I get the therapist now\ud83d\ude02).\n\nIt is a very personal choice, and I do not want to tell you what to do. I have seen some young people however, who want to get tested without considering what it might do to them, and since I have had issues with my mental health before, I do not wish that upon anyone. If the test is positive, it changes your whole life, and it might make you very depressed....\n\nWhat your husband said, makes sense, and it helps you to see things in another light.\n\nAgain, I do not want to tell you or anyone else what to do. Since I have struggeled with mental health issues, and since I see my dad struggeling since he was diagnosed, I know what it can do to a person. I meant it all with the best intentions! Hi there, my dad has HD and my sister\u2019s been confirmed to have it. I probs will be able to relate a lot to you! Plus I would love a good chat as well! Sure, my pms are always open :) My dad did not get tested. His dad mom and brother both started showing symptoms in there mid 20s die in mid 40s. My great great aunt died from it at 29. None of her kids have it. My dad died from cancer at 35 before he could get tested but it is pretty safe to say he is in the clear due to the age he should have started showing symptoms. I still worry cause I had kids before I knew but damn I pray he did not have it My dad started to show symptoms aged 55 or so... I do not want to make you paraniod, but sometimes the symptoms show up later in life, or the symptoms do not show up at all, due to dying before the symptoms show, or the symptoms just do not show up at all while you still have it (this is very, very unlikely, but sometimes it happends). \n\nGetting tested is, again, your choice, I just wanted to let you know. Yes I agree! But in my family the ages of onset have slowly gotten earlier and earlier. I still will get tested at 30. But for now I am waiting. Knowing mow will not change anything", "NAC (N-acetylcysteine) for delaying onset of HD Hello I was given the news my Father has Huntington's on January 1st (Happy New Years!). I will be seeking out genetic testing later this year.\n\nDue to initial curiosity I started looking into the ongoing HD research. I stumbled upon this video with a doctor in Western Australia describing the current trials there. The last one she mentions is about NAC, an over the counter widely available health food supplement that was shown to delay onset of HD in mice.\n\n( she starts talking about the NAC trial at 12:15 but the whole video is good for an overview of some of the new research trials.\n\nI did not see this any where on the subreddit so I thought I would share.\n\nI will be going to pick up some NAC later on today while I begin the process of finding out if I have the HD gene. It is a health food supplement so probably cannot go wrong either way.\n\nPlease note this post should not be taken in any way as any type of medical advice, I am simply sharing information that there is potential for this supplement to delay onset. There is a cysteine experiment group on Facebook Looks like they want to test its effects clinically on recruits that are gene positive but have not shown symptoms yet, starting in February of this year.  Seems promising, but I want to reserve judgment for when we have more information.  Perhaps I could ask my girlfriend's specialist about it. I bought those for my wife, we have not started using them yet, since she is still breastfeeding..\n\nI mean technically any anti oxidants should be good for people with HD. It is all about protecting the brain until some cure comes around.", "Butler interviews Hello Reddit. \n\nMy dad has Huntington\u2019s and I need your help. \n\nA little backstory, and then I will get to why I have gathered you here today.\n\nMy parents (dad 60 mom 59/ retired) have been together since they were 15, and have a tenuous relationship at best. Before my dad got diagnosed, my mom was in the midst of filing for divorce. She waited to see what the diagnosis was before she proceeded. Obviously, with this being the outcome, she did not go thru with it. \n\nMy dad is not exactly a nice person.  He never physically hurt my mom, myself or any of my siblings. It was all a mind game. He would gaslight the shit out of you. Follow you around saying horrible things under his breath, and stop as soon as someone else was nearby. \nThat kind of shit. \nHe is an alcoholic grouch with a short fuse who put my mother and I thru hell. \n(Not sure why it was just 2/6)\n\nEven with his Huntington\u2019s progressing, quickly as he is still drinking, he still manages to make my mom feel terrible, as if she personally did this to him. He cannot  drive, so all day he is at home watching re-runs and throwing away our possessions at random. My mom does her best to stay busy and out of the house, even getting a part time job, but he always manages to find a way to ruin her day.\n\n My siblings and I all have jobs/families/responsibilities and as you can imagine, spending time with my dad is emotionally draining and I usually need to look at baby animal videos after.\n\nHe needs a caretaker. Not so much to take care of him in the traditional sense, but like an assistant or a butler of sorts. Someone to keep him company and make sure he does not get hurt or lost or end up on the news. Unfortunately, he is not open to the idea because, \u201che is fine\u201d. \n\nHe is not fine. \n\nHe is spending too much time alone and he is turning into some sort of super villain with the dark backstory. \n\nThere are a few agencies where we live, that would send over a person to basically be a buddy. The issue is not accessibility. It is that he does not want help and if we try and force it, he is going to make my mother even more miserable. \n\nVictims should not have to care for their abuser. We have all seen that movie.  It does not end well for anybody.\n\nHow do we get him to meet with the caregiver/agency/butler service without him unleashing over-the-top rage on his well-intentioned family? \n\n\nPlease send help. My first and admittedly harsh thought is that your mother might be wise to restart the divorce proceedings. There is no way this will not become an increasingly abusive situation if they continue to be married and they continue to live under the same roof. \n\nCould your mother move in with someone?\n\nMy second thought is that any buddy/companion/butler service will quickly withdraw their services if you father is half as challenging as you describe. No one is going to put up with even his pre-HD behavior. If nothing else, there are safety concerns for any companions.\n\nI commend you for trying to work out some options in light of your father's diagnosis. However, after decades of abuse, it may be time for you all to consider what is best for you, not your abuser.\n\nA dios my friend. Hard truth: You cannot make him do anything.  The best you and your mom can do is attend Al-Anon where you can learn to set healthy boundaries and take care of yourselves.  You are both trying to care for him without acknowledging your own needs. Al-Anon will teach you how to loving set limits without sacrificing yourselves.  \n\nAt some point your dad will not be able to get his own alcohol. Are you and your mom going to go get it for him?  Google Al-Anon and get yourself some help. \n\nMy sister died of HD - I became her guardian years before she passed away because her husband is paranoid schizophrenic.  I am so glad I was already in Al-Anon so I could set limits with him and not lose my mind!!!  \n\nGood luck friend:) My grandmother was not nearly as belligerent as you describe here, so take this advice with a grain of salt, but she was SO stubborn about letting someone help her even when she clearly needed it. Our solution was to hire a hairdresser (who was really a social worker) to come in a wash and do her hair twice a week. It gave my grandpa a break for 2-3 hours twice a week, but my grandma did not realize she was not just getting her hair done. It worked out so well for us until my grandma\u2019s symptoms progressed so much that she needed full time care.\n\nMaybe you could find someone you could hire as a handy man or gardener or something under the premise of helping your dad with more technical tasks, but is actually there as a care giver. \n\nMy heart goes out to you and your mother. This seems like a terrible situation and I hope you can find a solution that brings some peace. This is honestly genius. I might try this with my mom who keeps canceling her home health aid or just treating her like chauffeur. Maybe hire her a \"gardener\" or something. \n\nFor OP, maybe try reaching out to your local HDSA support group. There may be someone who is very familiar with the disease and would not mind being paid to do something like this. Hey guys,\n\nI know it is been a bit since I originally posted. There is been a lot going on.\n\nThank you so much for your suggestions and input. \n\nYour support has definitely helped ease my anxiety.  \n\nAs of right now, our solution is for my siblings and I to take turns \u201changing out\u201d with my dad. I cut back my hours at work and drive down to spend time with him, my mom and dog 2x a week. It is a lot of driving (4+ hours round trip), but also somewhat cathartic. \n\nWhat has been surprisingly helpful is that there is no precise treatment, so anything COULD work. (Hypothetically). Makes talking him into things much easier. \n\nI have been journaling about our time together and finding creative solutions to some of his limitations and so far so good.\n\nHardwood floors and always in socks = socks with adhesive on bottom to prevent slippage \n\nHard time chewing = bite size foods/ snacks and in smaller portions\n\nWe also got him some cannabis gummies.   \n\n \nI love the idea of hiring a professional posing at something else. It is very Mrs. Doubtfire meets Mary Poppins and I would watch the heck out of that movie.", "How old were you when you learned you were at risk? I am currently 32 (spoiler: no HD), and I only learned that what my father died of 21 years ago now was HD. Before two summers ago, I thought he had died of a heart attack, which I thought was unrelated to his neurological condition. He had been diagnosed with said neurological condition when I was nine, and I never learned the name of it. I always knew my mom was reaaaal touchy about anything regarding my dad, his illness or his death, so I learned to not bring it up. \n\nFast forward, I was working at a patient library at a neurological hospital (I am a medical librarian) and I got curious. I saw my doctor and eventually got paperwork from my grandparents about my dad's illness, which prior to that I had thought might be Pick's disease. I sobbed. That whole summer was swallowed in anxiety and silence, just me, my partner and my best friend. \n\nOnce I had negative results, I finally confronted my mother, and she admitted to lying for years to my brother and I. This has created a fairly serious family rift. I am in low-contact, borderline no-contact with my mother now. I am always so interested in stories and articles on family disclosure practices - I have never heard of a case like mine, where the children learned so late of their HD risk.\n\nI would love to know from others when and how you found out about your HD risk. Plus, if you are a parent, when did you/will you tell your kids? I know people have lots of reasons, but you do not need to go into it if you do not want to - I am more interested in the \"bottom line\" of how old folks were. \n\nPlease note and respect that I am not interested in making this thread about how I should manage my relationship with my mother. I have a therapist and other support for that. TIA &lt;3 I am so so sorry. That is awful. I have heard stories from people who learned about HD late in life (either due to parents hiding the HD from them, or because they were adopted and never knew their parents) and I cannot imagine how much more difficult it must make the process of learning about HD in your family. Especially if your parents knew about it and did not tell you.   \n\n\nI am realizing my parents were maybe anomalies because they were both pretty proactive in the community and my dad went to support groups for well over a decade... so I first learned I was at risk for HD when I was about 12 or 13. If I ever have kids, I plan to make sure they do not inherit huntington's before bringing them into the world. I also learned I was at risk later on in life. My parents had been told that my grandfather, a Mennonite, had died of Parkinson\u2019s. It was not until I read my dad\u2019s chart at age 25 when he was in the hospital that I saw he had been diagnosed with HD.\n\nThis will be a hard year for you, and you will have a lot of options for testing that you should weigh with lots of consideration before going forward. I would recommend r/raisedbynarcissists to help you learn about what seems to be your mother\u2019s condition. I am so so so so sorry you have to go through this. My husband found out when he was 31. That also happened to be when his mom officially got diagnosed. She had told us for years that she knew she did not have it. In our minds that meant she took the test and it came back negative. Once she started showing signs we realized that was her way of being in denial. She had never taken the test. But eventually she did and we got the results. She is still partially in denial. \n\nWe were both shocked and angry. I was 38 weeks pregnant when we found out. Needless to say that made everything worse. We plan to tell our child when she is old enough to get tested, which is 18. I found out at age 37 when my mother was diagnosed. We knew something was wrong with before the diagnosis but with no family history nobody had ever considered that it could be Huntingtons, not even her doctors initially.\n\nI am a parent of a preschooler who was born before her diagnosis, and who is too young to really understand. I plan to just be honest with him about his grandmother\u2019s illness and my positive gene status. He knows she had a disease, and he knows it made her move and dance in a way she could not stop, but he is too young to grasp much else. I hope that growing up with that knowledge will help keep it from being as shocking and traumatic for him as it was for my family to learn about it.\n\nI think kids can understand and adjust to more than we give them credit for. Your mom probably thought hiding this from you was for the best, but I cannot imagine the sense of betrayal you must feel/have felt. I took my test when I was 24 and am only 26 now. As a child i watched my grandmother with HD. My mother passed away at 37 from unrelated circumstances so there was a chance I could have it. I was honestly so sure it was going to be negative but it was not. I was 7 months pregnant with our second child when I found out my mother-in-law had HD. I was the one that took her to a neurologist after a fall. I had been told she was a drunk. Her father had died of cancer before onset. She thought she had a brain tumor and had planned to just die. My relationship with her son was already all but over and I lost contact with the family for years. \n\nI told my kids when they were 12-13. Their dad had reappeared, symptomatic and in denial. We already had a pack of therapists to help deal with it. As much as it can be dealt with.\n\nI am glad I did not wait until they were 18. Testing is not the issue - it is \"How could you keep this from me? How can I ever trust you again?\" There is NO good time to bring it up. I wonder if it is better to grow up around symptomatic family members and \"always know.\" Not possible in our case.\n\nMy oldest, now 27, got tested a few years ago and regrets it. Increased her existing anxiety disorder dramatically. The younger is almost 24 and went right up to the actual blood test and said, \"stop - not ready.\" I do my best to support them. Neither wanted me to be part of the testing process. HD was not the only challenge we faced, and the layers of trauma affect everyone.\n\nThe younger found the nursing home her father was in a few years ago. She never knew him as a parent, and was not exposed to his psychiatric symptoms. She was able to build a bit of a relationship. She sat with him at the end and handled his final arrangements last year. He was 50. I do not really remember not knowing. My dad was very up front about it. As a kid I remember being confused (and sometimes frustrated) as to why my mom could not do certain things. From playing tag with me to not being able to walk on her own. I remember being told that she was sick but I did not understand why. I do not remember when he told me the details about the disease but I was aware of possibly inheriting Huntington\u2019s around middle school. She passed away a few years ago at 39. My brothers and I still have not been tested. I am 23 but I do not think I am ready for the possibility of knowing I have it quite yet. Learned about my grandma having HD when I was a freshman in high school. Maybe it was my own denial but I also did not have a good relationship with my father growing up and it basically ended when my parents got divorced about a year after that. He tested positive after a fall at work February 2017 (I was 22 almost 23). That was when it really hit me that I was at risk. Got my results Valentine\u2019s Day this year (maybe a little morbid?) and tested positive. I did not think I wanted kids but I have really been grieving that lately. Seeing all these posts of those newly pregnant and knowing that will never be me. I do not want to go through IVF or adopt, personally I do not want to have a child who even though they are negative has to have/see a parent go through this. I am so sorry you and your family had to go through that. Thanks! Some days are easier than others. Still figuring out how to handle all this. oh my GOODNESS! I can hardly imagine how frustrated and irate you must have been! I am so sorry. how long ago did this happen? Thanks. This happened last year so we are still grieving. Best of luck to you! Thank you &lt;3 do you happen to recall where else you have heard of similar stories? truly, I hunger to connect with someone who has been through something similar! &gt;There is NO good time to bring it up. I wonder if it is better to grow up around symptomatic family members and \"always know.\" Not possible in our case.\n\nI absolutely agree. While I was trying to process what my mother chose to do, I kept walking through it in my head, how I would handle it if I was in the same situation with my son. I did not mention it in the above post, but I do have a nine-year-old kid (yeah, my mother did not tell me even though I had not one but two pregnancies in my twenties), and I just kept coming to the same conclusion - that your role as a parent if your kid is at risk of suicide because of their health risks is to **support them** \\- not hide the facts of those risks from them. thank you for sharing! I am curious, as someone who did choose to get tested because the not knowing was worse for me personally - do you find that generally, you are able to kind of forget about HD in your day-to-day life? or is the goal more to keep it relegated to just one \"room in your house\" and not let it spill over, kind of thing? if you are open to sharing! you say you are not ready to maybe learn you have it, yet you are here on this reddit, so I am curious. aw that is really tough. are you open to encouragement, in the form of mentioning some other ways you can experience similar things, or would you prefer to just be heard? absolutely. it is tough - we had a very honest conversation about it when I confronted her, and I was very gentle and compassionate, honestly. but the next day I told her I could not maintain a relationship with her for awhile. I needed a long time to process my feelings. and I have always known that she genuinely believed that she was doing the best thing for us - and she is honest with me in admitting that she still thinks that. she told me that she would not do differently if she could go back in time. she wanted us to have \"normal\" lives and she did not want us to kill ourselves if we tested positive, I think. I know this, I see it, I understand it, I do. but yes, I did feel deeply betrayed, and deeply disrespected. it is very hard to carry on a relationship when you know that the other person would do the same thing again in a heartbeat. I would say I think about it almost daily. I do not want to disregard the possibility of having it because I feel like I kind of need to plan my life around it. Like, I want kids but I have made the decision to not have them if I do end up inheriting this. For awhile I was questioning whether or not I should go to college. My thought process is \u201cwhy pay for all this schooling if I am going to get sick in my late 20s like mom.\u201d So, it does come up quite a bit. I try to be real with myself and make myself aware that I could test negative or positive. I am actually going to therapy to help work through my emotions and my fears of this disease. \nI want to test for it but there is a lot of unknown. Getting life insurance, finding a place to test, all the different tests you have to take, how much it will cost etc. And on another note; am I ready? I have heard of survivors guilt and I can see they being a possibility for someone like me. And if I end up with this; how will I be able to be healthy mentally/emotionally while carrying this new weight on my shoulders. There is a lot to consider Ahhh, I hear you. I am so glad to hear you will be seeing a therapist! That is great. I live in Canada and I did not have to pay for testing at all, it did not even occur to me until you mentioned having to worry about the cost. It is humbling. I wish you lived somewhere that it is covered as well. From what I have seen online it can range from below 1,000 to maybe over 2,000. I guess it depends on where you go? I mean, it is not THAT bad but also I am trying to buy a house and want to save as much as possible hahah. So it is doable, but still is not the cheapest. Golly I am sorry to hear that. That would have been prohibitively expensive for me as well. Good for you for saving :) I am lucky enough that my sister had her gene negative IVF baby. I respect her decision to do what she wanted and I hope to be the best auntie to him \ud83d\udc9c but I am always open to encouragement Most of the stories were through local support groups or conventions, but I can DM you some links to places you might be able to find more people to chat with. I totally get wanting to talk to other people who know what you are going through! Chances are she will learn about it long before she is 18, and even if she does not, if you wait till she is 18 to inform her at all, her reaction might not be a positive one. &gt;she told me that she would not do differently if she could go back in time.\n\nI know that this is very, very hard to process when anyone in your life tells you this about something they did that hurt you, much less someone as close to you as a parent. It makes it all but impossible to keep them in your life. The cognitive dissonance never goes away. So it is like a wound unable to heal. Hey, thank you so much for taking the time to reply and for being so understanding. It has been really tough, yes, in part because the circumstances are so very specific. \n\nThe community of people with severe genetic illnesses (HD families, but also certain families with genetic cancer predisposition syndromes, etc.) are already pretty tiny... To find people within this community who also did not learn until quite late because of a deliberate cover-up is bound to be hard. I have not had any luck yet.\n\nAnd from the other side, the community of folks that are in therapy for difficult family dynamics, or who are estranged from their parents, is often made up of people whose parents were more obviously and severely abusive or neglectful. My mom definitely has issues aside from the HD stuff, and there was some trauma in my childhood, and I am talking about it with my therapist... But most people in this community have no idea what HD is; while some of the dynamics of control are familiar, the specifics can be hard to relate to.\n\nIt is just a difficult thing to be affected in any way by a rare disease; I am sure feeling alone must be quite common. I am glad to have this group! Correct, she will most likely know before then. But she cannot get tested until she is 18, so I guess what I meant to say is that she will not be able to KNOW if she has it until then. I was around 12 when I found out I was at risk. My mom has it but when I was younger no one ever told me what it was exactly that my mom had. Until one day a family friend told me, \u201cyou know your mom has Huntington\u2019s right?\u201d and I had no idea what it was so I decided to look it up. That was when I learned truly what it was and that I could possibly inherit the gene one day. Oh wow! Did you talk to your family about it, about your discovery? It reminds me almost of how Jeremie Saunders from the podcast Sickboy describes finding out that cystic fibrosis is a serious, life-limiting illness. He knew he had it off course, but he found it how serious it was in a medical waiting room, from a pamphlet, and felt totally betrayed by his parents. There are a couple of episodes about it. I actually never really talked to them about how I found out. But now I am curious so I think I am going to tell them (later today) and ask when they were planning on telling me, if I had not already found out on my own. Going to be an interesting conversation for sure. Also that podcast sounds interesting, definitely going to give it a listen. Thanks for telling me about it :) I have known for as long as I can remember, at least since I was 8ish. At least one of my uncles with HD was already symptomatic when I was that young and my mom + extended family have always been VERY open about what was going on with them. As a family, we have mostly all been very into educating ourselves and mutual support (kind of have to be with the large number of HD+ folks in our family). I did not know for sure that I was at risk until my mom tested gene positive when I was 15, but I already knew it was a possibility so it was not a shock. \n\nFor me, both being at risk (and eventually finding out I was gene positive too) were way easier to cope with because I would had a literal lifetime to prepare myself for the possibilities. Plus, one of the upsides of having many family members with HD is really understanding the wide range of possible progressions of the disease, so that helped too. I was shocked when I started learning about so many other people's experiences of family secret-keeping and lack of knowledge; that would have made everything SO much harder. I always understood intellectually that HD was stigmatized, but seeing how that is impacted people personally is heartbreaking.\n\nI am currently pregnant (IVF with PGD to select for HD- embryo), and we will take the same open approach with our kiddo. He will know why his Nana is sick, and that mom has the same disease. Plus heaps of info about our hopes for progression delay drugs, and that lots of good years of life are possible with HD. We will also be upfront with him that while we are 97% sure that he is negative, he should probably test before having kiddos of his own (if he decides to).\n\nFWIW to anyone with kids at risk, tell them early (age appropriate detail, ofc) and talk about it more than once. Make it an OK thing for them to talk with you about and for them to learn about. That is made my experience *so* much better than what I have seen others go through.", "My dad passed away from this disease two years ago and I am very mixed on getting tested. I guess I am more scared to find out it is positive and just lose the will to try in life anymore because I know how I will end up in 20-30 years.  Plan for the worst, hope for the best. In all likelihood, an effective treatment/cure will be available within 20 years. But still take the time to make some plans, just in case. \n\nHaving been around family who have had this disease, none of them have regretted living their life to the fullest. They all had children and eventually grandkids. They celebrated birthdays and weddings, and also mourned as others passed before them. It is life. \n\nOne day you will make that decision to get tested. There is no hurry, as treatment options really are not there yet. But being physically and mentally strong  will prove helpful, no matter your diagnosis. Get fit and stay fit. Even after initial symptoms, you will have years where you will still be talking and walking, and being with family and friends. Do not cheat yourself out that time. You maybe even end up enrolled in trials to help defeat this disease, once and for all. \n\nI used to look at psychiatrists and therapists as sort of fake medicine. They are not. Look around and find someone who can understand your situation, and let them help you. It truly works, and having someone you can trust will always make decisions easier. HDSA also has resources that can help. \n\nGood luck, and keep strong. If you decide not to get tested, DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN without iv.", "HD on the Today Show on Mon 2/11.

Hi, I am a teenage girl. My mother and grandmother both have HD. I have a 50% chance of having the disease as well. I have watched my grandmother go through the terrible symptoms and my mother will one day end up like that too. I do not want to end up like that.\n\nEven though there is just as good of a chance of me having it as there is of me not, I still cannot help but worry. I overanalyze any sort of muscle twitches, and I am constantly paying attention to anything I do to see if it is a symptom, even though JHD is very rare and tends to happen whenever the father has HD. I also have pretty bad anxiety which causes me to twitch a little bit along with rocking in my seat, bouncing my leg, twirling my foot, and rocking back and forth in my bed.\n\nI take a walk every single day, sometimes multiple in a day. I worked out a lot too until I decided to take a break so I could gain more weight. I also read a lot, I have straight A's, so my mind is constantly at work, and I also play the violin and sing in a choir which involves reading a lot of music.\n\nCould all of these hold off HD? I have read that exercise is one of the only things that can hold it off, but I have also heard in some places that mental stimulation can help too. What do you think? I cannot get tested until I am 18. Do you think there will be a cure by the time it gets to me? According to a Huntington researcher I talked to once at UCLA, anything that has been shown to be good for brain health in general is probably going to be good for delaying Huntingtons. I do not remember the list of things that had been studied at that point, that brought her to that conclusion. I do remember vitamin e and fish oil though. Pretty sure exercise was too.\n\nI am positive but no symptoms yet. Watching every twitch is going to drive you insane. There are a lot of sources of twitches that have nothing to do with brain disease. \n\nAnyway, sorry you are here. Hope you are negative. If you are not, or never test, I hope you can find a way to live a fulfilling life without it hanging over your every moment. Do not worry about every little twitch that happens, they are normal that everyone gets.\n\nIf you do you are just going to stress yourself out over nothing. If the symptoms start you will know. Daily exercise is one of the few things that has been proven to delay onset and slow symptoms, so yes daily walks would absolutely help. Generally speaking a cardio and strength training routine is probably more effective than walking alone, but walks are definitely better than nothing.\n\nAs to the rest of your questions, watching yourself for twitches or symptoms will not help your mindset. I try to remind myself that due to symptom blindness I probably will not even be able to notice my first symptoms.\n\nUnfortunately it is impossible to say what will happen with potential treatments or cures. There is a lot of exciting research happening, but no guarantees. I am sorry this is something you have to deal with, and I wish there were more concrete answers for you. My husband and his brother both have HD and are in their 50\u2019s.  My husband has been sober for 30+ years and has tried to stay active.  His brother is a full blown alcoholic.  Their symptoms are so different between the siblings because my husband has done his best to stay active and challenge himself by constantly learning new things.  From what I have seen, the better you treat your body, you will ward off the symptoms for a longer period of time.   I have been with my husband for 13 years (no kids together) and he is been the best partner.  The HD symptoms are getting worse but he is still independent and working part time.  I knew there was a chance that he could have the gene but do not have any regrets in getting married, etc.  I hope this helps and I wish you could enjoy your youth while you have it.  Please live your life to the fullest. thanks for sharing this. it is a very positive outlook. I am the partner and it is a newish thing for us, as we thought his dad did not have it. and we just had a child been lurking here. he does not seem ready to really also lurk here or get tested. but is happy to get information filtered through me. sorry to babble, the best to you and your husband. Same, I only found out this disease existed last winter when I was 19 and that my mom tested positive. Now every twitch I convince myself that I am dying in 10 years, even though before last winter I thought nothing of them. I think a lot of it is mental but then again I have been depressed since I was 15, am easily irritated.. the list can go on but it is very easy for me to convince myself I have HD \n\nI think I should get tested, but idk how I would handle the news. But back to exercising, absolutely think it will help. If not HD, it has tons of other health benefits so it will never be a waste of time. I spoke with a neurologist studying HD today (part of the ChangeHD study), who recommended:\n\n1. Have a regular sleep schedule and get enough sleep. (Think 7-8 hours.)\n2. Eat well, aka avoid processed stuff as much as you can.\n3. Exercise routine comprised of cardio, strength training, and balance exercises (3-5 times per week) \n\nI have read that exercise is the only thing that has been correlated with a delayed date of onset, but I think it is also good to engage with hobbies.  \n\nWhile of course no one knows what the future holds, and this is a very scary disease to contend with, I keep reminding myself that this is still the best time (to this point) in human history to contend with this specific illness. While of course there are no guarantees, there are so many treatments being tested right now. The best I can do is take things one day at a time and allow myself to hope that there are some good things in my future, even amidst all the HD worry. \n\nAdditionally, I (29F, learned about the family history of HD in May) also do not know my gene status yet. But I started on an SSRI for anxiety and depression recently, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is been a huge help. So has talking with my therapist, exercising, and getting involved with the HD community. I wonder if it is the feel good endorphins that slow down the symptoms rather than the excersise itself, I drink a lot but I am not an alcy, I thought I was losing it completely before, but I noticed that I was actually just surrounded by a beehive of toxic people and the more Toxic people I cut out (like the proverbial cancers that they are) the better I actually got, drinking included, it was never alcohol that was the problem it was the downbearing social parasites and their constant negativity, thundering down on my Life like a fucking Rainstorm, the emotionally weak and Terminally diseased attract these types unfortunately like Honey attracts Flies, wherever somebody is feeling weakened or exposed a Life ruining control freak/ narcissist will squeeze their way through the cracks and nest in. Be very aware of the people around you and their actions before you start judging yourself and feeling that you are weak or useless, these feelings do not just pluck themselves out of thin air, they are usually planted there in nasty little controlled \"timebombs\" hidden in vocabulary, slowly weathering your resolve and logic over Time, read up on abusive and narcissistic gaslighters and understand the signs inside and out, people like us are their prey, they sniff us out like bloodhounds and then use our own disease against us as a shield for their abuse, shamelessly convincing the World we are symptomatic when we are not yet just so they can hide the proverbial and physical bruises whilst similtaniously getting praised for abusing some of the most vulnerable people in existence. I was lucky enough to get away from the abusers in my life but I do not think everyone else will be, as far as armour goes we are naked, just remember, when a rock comes smashing through the window do not blame the window for breaking, look for the person who threw the rock.", "Bio dad question So I just found out after 37 years who my biological father is. And I found out today that his mother and 2 brothers all have Huntington\u2019s \nI spoke with his wife (bio dad is still digesting the daughter news) she said he has never been tested but is 61 with no symptoms \nHow safe would it be to assume he does not have the gene? I have two young kiddos and I cannot imagine if I passed something not knowing I would strongly assume he is ok, but there is only one way to be sure. Are you planning to get tested? I do not know it is been a lot to digest in a week. Found my bio dad and then found out his family history from my new cousin. What type of doctor do I bring this to? A neurologist typically. But there are some more useful specialists depending on where you are at. Also, do some research on insurance before you do. If you do not have it already, I would buy both short and long term insurance policies before getting tested. They would be much more difficult and expensive to get post testing. And if you are gene negative you can just cancel them if you want. So no harm, no foul. And I would do some research and reach out to any local support organizations too. It may help to find out at which age his brothers developed symptoms. If he did inherit the gene, he would probably have a similar CAG length to his brothers, which strongly influences age of onset. Each person has a 50% chance. Your bio grandmother 50%, if she had it then your bio dad has a 50% chance, if he has it then you have a 50% chance.\n\nA genetic counselor would give you a lot of information and help you decide if you want to get tested or not. Do not do it flippantly, really think about it. If you do decide to get tested, I would suggest doing it anonymously so your doctors and insurance companies have no knowledge. Who knows what can happen if that information is leaked, even accidentally, to an employer or third party who you do not wish to find out. Also may have to think of long term care and you do not want an insane policy bc of your diagnosis, or even your possible diagnosis. Lots to think about. \n\nJust because your dad is 61 and may be a-symptomatic, does not rule out the chance that he could have it. He could have it but the symptoms may show later in life.\n\nThere is plenty of support groups out there too, for symptomatic and a-symptomatic people. See if there are any local groups near you or online communities. Not safe at all, get tested! Why is it not safe when everything I read people develop symptoms in there 30-40s... I am not being defensive but just trying to understand the disease Anyone can do the testing, a lab your main doc.  Only go to a neurologist if you know you have got it, they are there for other things at that point. I just found out I have a bio dad and now this The average is not the whole, that is why. This thing can be all over the place, and are you really wanting to play a guessing game with that? No, I do not think so - it is more likely you are looking for reasons to not go in and find out for sure because it is not so g\\*\\*damned scary but your owe your family more than that. Get a read on how your newly found bio dad is reacting, perhaps he may be willing to get tested and if so you may not need that testing after all. I had genetic testing done when I was pregnant with my son. Does anyone know if that involves looking for Huntington\u2019s? It does not. You have to see a specialist for Huntington\u2019s. I think they would have had to specifically test for it, it is kind of rare to be included in a general test I think. My mom was delayed onset. We all figured we were safe when she hit her mid 60s. She was diagnosed at 67.\n\nI also recommend a genetic counselor. I am sorry you have had this abrupt revelation. I am really sorry you are going through this, it is such a nightmare of what-ifs and second guessing.\n\nThere is two scenarios where your dad could have the HD gene, and while neither are very likely they are not impossible either. \n\nAs others have mentioned, your Dad could have delayed onset and just not be showing symptoms yet. He could also have inherited the gene with a CAG repeat count in what is known as the grey area (between 36 and 39) in which case he may never have symptoms but can pass it on to you. The higher the CAG count his mother had the less likely these scenarios are, but really the only way to know for certain is if either you or he get tested.", "No study for me today ", "Mouse Evidence from Johns Hopkins: Amino acid cysteine combats Huntington's disease ", "Innovation to counteract tremors when trying to write in Parkinson's ", "Huntington Genetic testing in NZ Hi - does anyone here know how the genetic testing process is done within NZ?

Huntingtons is ugly and it is heartbreaking, you need to support yourself through this a lot. \"No greater love has anyone than this, that they lay down their life for their friend.\" Your situation is very different from the original context, yet I think much of the message is the same. The fact that you are even considering supporting your friend in this way is incredible.\n\nTherapist, yes. Support group if an option, yes. Is your husband fully on board? \n\nThis will need to be an intensely collaborative effort and your marriage will be tested. Maybe plan on couple's therapy to help you both work through the changes ahead of you.\n\nI think of this kind of like having children. You may know 100% that it is something you want to do, yet there is no way to fully appreciate the decision until you have lived through it. It can be an amazingly beautiful experience even with all of the challenges.\n\nDo you have any  clergy in your life? That could be a good resource.\n\nBeyond connecting with a support group, therapist, your husband, I recommend a couple other things.\n* If it is a concern where you live, talk with your friend about him designating you and your husband as people officially permitted to know all the details of his care and condition. It will remove some of the logistical barriers as his condition progresses.\n* Work out a plan with your friend. Has he been through this with other family members? He may have specific thoughts on how to do things differently. He is probably also very afraid.\n* See if your friend is up for you joining him in at least one appointment with his doctor so they have a chance to meet you. If this works out as planned, everyoje will benefit from knowing each other before your friend really starts to decline. This is the best advice. Mind if I ask what symptoms you feel you show at all. I am in my 20s and concerned. Have you been tested? If it is something you are currently going through or considering doing, I highly recommend establishing a strong support network with an experienced psychologist and friends/family.

I have not gone to my appointments yet, but where I am at (an HD Center of excellence) my appointment with the genetic counselor is July 19 and we go back for results 2 weeks later, Aug 2nd. It took about a month from the original referral to being able to schedule an appointment, but I think that will depend on how busy your center/clinic is. Hi there! There are several HDSA Centers of Excellence in New England that you can go to for testing. Please feel free to message me if you would like to chat about experiences with a few of them (my parent got tested at one Boston hospital and I decided to go to another for my genetic counseling process) I highly highly recommend using an HD Center of Excellence. I went to one in Chicago and my first appointment was in October and I got my result at the end of January. Side note: we pushed my results back a few weeks so I could get my life insurance in order. So I would say a couple months for full process. I started my process in October. Because of covid everything was over zoom and only my blood drawn and results were in person. My first appointment with genetics was to discuss my family history, and they them referred me to a genetic counselor. Two weeks later I did a 2 hour session with the counselor and my husband to discuss more family history, the testing process and if I was mentally ready for my results. Got my blood drawn beginning of December and my results 10 days later. Then another follow up with the counselor a month later to discuss how I am processing my results. \nAll in all, it is not as long of a process as I thought it would be!

Has anyone heard of CK2 target drugs?", "Just waiting Hey guys,\n\nI have had a story similar to a lot of the stories I have read on here regarding HD and watching it affect my family. I am currently sitting here between getting my blood drawn and waiting on the results and my mind has really been fixating on things like life, death, legacy, dependence, meaning, and the concept of self. I tried googling some good books to read that highlight the subject in a meaningful way, but so often these books center on either aging (getting old) or \"fighting\" a disease. While positive, these things do not feel as applicable to HD to me. Any good book recommendations that have helped you, or someone you know, and that you would recommend for someone who is currently experiencing the disease in family members and waiting on their own results? Inside the O'Brien's\n\nThe family deals with learning about it and deciding to test or not and getting results. Steven Beatty has a great book that sort of helps gene positive people navigate the waters of life with a positive diagnosis. I know you do not have your results yet but I really wish I had read it before getting my positive result. It was really hopeful and even kind of funny and also very informational for gene positive status people. \n\nMore books that I have read that I really enjoyed are Can You Help Me by Thomas Bird And Inside the O\u2019Briens by Lisa Genova. \n\nI have not actually finished Can You Help Me yet but it is written by a neurologist who has decades of experience working with Huntington\u2019s disease patients and it is just really informational because HD is a disease that affects everybody differently so it is really just kind of an educational read. \n\nInside the O\u2019Briens is a novel about a family with Huntington\u2019s and it was a really great read that kind of touches on some of the topics that you talked about and also many of the struggles that people with Huntington\u2019s in  their family deal with. \n\nThat time period between having your blood drawn and finding out your results is so difficult.

Not really the same idea as others, but I enjoy reading about the state of the art clinical trials.  Huntington\u2019s is a fairly simple disease from a genetic perspective, so current HD clinical trials are easier for me to understand than some more complex diseases. As someone also waiting for the final meeting, it is somewhat comforting and interesting to read the research. Dancing with Elephants by Jarem Sawatsky was the only book I found that I enjoyed. It reads more like a collection of short stories but I found it to be positive without being too \u201cjust live life to the fullest\u201d condescending. \n\nSide note, please reach out if you are looking for someone to talk to.

Well I got a double OOF. My counters are 43/32 which means not only did I get HD from my Mom but I also got a mid range number from my Dad. Which puts my kids at a bigger potential risk of passing HD down to their children. \n\nHonestly, I love my children so much. But I feel immense guilt.  Thank you so much for the update. I had you in my thoughts. I had not even considered both numbers to be elevated as a possibility. I know that is not the news you were hoping for, but knowledge is power and you are prepared. You can handle this. I do not have kids and I have no idea how that must feel for you. I am so sorry and this is so cliche thing for me to say as a stranger on the internet but if you need someone to talk to please message me.  Yeah I was not expecting the second  number to be elevated.  What does that mean in terms of the disease?\n\nIt is sounds like you are doing well. Stay the course. You got this. :) It will not make it any different for me or make my kids risk any higher. But because they are Male if they inherited the \"silent\" gene from me/my Dad then that gene could *possibly-risk level unknown/understudied* still manifest into Huntingtons for their children. About 3% of the population unknowingly carry a CAG repeat of 27-35 which is the \"silent\" HD gene meaning it can mutate over time to be a higher count, and thus HD.  Just checking in, how are you doing? Mostly okay. I mean dark thoughts about- \"What if the treatments do not work\" , \"What if my insurance does not cover the treatments?\" , \"What if we have some sort of global apocalypse and I am left to get sick?!\", \"What if the government changes and Canada becomes like the states?\" Etc. Etc. \n\nAll logical things but also sort of pessimistic. \n\nAlso doing more symptom searching than usual but that is to be expected. \n\nI went back to work yesterday and that was great..it reminded me I kick butt at my job and I am still in control of my mind, feelings and body. \n\nAnd I just keep reminding myself that although not fully accurate I have a lower HD postive CAG.  Also saw you like MTG, noice.  I am glad to hear that you are handling it alright. I know HD is hard. My ex actually has it, and that is what pulled me into this community. Feel free to reach out if you ever need to, okay? Thanks, I think I am pretty lucky on the home front. \n\nI have an Aunt with the same CAG as me and she is still going strong with minimal symptoms at 50. And my husband is awesome. My co-workers are all amazing, I have some really good close friends who all work in human-service fields and my MIL is a PSW and also very supportive. So I show them all a brave face and when I am feeling vulnerable they remind me how kick ass I really am. \n\nI am also really hoping if I do ever get \"sick sick\" I will just be one of those happy HD people, like my Grandma was. Hopefully keeping a positive attitude pushes me in that direction.

Does anyone know where I could get this done? I live in Quebec, Canada, but travelling for the test is no problem.", "Genetic Test When you request a generic test, is there a specific one for HD or is there a generic test where you can find out other info as well? It is a specific one just for HD. Not only is it specific, it is looking for more than markers like the generic tests.  In the HD tests they isolate the gene, sequence it enough to count the repeats. Look into this in depth before being tested. Weigh all options. Do not take the test lightly without thinking about the consequences. Is there a link in this subreddit that talks about all the risks? The only major one I am aware of is that future employers may be able to access the results or be able to fire you later down the line if they found out you lied about it- what other risks are there? (besides emotional response) I am only 19 yrs old and have to decide on my career pretty soon based off the results which is why I was asking Ever hear of the saying ignorance is bliss? If you get tested and you find out you have it, it will be devastating and I do not think you are mature enough to handle the results. Maybe mature is the wrong word, but I do not think you would understand the gravity of the diagnosis. Right now you are living as if you do not have it and you can always tell yourself you do not have it. If you find out you do have it, you may find yourself looking for things that are signs of the impending disease. It could really mess with your mind. I think you should think about this more before you test. Read through the sub and message people. They will answer and be happy to discuss. My thing is that I am currently studying to become a doctor &amp; medicine is a long path and tuition is extremely expensive. I do not want to go down this route if I know my diagnosis is positive if that makes sense? I also think it would be selfish if I was a healthcare provider with an illness of my own. I want to know ASAP so I can figure out what to do with my life that will not be an expensive decision. Why would that be selfish? I have never come across the opinion that doctors should be in perfect health, especially if they had an issue that was out of their control.", "Huntingtons and infidelity I need advice.  My wife and I are married for almost 10 years, she found out she has huntingtons about 5 years ago and has been declining.  We have children.  She is fully disabled and does not work.  I work a full time job plus uber to make up for her income, as well as cook and clean, and generally handle the kid related things.  She can do those things still, but tires and is clumsy from chorea so i try to do as much as i can.  I really do love her and have bent over backwards to try to keep her happy.\n\nRecently, i discovered she was talking to another man on IG (popped up on her phone notifications and i happened to see it when it did).  Long story short, i know she is making plans to meet up with this person.  We have had problems in the past with infedelity on her side, but its been years, and i really cant keep letting it go every time.  I know huntingtons can cause hyper sexuality as well as problems with decision making, but i am still person with real feelings and im torn apart by this.  She doesnt know that I know yet, but i dont know how to confront it.  If I say something, she will get extremely defensive and then angry, and very likely leave or at least threaten to.  I dont want to lose my marriage, or my family, or time with my children.  I love them all so much and it will devastate me not to wake up every day to see all of them.\n\nFrom a huntingtons standpoint, I want to blame the disease, and i dont want to lose everything i have, and i dont want to lose my wife, but at the same my mental health cant keep taking a beating like this.    Is infedelity normal with huntingtons, and how do you as a spouse and care giver, who promised thru thickness and health, handle it.  Im lost and need advice unique to huntingtons because relationships with huntingtons are anything but normal.\n\nIf this isnt allowed, let me know and ill delete the post. That sounds awful. Be careful asking here. You are a person with needs and you are allowed to draw a boundary for your own well being. That said, there is so much going on here. Can you get some advice from a professional with some experience in managing relationships and neurological conditions? Huntington's of course can affect a person's behaviour but is not an excuse for a sufferer treating others badly. \n\nPersonally, I would not let a person with Huntington's use it as an excuse for their behaviour, even tho of course it plays a part.\n\nYou sound like you are doing your best for your family so do not deserve this. I think you should definitely confront her about it. You say you dont want to lose your marriage, understandably, but you cannot let her treat you like this. \n\nJust remember whatever happens, you have not the one in the wrong I have Huntington's. My question is this: If she tires and cannot do home, kids or work stuff - how can she date? My husband was killed in a car wreck in 2009 and I cannot fathom dating with Huntington's. I am in decline - albeit more slowly and attenuated through healthy lifestyle, balance exercises, chair yoga, certain supplements and a fabulous osteopath and neuropsych. \n\nConfronting her is unlikely to deter the behavior. So either accept it as who she is now or make an affirmative decision to leave. There is not much else you can do.  This has more wisdom than I do. You are fighting two biologies and brains here, yours and hers. Good luck on your journey. \n\nShe has lost some but not all her decision making power. You can probably still get some limits and boundaries put on things (always a condom for instance). It is a phase that will not last. And feel free to reach out the other guy, go ahead and be sneaky, put a mimic/mirror on her phone, get sophisticated and complicated; tell him to back off and respect the situation. Wow. Okay.\n\nAll I can say is that my boyfriend's dad never said an unkind word to his son until the day he died, and he never cheated nor attempted to. Based on that sole anecdotal experience of just one person, what you are dealing with sounds like a selfish person. \n\nBut for real, talk to a professional who specializes in HD, because relying on the non-professional kneejerk opinions of Redditors is a bad bad bad way to make life decisions.  I am sorry you are having to go through this, sounds like you are giving a lot of support etc.. best advise I can give is see a counselor even if you have seen one in the past as our marriage counselor told us we would be back at some point in our marriage and we were and it is saved our marriage! What does it mean to be in decline? Can you provide some examples and tell me more about your rate of progression? It means you go from being asymptomatic with just the diagnosis to pre-symptomatic to actually symptomatic with the chorea, cognitive decline and other issues. I am symptomatic but it is currently mostly attenuated FOR NOW. Oh my gosh. I am so sorry.  Truly, I am.\u2764\ufe0f My dad and aunt died from HD, and I am gene positive as well. I have got a cousin who is symptomatic. Unfortunately I have been in this community for a very long time. \nWith that being said, I have never seen or heard of Huntington\u2019s causing hypersexuality. That is not to say it is impossible, but. It can certainy cause impulsivity problems, I understand that. But cheating on your husband who is taking care of you\u2026 that is not something you should excuse just because she is sick. \nI wish you and her the best. I hope you guys find a way to have a healthy marriage through such a horrible disease. Maybe counseling will help her through whatever reasoning she has for cheating.", "My husband was diagnosed on Friday. My husband was diagnosed with Huntington\u2019s on Friday. We found out his mom has it earlier this year (two weeks before our daughter was born). He is the 6th person in his family to be diagnosed with it. He is lost four family members to it. It is been a rough time for us. I know he is active in this group and will see this.\n\nI would love it if you could leave a message of encouragement for him on this post. I think it would be a great surprise for him. Please share any phrase, stat, or message of hope to help lift his spirits.\n\nThank you! Love you all. Is he actually diagnosed and symptomatic with it or is he a carrier?  He was told he is gene positive on Friday. I apologize if what I said was confusing. I am still learning all the terminology. CAG of 43, the same as his mom. Not systematic currently. The genetic counselor said it is hard to determine his age of onset because everyone in his family was diagnosed in their 30s (he is in his 30s) with the exception of his mom, who is 57. \n\nSo now we wait. \n\nWe are currently caretakers for his mom and it is hard knowing what she is going through may happen to him. Any encouragement for him would be appreciated. Very sorry to hear about your gene positive diagnosis. I was recently gene tested for a similar illness and have yet to feel strong enough to go get my results. \n\nAll we can do is continue to live our lives and try to appreciate each day we have. Use this time to do the things you are passionate about, spend time with your loved ones, travel. You will be in my thoughts. I am sorry. The best news is that his path is more likely to follow his mom's then other family members, since that is who he got it from. \n\nNumber of cag repeats is also a good general indicator, although not a crystal ball. Really high repeats get child onset, the worst and fastest version. Less than 40 and you may live long enough to die of something else first. (Sorry if this sounds horrible, one of my coping strategies is a bit of a dark humor some people find disturbing.)\n\nI have 42. I got if from my dad, but mom's a bitch while the family is in reproduction mode and will not share dad's numbers, so I do not know if I am worse or not. (She seemed to think that would influence my sister in law to have an HD + baby. It did not. She also thinks it will prevent me and my hubs from doing IVF and screen out hd + embryos. I will not.) If you never feel strongly enough to get the results that is ok too. It is a terrifying place to be. Knowledge is power for me, but maybe darkness is your safety net. Sorry to hear about your experience. It is unfortunate that your mom is making things harder than they need to be. Why does she seem to think it will keep you from doing IVF? I would completely understand if you choose not to get your results. It is completely changed our lives. However, we were already living like he had it, but we still had a tiny amount of hope, which is now gone.\n\nDo not beat yourself up over it. Ignorance can be bliss sometimes. What a great time to be alive, we are finely getting real drugs that can treat this curse. A shot in the spine every month is a small price to pay for keeping your nervous system. In the mean time eat healthy, exercise and keep cool. This is perfect. Exactly what he needs to see. Thank you! hey, i am really sorry about the diagnosis. it is dreadful to learn something you were hoping to avoid, but as other commenters have said, medicine is changing all the time. bit of advice from a daughter? talk to her. explain what it is, and do not shy away from the topic. she needs to be able to talk to you, which is something i never had. keep your head held high and remember- you have hd, hd does not have you x This is beautiful. Thank you. \n\nAlso, sorry about what you went through with your dad. That would be really hard. it is better now he lives in a care home- the conversation had to come up about whether i was too young to look after him. i know i am young but i have a lot of experience with hd. please get in touch if you need anything Hey!! Chin up and welcome to one of the worst clubs on the planet. But seriously, both of you need to take the best care of each other you can. You can help him if you are well. Make sure you have support networks and outlets for when times are hard. Start setting things in place now. And for God's sake talk about it. Be open and candid. Conversation doesnt have to be sad and morbid. Talk about how to tackle things and get through this shit together. \u2665\ufe0f It is so hard to have hope during trying times like this. I am so happy you have found this community. On really bad days with my mom I will post in here and knowing I am not alone makes the burden a little lighter, at least for a while. Others have said this but the advances in medicine are astounding and I hope that drug advances continue to be made. My mom\u2019s diagnosis inspired me to become a doctor and I started medical school this summer. We love you, we support you, we are here for you! I have also been living as though I am positive. I figure if I have a 50% chance to not live with this anxiety/depression, I need to take that shot. I just want to do some more therapy before I go to get the results though. I am sorry you both are having to deal with this. I do not know what goes through her mind. All I know is when it comes up she insists that a baby with HD is still lovable and I am like... That was never the issue or question. How does this work? Is it still in trials or is this available to all? There are three different ways for the three drugs, in a broad description, they use a type of virus that grabs a certain genetic code and kills that cell. One kills just the mutant RNA tied to the mutant protein.  In phase 2 trials. See HDbuzz. I was mistaken, here is some updated info.\n\n\n CHDI Foundation, the largest nonprofit effort aimed at developing Huntington\u2019s disease therapies, has expanded its efforts and partnerships to accelerate the defeat of the deadly disorder. That is the message transmitted in a recent extensive interview by Dr. Robert Pacifici, CHDI's chief scientific officer. CHDI continues to spend $100 million annually, and its staff has doubled to 100 in the past ten years. \"On any given day, there are about 700 other people who are supported by CHDI that are working on various aspects of the drug discovery and development pipeline that we try and orchestrate and integrate and enable,\" Dr. Pacifici told me. CHDI has partnered with firms like Ionis Pharmaceuticals, the developer of RG-6042, a gene-silencing drug now in a historic Phase 3 clinical trial run by Roche. However, CHDI is also looking at alternatives to gene-silencing made possible by dramatic scientific discoveries. A major example involves so-called modifier genes, that is, genes other than the huntingtin gene that delay or speed HD onset - perhaps by decades! \"Imagine if we had a drug that could delay onset of motor symptoms by 40 years!\" Dr. Pacifici exclaimed. \"My gosh, that would be fantastic. Nature's kind of done that experiment for us.\" Read more in my latest blog article:  Thank you so much for sharing this!!", "So, I May Have Huntington's and I am Freaking Out I appologoze in advance for formatting and spelling. Im on mobile plus my hands are acting up so typing is a little hard.\n\nSo, yesterday I was driving to my job to pick up my new schedule. When I saw it, it was really shitty hours, but nothing too horrible. I got madder than I have been in a while. I drove like a maniac and then eventually had to pull over and calm down. This is... very out of character for me. I have always had a bit of a temper, but this felt... random and out of my control.\nDuring this, my hands were twitching horriblely. They have been now for about a month, with varying degrees of severity. Normally it is just my fingers, but sometimes it is my whole hand or arm. \nAlso, for about a year now I have noticed a steady decline in my ability to think quickly. I am becoming overwhelmed easily, and am losing the words for things. I lose items constantly, forget about things, and my organization skills have taken a hit too. I also sometimes kind of, well, fall over for no reason. As if I am dizzy or something. \nI was recently diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia, so I was under the impression that this clumsiness was my blood sugar, but it is becoming more frequent even when I take care of myself. \nI am VERY scared this could be Huntington's. I do have a an incredibly small family history of it (my great grandmother on my mother's side had it) so I know there is a possibility.\nI have always been so quick, and so smart. I am so scared of losing myself. I also have a fiance, and we are just about to get married. She knows this is a possibility, and does not want to leave me, but I am still so scared of putting her through this.\nI also do not have money for a doctor. My father is a doctor, but I am his little boy. He will avoid the subject, and deny it. My mother will flip out and worry more than I am, so needless to say I do not want to tell my parents unless I know for certain. \n\nMy question I guess is, to those suffering from Huntington's, does this sound like the beginning?\n\nIf so, I will save up money, get insurance, and see a doc.\n\nThank you for you are time, and I apologize if it is a little all over the place I am a little scatterbrained right now. If your mother does not have this your chances of having this are about the same as someone having it spontaneously in the general population.  Teeny tiny.    \n\nIf you do not know if your grandmother and mother had this, then no one can tell you if you have this or not until you take that test.    \n\nThis is kind of (    \n\nIf you are curious, go to  ( and scroll down for the easy-to-understand diagrams.  If you feel like you might have it, then decide if you need the test.  You can contact the HDSA for assistance, or find your local HDSA social worker on the website and get in touch.

Hi, my wife 47 yr got it from her father who started became disabled by it at about 70 yr. She has a 37 CAG and that low  level can be odd. Perhaps your mom did lots of great things like exercise, or she got lucky and has not shown symptoms yet. \n\n( has helped her a lot. If anxiety gets strong crises lines like Fox Valley 630-966-9393 or one local are great at talking people down from anxiety attacks.  You should probably get tested. There are places like UCLA where I believe they will test you for free. I would look into that.  (  says 1-3% of people with HD have no family history identified. Hope you get some answers, OP.\n", "Boyfriend might have HD but does not want to get tested, at least for now My 27 year old boyfriend told me a few months ago that his mom has HD. He and his two brothers have not been tested. One of his brothers even has a kid and has not told the kid's mom about the potential of him or their kid having HD. Apparently, my boyfriend only found out about his mom's diagnosis as a teenager when he found some of his mom's medical info laying around. I guess she is confirmed it since then but will not discuss it with him. We have gotten to the point where he and I can discuss the positives and negatives of being tested, and he has started going to therapy. My problem is that I really desperately want him to get tested. The not knowing absolutely kills me and makes it feel really hard to plan our future. I try to keep my opinion in check because it is his choice, but he is asked and I have told him that I would like to know. When I do this, he gets very fearful that I will leave him if he tests positive. I have told him many times that I would not leave and that I would only want to know to be able to plan better (kids, finances, etc) but I can tell a part of him does not believe me. He says that he cannot imagine being tested in the next year. He and I are both career changers applying to medical school this year, and I am scared about the unknowns of him taking out all of the loans for med school etc. without having a real idea of what the future looks like. I know better than to bring this up a lot with him because I cannot even imagine the burden on him, but does anyone have advice?  It honestly sounds like you are doing the best you can in a tough situation. I support you being honest with him about your need to be able to plan for the future, that is a legitimate need. I applaud you reassuring your BF that you are not going anywhere regardless of the results too. Having a possible HD diagnosis is going to make him incredibly anxious, it is not an easy decision to make. You can simultaneously recognize that it is solely his decision to make, but continue to be honest about your own needs at the same time. I am sorry that I have little more than a validation to offer you, hopefully someone else will chime in with more substantial advice. My only thought would be to offer to join him for a therapy session if that would be helpful to him. He may not want you to or not be ready for that, but it is another way to show that you are there to support him and be there for him come what may. Good luck to you both. Hey there! I am 27 almost 28. I am at risk for HD and I am getting tested on October 15th. My main motivations are that I have two children, I may want to go back to school if I am negative, I want to plan better financially (I just got life insurance and critical care insurance) and I also want to be the first on the list for new medications as they come to trial. \n\nI think knowing is important, especially when planning a career and future. A lot of people also do not want to know though. I do wish a bit that I had not of had children. But I think if I had not of had them I would not know what it is to love them so much I wish I hadnt. For me, KNOWING one way or the other was far better than NOT knowing. Even when I came back positive, I feel like if I had not been tested my mental state would have been worse.\n\nThat said, my wife was on the fence as to whether or not SHE wanted to know. I dont mean that in a bad way, she was just afraid of a positive (yes) diagnosis. She thought that as long as she did not know, there was a chance everything would be ok. But a definite positive (yes) result would take away that hope.\n\nIn the end, she was glad I told her. She (and I) were not thrilled with the positive result, but it was better than not knowing. My husband has known for a long time that he has a 50% chance of inheriting HD (he told me when we started dating 12 years ago). When we first met, he did not want to get tested, and I thought it was crazy, that the not knowing was so much worse. Fast forward to yesterday when we had the first appointment to start the testing process, and it is so much worse than I imagined. He is doing the testing because he came to that decision on his own, and I support his choice no matter what, but honestly it is killing me to go through this. So be careful what you wish for. Just be supportive and let him decide to do it if and when he is ready.  There are two real issues here: adequately planning for the future, and getting tested. Getting tested makes it more straightforward to plan for the future (and can ultimately be cheaper, depending), but it is by no means impossible. \n\nMy dad had HD. He refused to admit it or deal with it for a long time, and so did not have plans in place. Then my mom got sick and was diagnosed with early-onset dementia. I was 20, and I had two younger brothers. With two parents with dementia, taking care of everything fell on me. My parents did not have wills, did not have medical proxies or medical directives, did not have long term care insurance, had a big house with no bedrooms or bathrooms on the first floor, etc. I bring up my situation only to point out that you have no idea what life will bring, and that the only responsible thing to do is to plan. I think everyone should have wills and contingency plans, and if you know you are at risk for something, it is even more pressing.\n\nSo, I think it is completely reasonable - necessary, even- to sit your boyfriend down and tell him your concerns. It is his choice to get tested, but that you need to speak to people about your planning options. For instance, I have heard that residents can take out special doctor disability insurance so that if something happens, they can still pay back their loans. Your boyfriend should look into that. He should look at long-term care insurance. He should consider what he will do if he becomes symptomatic as a doctor- maybe he needs to start getting neuropsych testing done every few years to make sure he is safe to take care of patients. You should discuss whether you would want kids, and if so, maybe you need to start saving up for blinded IVF (that way they make sure the kids do not have HD, but they do not tell you his HD status). He should get wills, medical proxies, medical directives, the whole deal. Financial planning is also probably helpful. If you are in the US, a good place to start is your nearest HD Center of Excellence through the HDSA- I think most are staffed with a social worker who is experienced with stuff like this, and can walk you through it or help you find resources. \n\nIt always feels like you have more time, but things can quickly become too late, and you can end up leaving your loved ones with an incredible burden. And as an aside, I hope your boyfriend's brother reconsiders his course of action immediately. He is taking away the ability of other people to make important health decisions for themselves, and while I understand it is a hard situation, his decision is a selfish one. It is not just about him. My dad's decisions to ignore his disease made my and my brother's adolescence and early adulthood living nightmares.  Hey- thanks for your answer. I know it was a while ago but I felt too overwhelmed at the time to reply. Just want you to know that I think about your advice regularly and really appreciate it.  Hey- you are very welcome. I understand. This is all so much. Thank you so much for taking the time to reply and let me know. I am glad it was helpful, and that it continues to be. I so hope that you and your boyfriend are doing well, and that you have a lovely holiday season. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you ever want to talk or have any questions. ", "How long did it take to conceive with nondisclosure ivf with pgd Curious about the time it takes to have success with nondisclosure ivf/pgd if there are no fertility issues. How many rounds and what was the total length of time?  I just did this last year. Our embryos (amount unknown though the doctor implied there was more than one) are currently being stored. We plan to implant next year. That part of the process took several months.\n\nI have a friend who just did this for the same exact reasons and it took her two rounds total to get pregnant. So for her I think it took 1-2 years. I did not do nondisclosure, but did do IVF with PGD with no fertility issues. It only took one round of retrieval-fertilization-testing (the expensive part, lol) but I did need two transfers (first good embryo did not stick, but second was a success/healthy birth). Took about a year to get pregnant. Good luck to you! One round. 5 embryos that went through PGD and got the green light. Transferred 3 of them. Have two great kids. From egg retrieval to first positive pregnancy test was 6 months can someone educate me about what nondisclosure means in this context? I am curious about this whole process. Nondisclosure means the parent that has the potential to have huntingtons does not want to know their status and wants to make sure the implanted embryo does not have huntingtons. The parent does not get tested themselves (other family members are involved), the parents usually do not know how many eggs were retrieved, how many embryos are viable, etc. Interesting. I had no idea that you could do the egg retrieval and test embryos then wait for implantation. Thanks for the additional insights. Thanks for the information! Very helpful Congratulations! Thanks for the input Absolutely you can! They test for ones that are gene negative and keep those for when we are ready. This is probably a dumb question--but are the two kids twins, or did you use the same retrieval for multiple pregnancies? Not twins. One retrieval. One failed frozen embryo transfer. Two successful frozen embryo transfers and pregnancies. I actually did know how many eggs were retrieved and embryos were made and those things. The embryos with the Huntington gene that was from my dad (HD positive) were labeled \u2018possibly affected\u2019 and not used. \n\nMy dad has two copies of the Huntington gene. One is HD+, the other is normal. I do not know which of these I got from him. Half of my eggs would have the Huntington gene I inherited from my dad. The other half get the Huntington gene I inherited from my mom - which is definitely not HD+. The PGD reveals which embryos inherited my Huntington gene from my dad vs my mom. So if I do not have HD, meaning I got the normal Huntington gene from my dad then I might have just thrown out embryos with normal Huntington genes and wasted my time and money. But, if I did inherit HD from my dad then I can be sure my embryos did not because they got the Huntington gene that I got from my mom.

My husband and I are talking about having children so I have decided to get tested. My appointment is January 30th. I had the neurological test back in May and had no symptoms. I just thought this would be a good place to post for support as I am extremely nervous about all this... any advice? My wife tested positive last April.  She is not symptomatic but we would like to have kids and we wanted to make sure we did not pass HD on.  We initially put the test off for a few years but once we hit our mid 30s decided that if we wanted to have kids now was the time.  We are currently going through the process of IVF/PGD.  This will be our second try and hopefully we are successful.  My advice would be that though a negative test would be wonderful, a positive test is not the end.  You can still have children if you want to and you can ensure they will not have HD themselves. If you ultimately decide that you do not want kids, you and your husband can still pursue a great life.  Before I got pregnant I got tested for Huntington\u2019s.

Is it a guarantee your kid will not carry the gene? They have not explained the process much to me. I had Neuro test already. Did you meet with a psychiatrist and the genetic counselor?

They asked I bring someone not related to me to the appointments. They explained how the genetics work and What my chances were of having it. I found it quite interesting to be honest. \n\nMy grandma, two aunts, and a few cousins had Huntington\u2019s. My dad refused to ever get tested so I decided to before I had kids. I am glad I got tested though those two weeks waiting was difficult.  Why someone not related to you? I am planning on bringing my husband... I brought my husband too. I meant someone who is not at risk of Huntington\u2019s. Like a brother.   Yes it is  I tested positive a couple of years ago. Over the past two years I have been involved with the HD community and I follow all the HD news and studies. There is a great deal of how that an effective treatment for the disease is right on the horizon. I am 43 years old and even I feel hope for myself! \n\nTesting positive was the worst experience of my life, I am not going to lie. But once I started educating myself about the disease and what is going on in the science, I do not feel so much like I am a walking time bomb.  I follow the research pretty closely and every time there is news of a new treatment I become more hopeful. I hope that there is a cure soon! The lab we worked with (Reprogenetics, in USA) tells you that there is a greater than 90 percent certainty that the child will not carry the affected gene.  They do a bio marker map using saliva samples of you, your partner, and the biological parents (if possible) of the person who is positive so the test is designed specifically for you for accuracy. My wife and I have adopted a daughter, and while the adoption was in process we found out her birth mother has HD.  The mother was diagnosed after we took our daughter home, but before adoption was finalized.\n\nWe cried a bit and stressed for a while.  But we have come to the conclusion that, regardless of whether our daughter has it or not, we have no guarantees in life.  We will encourage her and love her, and I believe having this challenge will make her a better person.\n\nYes, it will suck for her to see her birth mom slowly succumb (barring medical breakthroughs).  It will hurt for all of us.  But I think it will give our daughter an appreciation for life and a drive to take nothing for granted.\n\nSo my little bit of advice is to remember that your life is not defined by what happens to you, but by how you respond to it.", "AHL hockey player Jake Dowell talks about HD, family, and testing ", "Questions about heritability? Is it better to know you have it or not? I am sorry if this is a stupid question but I cannot find a clear answer online. My grandma had huntingtons and so did her mom and siblings. My mom is mid 50s and has not been tested. She does not have physical symptoms yet but has mental illness and I have noticed her memory is bad. I wanted to know, if someone is a carrier of the gene is it guaranteed they will have symptoms? Could my mom be a carrier and pass it on to her kids without having symptoms? She does not want to get tested. I know 10% of people do not get symptoms until after 60 so she could have it. I have bipolar disorder and so did my grandma and her mom and possibly my mom but she has not been diagnosed. My great grandma killed herself and it concerns me that my mental health issues seem to be getting worse each year and I am only 19. I am thinking about getting tested and trying preventative treatments but I do not know if it would be worth it to know, maybe I should just not think about it? Anyone in a similar position think it is better to know or not know? This is a difficult situation, and I am sorry that you are going through this. There are some similarities in our lives. I apologise as I do not have a clear answer for you, but I am a little older (27) and your post reminds me of the way I felt about my circumstances at 19.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a great therapist or support network where you can clear your thoughts and make helpful choices that can steer your life in a more positive direction. Like posting in supportive forums! If you cannot afford a therapist, do you have cheaper or free alternatives where you live? &gt;Is it better to know you have it or not?\n\nPersonally I would say yes. You have the potential to affect others strongly with your actions. Hey, there is nothing I can say to help make your decision because that is only something you can do by unravelling your thoughts perhaps with a therapist and offer a shoulder if you ever want to talk to me about it (m, 22, untested too! :))\n\nWhat I can tell you is that it is not a \u201ca carriable disease\u201d. Its called autosomal dominance inheritance if you heard of it in school/college. It basically means you have a 50-50 chance of getting the Huntington\u2019s gene from an affected parent due to its dominant nature. So if your mother/father is negative then there is no way you have it (because it is dominant and not recessive) The odds are 1 to millions you can get it if your parents are unaffected and that is due to random mutation which everyone is capable of having. :) if you have the Huntington gene then it is almost guaranteed you will show symptoms at some stage in your life, usually mid age. There is a correlation with a chemical sequence (CAG) and the severity but it is not completely accepted yet. I hope this helped I would recommend speaking to a genetic counselor about this. \n\nI can tell you that my MIL has it and hers looks SO different than her mom and sister. My MIL has mainly cognitive issues and still lives on her own at 59. However, her mom and sister only had physical symptoms and passed away before the age of 50. It can just look so different I am each person. \n\nDo you know what your grandma and great aunts CAG number is? That number will help determine the average age of onset. For example, my MIL has a CAG of 43. This means she likely started showing symptoms in her 40s. The lower the number, the better. \n\nGood luck I do not know what her number was but I know she was able to raise my mom without physical symptoms although she had a lot of mental issues and never seemed normal according to my mom Oh okay, thank you! I do not plan on having kids tho I think I can afford a therapist. I do not have a lot of friends and family so I probably need the support. I am 18, I got tested a few months ago and found out I would develop Huntingtons, my CAG repeat was 48. I have had a long history of depression and anxiety throughout the years before I got tested. Honestly I am happy I know, I can plan out my life accordingly and really try make the most of it. I will warm you though of course it is tough, it takes a while to fully sink in and I am not sure I will ever truly process it, you have got to expect the lows that come with knowing something like that. On the flip side, you might get a better result than myself and be worry free for life. Personally, I think it is worth getting tested but honestly it all comes down to you in the end. If you have any further questions just lemme know and I really do hope everything goes well for you, no matter what you choose :)", "'Huntington's disease will not stop me having a baby' ", "I am beginning the process for genetic testing Hi everyone, thought this would be a good place to maybe find some encouragement and positive vibes. Long story as short as I can make it...\n\nI was adopted at 9 months old. At 16 I learned that my bio mom had Huntingtons Disease. Her 3 siblings fortunately did not inherit the gene mutation. \n\nI used to not care and put it off, but my partner's recent 25th bday had me thinking of the future... my own approaching 25th. All of a sudden the reality of my genetics hit me and I decided that I should know what the future holds. I love my partner so much.  We want to have a child in a couple of years but I worry that I will either\n\na) have a child and potentially not be able to raise them and force them to witness my suffering, while leaving my partner to be a single parent and care for me\n\nb) not have a child and get sick and leave him alone (we are best friends and have a great relationship  I know he would move on but the thought of it all is difficult to process)\n\nIt is all alot. Anything from anyone who has been in the same boat as me would be nice to here. Both positive and negative result experience welcome.\n\nXx May the odds be ever in your favor. It really is a lot, both the decision to do it and the commitment to follow through what is inevitably a long process. The process is helpful, but the waiting is like you are stuck in quicksand unable to move forward.\n\nI am going through it right now, and my next appointment is this Thursday. It is a 4 appointment process where I am at, and this will be the 3rd of 4. The appointments have been good so far, informative and helpful for the most part.\n\nThinking about kids really forces you to think about the future and confront the realities of HD. I already had a child when I found out I was at risk, but I want to know my status before deciding on more kids.\n\nYou have made a tough decision to go through testing, but remember that it is equally as likely you are HD negative. There was a good post from someone who had just tested negative a few weeks ago that helps keep things in perspective. \n\nGood luck! Thank you Just know you are not alone\u2014there are others out here who are going through this, too.  Or who have already done it.  Reach out if you want to talk. Thank you for that xx You are not alone. My husband gets his results this Friday. We found out his mom had it two weeks before I gave birth. My daughter is now 3 months old and I hate not knowing what the future holds for my family. \n\nI think you are doing the right thing by getting tested and finding out before you start a family. \n\nBest of luck! Thank you friend. I hope you guys get some good news too. Xx My bf and I are about your age. He got tested 2 years ago and was positive. Knowing is a lot emotionally for BOTH of you. I hope for the best for you but honestly, I regret encouraging him to get tested. I wish we talked about it more but whatever. The world will probably end before it is a problem for us \"The world will probably end before it is a problem for us\" sometimes I feel this way too.\n\nThanks for your response. I hope you two are happy most days and enjoy your life together. this is a really valuable perspective to have thank you for sharing. I think those of us who are struggling with getting tested are so worried about the potential burden on our partners in the future I think that knowing in advance can really help the situation with your partner. My mom had no idea she had it and was starting to become a completely different person and their marriage was over before she found out what was wrong. I think being open honest and prepared is the best thing. Share all your worries and fears and make sure you let your partner know you want to know everything they are feeling about kids and future care stuff. It sucks and it is awkward but this a serious enough topic that it needs to be done. I am 22 and kind of in the same boat so I totally understand. Especially seeing what it did to my parents I want to make sure I am prepared if I test positive", "Predictive testing without genetic counseling? Anyone heard of being able to get predictive testing without all the genetic counseling and related evaluations? I understand some people need it, but for someone who understands the science, and the process and all the consequences, and has spent years considering their choice and the possibilities, there should be a way for me to just go in and get blood drawn and then find out the results. \n\nI find it incredibly frustrating and patronizing that most places do not allow things like that. Im not just going in on a compulsive itch to get tested, its something that I have carefully considered. Why do they have to make it more difficult and expensive, we have to put up with this disease shit our whole lives, at least do not treat us like little infants unable to make a decision.  i understand totally. But it is about the legality. If they dont do it and you kill yourself, they can be held liable. That makes no sense, How is it different from any other major diagnosis then. If I kill myself that is my fucking choice anyway, I hate the goddamned anti-suicide cult that exists around this kind of thing. Its my fucking body, Ill put a bullet through it if I damn well please and that does not necessarily mean Im out of my mind.  Like i said. I understand. I have been through it. Prior to the introduction of the counciling, people did sue when their family member suicided and courts said that the hospital did not do enough to prevent it. He acknowledged that it may not have prevented it.but they have try support as best they can. This is how they do it. I hope you find what you need. Good luck. Where are you from? I am from Victoria, Australia and I have just completed my testing. I only had the one appointment, which was the first time I met with the councillor. Went for about an hour, talked about CAG counts, and what Huntingtons really is and just wanted to make sure I knew what the process was. Had my blood test the same day, and got a call 3-4 weeks later telling me the results were in. Did not need more sessions or anything.  Being able to test for HD pre-symptoms puts them in a really awkward situation.  A lot of other major diagnosis will happen when a patient is already having symptoms that cause them to seek medical help.  That is the primary difference.  It could be 30+ years before someone with HD starts showing symptoms, hence the counseling.   Yes I am sure there is some legal issues there too, but you should know that it is not a death sentence and should not be treated as such.\n\nThat being said, it all depends on where you live.  Some places have these rules for counseling and some do not.  I understand your position but I have see both sides of this play out and I have to say it is the better way.   It would be nice to be able to sign a waiver and get it over with, but the extra time to reflect does not hurt. its complete bs. it frustrates me as well to no end. i am 34 and have been thinking of this decision since i was 18. i dont need 3 separate counseling sessions for this decision. its ridiculous. and i dont want to pay $1200! i am from MD. whe  i was 18 the price was $700. its a friggin blood test. cmon. my wife and i could sign a waiver saying if i kill myself itsy fault. its stupid. my body. my decision. not yours. Yeah it makes sense but it also does not. Because if you are postive then genetic councelling is not going to change anything. And if that financial barrier is stopping people they are missing their chance to get newly developed trial treatments. \n\nMy heart goes out to those who are ill with HD in the US. They need to get on universal healthcare. ", "Just got my blood drawn Hi all! I am 19f, I posted a while ago about my dad refusing to sign the affected family member form. Turns out I did not need him to sign it, and I am just a hair away from getting my results! \n\nI got my blood drawn on Wednesday, but now I am freaking out. I have just assumed this whole time I have it, that way I will not be as disappointed with the positive result. I am realizing I have never considered what if I do not have it? I am scared, I know it does not work like this but I always hoped with a 50/50 chance, either I will have it and my sister will not, or I will not have it and my sister will. My logical brain is saying that we could both have it or both not have it as well, but my emotional brain is already preparing for the guilt that will come with a negative result for me. \n\nI was not anxious about the testing process until I had the needle in my arm taking my blood. I do not know how long I will have to wait for the results. I have had the first 2 appointments already, apparently I still have one more meeting with a geneticist before I can have my results but I do not want to wait! I am so anxious(and excited weirdly) I want to know right now. \n\nHow did you all deal with the wait? It is easy for me to be distracted about it since I have lots of other stuff going on in my life, but late at night I cannot sleep because I think about all the what if\u2019s. Although before the blood test I stayed up worrying about a multitude of other things, before bed is just when I tend to stress about things. \n\nSorry for the rant here, thanks for reading everyone. I hope you find some peace while waiting for your results. So did you get tested before your parent has a confirmed diagnosis? I am in the same boat. No my dad has gotten tested and was positive, he just wanted to stop me from getting tested. I managed to get around the affected family form thankfully. I just recently was tested, here is a little back story.\n\nI am the eldest (36m) and my brother (34m) and sister (31f)\nI was told about my Mums history when I was 20 and for 16 years I wondered if I would have it or not, it created who I am today and the way I look at life.\n\nFor some unknown reason I said no, I am getting tested and did it, and 2 weeks ago was told I am negative.\n\nMy brother refuses to get tested and does not care, and my sister was told positive when she was 24.\n\nThe wait for me was bearable - it just sucked the care out of everything for 4-6 weeks, I just did not give a shit about anyone\u2019s problems, work, my partner, and I will tell you now that is okay! It is your time to be selfish, do not feel bad about that.\nMy way of getting through it was video games and just keeping busy, but the moment I jumped into bed, the shower, etc, it was on my mind.\n\nEventually whilst waiting I got excited, for both negative and positive, and then realized this was about coming to peace with death, not the disease, because either result did not change much except for possibly how long I had to live.\n\nI started to just focus on what is in my control and looked at all this logically rather than emotionally which is easier said than done.\n\nAfter 2 weeks now of being negative it is been just as hard, I feel more anxious, more depressed, I do not know what to do now, and the world keeps spinning and life keeps going and I am kind of feeling at a stand still. So, I have packed my apartment, I am going to move out, think about my career, take control of my life and make changes that having HD held me back from!\n\nSo, hope this helps in some way, guess it is more just a story about me and maybe you can take something out of it, if you want to chat let me know. Hey, I remember your last post. I am glad you got connected with the right people to move this forward.\n\nI felt basically the same as you when I got my blood drawn, that is when things really seemed to get real for me. My wait from draw to results was maybe 6 weeks or so I think, but it could have been quicker if I would pushed it more.\n\nAt this point in the process I basically just distracted myself. I worked out, I hung out with family, I went for beer with friends (the joys of pre-covid life), I read books. Mostly that helped me not to get stuck thinking too much, but I would still had trouble sleeping sometimes. Getting stuck thinking then you are trying to fall asleep or when you wake up at 2am is hard, I can definitely relate.\n\nIt is good to remember that your results do not affect your sister\u2019s chances, so all four scenarios are equally likely right now: you are both negative, you are both positive, or one of you is positive and the other negative. You can also still decide not to get your results, or not to get them right now, in which case you can continue on like Schrodinger\u2019s cat and just be at risk. Only you can ultimately decide what is best for you. I got my results back in December, negative. And I was so sure that I had it. I prepared for the worst, and I was completely blindsided by a negative result. The blood draw was when it felt real for me. My siblings have not been tested yet, so I know when that time comes the potential guilt will set in. \nAs far as distractions, I could not take my mind off of it. I was counting down the days, and I was terrified the whole time. It felt like 1000 years but it was just 15 days. What I did (and would 10/10 recommend) is plan some things to look forward to during that waiting period. Plan some self care activities like a massage. Anything to really ease your mind. Make sure to take some time to yourself to process your results! I remember thinking I would not have it I was already 49 and then when I got the positive results I was not prepared at all! I guess I was in a dream world.

He is also had severe mental health issues for a number of years, mania and depression as well as more subtle \"oddities\" we thought was Aspergers growing up. His doc wants an mri and testing done. Our maternal grandparents died young (40s and just 60) of suicide and cancer and we dont know further back so I guess in theory it could be a thing. But it still seems very left field in a 26 year old.\n\nMy mother told me this via video chat (I live 3000 km away from all family and have since before his mental health went downhill). Thanks to House I understood the gist. I have 4 young children and a husband to think about. Has anyone been confronted with the possibility of this disease in this way? I am glad he is getting tested. That is often a big barrier. Juvenile/early onset is definitely a thing. I have no personal experience with it. You may want to consider getting tested even if your brother's test comes back negative.\n\nThe standard recomendation here is to seek out a genetic counselor to help you decide what to do. There are a lot of competing considerations and getting tested is an extremely personal decision.\n\nDo you know if there are HD resources in your area? I live in the middle of nowhere, but I presume 4 hours away in the capital city of our province there are resources. Here even getting a family doc is a challenge. You might find some help at HDSA.org. It is an American organization so global resources are not their focus. They have a lot of online educational resources however.\n\nIf you are in Canada there are HDSA Centers of Excellence in several of the US northern states. Might be helpful if you need to go deeper. Shoot, you might want to just contact one of them and see what they suggest. They may be able to set up some online or phone consultations. Theres a canadian one as well. Ill just have to see how his MRI goes I guess. It would be us that gets that genetic lottery \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f both born with cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus, plus I got a benign kidney defect and hypothyroidism. So why not add to the list? I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I do not have any personal experience with finding out this way, but I did want to mention that if you are identical, meaning a positive test for him applies to you as well, it would be very reasonable for you to ask them not to disclose the results of his test until you can seek out some professional guidance of your own. This is a life-changing thing, and no one should be forced into the decision to test, even indirectly like this. I am not saying ask them to never tell you, but it would not be out of line to ask for some time to talk through this with a professional on your own.\n\nEdit to add: If it is the worst, once you have digested the info, please consider reaching out to the closest place to you doing HD research. I assume twin studies in rare diseases are hard to come by, and yours might be particularly of interest considering your very different health histories. But I am hoping hard for you that your brother's issues are literally anything else. Srsly? Oh my. We are fraternal twins so that is not a worry at least Hand tremors can be a lot of things - Parkinson's, MS, ALS, anxiety, hyperthyroidism, hyperglycemia, side effects to a medication he is taking, etc.\n\nIf you do not have a parent showing symptoms at this point, I would say it is unlikely to be Huntingtons, statistically speaking. I am in Canada too and my Mum had a surprise diagnosis. What province are you in? AB Me too, small world. \n\nI am happy to help if I can, if there is anything you need. I know the Calgary based HSC social worker and have been through the genetic counselling process there. Email or phone conversations with HSC are easy to set up. Id likely end up in Edmonton if that was an option. Its much closer. But I have no idea what services are where to be honest. We have lived here 2 years and in our area Ive learned fast that I was SPOILED in ON with easy access to basic care and what specialist care I needed was an hour away. Here? Ha... Getting a GP was a stroke of luck, they arent much use and anything else you need to travel 3 hours to the city for. The Edmonton HSC chapter should have a social worker who covers your area, if you want to talk to them just send them an email you can probably schedule a call. Should your brother test positive you would have to go to Edmonton assuming you wanted to test as well. We will see. He has an MRI scheduled for the 30th... He will go from there. If that indeed what it is I have 4 very young kids to consider. As a Christian Im not terribly upset by my own eventual mortality, whatever from. but for their futures and my brother's present I am praying for literally anything else. I get that so much. My Mum was diagnosed after my son was born, and there is no other family history before her. Your head just spins thinking about the different ways things could play out for you and your children.\n\nDoes he have a blood test as well?

Sending all the positive thoughts your way!", "I am terrified My mom was diagnosed after she had my brother and I and I have watched her health deteriorate from a young age. I have also had to be her care taker until I moved away for college. Now facing greater life decisions likes a career path, furthering my relationships with my friends and boyfriend, and further education, I do not know what to do. The possibility of having to suffer like she does keeps me up at night. I do not know whether to test sooner or later. Although I am only coming up on 20, I have been having a harder time reading and speaking. This could have no correlation to being HD positive, but the voice in the back of my head tells me otherwise. I feel like giving up because why bother if my life will go downhill. I am scared for my future and it is so hard to stay positive in times like this. Hey man, I am in a similar position. I cannot tell you what to do because everyone is different. However, if you decide to get tested and found out you had Huntington's it is not the end of the world. \n\nThere is research happening that looks positive, it is not a guarantee of a cure or anything but the future will not be so dark. Huntington's is not a death sentence like it used to be. Full disclosure; I am not at risk. You should look for a support group. You can find some on HDSA.org. There are groups for at risk folks etc. My daughter has found these helpful. HDSA events/volunteer events were a convenient way to ease into things. I am not super comfortable asking about it/help but the events made that easier. I completely get where you are coming from. It is a hard choice because once you know you cannot \u201cunknow\u201d. I am in a very similar situation, I am going off to grad school this fall and will have to leave my mother in the care of my grandmother. The way I see it, you only get one life, so live the way you want, because life is not guaranteed with or without HD. I second the support group because it can help a lot. If I get tested it will only be to have the ability to plan life after college, like if I am positive buying a ranch house instead of a multi floor home for example. If I am negative, going off on a trip to celebrate. Good luck to you and all you do \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 Hey I am feeling the exact same way, I just turned 20 and I was just crying in the shower about all the same things you described. I have gotten through in the past by saying I would test after I finish college but now I am not even sure about that. I know that if I tested positive I would eventually be able to handle it but I know how much it will hurt my siblings and parents and friends. For now I am just trying to live as much as I can and do as much as I can while I am here and able. If you ever want talk just message me it so hard to deal with all this and be in college.", "Being 100% honest, how close are we to a cure within the next 10-20 years?  Thought we were going to have one already, but we obviously do not because the phase 3 trials failed to prove efficacy. Science is a black box, so who knows. Another point, if we do produce a \u201ccure,\u201d how effective will it be? Will it knock out Huntington\u2019s completely or give those inflicted a couple more years after having brain surgery\u2026. I think 10 years is too ambitious is you look at the pipeline. It is hard to find people for clinical trials. I belive there will be clinical trials of a higly promissing treatment but it is costly and does not have enough funding, so human trials could be years away. It depends on alot of factors but I am optimistic there will be treatment available in 10 years. Just a side note, I do not have Huntingtons and I have only recently been looking into advancment in treatment development. Cure? Not likely.\n\nSome type of treatment to delay symptoms? More likely. Lots of good companies (20+) out there with drugs entering the clinic soon. Very optimistic there will be something to delay or prevent symptom onset significantly. Are you saying you believe there will **never** be a cure for HD? If so, may I ask what makes you think so?\n\nWhat do you think about gene therapy as a cure? I am far from an expert and have no background in science, but from what little I understand, gene therapies to cure genetic diseases like HD are already technically possible. My impression was that we mostly just need a company (or several, ideally) to create a gene therapy targeting HD specifically, but because it is considered a fairly rare disease, it just has not been made a priority yet. Gene therapy for things like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s will probably come first, I would imagine. \n\nI also assume that even if a gene therapy for HD is invented, there will then be some hurdles on the way to getting it approved by the FDA and/or other agencies. I am just saying that from what I have gathered in my research on HD this far, gene therapy is most likely the answer we are waiting for.\n\nPlease forgive my ignorance if I am mistaken about this! I am very new to the HD community, so I am not super knowledgeable about the details. My husband and I found out just 3 weeks ago that he is positive for Huntington\u2019s, with a CAG repeat of 41. He has no family history of HD to speak of, so the news completely blindsided us. He is 30 years old and it unfortunately appears that some symptoms have already begun. I have not quite fully recovered from the shock, but I am trying to learn everything I can about the disease and we are both desperately hoping for something to come along to help him in time. Even if our only hope is something that will slow down the progression\u2026 that is something, and knowing it is on the way would make me feel so much better. I would do absolutely anything for more time with him as he is now. I sure hope so. Start spreading the word, join HDSA, wrote letters to the people performing the testing, studies, experiments etc.  Post it all over and And spread the word like wildfire. Everyone needs to. This will get peoples attention, this will get people educated and this will get the ball rolling. If we want to cure for our lifetime and our kids and this is what we need to do.", "22 - Family History and Concerned My dad is 57 and his father had HD. Grandpa did not get diagnosed until 68. I know if my dad has it I have a 50% chance as well. I suspect he may have some symptoms as well as his siblings. They are very private and have not been tested, more than likely would not tell anyone if they were positive. I would bet my dad has it, he is OCD, short fuse with extreme outburst, has frequent voice problems, a total lack of social understanding, and my gut feeling is that he is not on the good 50%. \n\nI seem to have this impending sense that I may have it. I have fasciculations all over a frequently,     and I lose things so frequently and effectively it almost brings me to tears and rage. I also seem to choke on food or liquid and have it go down the wrong \u201cpipe\u201d all too frequently. My ability to write down a list for groceries or plan stuff out causes me great pain considering I have a degree in mechanical engineering I am confused about some of my struggles. So I am not going to go down a long message here and try to tell you I know exactly how you feel because I do not. This is absolutely no fun and it is got its own unique personal horrors that no two people experience. But, I will say this: the fact that you know there is a risk and the way you react to all the tiny little things like forgetting your car keys or things going down the wrong tube are linked. Your mind is going to blow every clumsy thing you do and every forgetful moment you have entirely out of proportion. When I found out the risk I would stare at my hand looking for any kind of tremor or muscle spasm I could find. And if I twitched, even a little, my heart would start racing. \n\nIt is totally normal, and it is the fear talking. Take a breath. Remind yourself that you are still you, you do not know anything for certain right now and in that moment you are in control. \n\nMessage me if you would like to talk, I am happy to listen and can point you towards some options. I spoke to a geneticist many times and they said If you are consciously aware of spasms, forgetfulness, or any other symptoms then it is likely not HD, as you would not be consciously aware of symptoms, so I would relax a little bit.\n\nStrongly suggest taking control of your situation - get tested, get the results, and then get your life going, where you live every day as much as you can.\n\nWe are all going to die, and I am still waiting for my results, they come next week, what I have learned in the 4-6 weeks of waiting for the results is that I am not fearful of positive or negative outcome, I am just scared of death and my mortality, but when you come to peace with death, HD becomes less of a problem, this is for me anyway.\n\nGet tested, it is the best thing you will ever do, but, you will do it when you are ready, took me 16 years to be brave enough :) You are taking the right approach (not that you need me to tell you that) but my offer to listen if you need extends to you as well. Going through that process is tough and I would not wish it on anyone. All the best, here if you need it :) Just to reiterate what others are already saying, it is natural to be a little paranoid when having it is a possibility. But until you get test results confirming it, it is also possible that those things that seem to be symptoms are completely unrelated.\n\nMy husband chokes on invisible spit all the time, but his side of the family is not the one carrying the gene, it is on my side. Just because something is common with HD does not mean it could not be caused by something else. It is not healthy to live your life second guessing everything. When you are ready to face the results, get the test. It will either confirm your fears or be a monumental relief. But do not steal days from yourself worrying about what-ifs. Piggy backing off what the other people have said - Symptom hunting and anxiety is a massive thing with HD, especially when you have not had the dialogue or any idea on your results. \n\nThe other thing, from what I understand, the things you have listed about your dad are necessarily definitive symptoms of Huntingtons disease. \n\nI found it really helpful to get tested and saw a psychologist for the entire process and have continued seeing them now 6 months later. It is really important to get out of your own head and have the facts to rationalise you (and a great healthcare team).", "What should I do? Hi everyone! 23M here, and I have recently discovered that I am at risk (HD). I am planning to do the test, because I think that knowing may be of help in taking important decisions. But I have a huge doubt which makes me not sleep at night: let us say I am positive, should I ever get in a relationship? I would hate to be a burden to my significant other, making her life a nightmare (I have experienced this with my father's uncle). I will be glad to read your opinions, I am kind of desperate right now. That is her decision to make I think. And even *if* you are positive who knows how long it may be before onset. \n\nI do not think it is something you should hide if you do know but you could realistically be looking 40+ years down the road from now here. \n\nMy SO has known about it since we got together she says she will stay regardless and it is not even something we really have to think about. And even if she did not stay oh well whatever, we learn to not take life so seriously at some point I think. Thank you for the reply. You are a very lucky man if your SO is willing to stay with you no matter what, take good care of her. Having said this, probably I should think more about the bad idea of not being happy (and alone) for the next 40+ years: does not sound too smart actually. As someone who have been in a relationship with a girl  who had HD. It was a really good relationship, I did have it in my head at times thinking about the future we would have. But if the other person really loves you they can overcome what you concider being a burden. \n\nI would never have left her, because of HD. \n\nI hope you dont give up on love if you are being tested positive.  \n\nShe had a bigger brother who had HD too, and he was really amazing at handling it, he has two kids and a wife, he met after being tested positive. \n\nBest of luck with the test and future. I found out I was at risk 5 years ago and ive been married for 10 years. Ive had to buy a house to care for my mother who has it. I havn't been tested yet because there is alot of red tape in doing so, unless you bypass the docters and do it online. My wife has stood by me and we have concluded that we will deal with it as it comes. The only thing it really changed is we have decided we arn't having children. We were kind of leaning that way already because niether of us like responsibility and the possibility of maybe passing it on to another generation is unexceptable in our minds. Lucky I got a wonderful woman to fall in love with me before we new about the disease. I say let anybody you are feeling serious about know about your risk and what that means for your future. About getting tested, sometimes knowing is worse than not knowing. If you ever want to talk it out, feel free to PM me. I know what your going through, and your not alone. &gt;If you do want kids you can ask your doctor for assistance and they can help with giving a child without HD.\n\nI did not know about this: this could be a game changer, thanks!\n\n&gt; we are unfortunately not together anymore\n\nI am very sorry to hear that, truly. They do invitro by pre-testing the at risk subjects eggs/sperm and selecting ones that do not carry the gene. Easier for men due to high sperm count. Very expensive procedure, but worth it if you safely want children of your own. Definitely this! Do not be afraid of a relationship. It is better to live a full life than to live a life full of fear. I am 27 and at risk, just got married last summer and it is the best decision I made. Be open and honest with them and you will find someone that makes life better.", "Roadblock getting tested Hi all, I have been trying to get tested for Huntington\u2019s since the day I turned 18. My doctor supports me, my mom (does not have HD) supports me, I am very confident that I want to know the results. \n\nMy father(who has it) does not support me, and refuses to sign the consent form for the clinic to prove I am at risk so that I can get the test. I tried asking my aunt to possibly sign for my grandpa (he died, he had Huntington\u2019s but that is not what got him) but she also refused. \n\nI am so tired of wondering, and I feel it is my health so I have a right to know. I am just wondering if anybody knows of a way to bypass the confirmation of affected family members form? I got a call from the clinic saying I need it, but other than forging his signature (which I will not do, because laws), I have no other way of getting an affected family member to sign. I am in AB, Canada btw. Thanks for reading! If I am in the wrong sub or not posting this correctly I am really sorry, I just do not know where else to turn for this one. I would go to another doctor and explain the situation. There are supposed to be ways around that paperwork on a case by case basis. If that does not work, look into getting anonymously tested. I agree, you should see another doctor, they should test you base on the fact that it is been in your family and that is it is your choice.  Hi, I am in AB too and went through testing last year, so feel free to DM me if you want to.\n\nI would start with the ( which should have a social worker I that covers your area. They can likely get you in touch with a genetic counsellor in your area. I think only Calgary &amp; Edmonton do testing, but they should be happy to give you a call. I talked to my genetic counsellor on the phone a couple of times before my referral went through.\n\nI do not know what they will tell you, but they must have dealt with this type of situation before. Everyone I have dealt with has been very knowledgeable and supportive, and helped me before and after the testing process.\n\nAs far as I know anonymous testing is not available in AB, I think the genetic counselling process is the only route available without looking out of province (or possibly out of country).\n\nGood luck. I think in Calgary my only option is the Huntington\u2019s society, and they said I need this consent form for an affected family members records to make an appointment, I emailed them explaining my situation but no response yet. Hoping they will say yes to bypassing the affected family form. I got tested a few years ago and did not have any consent from family. Is this a country requirement or a Dr office requirement? Seems odd to me, that you cannot find out about your dna.", "Mom is worse than I thought Well I finally got mom to see the HD specialist in our area. She did really well considering her past butting heads with doctors and getting extremely upset when talking about her HD. She was cute and giggly, god I love her.

She thought the date was September 2016\u2026 she knew it was fall and that it was Tuesday. When asked 100-7 she took a while to say 94.

I am sorry this happened. Being sad is definitely ok. Thank you.

Hi all. I (31F) found out a little over a month ago that my great uncle (75) on my father's side was just diagnosed. Started showing movement symptoms \\~5 years ago. His sister, my grandmother (78), may be showing symptoms - things like cognitive decline and unsteadiness that her doc previously attributed to her other health problems and med side effects, but could be HD related now that there is family history. I just found out that she will not be able to see a neurologist until January to be evaluated and tested.\n\nMy husband and I were just starting TTC, but have put it on hold as I firmly believe I need to know my status before we make any decisions (CVS, PGD IVF, etc.). I do have an active referral to Mass General's HD COE for genetic counseling, but no appointment yet.\n\nGetting to the point - has anyone tried to begin the genetic counseling and/or testing process before having an \"immediate\" family be diagnosed? I am worried that I will not be able to start my own process until hers is complete, assuming she is gene positive. I know for sure that I want the information and it is devastating to think we might be waiting well into next year to know whether and how we can start a family.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? \n\nAlso curious if anyone has seen consistent late onset in a family - my father is 57, his sisters are \\~45 and \\~59, all with no symptoms. I know I am looking for signs, but would not it be odd for 1.) my grandmother to show symptoms so late in life and 2.) for none of her children to show signs yet if she is positive?\n\nTIA for any advice! I am not American, so I cannot specifically speak to whether you need to wait for family members to get testing, but I suspect there would be a way to get tested privately without waiting for their results. I would reach out to the HDSA or other HD patient support organizations that should be able to help you navigate through the testing process. \n\nIn terms of consistent late onset in a family, yes, this is entirely possible. It may be that your great uncle and potentially grandmother have CAG counts which are on the low end of the disease-causing range, which leads to later onset on average. We also know that there are additional genetic variants which can be associated with later onset, so it is possible that one of these runs in your family.\n\n CAG sizes *can* get larger when passed to the next generation, leading to earlier onset in children than their parents (this is called anticipation, and is more common when the HD mutation is passed down from the father). However, this does not happen in every case and is less likely to happen when the CAG repeat length is shorter. \n\nSo it is entirely possible that none of your grandmother\u2019s children would show signs yet, especially if she has not been showing symptoms for very long. And remember, there is only a 50% chance that each child would inherit the same mutation, so some or all of her children may never develop HD even if she does carry the HD mutation. \n\nPlease let me know if I can clarify any of this more! I am a graduate student researching genetic factors leading to early and late onset HD, so I am fairly familiar with the research side of things. If you are worried just get tested. My family tends to get it later 60s according to cousins. When my mom was diagnosed in her 60s we thought it came from her father but my grandmother was the one with first cousins with HD when I found some records in my family tree research. We spoke with DNA cousins who knew about HD even through one branch did not seem have it in their direct line. My great grandparents hide it because they were Christian Science who do not believe in medical treatment. I am actually trying to trace it in family right now 10 descendants of my second great grandparents I know have it. Since an immediate relative of your immediate relative IS diagnosed, and it is autosomal dominant, it should not be a problem in terms of getting tested since you are still technically at risk. You may hit a snag with insurance, but a prior authorization from a neurologist should be able to clear it up. I have not specifically dealt with the situation, but I work in healthcare and am generally familiar with the insurance process for things like this. Commenting because we are in the same area! and we are wondering if we should go that route or not. BF, 30, and father of my baby, just found out his dad (~59-62... not sure fully) who he is not close with has HD. We do not know how he is really because he is in jail. Now very worried about my daughter and BF. His DR was suggesting Mass general also. We are afraid for two reasons: insurance, and if he does that is a lot of weight in our minds in regards to our one year old. but the weight is already there, tbh. I know there is the ma/RI HD center of excellence, where you can be tested without it being official. I am wondering how that works and how much it would cost as you cannot use insurance. Just figured i would mention that, and also wondering if anyone else has been there?\n\nI cannot go back, and I would not go back and do anything differently, as my surprise baby is the best thing to ever happen to me. I do not think I need to explain to anyone here why I worry how she will feel. I think there is extensive fetal genetic testing you can get done. and I know that is a touchy subject, but putting it out there. we got the basic genetic testing done which does not test for that and is not as invasive, but also we had no idea. sorry if I was all over the place a little with this comment. You are correct about there being a way to get tested privately without prior results from family members. \n\nMy 30-year-old husband just did this in early July, with absolutely zero known history of Huntington\u2019s in his family\u2026 He simply had a bad feeling about some neurological symptoms that began about a year ago and seemed to be worsening in recent months. He incidentally watched the show ZeroZeroZero, where a main character is diagnosed with HD, and immediately suspected that he shared the disorder.\n\nHe was right. He submitted a saliva sample to a private lab called Labcorp, and they called him a mere 3 days later with his results: an estimated CAG repeat of 40, with an error margin of +/- 2. He then requested his DNA be sent in and evaluated by a more accurate test, and his final CAG repeat number is 41.\n\nAs I understand it, the way my husband went about it is an anomaly. Most people become aware of HD in their family and have a long time to decide if they want to know whether or not they have it. Then they are forced to undergo genetic counseling before they can receive their results, and it is often a month-long process or longer. For us, it was 3 days from the time we found out exactly what Huntington\u2019s entails, to the time we learned he has it. 3 days from suspecting nothing, to seeing our future plans up in smoke. Since his symptoms began before he turned 30, he does not have much hope that he has many good years left. \n\nI do not know if I would personally recommend the way my husband did it, because obtaining the knowledge without any sort of therapy or other way of bracing for it has broken us in many ways and we are very much struggling to cope. His symptoms have drastically worsened since the test results, and I cannot help but wonder if the stress and trauma of knowing plays a role in that. I am in therapy now, but my husband does not see the point. Just last week, he cruelly tried to force me to leave him because he believes I am not emotionally strong enough to handle his diagnosis. Luckily, a close friend talked some sense into him and made him realize he does not get to make that decision for me. Sorry this is a bit random, but has your doctor been evaluated by a doctor and had the diagnosis confirmed through a doctors office? I work with HD very closely in pharma and I have never heard of that Labcorp saliva test, especially it being inaccurate to +/- 2 CAG repeats. Any test should be able to give you a definite repeat length. A length of 38 means something very different from 40.\n\nI do not mean to question the legitimacy of your husband's diagnosis as I am sure you guys know what you are doing, but reading this was highly concerning, especially with no family history. The LabCorp blood test is also not FDA approved.\n\nIf his CAG repeat number is 41, that is truly one of the best scenarios. Most patients with a length of 41 do not typically show symptoms until their 40s or 50s, which is also why I am curious. I understand your concerns! I know this is a highly unusual way of going about testing for the disease. I have no background in any kind of science, so I apologize in advance if I mess anything up as I attempt to explain this.\n\nThe first test was a private test measuring protein fluorescence and indeed is not FDA-approved, probably due to the error margin. When they called him up to give him his results, they were very reluctant to release them and kept repeatedlyasking if he was absolutely sure he wanted to know without any prior counseling first. But my husband is the most persuasive person I have ever known, so I assume he worked his magic and that is how he got his results faster than anyone else I have ever heard of before.\n\nSo because of the error margin and the possibility of his real CAG number being 38 or 39, we took those results with a grain of salt and hoped for the best as he submitted a sample for more accurate testing. The second test was a genetic sequencing test that is regarded as almost perfectly accurate, was significantly more expensive, and took a week to process. And yes, those results have been evaluated by both his doctor and a neurologist. \n\nAnd as I understand it, the lack of family history is rare, but not ultra rare. Correct me if I am wrong, but I think I read that around 20% of HD cases these days are de novo (meaning the gene was not inherited from a parent). I also read that de novo cases are becoming more common in recent years, and that the disease is appearing in more and more of the global population, particularly in non-Caucasians. \n\nI am extremely interested in hearing your opinion and learning about your experiences with this disease that I am only just beginning to understand.

We have a child, he is 4. \n\nI am terrified. \n\nI feel incredibly selfish and know I should not be \u2013 I am not the one sick and all I am thinking about is what this will mean for my son as he grows up, in part what it means for me and how it is going to affect every aspect of our life. My husband talks about his mom and how hard it was growing up with her mood swings, treating her husband horribly one second and great the next, going back on decisions, poor reasoning, etc. Is that going to be him and me? I am scared for my son to have to live with that (completely aside from the fact he could have that mutation, too). \n\nIf I were someone else, I would say\u2026 Take it day by day. Travel more, read more, laugh together, go exploring, breathe fresh mountain air, appreciate the little things... \n\nI guess I do not even know what I am doing here and I do not have a question\u2026 I am just\u2026 it feels like a bad dream and I keep waiting to wake up and know it is not real. All I am thinking is I am going to lose my best friend and I am going to watch him turn into something that is so far from \u201chim\u201d mentally first. \n Hi, sorry to hear about the news of your husband and also the effects of his family and potentially your son. \nDo not think of yourself as selfish, you may not physically suffer from this disease but it is also going to be one that effects your life so you cannot be selfish because you are apart of this too. \n\nI am a 20 year old female who is father also has this gene and my grandmother passed from. I am currently going through testing for it myself and it is a big thing for myself, my family and my boyfriend and I would never think of them as selfish for struggling with this. \n\nJust know Huntington's can effect everyone differently and come at different stages of life. My dad is 50 and has yet to show symptoms of this disease.  There is a lot of testing going on currently and we recently had a small break through that was announced over here in the U.K. With a potential cure to be coming eventually: it is still early days yet but they are getting there. \n\nThis disease really only effects people later in life but again it is different for everyone however worrying and thinking on it everyday will not do anything to ease it that is what I have learnt, I am terrified of losing my dad who I am so close with to this disease.  Just know that your son is young and with research and break through happening there is going to be a cure and treatment for him by the time he is old( if he even has this gene) \n\ntry to keep up with counselling sessions that you and your husband can attend together and separately and just know that this disease is not as much of a death sentence as what it used to be. Keep yourself up to date on all the research and announcements going on. Do not look too much into the negative side. You still have a long healthy happy life and future together with your husband and son, this disease has not come yet so do not let it take away from the good times that you have now. \nI know that is easier said than done but remember it is ok to be sad, worried, scared, angry and all the other emotions it is natural but just also know that as much as there negative news and articles out there about the horrors of this disease there is break through stories and research going into it. :) \n Hun, you are far from selfish. You are thinking about the future, which is very important when you have young children. I am, personally, glad you are worried about your kid's future... it shows you care. But try your best to not let your anxieties get the best of you. You SHOULD take it day by day and spend the time you can with not only your husband, but with all of those you love. Treat him no differently than if he was not positive because, truthfully, none of us have any idea when we are going to die... he was just given a probable cause. \n\nStart trying to plan things. Make sure you have things like life insurance and marriage benefits set up, like any married couple does. Make sure you have a savings account and are paying into it. Make sure you stay on top of research and trials coming out.\n\nI will tell you, they are coming out with new stuff for this everyday it seems. My Aunt, who has HD, has been doing human trial stuff for some medication and it has helped subdue the symptoms but they have not gone away.\n\nThese things take time... And lots of it. Most do not show symptoms until 54 and can live worthwhile and amazing lives. \n\nThere are people you can talk to who are apart of the HDSA who would love to help you. It is kind of what they are here for. \n\nBe safe and keep your head up. You got this!! There is not a damn thing wrong with acknowledging your feelings about your husband having HD. Get all of your emotions out however you need to. Honestly, you are doing good by venting here. Repressing your feelings will only make you feel worse and could lead to your health taking a negative turn. You have just become a caregiver and speaking from experience and exposure to many other HD caregivers, we all experience negative feelings including feeling selfish. I highly recommend finding an HD support group near you and going to a meeting. There you will find a great group of people that you can open up to and not feel judged because they have been exactly where you are now. \n\nBest wishes to you and your family and hope for a cure.", "Worried about getting tested and the future This might be pretty long because I have not really talked to anyone about the way I have been feeling. If anyone takes the chance to read the whole thing, thank you so much.\n\nI have known I have been at risk to get Huntington\u2019s since I was around 12 years old but I guess I was too young to really understand what the meant until about a year ago. My mom sat me aside one day and told me and it was a pretty big shock considering I never really knew my dad. My mom got pregnant with me at 17 and my dad  tested positive at 18 when my mom was already 3 months along. They broke up shortly after I was born so I never got to see the progression. Well, I am now 18 and I told everyone who knew that I could have it that I wanted to get tested as soon as I turned 18. I turn 19 in 3 months and I still have not gotten enough courage to do it. \n\nHonestly, I am not sure if I want to get tested now. The only reason I want to is the take this weight off of my shoulders and to have a chance to be normal. It sucks being 18 and have your whole life ahead of you but having the fear of getting HD looming over your head everyday. The older I get, the worse I worry about my future and the possibility of getting HD. I know there is a chance that I will not have it but it is taking the leap of actually knowing which scares me more than anything. I feel like once I know, my life will be over before it is even started. It is gotten really hard to stay positive and I am at a constant battle with myself to wether or not I should get tested now or wait. part of me feels like I am putting myself through unnecessary pain because there is a chance I do not have it and all the crying and the sadness is for nothing. But the other part me of knows that the test could be positive and if it is, I do not know if im ready to hear those words. \n\nI constantly worry about the future. My biggest worry about finding out, is that I will hurt the people I love. Every time I think about my future husband taking care of me and how hard it will be, I break down. I do not want people to take sacrifices in their own life to take care of me. \n\nI started dating a guy and we have dating for around 9 months. I know I am young and probably a little dumb but I love him more than I have loved anyone before. He is amazing and perfect and so kind to me. He knows about my chances of getting HD but I do not think he fully understands what it really means. Part of me feels bad for putting him in this situation and telling him in the first place, because after all, we are only 18. When I told him, he cried almost for a whole day. He could not even look at me without crying. He says that he does not care and he loves me anyway and that no matter what happens he will stay but after reading all the stories of spouses of people with HD, I realize how hard it will really be for him if we do stay together that long or anyone I date for that matter. \n\nMy head is full of worry all the time over this and I guess I came here to find people like me. I have thought about maybe going to therapy and talking to someone about the way I have been feeling and the sense of hopelessness that I feel. But a small sliver of me holds on everyday hoping that it will get better. \nThank you so much for reading if you got this far. Some facts for you, my dear:\n\n1. You might not have HD.\n2. You might have HD but it will never break out, because you are super young and science is making progress right now.\n3. HD might eventually break out, but people who love you will gladly \"sacrifice\" things to help you, support you, do anything needed, simply because they love you and there is nothing you can do about it. Just accept it.\n\nMy girl has HD, we are awaiting a baby boy. I am certain we have a beautiful future ahead of us. If we can look forward, so can you. Hey, first of all it is not about building the courage to get tested. It is a personal choice and if you decided to do it you need to be ready. It does not make you a coward for not getting tested.\n\nIf you did develop the illness it most likely would not be for another 15 or 20 year at least so it is not going to affect you any time soon no matter what.\n\nTherapy might be good for you. I am not sure where you are from but a lot of countries have HD services that are designed for young people like yous.\n\nI am basically in the same boat as you. 19, at risk and have a supportive girlfriend but you have to try stay positive as hard as that is to be. Research is making great progress and all the signs are good. \n\nI hope this helped some what, if you ever need someone to talk to I am happy to help :) I tested at 18....10 years ago. It is tough and I would say make sure that it is right for you. Make sure that you have everything ready or think of how the test results might impact your career. Good luck!", "How to cope knowing that your S.O has a 50/50 chance of getting HD? My S.O and I are moving to toronto as he is doing film school and wants to do a whole documentary about HD . He also wants to get tested for it if he ever does it but I am having a really rough time not thinking the worst. I am so paranoid and I do not want to lose him. He says he will let me know by proposing to me (tested negative) and states that he will do the latter if he ever tested positive. His mom passed away from HD in her 30s. We are in our 20s but he is not showing early signs of it. He has 2 other siblings and his older brother had signs in his 20s and will likely be diagnosed with HD. His sister is not showing signs and she is in her mid 20s. I cannot really talk to him about how I feel because I want him to be happy. We have plans to get married and start a family but he is afraid of it. I am venting on reddit because I have no one else to talk to about it. Sometimes I think about it, sometimes I forget. But its always on my mind. It is my greatest fear. Any advice on how to cope and what to expect would be nice. I love him a lot and I do not want to think the worst but I cannot help it. I have been with my fianc\u00e9 for 5 years - got engaged almost a month ago. We are 29 &amp; 30, and HD runs in his family. His grandmother, mom, and little sister have all been tested positive. He is not sure if he ever wants to get tested or not. We had a couple of years where it weighed really heavy on our minds, and for a while he was overanalyzing every little thing about himself to the point where it consumed him and threw us both into depression. What helped, honestly, is not letting ourselves focus on it so much. I do not want to say \"Just do not think about it\" - because that is not helpful and not exactly what we are doing. We have made plans to get on a good life insurance plan while we are still young and before he shows potential symptoms, and we talk about what we would need to do next if he *did* start showing symptoms. When we look to buy our first house, we will make sure it would be easy to modify for accessibility and close to a good support system (family/friends). We have some other plans made regarding long-term care, what we will do when we are ready for children, etc. Other than that, we live as though he is negative. We constantly put it in our heads that he is negative - it keeps us going. I might have 5 years left with him, I might have 50. We do not know. And if he ever starts showing symptoms? Well, we have got plans for that.\n\nAlso, there is a Team Hope walk sponsored by the Huntington's Disease Society of America that happens near us every year. We participate every year to donate to the cause and fight back. :) Thank you so much this really helped ease my mind a bit. I usually think about the best, but hearing about his brother\u2019s condition had me paranoid and scared. Completely understandable. When we found out about my fianc\u00e9's mom, we had a whole mental breakdown. Then his little sister got tested positive immediately after, and we spent a few nights just crying. It is hard. It is really damn hard. And I am not going to lie, every now and again I have a night where I think about what we may have to go through and I feel such a tightness in my chest that completely takes my breath away for a bit. It is an earth-shattering pain to imagine the one you want to spend your life with could start fading, changing, at any moment. When that happens I allow myself a good cry, then grab the love of my life and take him out on an adventure. Even if it is just camping at a nearby state park.\n\nEdit to add: It is hard to worry about things while shoving campfire marshmallows into your mouth. ;) I would reach out to a social worker or genetics counselor and ask about testing. Not for testing necessarily but to go over your options and they can give you resources to help you cope and also make the decision. You can also test anonymously so you do not alert your insurance.\n\nThere are important things you might want to know prior to testing, such as GINA but how that does not protect your SO from discrimination for life insurance and disability insurance. Idk where you are living now or what the laws/healthcare/insurance would be like in Toronto, but this is what I know about the U.S. You want to check with local advocates who would be familiar with the local laws.\n\nHow old are you guys if you do not mind me asking? If his mom passed away in her 30s, I want to say she probably had a pretty long expansion due to the inverse relationship between expansion length and age of onset. If your SO is gene-expanded, stats show he would likely have an early-ish onset too, but no way to know for sure without genetic testing.\n\nEither way, I would definitely seek professional help (therapy) to cope with this unknown. It is a huge weight to bear, especially if you are his support, so no shame in seeking help. Thinking of you and hope you can find peace with your so is decision whether or not to test &lt;3\n\nETA: I think the proposal thing is sweet, but that means your SO would test alone? It is a big decision to get tested and although the gesture is romantic I do not think I could let my SO go through that process without my support. But ultimately it is your so is decision.", "Enroll-HD will I be able to learn the results of the test? I would like to participate in Enroll-HD but I have not been tested yet. Reading through the informed consent form they tell you that you will not be told of the results but your doctor will have access to the information and can use it to help with care. \n\nI would really like to learn the results in an anonymous way without a great personal cost. Is it that they will not share the results with you period or they will not share without asking?", "My mom will not get tested Hi! I am on mobile so sorry for formatting. Just found this sub and figured I would seek out some advice/support. I will start off by saying I do not know a ton about Huntington\u2019s so forgive me if i come off uninformed. My grandfather had it and died when I was very very young and his illness and the nature of it were kept from me my whole life. When I found out the truth earlier this year from my siblings, naturally I asked if my mom had the gene. They did not know because she is never been tested and I was strongly discouraged from bringing it up with her because she will not discuss it. \n\nI can understand and empathize with the fact that she does not want to potentially live her remaining good years worried about when, and not if, she will fall ill. But that fear was not eliminated, only transferred onto my sisters and I. She has seemed to be in poor health the past few years with a variety of medical issues, the most significant being her declining mood and emotional state. I am in constant worry, wondering when or if the day will come. \n\nMy three sisters and I are all either in or approaching the point in our lives where we want to have children, but we are all hesitant to start because we worry that we will be passing on the gene. But at the same time we are all still too scared to get tested ourselves because if one of us is positive, we would not be able to keep it from our mom and that would cause a *major* rift in our family. \n\nI really wish she would just get tested and give her children some peace of mind or time to prepare, but it is a selfish desire and one that I have to let go of. I just wish she cared about or even acknowledged the impact that this choice has on all of our lives. You can get tested (if you are over 18). If you come back positive, she is got it too, and your siblings need to worry. If your negative, the others could be either way.\n\nShe does not have to test and should be left alone about it. It may be harder on you this way, but clearly she is not at a place where she can deal with it. And that is ok.\n\nI tested positive and the whole process, facing my worst fear etc. was extremely hard. Not every one can do it. I have two siblings who will not talk about it, and are not moving towards testing. One just had a kid that might have it too. Sucks? Yes. But they cannot do it. \n\nI am sorry if this is harsh, I am truly sorry you are dealing with the unknown if this. It is not harsh I mean I know not to ask my mom for or about it, I never will because I believe that people should be 100% in charge of their medical decisions w/o coercion. It is just been hard letting go of the part of me that is angry with her for it. \n\nI would get tested but I just do not know if I am strong enough to get a positive result and not tell any of my family. Because I definitely could not tell my mother but I think that I also could not expect any of my other family members to take on that burden of information. I think you should seek out a therapist experienced with these issues. Do you have an HD Center of Excellence in your area? They could probably help you find one. Otherwise, check the Psychology Today website. I have had genetic counseling twice, ten years apart, that helped me decide whether or not to be tested. They almost seem to try to talk you out of it if you are not symptomatic. My doctor said that he is diagnosed people in their mid-80s who have just started showing symptoms, and living with the knowledge that you carry the gene when it may not affect you before you die of something unrelated can be hard for people. On the other hand, I do believe it is absolutely something you need to take into account before you have children. I found out it runs in my family when my son was a baby, and the guilt was pretty intense. While I am not symptomatic, I was nearly tested ten years ago when I considered another pregnancy, and I am being tested now because my son is old enough to start considering kids himself. My own mother felt the way yours does before her symptoms became impossible to ignore. Since she started medication, she is almost a new person. Pleasant, rational, able to carry on a conversation and think about other people's feelings. I dearly wish she would been diagnosed 15 years ago. \n\nHowever, if neither of you want to be tested, there are still reproductive options. You can do IVF and have the embryos tested. Of course, if the one you test is positive, that is a positive result for both you and your mother...but if not, everyone can remain blissfully ignorant. Some people who are not tested have children younger than they might otherwise, just in case they are struck in their 40s. That is still taking a pretty big risk, though. I have family members who had children in their early twenties and lost custody due to Huntington's in their late twenties. The path is not always clear or predictable. \n\nTherefore, as I said, if I were you I would seek out genetic counseling and a therapist to help you make these decisions. Everyone reacts differently to the news, and you will want to have support no matter what you decide, and also in dealing with your mom. Good luck. If you did get tested and come back positive I think you should tell you siblings. You guys will need to prepare for caring for you and your mom, and they may want to test as well. It wont be a burden you can carry alone forever. Eventually your mom will get sick and give it away, and someone will have to take care of you when you get sick in turn. But you can take your time with the news. Come to terms with it yourself first, at least a little.\n\nTelling family I had tested and come up positive was very difficult. If you have not got a therapist yet, they will be a huge help with processing bad news (only 25% chance since your mom is unknown) and telling people. \n\nAnd you could (75% chance) be fine. And that relief, well my older brother can attest to how freeing it is. Your mom is not obligated to test and even if she tested positive, that does not mean you are guaranteed to have it.\n\nThe only way you will know for sure is if you get tested yourself. There is nothing really for HD in my state, I have given it a look. I also do not really have the money to see a genetic counselor at the moment, but I am also not interested in having kids for a few years and that is the big thing that is making me consider getting tested. It is definitely something I want to do down the line, I just right now really am on the fence about whether I want to pull the trigger on it. I do know all of these things but thanks. Thanks for giving me that perspective. I came here hoping to understand a little better from others who have been through it too. I have felt really isolated, especially from my own family. Do not rule out seeking counseling due to cost. There are a lot of resources available for free and low cost counseling, even if it is just someone to talk through your feelings with. My testing was also free and anonymous. Do not discount the stress this can cause and how it can affect all your life decisions, even subconsciously. I am so sorry you are affected by this. Thank you. I guess I will have to look into it all a bit more. What testing service did you use? Anonymous would be ideal, I have been really worried about the impact on my insurance, my uncle got his coverage dropped recently. This disease has a nasty habit of doing that. I am sorry.\nI wish you the best. If you need to talk feel free to pm me. You are not alone in this.  Hi sorry.\nI, I am Dad! I am testing through an UC-Irvine's HD research center. The testing is paid for with their research funding. If I am positive and choose to switch over to my own insurance for any treatments eventually, I will just have to get any life insurance or long term care insurance or whatever first. But I can participate anonymously for monitoring and stuff before that. Honestly, part of the reason for testing now is because I am considering a job change, and I really need to know what insurance and location issues I am going to need to take into account. My mom became symptomatic about five years older than I am now, so I want to be prepared.  Hi testing, I am Dad! Thanks so much, that means a lot. Same goes to you \u2764\ufe0f I am testing through an UC-Irvine's HD research center. The testing is paid for with their research funding.

My mom became symptomatic about five years older than I am now, so I want to be prepared. There are ways to have children that are HD free without getting tested. IVF can test all embryos and only implant the healthy ones. The whole process is done through a third party who keeps everything regarding your status a secret. I cannot offer much advice more than what others have stated but know you are not alone and even us internet friends are here for you! Sorry to barge in, but I used to be a social worker in a HD center of excellence. Call your closest center and just talk with their social worker.\n(You do not have to actually go there). HDSA spends a lot of time and effort training their social workers and they may be able to help you and connect you to the right people in your area. At the very least, they will be able to send you resources about thinking about getting tested and genetic counseling.  \n\nI wish you all the best my friend and I am so sorry you are dealing with such uncertainty. It is your life, you cannot force your mum only a doctor can do that but it is such a awful thing you have every right to know, and by the sounds of it you cannot go forward without knowing, do not be swayed by what is best for everyone else in this situation it is each individuals choice good luck \u2764\ufe0f I am currently going through the motions for getting tested.  I am actually late for this period as well.  \n\nAt the end of the day, you cant make your mum get tested and you need to respect the fact that she might not want to know.  If you are concerned about the potential for you passing it on, there are means and ways of testing eggs before you are pregnant and you may be pregnant and still test.\n\nAs for if you were to test yourself, if you dont think you would be able to keep it from her and If you are also too worried to do it yourself, maybe now is not the time.  And just because you start the process does not mean you HAVE to get the test.  I appreciate the anxiety on your side.  My dad and I have never ever spoken about it.  It was my  mum that told me he had it.  I get tested in January, and regardless of the result i wont be telling my dad.  Not out of badness, just not what we do :P\n\nYou can DM me if you like, theres a lot more I could mention but not sure which parts you are more interested in.  All the best \u2764 You did not say what state you are in, but you can walk into any free clinic and get a referral for testing.", "My mom Watching in horror, my mom with her chorea right now; I had no idea it was this bad. It is so, so bad. She is like a person possessed \u2014 and this is heart wrenching. My mom. She cannot speak right, she is making these weird sounds. Choking. And the flailing, this is so horrible. The violent jerking movements. Her mental reasoning, a frail shadow of the sharp savviness I remember. Suicide something that I always worry about. I cannot ask her to stay in this world if it is treating her so poorly. But I love her so much. I do not want her to go. \nI miss her. \nI am afraid. \nHuntington\u2019s sucks. \nMy CAG number is 43. \nI read the posts on here and it is good to feel like I am not alone. Im posting this because I hope that you, out there, in the same shitty battle, might feel less alone as well. It is incredibly scary and sad to watch. And it always feels like even if we try to describe to others who do not even know about Huntington\u2019s how this whole situation is, it is never fully understood how awful it is. My mother has also thought of assisted suicide I think in Oregon? And it absolutely breaks my heart but I cannot say that I blame her. It really changes who you are and there is nothing to do about it. Just try to be as supportive and loving as you can in the short time she has left, you are not alone I do not know if it is good news or bad news, but once it is gotten as bad as it sounds suicide is kind of beyond the reach of the patient so she probably will not leave you that way. My dad went the long way, not suicide. What is a CAG number? Number of repeats Hey, thank you for your words. I will absolutely cherish every moment we have left together. Yeah, that makes sense. I guess we will see. She is not on any kind of medicine on this point so the symptoms are just totally raw. If she could get a little bit of quality of life back maybe she would feel encouraged to hold out and play the long game (shitty as it will be). \nSorry about your dad. :( ( is a link to a little article that explains what a CAG number is and its implications. Would medical marijuana help? It has helped someone I know with Huntington's. It reduced movements and made her able to talk more clearly. She is more relaxed. You know, I was just thinking about that this morning. From an initial poking around to see what people say online, it seems like it could help reduce the chorea and also some of her feelings of paranoia/anxiety. I am definitely going to keep looking into this option. Thanks for your comment! Medicine can help a lot with the symptoms. I am so sorry, it is a hard thing to endure. My mom has early symptoms, and is just beginning to show chorea. Knowing that it only gets worse from there, is disheartening. May I ask your mother's age, and CAG count? Hi, thank you for that and I am sorry for you too. It is not easy. \nShe is about 53 years old, and unfortunately I am not sure what her CAG count is. Thank you for even just posting this. It takes courage. And know that even though all the posts on this page are just words, they are coming from actual people. People who understand. People who empathize. You are not alone.

If the trial does not meet its primary endpoint it will not result in a drug. \n\nAlso, if it does succeed in meeting its endpoints, when the drug does eventually come on to the market it will likely cost several hundred thousand dollars per year, similar to another antisense oligonucleotide also developed by Ionis for another genetic disease, Spinraza, which costs $750,000 the first year and $350,000 every year after for the rest of the patients life. I think it is really cool that your mom is going to get tested. Some people are so afraid of it that they never test, which causes problems for future generations and that is one way how HD can affect several generations at the same time. My dad has it and he has a brother who has never tested. My uncle has three daughters and all three of them have now had children. None of them know if they are at risk because my uncle has never tested. Some people with HD in the same family can show symptoms way later than others. \n\nTry to be there to support your mom and do not worry about your own risk unless she does test positive. The testing process is very difficult and stressful. It takes about a month to get your results back from the blood test and those weeks are very very tough. She has a 50% chance of having it but also a 50% chance of NOT having it, too. Those numbers are a game the industry is playing with taxes and governments. They have a charitable foundation that assists in paying for the drugs. See Audesto now it is $70k/yr, with a $69k gift back.\n\nYes the drugs are not on the market yet, but this is the first time in history where an HD diagnosis is not an automatic death sentence. Teva\u2019s Shared Solutions did not renew their help program this year. It simply dissolved without further ado. And those programs do not help if you are on Medicare. Be aware: if you have HD your progress will be similar to your mom's and grandmother's. Which means, you probably have a lot of time.. have trust in science, the chances are not too bad you will be just fine either way :)", "Sorry if I posted twice. Newbie ", "Medical Marijuana for Huntington\u2019s Disease ", "My partner\u2019s family. Hello! \n\nI am so happy to have found this subreddit. I have a few questions about HD potentially running in my partners family. We are considering starting a family in the coming years, and wanted to get insight/input on testing, HD, and the like. Here is the background.\n\nMy partner\u2019s mother passed when she was 53. Due to her insurance situation they could never afford a true autopsy, but it is believed she suffered a heart attack or event at the top of the stairs while home alone. Prior to passing, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, and had issues with a very ever so slight shaking leg described as hardly noticeable but potentially present. She also suffered from communication troubles in terms of relating and relaying information, as well as social filter and inhibition was impacted in more minor ways, with a few instances of it seeming to be a significant problem at the time. \n\nMy partner\u2019s uncle passed at 64. He had suffered from severe and vivid mania, depression, and hallucinations. He may have also had a shaky leg, but it was assumed he did that because of hyperactivity and anxiety. He was checked into the hospital due to the severe hallucinations, and had an allergic reaction to medication administered there, eventually being told by doctors it appeared to be some kind of Alzheimer\u2019s, though no true solid diagnosis was given. The allergic reaction to the medication caused him to stop eating and he declined over the course of a short period and passed. \n\nMy partner\u2019s grandmother passed from a major heart attack event in her early 50s, and showed signs of depression, though that is all really known up to that point in family lineage. \n\nMy partner\u2019s cousin has had a history of severe mental illness since adolescence due to multiple forms of abuse, and is in her 30s now. Over the last 20 years she has had diagnosis and treatments for depression, anxiety, OCD, Bipolar, and most recently autism spectrum disorder. She appears in good health, but recently her recall of events has been conflating truth and facts with fictional recollections of events, only on specific minor details. \n\nNo one in the family has ever received an HD diagnosis, and we do not believe anyone has been tested for HD. Me being me, the anxiety has sent me spiraling connecting these dots, and even has gone as far as to consume me over the last few days. We are considering starting a family and do not know whether testing is viable or necessary, or if this truly is something else other than HD. \n\nThe other key piece is my partner and sister in law saved their mother\u2019s hair to one day have it genetically tested. They were young and without enough money to do testing, but have intentions of one day doing so with their mother\u2019s hair. \n\nIn your personal opinions, what can or should we do? Does this sound like an HD lineage? I understand there will be no Reddit diagnosing, this is more personal experience and analyzing our situation and giving input on your own experiences. Is testing really worth it? This has been so much. Thanks in advance. pm'd you My partner and I are also considering getting a test since his dad has it. I would suggest talking to a genetic conseler about the family history they can give you next steps This. Some of the history you describe could overlap with HD symptoms. Some of it probably not. If it is enough of a concern (sounds like it is) a genetic counselor should be able to help you both clarify things. Crazy runs in families who do not have HD. Stop worrying so much about what might happen and just live your life. Even if your partner or children develop mental illness, they can still have a meaningful lives. Being disabled is not going to make you love them less. But, if that looks super daunting and you cannot see yourself stepping up if your partner gets sick, end the relationship now. This is great advice! Get in contact with a genetic counselor, your partner\u2019s GP can probably suggest someone! Make sure you explain family history, and both of your concerns for the future. I personally would get tested if it were me, but that is because I do have diagnosed family history and I do not want to pass it on. Excellent comment", "Managing health outside HD Hi everyone. I was wondering how people with / with family members with HD navigate managing other health conditions, and cancer screening and dental work. My mom is in probably \u201cmoderate\u201d stage HD,  can still do most things independently, some mobility and speech+swallowing issues. she is otherwise completely healthy and has no other family history or anything. Up until her chorea got worse she did keep up with regular health screening which has never turned up anything. She tried to get a mammogram 5+ years ago but she was moving too much and it did not really work and she is been against getting mammograms and Pap tests since then. She is so ashamed of her chora that she hates leaving the house. She does have a family doctor who we check in with yearly for blood work and a check up but that is pretty much all she is willing to do usually. She has not been to the dentist in a few years for sure. \n\nI just feel guilty that I am not doing more to keep up with this. On the other hand, I do not even know if she would even want treatment should she have a cancer or something. \n\nI do think a lot of this has to do with my anxiety and issues with excessive guilt about all things to do with my mom but I would love to hear advice and how others have navigated their/ their family member\u2019s health outside of HD. \n\nThank you \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "Fuck this horrible evil goddamn terrible fucking disease Fuck everything about it.

Hi,\n\nI apologize in advance if I say something stupid in my post, but I heard about Huntington's disease a few weeks ago and I am still learning about it\n\nLast year I started a relationship with this wonderful woman and a few weeks ago she confessed that her mother died of Huntington's disease. I have never heard of this disease before and I was really shocked with her news because, based on what she said, since this is a genetic disorder, there is 50% that she might have the defective  gene too.\n\nHer mother died when my girlfriend was 18 years. She is 31 now, but she never wanted to get tested to confirm or not if she has the same problem. She is afraid to know the results -- she does not want to know if she will die like her mother or not.\n\nAfter thinking about this for a long time, I came up with an idea: since this is genetic disorder, I assume (please correct me if I am wrong) that it is possible to detect the defective gene in a blood sample (or maybe in a piece of hair).\n\nIf my assumption is correct, I am planning to take a blood sample or a piece of hair from my girlfriend to be tested (without her knowledge) and check the results. If the result is positive for Huntington's disease then I will respect her wish and I will not tell her anything. But if it is negative then I can tell her and remove this huge concern out of her shoulders.\n\nThe idea to have someone tested without her knowledge may sound unethical and I do not blame you for thinking that way, but I am not trying to do this for ulterior motives. I am just trying to help my girlfriend somehow, but I do not know how to do it :(", "Help me take the next step Hi everyone.\n\nI am ready to take the test. I have known for 8 years that my father and grandmother were positive, though I have no idea how many repeats they had. I would like to say I am mentally prepared since I have a neuro PhD and have had a long time to think, but only a psychiatrist can truly say.  All I can say is I do not have a super early onset due to my age and good health so far.\n\nMy primary concerns are twofold:\n1) I want to take the test anonymously with cash due to insurance concerns.\n2) I only want my mother to know about this until I have a result. No significant other, no friends, no other family. \n\nI am in Los Angeles - has anyone taken the test anonymously and can recommend a path forward?  \n\nI am also aware that hiding an HD diagnosis is fraudulent regarding life insurance - curious if anyone has feedback on this aspect regarding regular health insurance.  I do not ever intend to get life insurance unless I test negative, but I am concerned about a positive test making it harder to get or maintain health insurance / longevity of pre-existing condition protections.\n\nThanks. My understanding of the current status of the ACA is that pre-existing conditions are still protected from discrimination of health insurance companies. Though your hesitation is understandable. You may want to look into long-term care insurance prior to testing. \n\nCheck into resources around studies like Enroll HD. They may cover some or all of the costs for testing and travel. As well as keeping the results private. My understanding of their process is that they will even keep the results from you if you choose not to know.\n\nI also just ran across this tonight that is another user's experience in getting tested.\n\n Dude or dudette. You are not mentally ready. You may be in the best place to understand and rationalise it. But be ready to be shook. Either way too. Even a negative result can shake you a bit. Good luck and let us know how you go. \u2764\ud83d\udc4a My understanding is that you want to be a little careful what kind of lab you use, and that the results are so traumatic that you might not want to go it alone. \n\nThe specialist I saw (before getting tested) was able to tell me which labs were good to go to in town, and he also kept my medical records free from any specifics. (No mention of HD is on there, anywhere.) There are a few labs in town which are part of a national network, and these are a fairly good bet although last year one of them experienced a data breach. (And UF one can, I presume others are vulnerable as well.) According to a doctor I have spoken to though, this is not a guarantee that the entity who steals information from their database is able to link it to the actual identities of the people it represents. Apparently it is all numbers. I chose to go to the lab at the university in my town. This means that the entire university has access to this information, but still, the attitude at this point is still in the preservation of identity and anonymity. A doctor outside of the university that I spoke to confirmed with me that although the university has access to this information, my insurance company in all likelihood does not. \nNow this is all rather mysterious and abstract to me, but the specialist who brought up privacy and medical records concerns on my first visit seemed to have my best interests in mind and I decided to place some trust in him and not stress out too badly worrying about my medical record at this point (let us hope that the preexisting conditions protections stay the way they are.). But when the test results were in, I did not receive them directly. He did, and he called me in for a personal visit. I brought my boyfriend, and learned about my  test result, and I have to say I am really thankful I had a specialist to talk to and reckon with in that moment, as well as the person I am closest with to hold hands \u2014 it is jarring and shitty and there are so many questions to ask. The doc was also able to tell me about the trials and research going on right now though, which is a comfort more so now that the initial shock has worn off than it was back in the moment. \nI wish I could be more detailed but this is all I know, and I hope it is helpful to you as you continue to research the best route to getting your result. I wish you good luck and all the best. The ACA protects you from discrimination based on preexisting conditions in health insurance only. Life insurance, disability insurance and long term care insurance are not afforded those protections and a positive test will absolutely preclude coverage there. I was told to get life/LTC/disability coverage before getting my results in order to cover my ass.\n\nThere is also GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008), which affords some protection in employment and health insurance ( I have spent the last year doing the financial CYA stuff- life insurance, disability etc and seeing a genetic counselor. I tested positive about two weeks ago and I cannot describe the experience- I have always been one of those \u201chope for the best/plan for the worst\u201d sort of people and now it is like the worst has happened but I have always believed it would so in a way I am square.\n\nIt is hard to describe. There is a lot of hope for research and treatment but there is no promise that it will be soon. All I can say is you are never ready mentally. Never. It is going to hit you like a ton of bricks, your heart will feel like it is both stopped and racing at the same time. But you can prepare yourself financially in a way that takes some of the fear out of the situation.\n\nI wish you the absolute best of luck.", "My wife's best friend for 30+ years may have HD But she does not want to get tested.

And your wife might strain the friendship by trying to interfere I totally get the concern for your wife's friend. But ultimately it is an intimate decision that everyone needs to make on their own.

", "Looking for advice after learning of our family's unusual Huntington's history Hi! I am a 23-year-old female looking for advice and perspectives on getting tested. I knew our family had a history of Huntington\u2019s, but I honestly thought it was more of a distant history than it actually is. We were talking about Huntington\u2019s Disease yesterday in class, and I called my Dad about it and learned all the details. \n\nI included a visual of my Dad\u2019s side to hopefully help (the ones in squares had/have Huntington\u2019s). Huntington\u2019s affects men and women differently in our family. My great-great grandma and my great aunt experienced severe physical symptoms earlier in life. Neither of them had cognitive issues, so it affected them more physically than mentally. I believe they both lived to relatively old ages. The men in my family normally do not experience symptoms until late in life, and it is usually hand shaking. This excludes my Dad\u2019s cousin, who has had minimal symptoms (occasional tremors) for the past 20 years. He frequently uses marijauna, so we wonder if that has kept his symptoms at bay. Anyway, my Dad says Papa\u2019s hand shaking is just like Papa\u2019s dad, so it is possible that he also has Huntington\u2019s. Basically, I am concerned the situation that happened with my great grandpa and his daughter (great aunt) will happen with my Dad and I. \n\nWith the men developing symptoms later in life and the women developing them sooner, there is really no heads-up for me. I understand why Papa and Dad have not gotten tested, since there is not a lot you can do about the diagnosis. However, the pattern in my family suggests that I may have less time before symptoms appear, if I have the gene. \n\nPart of me does not want to know, but the logical part of me thinks I probably should. If I have it, maybe I should do as much as I can before symptoms start. However, knowing that symptoms will inevitably start would be hard. Should I maintain hope that I do not have it and continue living my life? Or figure it out and live accordingly? There is always the chance that I do not have the gene, and I would feel relieved knowing that. My husband and I have been together for 6 years and recently got married, and he is supportive no matter what happens. He is a nurse currently working in mental health and understands what could happen. I do not want him to have to be a nurse both at work and at home. We are not ready for kids right now, but it is something we have talked about. So, that is something to take into consideration as well.\n\nSorry for the long post! Thank you if you have read it through. I am looking for any advice or perspectives, because I am not sure what to think right now. I understand this has to be my own decision, but any thoughts would be helpful! Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: Because the men in my family do not experience symptoms until later in life, they have all agreed to give their bodies to science for research purposes. While I cannot give you any advice on whether or not you should pursue testing, you may want to consider seeking out a HD center of excellence and speaking with their social worker, neurologist and perhaps a genetic counselor. You do not have to get tested for these meetings and they may be able to answer questions and help you pick a path you are comfortable taking. I wish you all the best and know the uncertainty of all of this can be a really heavy load to carry. Hang in there. Sending big love. Jumping off of this: I also cannot give you advice on testing, but I can tell you as someone who tested young and did not have any counseling or professional support afterwards, I would highly recommend having as much support and information as you can. If you ever want to just talk about the testing process, I would be happy to chat, although my testing experience was admittedly a bit unorthodox. Thank you. I really appreciate it! I will definitely take this into consideration. I am not sure how to feel right now. Feels like hanging in limbo. I am sure it would be helpful to talk about it with a professional familiar with HD. Hey there. I will not say much about myself, but I do HD research. There is a lot about your family that I am very confused about.\n\n1) There is no post mortem test for Huntington's disease, so I am confused as to how your great grandpa was diagnosed after death. It does not seem possible. Can you share more info on that? \n\n2) That being said, has anyone in your family ever been officially tested for HD, while alive.\n\n3) Tremors are not very characteristic of HD. I am not saying those symptoms are not HD, but that would be very odd. HD is characterized by jerky, dancing across rooms, chores movements. Think about hands moving wildly in the air, not tremors.\n\n4) There is really no sex differences in development of HD.\n\n5) HD rarely does not have cognitive issues.\n\nBased on only the information you have shared, it honestly does not seem like this is HD, so it would be helpful if you could confirm who was tested (while alive). You can be tested postmortem. ( The article starts off with \"in theory\" it could be done. It is not common and likely very rarely done. I am sure it CAN be done, but I have not heard of that being the case. That is why I asked OP if they could elaborate on that. Hi! Thank you for responding. I apologize for not responding sooner. I have talked with my Dad about our family history, however I do not have all the details. I may need to do some more digging.\n\nAs far as my great grandpa, I know that he donated his body to science, and our family somehow received word after that he either had or likely had Huntington\u2019s. I am not sure if it was an official diagnosis. \n\nMy great-great grandma and great aunt both experienced the uncontrollable flailing, twitching movements (chorea). A doctor diagnosed my great-great grandma with Huntington\u2019s and my great aunt was later diagnosed as well, considering the family history. They are the only people in my family with official diagnoses. I would assume that doctors would run tests when making the diagnoses, however I am unsure about testing details, just the diagnoses from doctors. My Dad remembers visiting my great-great grandma when he was young, and she had no trouble holding coherent conversations. Her arms would flail wildly during conversation, but she did not appear to have cognitive deficits. It was similar with my great aunt. She was prescribed medication to try to slow/dull the uncontrollable flailing, and it seemed to affect her cognition. On the medication, the movements would slow and so would her mind. Off the medication, the movement would intensify, but she was fully aware and could interact (similar to my great-grandma). They both lived relatively long lives. This is most of my knowledge on my great-great grandma and great aunt\u2019s experiences.\n\nMy second cousin (male, 52), experiences tremors and occasional flailing. So, his arm will shoot up in the air occasionally. My grandpa and great grandpa only experienced tremors. I have been told before that the men in my family get HD later in life, so I assumed the tremors were considered an early symptom that others experience earlier in life.\n\nThe men in our family have been asked to donate their bodies to science to figure out why HD affects them differently. This is what I was told, so I assumed it actually was HD. It could potentially be something else, but this is what our family has been told since my great-great grandma was diagnosed. I currently do not have more information, but I may be able to find out more. Hey &lt;3 I am 32 and finally got a negative test a couple of years ago - HD had been a total family secret before then.   \nI think that ultimately, it comes down to a) what difference knowing might make for you, and b) your personal comfort with ambiguity/risk.  \nAs for a), there is a lot of \"there is no cure so why find out\" - but this is not my attitude! Even in terms of medical research there is a lot of promise. I follow ( and I am a medical librarian, and I follow HD news generally - and we are really not in the same \"hopeless\" situation as we were in the 90s. I think there is a real spectre in HD families of \"no treatment, no point\", but actually we are working on treatments and it is kind of amazing. Knowing might allow you to participate in clinical trials and get early access to certain therapies. On a personal/social level, there are definitely other things you can do - managing finances to be able to live your life to the fullest and plan for a more serious period of illness come to mind. And yeah, if you are open to maybe having kids, having HD may mean that you would have access to certain family planning services.   \n\n\nAs for b), this is the one where I think people have a strong sense of yes or no for themselves. For me it was crystal clear that I wanted to know, no matter what, and I never wavered in that.  I knew that I would have incredible anxiety if I did not know and was left to wonder, whereas my brother has chosen to not find out and seems to have compartmentalized about it - something I just could not do, personally. I already have an anxiety disorder, and I know that for me, tackling known problems is fine, but uncertainty kills me.  \n\n\nI think getting in touch with your local HD association chapter to chat with a mentor or something could be really great. Also, making a first appointment with a genetic counselor will not hurt - they are literally experts in navigating these tough decisions. Hey! Thank you for responding! I have gone back and forth on this, and I appreciate your input and how you broke it down into two general questions.\n\nI am not sure if knowing would make a big difference for me. Being a practical person, I generally like to plan and be prepared. However, I am not sure I would do anything differently if I tested positive. I would continue on the path I am already on. We plan to travel when I finish graduate school. I am the saver in our relationship, so I oversee our finances, and we save/invest as much as we can. If I tested positive, it could be a few years or decades before I experience symptoms. Living in anticipation of what will inevitably come is a scary thought for me. \n\nThat being said, I would be interested in getting tested and participating in clinical trials if I begin experiencing symptoms. I am not sure if it would be too late at that point. The idea of knowing something is coming without knowing when is what is unnerving for me. In this case, I think I might be okay with ambiguity. That is my decision to make about my life, however I do worry about potentially passing it on if we have a child in the future. That is something I struggle with and may discuss with a genetic counselor.", "Newbie to the group Hello im new here tryn to figure out this page thank u!! Hi, sorry you need to know about HD.

My mom has been off for years, maybe most of my life. She did not want to get tested, which I do not blame her for. I got tested and got a positive result back in late April. My CAG is 42. After getting my result, a month later my mom was diagnosed with stage one. I am 21 years old, and my birthday is coming up in a couple days. I just do not know what to do. Im closer with my mom than anyone else, and this news has been earth shattering. I feel like we are both on this time limit, like every moment with her is my last with her being aware of her surroundings. She is still high functioning, and it is been horrible to see her have to process her own diagnosis. Sometimes I wish I had never gotten tested, so she would not have to know. I feel like I am wasting time in my own life. Like there is so much I need to do and see and experience and yet I spend hours on my phone doing nothing. I am pretty devastated. And my inactivity feeds into the depression. I do not know how to be strong for my mom, I do not know how to live the life I want to live. I do not and cannot give up, but this just feels like I am drowning everyday. I do not even think about cures. Hope just leads to more disappointment. And I feel like no-one around me understands.

I appreciate you taking the time to reach out &lt;3 Also what meds r u taking if its not too personal? I take 20mg of celexa daily Could I ask what Celexa does to help? It is an antidepressant. It helps with anxiety and depression and gave me the space to work through my thoughts without getting into the deepy darkies I am 25 and in a similar boat.  Dad does not want to get tested and the possibility of having HD is driving me crazy.  I find myself tripping over my words lately and forgetting things, and I twitch a lot as I am drifting off to sleep.\n\nThis is why I am afraid to go ahead and get tested.  If I am positive I feel like I would have to keep it to myself and it would be too much to bear. Just from personal experience, its near impossible to keep it to yourself. But you should get tested if you think it would benefit your life. Do not stop yourself from that for anyone else. Its your right to know. I will say that it does not stop the worrying, for me it brought everything to the front of my mind, but that is because Im positive.", "Can someone have chorea but not Huntington's? ", "Just found out I am 50/50 for HD. Will my 2 year old be tested? (UK) Hi guys,\n\nMy dad just got diagnosed with HD today with no family history (his dad died young from cancer, so assuming he would have developed it if that had not happened).\n\nTo be honest when my dad told me this news I was like \u2018what is Huntington disease?\u2019 I had not heard of it and assumed it was similar to dementia and only affected you at a later age. Now that I have had the chance to look it up I am upset. \n\nI 100% want to get genetic testing as quick as I can, for 2 reasons: 1) Now I know it is 50/50 I just need to know what is in store. And 2) my 2 year old could now be at risk and I want more children.\n\nAnyway, my question is: When I get tested and find out my results, if I have HD will they then test my child? Or do they want to wait until he is an adult and able to decide for himself?\n\nThank you all Your child cannot be tested until they are 18. It has to be their deco on at that point. I have a 6 month old and found out when she was 2 months that we had a 50% chance of having it so I understand your concern. \n\nWe spoke to a genetic counselor about this topic and she said there is really no benefit to finding out if your child has it. All it does is cause you to worry and possibly affect how you raise your child (in a negative way). \n\nYour option at this point is to wait until they are 18 and let them decide. \n\nSorry for your situation. You are not alone. Good luck. Not till they are 18, I think, at least in the US. FYI, if you do have it and you want more kids who will never have to suffer with this disease, you can do that; it is just a shit sandwich that your partner will have to be 100% on board for. You can do genetic testing on a fetus, then terminate if it turns out to have HD. Maybe you will be lucky; but if you are dedicated to having several more kids, it is more likely you will be staring down the barrel of a few abortions. \n\nTake a LOT of photos and *videos* of your dad. And of yourself, if you have HD. If it is emotionally possible for you, leave your child with videos of you having fun with him, you being the real you with him and pulling dumb pranks/teaching him your favorite hobby/anything with your face, your thoughts, you saying how proud you are of him, even conversations directly to camera that he can watch when he is older. My boyfriend's biggest heartbreak is that he never got to have an adult relationship with his \"real\" father, and over the past 15 years he is forgotten a lot about who his dad used to be.  He still loves his dad, of course, but those old memories are so precious and so ephemeral, and they are slowly getting overshadowed/replaced with this late-stage reality. \n\nVIDEOS. Making the decision to get tested is a complex one and needs time, it is not something you want to rush. You do have options though and in the UK you can have access to PGD IVF where embryos are screened for genetic diseases prior to implantation so you can ensure a future child is free from HD.  Take your time with all of this. Finding out about the disease for the first time is a massive shock and everything feels urgent and panic sets in. I have been through this situation myself and I also run a support group for HD. Get reliable information and support to help you make your choices Please reach out if you have any questions about testing. Went through it about a year ago. I am in the US though. \n\nI remember googling HD in 2012 when I first learned my dad had it. I had no clue either, and reading about it alone was really scary. \n\nIf you have the gene, then getting tested will not change that. The only thing that will change is that you will know what is in store for yourself. I find it empowering. I tested positive. Obviously, not the result I wanted but I am coping with it pretty well a year later. It was a pretty big identity crisis at first for me. \n\nGood luck. You are just as likely to not have it, if that helps! This is very good advice! Other comments have answered your question, but I thought I would add on a bit. People are correct in that your child now must wait until 18 before getting tested. However, if you text negative in the meantime, and I mean truly negative wherein you do not dormantly career the gene, you will know your child is safe as well. I hope your results go well. Waiting to hear mine was beyond nerve wracking, but ultimately the process took a massive weight off my shoulders. Best of luck.", "Waiting on results I got tested a week ago and am now playing the waiting game... Scheduled to get results in mid-December. Feeling oddly at peace, but also like my life is in limbo.

Everyone on this page Weill be here for you", "Feeling depressed at a wedding\u2026 advice welcome. Hello my friends. I find myself sitting outside at a wedding overcome by emotion. I am 24. Been with my partner for 5 years. We are thinking of getting married soon ish\u2026 well were thinking of if anyway. Now I am not so sure. It would not likely be next summer but the summer after that just financial and job wise\u2026 and I am so so angry that thinking about my moms HD and how advanced it may or may not be by that point will have to factor in to what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life. When I think of it all I think of is dread. How can I get married without my momma there\u2026 by my side walking me down the isle. Giving a speech. Dancing with me. And god the questions I am sure I will get or the talking behind my back. \u201cWhat is wrong with her mom\u201d \u201cwhy cannot she walk or talk\u201d I just is devastating to think about. A friend of mine recently rushed and engagement and wedding due to her moms cancer diagnosis and it has made me feel super guilty about not doing the same thing. Does anyone have experience or advice they can offer. Or even just kind words or a virtual hug. I need it right now :( Truly, I am not sure which, but either wisdom or ignorance comes with age. As you get older, you realize that every family has problems, and everyone loses family as the years progress. It is true, most 24 year olds have experienced HD or other similar diseases, but by the time they are 34 or 44, they will have seen it. \n\nThere will never be a perfect situation. Just focus on what feels right. If it means getting married later, then do it later. Do not worry what impression others will have of your mom. If you feel the need, talk to those closest and explain it. Word will get around eventually. \n\nLove your mom. She did what she could. Realize that life happens, and you just deal with it as it comes. We got married late, and had kids late. We manage as we can. \n\nKeep hope for treatments to improve. Things like Crispr offer great promise, though the long waits are gruesome. I am so sorry for what you are going through and I know that it can be rough to watch your parent with HD decline. My Father passed away when I was only 12, and I am 27 now, and not a day goes back that I do not miss him. Losing someone is painful, there is no right answer to handling these kinds of events, especially with regards to your wedding and your mother.\n\nMy advice would be to have your mother there, even if she cannot dance with you or walk you down the isle. You do not know how much longer that you have left. To hell with what other people think, bring her along. I have got a virtual hug for you. As far as rushing to get married goes I do not think there is anything wrong with waiting till you are both ready. Imo your both still young so I hope you do not feel pressured to run into marriage. I had a 5 year relationship that started when I was 17 end just because we both grew and changed. Not saying that would happen to you all, just encouraging you all to take your time. \n\nAs for your mom, I just have condolences. My only advice is to try and love and appreciate her while you have time. Tell her you love her and make sure she knows. The memory of that will help you in the future. I know it is scary and sad to think about her future, but you cannot control it. What condition she is in when the time comes is not something that can be known. So spend what time you can while you can and make memories. Because unfortunately we are often forced to go through much more than just a weeding without our mom/dad due to HD. All we can do is love them with all our heart while we can. Sending you virtual hugs. This is a tough situation to be in. Could you involve your mom in some of the planning for the wedding, keeping her updated on all your choices of dress, music, and flowers along the way, so that she feels connected to this milestone event in your life? Forgive me if you are already doing this and I am stating the obvious.\n\nOn the day of your wedding, perhaps you could have a few close friends or family members who understand HD and who are there to ensure that your mom has everything she needs to feel comfortable, so that you do not need to worry about her. Almost like a protective, loving circle surrounding her. I love my mom more than anything! Getting married without her would feel wrong. I am at least lucky she knows my partner well and likes him a lot. Thank you for your advice and yes keep the hope alive for treatments in the future. Your comments on everyone is posts in this group are always so helpful, kind and empathetic. I really, really appreciate you. Honestly it feels good to hear take your time from people because that is what I feel in my heart but I just have a lot of guilt coming with that. I love my mom so much and I tell her a sickening amount! She gets tired of me sometimes because I smother her. Its one of the only things I feel I can do. Thank you so much for your advice and support from the bottom of my heart. you lost your dad so young, I am heartbroken to hear that. I hate this awful disease. I love my mom more than anything and it feels wrong to imagine these events without her when that very well could be the reality. Im just trying to make her proud and make memories with her while we can. thank you so much for your comment. yes you are totally right keeping her involved in any capacity she can will be exactly the thing to do. We enjoy going shopping together now and thinking of going wedding dress shopping with my mom makes me tear up.. I really hope she is there to see it. I really really like the idea about the protective circle. I actually texted my auntie the night I posted this and shared some of these concerns with her and she said that she would do this for her. Thank you for the sweet reply. I honestly did not realize my comments were that noticeable but I guess it is a small community. This is a community on Reddit that has helped me a lot. I was not informed what specifically my mom had until my dad told me when I turned 25. Id be lying if I said I did not fear going through what my mother did. And having posts and people to talk/read about their experiences as will as testing info has been invaluable. And then for all the younger posters having to watch parents go through HD I have nothing but a river of empathy. I wish I had the energy and love to help more but in recent days I have distanced myself from reddit. I always gravitate towards the news and what is going on and it is all.. a bit much. \n\nWishing you nothing but warmth.", "Have not told my 18 year old that get father has huntingtons. My husband has huntingtons disease. His father died early and the family history is questionable.  Neurologist has confirmed that it is huntingtons. I have known 5 years but cannot tell child (18)  until they finish college any thoughts? \n His sister has refused this diagnosis and I understand. I just do not want my child to deal with this until they have to. Is it better to let them in on what is going on or do I could continue I use that as a cover.  My husband has the organic denial so everything is cause of the brain bleeds.\n My mom was diagnosed a few years ago but she had already started showing symptoms. As a male in my early 30s it started really bothering me when she had to move in with me. My dad had got cancer around the same time and they werent able to support themselves so the wife and I had bring them in. Now watching this disease progress it has brought up a feeling of impending doom. It makes it hard to plan things for the future. I have 2 sisters that have already been diagnosed and its been really hard on the family. I tell you this because ignorance is bliss and my world changed with this diagnoses. Your son might be better off not knowing but he might be mad to have something so important kept from him. You will know that better. Stuff like this doesnt get kept secret for long though. Personally I would not keep it a secret.  Your son is 18 and as such is entitled to making some decisions on his own.  Let us put it this way - if your family was at risk for other hereditary diseases like heart disease, cancer, alzheimers or diabetes.. would you keep that from them?  I feel like it is important for your family to know about their medical history, and it is just as important that they are not scared of the disease or that it is treated like a dirty secret.  You can still have a fulfilling life with HD but you might make certain life choices differently knowing it is a possibility.\n\n Of course that is just my personal opinion and you are free to make your own choices too.  This is really not an easy decision to make!\n\n I think you should strongly consider telling your child. They are an adult now; they are going to be making huge decisions about their life, and this is something hugely important. Maybe they want to make sure to take advantage of opportunities in college; maybe they want to start saving more aggressively; maybe it will influence how careful they are about accidental pregnancies, or what kind of job they go into. Also, how early did your husband develop symptoms / was their repeat count high? Because expansions happen, especially between father and child, and your child could get it earlier than their parent if they are gene positive. \n\nI can only imagine that you just want to protect your kid, but if I were them, I would be furious that this was kept from me. This disease can make you feel helpless as it is; I at least appreciated that I was able to make my own decision about finding out. And, if you tell them now instead of it them finding out on their own or it coming out accidentally, you can go to the conversation prepared with information and support for them.  A young adult should be made aware of the diagnosis because when they reach the stage of planning their own families it is a vital consideration. IMHO. Yes I will defiantly tell my child...I just want to wait till she finishes college.  I hope that the cure is found by then.  All who are dealing with this, my heart goes out to you. Any caretakers experiencing the organic denial?  We are defiantly taking precautions against pregnancy. ", "HD on MLB Network show Hot Stove today Sorry for so many Joe Smith/Allie LaForce  posts lately.  They have been doing a lot of higher profile interviews lately for their charity and bringing attention to HD. Today MLB Network had almost 10 minutes with them live from Astros Spring Training.\n\n(\n My wife and I had a son born via PGD IFV two months ago so I am really excited that they have refocused  their charity on providing financial support for people with HD looking to have children via this process.  Knowing that my son will not have HD like his mom/grandfather/great-grandmother is a comforting thought.", "Seeing mom late stage for the first time I saw my mom for the first time in a year, and her decline was really shocking.  I do not really know who to talk to about this,but I have to.  I guess here might be okay?  I am sorry if it is not.\n\nShe is been symptomatic for a long time, but she is always been essentially herself.  Just increasingly irrational, but in ways that are in keeping with her personality.  She did so well on her cognitive tests that her doctors would not force her to receive any kind of care, even though she was exhibiting pretty extreme physical symptoms and had a BMI around 15.  She got very angry when anyone suggested help, and refused care.  The Health Authority sent social workers after my reports, but they would not intervene.  We were all very worried and frustrated.\n\nShe was finally involuntarily hospitalized in July after a series of falls, and was recently placed in a very nice nursing home.  \n\nI have not visited her since last Christmas (she moved far away to be near other family, and we have a difficult relationship).  My husband, baby, and I visited her this weekend and she is just... shockingly different.  She was living by herself last time, and now she can barely move.  She was still calling me six months ago, and now she cannot communicate at all.  I thought she was happy to see us.  But I brought her pictures of the baby to put in her room, and when I showed them to her, she tried to rip them up and threw them on the floor.  That was the first really out of character thing she is ever done with me.  I do not know if she is furious, frustrated, or has lost the last shred of herself.\n\nI do not even know how to feel.  I am relieved that she is being well cared for.  I have never liked to conversations with her, but it feels strange to know that we can never have a have one again.  I feel awful that she is lost so much.  I feel guilty that I could not help more and angry that she would not let me.  And confused about her behaviour.  And scared for my own future and my daughter\u2019s.  Other things that I cannot put my finger on.  It is just a big old bundle of feelings that I do not know how to process. I saw my granny for the first time in years when she was in the home.  She died a few months later, feb 2019.  \n\nThe time I would seen her before that she was still at her home, mobile, could still communicate.  When I went to see her in the home (which I hated) it was unbelievable how quickly her symptoms had progressed.   She could take a couple of steps, but that was it.  No communication.  No conversations.\n\nBefore she was put into the home she had similar reactions.  She started burning her clothes and possessions.  I felt so so much guilt for not going to see her.  I had started uni and I did not have a car to travel to hers.  It is a poor excuse but it is what it is.  I am so glad I took the step to see her in the home though.\n\nYou emotions wont ever really be sorted out.  It is the nature of the beast.  Even once your mum has passed away, you will always worry about your baby.  My dad has it, he does not seem to have any physical symptoms yet.  \n\nI am currently going through testing.  I get the test on the 15th of january.  But I am also at the stage where I want children and it does stress me out.  There are always going to be bad days for you.  The best thing I have found for myself is letting myself have those bad days.  I let myself drown in the sadness and guilt and fear and when I wake up the next day I feel like my head is so much clearer.  I know it will never go away though.  I also find meditation and tapping techniques really helpful, but there will be things that help bring you back to today, to focus on what today has for you and your family.  I find when I am most overwhelmed, I try and think about how insanely massive the universe is and I try to remind myself that really, nothing matters.  Nothing at all.  We are all going to die and it wont affect the galaxy, moon and starts in anyway shape or form haha.\n\nIf you want to talk about it you can send me a message (I have no idea if this is a function on reddit or not).  Its a hellish thing to go through but you will go through it and you will still be able to enjoy the moments that are important \u2764 \" send me a message (I have no idea if this is a function on reddit or not).  \" = hover over the name, a box pops up with the ability to message. You can also click on the user name and see their stuff and message. Sorry about the meanness. My lady is getting more and more of that. Try for calm, that helps a lot. The frontal cortex works a lot longer than the obligata part of the brain. That means she can think of stuff more than she can get it in and out. So the way to handle that is to put something in and then wait. You can still have conversations, but expect them to take longer. There is a great talk out there about, hurry up and wait, if you google that phrase you may find it.   Lower outside signals, go simple. I am sure after a year you have a lot to share, your baby may have been fussy from the trip, your husband was there and there is a whole thought process around him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you take another visit soon, she probably needs it. She tries to speak constantly, but the words are unintelligible to everyone.  She probably could communicate if she had speech therapy, or some kind of communication aid, but she will not.  She is *incredibly* stubborn.\n\nNow that my baby is old enough to travel and my mom is in a safe environment, we will try to make it over more. It is kind of strange, but thinking about how insignificant and ephemeral we are helps me too.  If nothing really matters, may as well enjoy the time we have.\n\nI hope your testing goes well.  Feel free to send me a message if you want, too.", "I do not know where to put this but.. My name is Leah, I am 23 years old and am at risk for HD. We just found out that all four sisters out of my moms family (including my mom) have all been diagnosed with HD and I have shown certain \"symptoms\" that worried my doctor enough to sit me down and tell me I needed to get tested. I decided in my own interest that I would rather know for sure so early part of this coming week I am taking the test. I am super extremely scared and I did not know where else to turn...so I thought I would come here....\n\nUPDATE: So it never occurred to me (not knowing much about HD) that I would have to go to a geneticist and not get the test ran just in the doctors office.

He would been symptomatic for around 15 years and enjoyed a modicum of quality of life for the first 10, but the last five saw him decline rapidly. I apologize in advance if I am breaking any rules or this is not appropriate, I just needed to vent. Fuck Huntington\u2019s disease. Fuck HD for taking our father and then my brother. Fuck HD for leaving my brother\u2019s girlfriend without the man she loved so deeply. Fuck HD for making our mom see her oldest son die by inches until he breathed his last at 6:48 am today. Fuck HD for taking my son\u2019s uncle from him and robbing them of the chance to know who he was before. Fuck HD for taking my brother away from me. I am alternating between feeling numb and relieved that his suffering is done, rage at this god awful disease, and sadness at all the things he did not get to do. But under it all, fuck Huntington\u2019s disease. I am so sorry for your loss. Sending love and light your way. Tell me about your brother. Yes! So much this! I want to rage at it and fight it with every inch of my being!\n\nIt took my husband\u2019s grandma, aunt, great aunt, and we are seeing it slowly take over his mom. My husband found out he has it on Friday. FUCK Huntington\u2019s. \n\nWe are all in this together. He loved music and desperately wanted to make a living with it. His bands would play some shows and have some success, but never quite broke through. He had a wicked sense of humor and loved sarcasm and irony. He suffered from a metabolic deficiency that made him unable to get b12 from food that led to severe paranoid delusions that we thought were from HD, but got much better once he was diagnosed and got b12 shots. He loved cats and at one point shared 5 with his wife. He was a member of Act Up and cared about HIV issues, attending many of their demonstrations in the 90s. He was sometimes self-centered and occasionally selfish, but he was human and flawed like we all are. He was my ally growing up when our parents were being bonkers in their divorce and the bitterness that lasted for years after. He drew funny cartoons that when he was 13 caught the eye of the girl who would later become his girlfriend after his wife left him due to his becoming abusive  from his paranoid delusions. She worked tirelessly to visit him, make him comfortable, and give him the best quality of life he could have until the end. I am so sorry for your husband\u2019s diagnosis. I hope the two of you can make plans now to know what kind of quality of life he wants, what he is willing to accept , and when you will need to make hard choices that will respect you and your husband\u2018s beliefs. I wish you all the best and hope that you guys can figure out the best steps to take so that he can live a life that is worth living and that your future and his future is planned for\ufffc. Seek and except help from every source you can and never be too proud to reach out when you need it. Fuck Huntington\u2019s disease.\ufffc  You have my sympathies. He sounds like he was a pretty interesting guy flaws and all. Sounds like he was a caring person too.  I like to think that I am a caring person that wants the best for all people regardless of the background but I have never taken the time to be a part of a demonstration or protest. I think that speaks volumes to the type of person your brother was. He took the time. I will try to do better and get myself out there to stand up for something I believe in.  Thank you for sharing about your brother.  Thank you. I appreciate the advice. We with your nothing but the best in your life going forward. Fuck HD! My brother is living at risk and the thought of him going through what my dad is kills me. I am sorry you had to go through all that. Sometimes seeing my dad at his worst almost makes me wish he was at peace in a way. Not wishing death on my father, obviously, just tough is all. You are not alone man; God bless. Hang in there, and do not be shy about getting therapy or other help to deal with what your dad is going through. My dad had a hard road before he died and it fucked me up for a long time. It is easy to be overwhelmed by their needs and forget about your own.", "Did the timing or severity of your symptoms differ from your parent's with a similar CAG repeat? My Mom (57F) and I (32AFAB)  have 41 CAG repeat. My Mom did not get significant symptoms until she was 50, with more rapid increase the last 5 years. In hindsight mild symptoms began a few years earlier. She can still walk a couple miles with occasional falls and has those flailing elbows and restless legs. Her cognitive/mental symptoms are much more advanced with paranoia, memory issues, depression, etc.\n\nMy care team, including my neurologist, told me that even though my CAG repeat is the same, I could quite possibly be looking at symptoms in my early 40s. The only thing she could say with some confidence, was it would be \"very unlikely\" for me to have symptoms in the next 10 years. She said my symptoms can hit me like a truck, or start slow and rapidly increase like my Mom. Before this point, I thought my symptom onset would be very similar to my mom so Id know what to expect. This seems like not the case though. \n\nWhat were your experiences with this? Anyone have wildly different experience than their HD-pos parent with similar CAG repeats? I spent a lot of time with a research team. Everyone is on their own path. Do not put too much weight in your observations. I tested positive last week but as far as I know I am not symptomatic yet (35f CAG41). My dad tested positive with CAG 40. He is in his early 70\u2019s and was diagnosed 6 months ago after some stroke like symptoms, difficulty swallowing, slurring words, balance issues. \n\nThe genetic councillor was really clear with me before testing not to get hung up on the number. When I tested 41 last week, there was no \u2018you might follow your dads path\u2019, only that you would hope for that, nothing more. \n\nIt is still raw for me, but from the process I went through and my understanding, I could be dead by 50 even though my dad is in his 70\u2019s. Me and my sibling may be wildly different, and someone is 40 is someone else\u2019s 48. There is no telling. This is down to the fact that the disease can also be impacted by a lot of environmental or unknown contributors, so there is just no way they can predict it beyond \u2018you will almost certainly develop it one day\u2019.\n\nI wish I could reassure you, as I am probably trying to reassure myself right now (it is only been a week), but I fear there is no answer. I will check your post with hope though :) \nRegardless, I give you a big virtual hug and hope that your a late and mild onset. You have got a long way to go. IF you are similar to your dad, you could have another 30+ years before becoming symptomatic. A lot can happen in that time. \n\nLook at cystic fibrosis, which is another awful genetic disease. A new drug recently came out and it is a game changer. People that were planning on dying in their 20s or 30s are now being told they could live to 50+. Do not give up hope, you have got a lot of gas left in the tank. My dad died at 57 and had symptoms from his thirties. My uncle (dad's bio brother who was also HD positive) is 53 with no symptoms (that we know of). I know it is just one example but it shows one parent does not affect kids in the same way and so there is not necessarily a correlation. I hope I do follow his timeline, and I am definitely hopeful of medical advances. With any luck, it is quite a straightforward disease to manage when the right treatment is found. \nThanks for the positive reminder. It is easy to try and be too \u2018realistic\u2019 given the councilling information, but the reality is also hopeful at the same time Yeah, unfortunately there is no crystal ball with these things. All you can do is the best you can with the knowledge you now have. Try to live as healthy a life as possible and make good choices: wear sunscreen to protect from DNA damage, limit alcohol and sugar intake, do not smoke, eat healthy, exercise, get good sleep. Same stuff everybody should be doing. I am just trying to live as healthy as I can while still enjoying my life, and I hope that a treatment will be here by the time I show symptoms. I am 30 and my CAG is 40. Wow that is a substantial difference. I am sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing. I appreciate hearing other peoples experiences. Thank you for sharing. My test was also quite recent, the beginning of January. It sounds weird to say, but it does \"get better\". More like, you have to accept the reality of your diagnosis and not let the test result destroy your life.\n\n I went through classic stages of grief. Now I feel a little better, but I do have weird triggers. Like every time someone complains about getting old, or even seeing elderly people running marathons and stuff. I know not everyone stays in great shape through to their 80s, but it still triggers some resentment. \n\nBig virtual huge right back at ya. You are right there is no answer. Best thing my therapist told me was let yourself feel what you have to feel. Do not be in a rush to just be okay with it. Its still early and raw. You will get there in time. Always good advice. I try to be healthy as possible while still indulging. My Bubbe did a lot of partying in the 60s (model in NYC lifestyle). I always wondered how much hard drug use affected her symptoms. But, that gave my Mom huge motivation to always prioritize health and fitness and really drilled that into me and my siblings.\n\nI do think there will be some kind of treatment. But, I also feel that treatment probably wont be the equivalent of just taking a Tylenol. I know its not the same, but although Cancer has treatment, it is not 100% effective nor particularly pleasant. I think of it as \"This is going to happen to me, and I need to accept that. There is also a chance there will be effective treatment, and my experience will not be like my family's\". True that... Although, PTC is working on small molecule drugs that you can take orally. I think your outlook is realistic and accurate on the expectations. \n\nTo answer your original question specifically, I have met people in their 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s who are gene positive and showing only mild symptoms. Then I have also met people in their 40\u2019s who have severe symptoms. It just sucks, there is so much else at play in addition to the one gene - there are many genes that interact with it and there is a lot of variation, even between siblings with the same CAG repeat. There is no other way is there other than to accept. Do you think we might be better equipped to deal as we are a bit older finding out? I feel like a lifetime of tools has definitely helped so far. I did almost cry watching Star Trek Discovery earlier, so I think the emotions are starting to kick in. I do trust I will come out the other end. I find myself sighing sometimes, like my brains just full.\n\nHow do you feel about the impact on having a child? Sorry if that is forward. You may not want one and that would be ok. I have not looked at any of your previous posts to find out what your family situation is or whether you already have children. Feel free to message If you would prefer that to be private. Absolutely better equipped. I thought about it a couple times in my 20s before I got tested. Even went to the genetic counselor a couple times and decided against it. I concentrated the next few years on emotionally preparing and learning mindfulness and radical acceptance. I got established with a therapist who was already familiar with Huntington's and specializes in people effected by terminal illness. I am so glad I waited, I have a lot of coping skills and emotional intelligence I did not have in my 20s. \n\nI actually never really wanted children anyway. I ended up getting my tubes tied a couple months I even got tested for HD.  One of my sisters is pretty set on having kids. She is going to do IVF and choosing not to know if any embryos have it. There is a nonprofit out there that pays for IVF for people at risk. \n\nI have heard Discovery is pretty good. Maybe I should watch it! I have a few comparisons to make in my family: mine with my mother, her sister, and their mother.  My mother's CAG is the same as mine and her sister's, and would theoretically be the same or higher than their mother's.\n\nI was symptomatic about 5 years earlier than any of them, though they all were un- or mis- diagnosed at the same time.\n\nI did see a huge difference between my mother and her sister - more exercise and better nutrition and less stress.  The older sib is the one still alive and coherent. What do you mean by restless legs?  Can you describe the early symptoms you think you missed at the time? Thank you.\u2764\ufe0f Chores in the legs", "My mom is losing her ability to communicate and it is hard for me to cope My mom\u2019s first symptoms of HD started when she was in her 40\u2019s. She is 51 now. Her symptoms have gotten progressively worse, to the point where she can only say a few phrases/words. It is really hard for me to watch. I will say something to her and she just stares at me not able to say anything back. Sometimes I will repeat what I said and her body will start making uncontrollable movements so then I stop talking because I do not know if I am stressing her out by expecting her to say something. It breaks my heart and is too much for me to watch. I feel like I lost her already. I do not feel strong enough to deal with this. All I can offer is sympathy. This is such a crappy place to be. I am sorry you all are going through it. I remember the exact same challenges with my Mom. I do not look forward to this with my brother as his symptoms progress. My advice is to be patient. She maybe trying to talk and it is taking her a long time. My mom would take about 15 seconds a word. Also try making a board with common responses and phrases. Let her point to the response. Thank you I appreciate your kindness. It really is a cruel disease. I am very sorry to hear about your mother, and your brother. I have a brother too and he has not been tested yet, so it is scary to think about. I wish the best for you. I am sorry to hear this. My dad got to that point and for the years he was alive following that point he never said more than one word at a time, if at all. However, he loved to email us (he never had a cell phone or anything more convenient than a laptop with email access). Sometimes it was soon after a conversation, sometimes the next day, or sometimes not at all. Most of the time his emails made sense, every once in a while I would have no clue what he was talking about. But all this to say, if there is a way to get your mom to communicate in a way that does not involve speech it could be worth a shot. I do not think my dad would have done well with a touch-screen, but actually pressing the keys on a keyboard was easy enough for him. Thank you that is a good idea, I will try that. When I speak to her I sometimes do try to wait for about 30 seconds but she still does not respond a lot of the time. I will definitely try making the board though and see if that helps. Make the words big and spread them out. Maybe even make the words different colors Thank you, I am sorry about your dad as well. It is really tough. It is good that he was able to email you guys though. My mom does not use the computer but she is able to text on her phone a little bit. She texts me every morning saying good morning and she loves me. I respond back and she does not say any more after that. I never know if she wants to text me more though. I do not know if it is stressful for her or not. I could probably try asking her if she wants to text more and see what she says. I am sorry you have to go through this. \n\nOne of the hardest parts for me, with my dad, was when he lost the ability to read. Books were so important to us. So I started reading to him. Sometimes it was awkward, because I was a kid, and his books had curse words, and mom was in the next room. But it ended up being special memories.\n\nI hope you can find some peace with it, because you are right. You have lost her already in some ways. I have been where you are and you have my sympathies. Try to be kind to yourself. What your going through It is difficult, and you are justified in feeling it as such. \n\nIf I had any advice In hindsight, it is to not always try and avoid the emotions. It is okay to be sad, to cry. It is okay to be sad with her and hold her hand while sad. You can mourn the change in your mother while she is still around to hold your hand. \n\nMy best wishes. I have some close friends who I sometimes communicate with using only emojis.  A heart, a thumbs up, a smile, a sad face.  We really are communicating.  If typing in words is hard for your mom, maybe just choosing an emoji or gif would be easier.  You could still be in communication during the day without the stress of her typing words. It is been mentioned to wait. I count to 10. \n\nBut also, remember, open ended questions and prompts will stymy your ability to communicate. Because the HD brain gets like a bogged-down computer, searching and searching and loading and loading and perhaps even coming back empty.\n\nAsk and prompt with forthought. \n\nDid you like the chicken or the fish?

I fell in love with this amazing person just under 2 years ago we have a beautiful 7 month old. She is been a victim of a horrible human being that took advantage of her from a young age. I met her as an adult and helped her out of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.   \n\n\nI found out this beautiful amazing person potentially has huntingtons disease, her father died of it and her mother lied and said it was only men that got it. She lived her whole live denying it was possible till she met me...I feel like the deveil himself.  \n\n\nShe does show signs, lack of speech at times. Emotional ups and downs and severe depression that comes and goes. She loves our daughter and can look after her whilst I am at work. But social services, the hospital have all been involved since my daughters birth because of the risk of her potentional condition. They are very happy and took a step back (she is an amazing mother).  \n\n\nMy issue is that I am seeing more and more signs shes going into her 30's now and her coordination, speech, memory and emotions are becoming varied. She finally has got an appointment with a specialist next month but I am so scared. I love her to bits and she can only remember her real dad since her step dad abused her for so long.  \n\n\nShe remembers how he used to adore her and take her on amazing trips to beaches and theme parks, but she also remembers the times where he got violent and inhuman. I do not want this for our daughter, I want her to live with both parents who100000000% love her till the end of the world and further, I just do not know how I would cope if she was actually diagnosed. I have been told it is 50/50 for her and that is 50 too much for me. I am sorry you are going through this. I hope you and your love can find peace. This disease is not gentle on families.  As a child of someone with Huntington's who is also at risk I want you to know your child will remember everything good. My mother has her ups and downs and has been getting progressively worse but I do not love her any less, I do not think she loves me any less even if at times things are bad. Children have a way of understanding things that adults do not. She may be very young but she will know her mom loves her I promise. \n\nAs far as being supportive for her, that is the best thing you can do. Love her through the good and the bad. Love her through the outbursts and the keeping to herself. Remember when things get bad the person you love is not the one doing anything it is the aweful disease. If you ever need someone to talk to I am here as I am sure most people are on this sub.  I have seen first-hand that the irritation can be controlled. A quiet, calm, and organized life keeps all the stressors low. I can completely understand why she was abused so much many have experienced similar. Good on you boy. Look into the latest trials from Wave and Ionis, there is hope, a shot in the spine every month.  I know this is just anecdotal, but I wanted to mention that my dad had Huntington's disease and he loved me and my sister until the very end. Despite the HD, I cannot remember him ever getting angry at us, and he was always there whenever we needed him. Even when he was trapped in a nursing home, in the late stages of the illness, and could not move or walk on his own, he would still ask the nurses to pick up birthday cards for us every year. My entire life, he never once missed a birthday or holiday... He was a really great dad and I have so many good memories from my childhood with him. I love him and miss him pretty much every day.      \n\n\nI guess what I am getting at is that I think it is still definitely possible to give your kids a good upbringing with HD in the picture. There are also drugs now that can help mitigate some of the anger issues that might crop up later on, assuming they ever do. And, of course, research is progressing at an incredible speed these days. Maybe I am being overly optimistic, but I really do believe we will have some sort of treatment in the next 10-15 years.

I have felt like a prisoner to fear this past year, and it is only gotten worse this past month. I have put the possibility of this disease to the back of my mind, hoping to get the strength in my 30s to get tested. I am 25 and scared, but I need to know now. Can anyone give any advice or resources for help? I live in Texas and the closest major city is Fort Worth.  Hey /u/Imsureyoualreadyknow \n\nWas it just a year ago that you found out about being at risk? It is hard watching a parent suffer and to know that there is such a chance that you will go through something similar\n\nI think being in the 'at risk' group and not knowing is the scariest part, you have all the same worries that you would have about your future as you would if you had a confirmed diagnosis, but you are not able to really make any decisions or plans. \n\nI was 24 when my dad was diagnosed, no known family history, it was all new to all of us. I decided to get tested as soon as i could. For me the decision to test was simple, the process and emotions around it were not.\n\nI know that the prospect of a positive result is terrifying, but the way i viewed it was that having the test does not change my status. Either i had the faulty gene, or I did not. For me the test would confirm either way and, if I tested positive, allow me to put the things in place to get the support and focus on living my life and doing the things i want to do.\n\nI tested positive and at first it is devastating, you feel like you are life is over. But living with the knowledge gets easier, sure it plays on your mind at times and it has to be considered with any major life decisions. It will put a strain on relationships, you will feel at times like you are going to be a burden, partners may feel the same way.\n\nIf you can access it, look for counsellors who specialise in genetic conditions. The SHDA have been really supportive for me, HDSA would be your go to.  Talk to people, talk to friends and family, other people who have been through similar diagnoses and people with HD.\n\n\nIf you are considering starting a family, it is possible to do a selective IVF where they test the embryos before they are implanted. This can even be done without a confirmed diagnosis of HD for yourself.\n\nTry and stay positive, it does help. There are going to be times that it feels like you are trapped or completely on your own. It is OK that there will be times when it so occupies your mind that you literally can do nothing else. But it doesnt need to be all of the time, if you feel like that more often than not, then seek help for it.\n\nSomething else that helps me is looking at the development of treatments, how much things have changed in the last 10-15 years, good progress is being made on a lot of fronts. Most of it is just on treating symptoms or slowing progression, rather than curing just now, but it is all very positive.\n\nIf you have any questions, or just need someone to vent to, i do not mind trying to help.  I am not trained or offering special advice or anything, just someone a little further down the road than where you are. I am in Australia so cannot help with anything specific in your area. But ask yourself this question- what will you do with the information? Would you live your life any differently? This is excellent advice all round. Why, thank you kind stranger!  - the Huntington's Disease Youth Organisation - connects young people from HD-impacted families to help and support each other (and yes, at 25 you still qualify). You can share your thoughts and experiences from people in similar situations. TALK TO YOUR HD SUPPORT GROUP!  There must be one near you in Ft Worth.  \n\nListen, my opinion is my own and no one else's, and I do not expect that my opinion will come out of your mouth.  But to me, this information you seek is just the truth.  If you get a positive result, then the truth is you have had it all along.  Not knowing does not mean maybe you dodge the bullet, the bullet will still get you.  If you are positive then you know for sure, and then it only remains for you to live the life that is most reflective of your values and dreams.  Plan for your goals, be realistic, be present.  \n\nIf you do not have it, WHAT A GIFT to find that out, right?     I have known since I was 7 when my mother was diagnosed, but I was told from that time until I was 18 that it only passes from from father to daughter or from mother to daughter. I think my dad did not want to scare me so I spent a majority of my life believing I would not have it. Once I started doing my own research after meeting someone who was also I risk I was a bit devastated to know the truth. I have not experienced the disease first hand, my mom abandoned us when I was a baby so I never knew her. She called my dad in 97 to inform him she had tested positive. I was also told it was curable. As you can see I had a different impression of the disease and did not put much thought into. On my 20th birthday my dad told me I needed to be tested to make life decisions and I have felt so angry about it all since then. Last year I started experiencing twitches in my legs and it started a full blown anxiety attack. When I research the symptoms and first hand accounts the only ones I can say I have are twitching and anxiety. But recently, a month ago,  I had a spout of insomnia and did not sleep for 5 days. I just paced around my apartment letting the thoughts of this disease consume me. I am doing much better now, but I am still consumed with the possibility of this disease and have already made the decision to be tested. I am just playing the waiting game and looking for resources as a test for me in this state will cost almost 1000 dollars. Which I cannot afford and my insurance will not pay for it.  Hi there /u/I'msureyoualreadyknow! So, I currently live in Plano (in Dallas) and they just started up a young adult support group meeting a few months ago. I have only been a few times, but there are 3 or 4 of us so far and everyone is really nice. I think they would likely have access to local resources if anyone would. \n\nI will send you a PM with their contact info in case you would be interested in getting on their email list or just asking after resources. The meetings are usually the first Monday of every month, so the next one should be coming up on June 5th. I am sorry to hear how you found out about it.\n\nFrom what I can tell most of what we know about the disease in terms of the cause and genetics side has been learnt in the last 20 years or so. It is possible in '97 that your dad's knowledge of the disease wasnt sufficient to help you, it sucks though.\n\nAnyone who is at risk will look for and often find symptoms that match with the start of the onset of the disease, every little jerk of your muscles or depressive episode and you make the connection. It is important to remember that they could also still be unrelated. \n\nSee if your GP or a specialist can help you identify any other potential causes. Anxiety and insomnia go hand in hand with depression (which I also suffer). I spoke to my neurologist who said that whilst the depression and short temper are potentially early signs, I also had a lot going on that was a more likely explanation for the difficulties that i was having.\n\nIf you are struggling with it mentally and emotionally, can you see a counsellor or therapist? \n\nI realise i am suggesting seeing these services and you potentially have to pay for all of them, I do appreciate that, everything has been covered by the NHS here.  I have no knowledge of insurance companies, but it seems harsh that they wont help cover the cost of a test.  I do not know what i would have done if i would have needed to find that money when i was getting tested. I can relate. I am 25, live in Dallas and work in Fort Worth. Just a few months ago, my mother died from complications of Huntingtons disease. Hopefully when I talk to my doctor next week, I will have the courage to bring up my desire to get tested. Living with the possibility of having this disease is doing nothing positive for me. ", "May 5th is results day I do not even know how to describe how I feel about that. I have been adamant since I was 14 that I want to know as soon as I could, but every day closer to results day I question that just a little more. \n\nEvery doctor I had to see throughout the testing process seemed to be trying to convince me not to do it, but I was persistent. I know I am just getting nervous, and I am sure my fence sitting is because it is coming up soon. I mean, just a month ago I was determined to get my results. \n\nI just wanted to see if anyone else had the same feeling about it I do now, but got their results anyways. Do you regret getting the results? Or did you not get your results because of this feeling and regret not getting them? Thanks for reading, I just have no one else to really turn to for this. I have never even met a person that knew what HD is without me explaining it to them, let alone another person who has HD. It is all a terribly lonely experience. It must be a terrible feeling. It was for my wife as she awaited her results (42 CAG, sadly.) i was right there when she got the results, 15 years ago. \n\nAll I will say is this, I am glad that she got tested, as her partner. I am glad that we were armed with the information before having kids (we decided not to have kids) and most importantly so that we could make the most of our lives while we were still young. We travelled and we had a lot of great experiences, so now, as she has entered the late stage HD, we have those memories to make us laugh during the hard times. This is actually a really helpful insight. My husband is not really much for talking about feelings and such, and every time I ask him how he feels about me getting tested or how he will feel about the results he just kind of shrugs at me. I am hoping he will be happy that I am getting tested too. Thank you I am so sorry to hear that doctors were pressuring you not to get the test! I think knowing the result will make you feel more empowered to take charge of your life, so I do not think you could possibly regret it. If you plan on having kids I think it is so important you get the testing.\n\nI work in the HD space, and I truly wish you all the best! I will check back in on the 5th and hope to see that you are negative \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e. You might want to explain to your husband what will be required of any HD caregiver spouse. It is a whole lot. Like a life changing amount of work and difficulty. It is not insurmountable but it is going to require a level of commitment that I was totally unprepared for. \n\nMuch love and support from an internet stranger I am so sorry. I know how exhausting &amp; heartbreaking it is. Watching this disease rob my mom of her vitality and life was hard. Learning at 34 that I had inherited it was devastating. I guess I just want to say kudos to you for staying by her side. Yes I felt the same as you. I  wanted to know had this crazy feeling it would not be me!! All doctors trying to pursued me not to test.  Well I tested positive with CAG 42 I was 46 years old at the time and I can say not a day that I do not think about every day. I truly wish I could go back and not find out at least then I had some days of it not being all I thought about!! I wish you the best outcome of a negative result. Hang in there!! Thank you so much for that. Made my day! \n\nHow are you feeling so far? Hi! I hope you are hanging in there as result day day approaches. \n\nI am gene positive and i waited until i was 34 to get tested. I was all over the board emotionally leading up to my decision, but luckily i had a doctor who is pretty laid back and didnt give me a tough time for wanting to go thru with it. I had several metal health episodes that i had tried to treat conventionally prior to testing, and nothing really seemed to be working so that is why I choose to do it. I think its healthy to know what you want. And I think it can help you to mentally prepare for what is to come. I do not regret finding out, but not going to lie its still hard 4 yrs later. I think it would have been much harder having waited until i was further progressed to process it. I still work and lead a pretty normal life. \n\nI have 3 bros who are also gene positive and two of them were really in denial about getting tested, but i think it was much harder for them not knowing. \n\nI hope this helps , i think you will be ok what ever you decide is right for YOU! Sending you all the positive thoughts, whatever you choose \ud83d\udc99 Im ok. Four years ago I was on a bad path towards a certain early death spiral. Found a great doctor - got me off all but one med &amp; put me on an all natural, all organic, way of life with balance exercises and chair yoga. I would already be dead if I had stayed in the Big Pharma path to ruin I was on. I am so glad that worked for you. She is on several different SSRI and seratonin drugs and they have been fairly miraculous. There are some great treatments to keep patients comfortable and happy. This is amazing!!! I really need to look into something like this. Pre test i was on several different psych meds trying to figure out if it was early stage symptoms of HD or if i was just dealing with mental health issues and it was such a difficult time for me.  Im now 4 years post test and taking minimal medication, but i feel like i need to find a healthier approach to caring for myself.  Would you be comfortable telling me what kind of doctor you sought treatment with? Thanks! It was actually an osteopath. EVERYONE told me I needed a neuropsychiatrist for HD. So I had one for 10 years &amp; all she kept doing is prescribing more drugs and more drugs and I continued to decline. Now I am only on one HD med to prevent cognitive decline and I take a variety of supplements instead. I began the balance work &amp; chair yoga and within 4 months I was out of the wheelchair. Within 6 months after THAT I was walking 1 mile per day &amp; working full-time. Then I got COVID + bilateral pneumonia in March 2020 and went into measurable medical decline post-COVID. But I was off my supplements &amp; exercise regimen for 47 days as I lay in critical care ICU dying. It is been a long slow journey BACK to restored health the past YEAR but I am about 80% now and working part-time again FINALLY. I feel like there may actually be a light at the end of this very dark tunnel. What supplements, if you do not mind my asking? I am pre-symptomatic and starting to read more about what could potentially help delay onset. I just received my results on Monday, May 3rd. I am pre-symptomatic but have a long family history on my mother's side. Turns out it is also on my dad's side.\n\nI have known I wanted to get tested for a while now. I am 28 married and was planning on having a family but could not bear the guilt of not getting tested before having kids. Well, I am a 43 on one side and a 37 on the other so no chance for kids but now I can move on and plan my future.\n\nI am still having a hard time navigating my friends and family. I do not like the feeling of people pitying me because I still have a great life ahead of me so I have kept it close. As soon as I knew about the disease in my mother's family, I did the test right away. I was diagnosed positive to HD at 19 years old. Feels bad to lost the fifty fifty but I cannot do anything about that anyway. I could not live without knowing about what will happen to me in the future. I am 23 right now, i have my ups, and my downs especially when I was jobless. I was depressed, I was feeling like the disease will hit me someday, and the fact that I cannot know when, it tears me up. \n\nHowever, I finally found a job and I have goals in my life that I need to pursue to the end, hopefully before the HD will catch me back. Afterwards, I do not really know how I will deal with it. But I try to live in the present, even if sometimes I think about my HD. Like today, I discover this subreddit thanks to this.\n\nI see that we are at 5th of May, I hope that the results will be fine for you. Try to not bring yourself down like me if the results are positive, it ' s easy to say I know. But I m pretty sure there are people to talk to for you, as I did not have at my time. ", "Next step? We learned a family member has been diagnosed a year ago. My mom is at risk, but does not want to get tested. I am also at risk. I want to be tested, but want to do it anonymously and I am willing to pay out of pocket to get tested, but I am unsure how to go about that route. Any suggestions? I am in California if that helps. Please be as sure as possible that you actually want to get tested. You cannot undo it. A positive diagnosis for you is a positive diagnosis for your mother as well. If you think a dark secret like that is something you can live with, I commend you. But you have to be sure. Accidentally disclosing that kind of unwanted information to her, whether through yourself or somebody you confided in, could absolutely annihilate your relationship with your mother and could cause intense psychological trauma for her and/or you. \n\nIf that is a burden you are willing to bear, then move forward with it. Genetic counselors will want you to have some sort of support group, so make sure to find somebody who has no social or genetic connection to your family. Go through the suggested counseling and they will provide you options for testing. If you are not using insurance or a family doctor and are not getting mail at your parents address I do not see any reason why you would not be able to keep this anonymous. The HDSA website has plenty of links for counseling and testing with an interactive map.  If you are in Northern California, the hd center of\nexcellence at UCDavis is amazing. My husband tested anonymously there. The staff there will make sure that you think about every aspect of making this decision to test. Only 1 in9 at risk get tested- it is a life changing and monumental decision. It seems that people either absolutely want to know or do not. If you are anywhere near SoCal, UCLA has a fantastic HD program. They will council you and offer you resources.  If you have HD, California is a nice place to be.  The centers throughout the state are staffed with great healthcare teams and the advocacy groups through HDSA are top notch.  If you want to connect with a youth worker or talk other young adults at risk/test, please reach out and I can connect you with few resources.   I have been tested as gene positive and I did so anonymously. I recommend being tested at an HDSA Center of Excellence and make it clear that you intend to pay out of pocket and want to remain anonymous.\n\nI respect your brave decision and you should not let anyone talk you out of it. For me, there was no question. The only thing worse than knowing was living the rest of my life not knowing. Ignorance is not bliss and knowledge is power, my friend.\n\nIt is my opinion that your mother should face reality and get tested first. It is absolutely selfish for her not to. Sorry, but that is the truth. My aunt refuses to be tested so all of my five cousins have to live in fear because they do not want to do so before she does.

I am looking into the Kaiser Advantage plans for my dad (HD positive), because we love his current care team. I want to make sure I am not missing anything as I am researching plans, because it does not seem like it will be easy to switch later on. Do you need to look into Medicare Special Needs plans with HD? Any advice is appreciated! I am not quite sure. Huntington's disease did not change anything with my moms Medicare. The only thing that changed was everybody gave up on her and blamed every bad symptom on the disease. If you have to change doctors make sure they are familiar with Huntington's or it can have disastrous effects.\n\nLost my mom about a month ago and I am quite sure her doctors ignorance was the cause of alot of pain for my mom. Please, make sure there is always somebody around who is willing to battle for your dad. There are a hell of a lot of bad effects.\nBut it is probably not the only thing happening with people. My mom slowly went full quadriplegic over a year. We kept taking her to the doctor and her doctor kept chalking it up to the disease. After a year of battling we finally got a referral to her neurologist. Neurologist took one look at her and said this is not Huntington's. He had us rush her to the hospital to get x-rays and MRIs and we found out she had been suffering from a broken vertebraes in her neck. Literally had a broken neck for over a year and her doctor blamed it on her disease. She never really recovered and slowly deteriorated over the next 5 years and died a month ago. I had to stop working to help take care of her and my dad(who has had 3 bouts of cancer) all because of a doctor that was complacent. That is malpractice.

I sang at her mothers funeral when she was finally set free from this disease and she comforted and hid me when I escaped my abusive father.\n\nShe had a son last year and I love him as if he were my own. She is like my sister.\n\nI do what I can to help, but she has always been someone who struggles to ask for help or share how she is really doing.\n\nHer symptoms are progressing fairly quickly, but at this point I actually think the worst part is the resentment of not being able to have the life/family that she always wanted. She is the best mom I have ever seen, and I know that she feels that being a mom is her purpose in life. Her son was a happy accident, and even though they planned on no kids, now that she has one she wants them all. However her husband made sure she got an IUD so she cannot \u201caccidentally\u201d get pregnant again. In her more rational moments she agrees this is for the best.\n\nHow can I best help her in life? I promised her when we were kids I would help her through the end. Now it is coming. What can I do? Just be there for her. Listen to her. Distract her. Go with her to her appointments. Stay updated on Buzz HD. Help her husband plan nice suprises for her. \n\n Thank you for the reply :) I already do quite a bit of that I hope so I guess the best thing is to keep doing it. Are surprises ok with HD?? I always worry when we need to change plans or something unexpected happens as that is usually when episodes of irritability and aggression happen.. It depends on the person. I think it comes down to needing control over more things because of losing control over so many others. Everyone has symptoms differently. I am currently symptom free myself but postive with the gene.\n\nMy Mom and two Aunts are all symptomatic. I would say my Mom liked suprises when she was able to walk and talk still. My one Aunt has minimal symptoms but naps everyday and as long as she is charged up she is good for anything. My other Aunt has been very aggressive and pushing people away; but she had other issues before even being fully symptomatic. \n\nIt just takes what is the worst in you and brings it out. If you are planning a surprise make sure it is something she would have previously before the suprise date agreed to do bring it up before but try not to spoil it, make sure she has done all the things she wants to do that day or that she is not busy/having her mind otherwise occupied. Then go for it! \n\nAlso take everything with humor. Try to help her laugh. It doesnt always have to be doom and gloom. Remind her that she is still herself.  Thank you this is all good. I do as much research as I can but it helps the most to hear from people with experience. From what I have read It seems like the best thing is to just keep on as we always have just being happy together. I think I just worry that I am not doing the right things and question myself since I have not had to be around the worst of it yet and I love her so much I would hate to cause her harm unknowingly. This is going to suck, but I know whatever pain I go through she is going through worse Seems like you are already doing a lot. Make sure you take time for yourself, as well. People who care for the sick also need love and support. ThNk you I appreciate that...I do have a tendency to overextend myself for people I love.. I am lucky that my husband is very understanding of that and he makes sure I am able to do what I do while still taking care of myself :) we are lucky that we have a very good support group", "Please help\u2026 feeling like I can no longer cope. My mom (59) was diagnosed 8-9 years ago with HD. It came as a complete shock to us and we did not really understand at the time what the future would hold. Now that her symptoms are getting worse the amount of depression and anxiety I feel is constant and debilitating knowing what the next 5-10 years hold for us.\n\nFor context, the current situation is my mom lives at home with her two dogs and my dad. They are married still but they have more of a contractually obligated relationship. My dad (65) works during the day on the farm, then makes sure she has something for supper and they spend the evenings watching tv together with the dogs. She is had 2 falls in the house but is still able to walk independently (with some difficulty and chorea as I am sure you all know about). She does not cook or drive anymore but is able to bathe, do laundry, look after the dogs and prepare small snacks for herself. She texts me and we talk on the phone every night. I am able to get home every 2-4 weeks for a few days currently\u2026. Beside me, my dad, her brother and sister and law (who live far away) she does not have much of a support system. She wants to keep her diagnosis a secret as much as possible so she does not like going out much or talking to others. Her mental state is usually pretty good and she is adamant that her happy place is on the farm with the dogs and wants to stay there as long as possible. \n\nI will summarize my main worries, and if anyone has any words of wisdom to pass on I would be so, so grateful. I feel so alone. \n\n1. I (23) am in medical school in a city 2.5hrs away. I feel so much regret and guilt over choosing this path. I always thought it was what I wanted but now that I am not able to be home very much I feel overwhelming sadness and guilt that I am not able to spend these last few \u201cgood\u201d years with her\u2026 but on the other hand she is so proud of me and would feel so horrible if I gave it up on account of her. \n\n2. None of the family wanting to be her caregiver. It seems like most posts I see someone in the family whether it be a child or partner are willing to be the full time caregiver. My family does not want to do that. We are considering bringing in home care to bridge the gap between her symptoms getting bad (unable to bathe or walk around the house) and the need for 24 hr supervision and care. But the stigma and guilt around passing the care to someone else make me feel like a shitty child. \n\n3. I feel sadness and guilt every time I do something that brings me happiness. When I go back to my own house and spend time with my partner and dog or my friends and I find myself enjoying myself and being happy for once my mind immediately goes back to thinking \u201cbut mom and dad are at home, alone and suffering through this without me and I do not deserve to be having fun when I have left that burden at home\u201d. \n\nI have a therapist I am working with but wait times between appointments are long. I am truly suffering and feeling hopeless. I love my mom so much and I want to do right by her. I am so sorry you are going through this. This is the right place to come. \n\nMy MIL is going through what your mom is going through. She cannot drive or cook but can do basic small tasks. We got her approved for disability a while ago and that is been a huge help. After two years on disability, she can be on Medicare, which also helps. \n\nThe truth is that your mom will eventually need a caregiver or need to go to assisted living. My MIL is moving to assisted living in two weeks. Medicaid helps to pay for it. \n\nI am glad you are looking into therapy. This helps with me as well. Our genetic counselor says we need to focus on our lives first. Continue on your path for yourself and visit your mom when you can. Your life does not have to be on hold. In the long run it could make things harder if you do not. \n\nAgain, I am sorry. Good luck. Thank you so much for your reply. If you do not mind I was just wondering did your MIL live alone in her house? What factors did you consider when making the decision to have her move into assisted living? And how did you have those difficult conversations with her - I expect my mom to fight tooth and nail when it comes time We would been documenting every time she had an issue so that when it came time, we would have more than enough reasons. For us, it started with car accidents and memory. She was going into collections because she was forgetting to pay bills and also messing up her medications. It took about two years before we 100% knew it was the right time. What helped was talking with her doctors and getting everyone on the same page. Once the doctors are aware that you are looking into Medicaid, Medicare, or assisted living they can help you get to where you need to be. \n\nI would also recommend you or your dad becoming POA. This will make things so much easier for you. This will allow you to sign papers and make decisions on her behalf. You will need a notary but once it happens the road will be much smoother for you going forward. There is going to be a lot of paperwork in her future so I cannot emphasize this enough. \n\nMy MIL has had the help of an in home aid for about a year now. The aid comes twice a week and helps with cleaning, errands, and other basic tasks. But we knew it was time when the help she needed was beyond what just the aid could provide during their limited time at my MIL\u2019s. \n\nWhen we had \u201cthe talk\u201d with her about assisted living she honestly did not seem surprised. She begged for another year before agreeing but we told her no. She cried and was very quiet. She seemed defeated. We had been working with her therapist on prepping for this conversation for a year. That is why it is so important to establish relationships with her doctors and medical team. Once they know the goal, they can help make things easier. Once we told her therapist our goal she was able to slowly start to bring up this sensitive topic with my MIL over and over so that when we brought it up, she was not caught off guard. \n\nI am sure your therapist will have advice on how to have did this conversation. We did eventually find a facility that she liked and is excited about living at. She is happy to be around other people and the fact that she lives 3 minutes from us instead of 45 minutes. \n\nThe facility is a Medicaid and self pay facility. If your MIL can get the Medicaid waiver, then she can go to some facilities at a fraction of the normal cost. I think it costs $749 a month for my MIL compared to the $3,450 it would have been without. It is a long road to get the Medicaid Waiver though so I would look into local recourses to help connect you with someone that can help. There is usually some sort of third party that works with the government that helps people for free on how to get the Medicaid Waiver. \n\nMy recommendation for you would be to get life insurance for yourself. My husband did this as soon as he found out about his mom. We were able to get it at a much more affordable rate compared to what it would have been if we were to wait and see if he had HD. Having this security will help provide for the family my husband could eventually leave behind. Your future family will thank you. I know it is a hard thing to think about. It was for us. \n\nHopefully this helps! This was very helpful, thank you. I am very lucky to be in a financial position that money will not be an issue when it is time to bring in home care or when finding assisted living. We are also in Canada so things work a bit different here. I really like the idea of documenting things over a course of time to give proof. My mom gave up driving and cooking without a fight so basically now the things I am looking out for are falls and inability to bathe herself (both things she is still able to do). She also has a bit of support with my dad being there every evening. It is hard because I really want to do right by her while also having her safety in mind. My therapist has told me that if something bad happens like a bad fall, I should not blame myself because I am honouring her wishes to be at home. \n\nI find it hard to think about my own future with this disease. Honestly I try to put it out of my mind and only focus on my mom.", "Cousin at risk My mom has HD and her youngest (of six) sister is showing symptoms (48 years old). She has three kids and the youngest is 17 and worried about the disease. In our family HD usually onsets in mid-40s.

I am trying to be sensitive since, all of her mother\u2019s siblings have been tested positive for HD (6 of them). BUT I have been holding off having this conversation because I know it is really not my place to ask her to be tested ...but since we have plans for a new life form... I cannot help but think it is essential. Any advice would be great, have had this on my mind for years. It is such a hard thing. I think it is really important for you to sit down with her and have an open and honest discussion about your concerns and fears and go from there. \n\nThe decision to be tested or not is ultimately hers, but your voice and opinions are obviously very important as well. \n\nThere are methods to have in-vetro fertilization with a gene negative egg a well if she was tested and was positive. \n\nThere is also a lot of promising clinical studies right now as well and I am feeling pretty hopeful that an effective treatment for treating HD will be available for the kids off today.  My mom refused to be tested but she now lives in a nursing home and it is pretty obvious she has it. That means I am at risk and my husband and I are talking about kids. I like to think that it gives me some sort of control over the disease by deciding not to pass it on if I do have it. Maybe frame it that way? Would not you want to be able to control whether or not someone you love has it or not? \n\nEither way, I am sorry you are going through this. I imagine it is very difficult and I hope for the best in every way. I was your wife. My family has HD running in it. My dad refused to get tested and 5 out of his 6 siblings have/had the disease. For me, denial was so much easier than finding out the truth. I got married with the expectation of never having children because I never wanted to pass it on, and I never wanted to have to find out if I was going to end up like so many of my loved ones. It was hell watching them all go through it. Then, my birth control failed. I should also mention that I was raised quite religious and the idea of aborting for the sake of aborting was just something I could not wrap my head around. I just kept thinking that my poor innocent little baby could end up suffering like other family members I would loved and lost. I could not stand it anymore and I decided to go get tested. My ex-husband supported me, and to some extent helped me decide that it was better to know than it was to pass it on. Having him to discuss and talk things through was helpful. If this is important to you, she will understand that. Because, at the end of the disease she is asking you to not only potentially bury her (after having to watch her suffer), but also bury your child after watching them suffer. You have a right and a say in the matter. You may not have a right to MAKE her get tested, but you absolutely have a right to choose whether or not you have a child with her. You two would be creating a life together. Its not an easy topic to approach. I know, I have lived through it.  If you need to talk, feel free to PM me.  HD spouse caregiver here: she either needs to get tested, or you should agree to not have kids. That may sound harsh, but it is physically not possible for you to simultaneously care for a spouse with HD and a child, especially if that child develops HD, in which case, your entire life will literally be spent caring for HD patients. If your fianc\u00e9 loves you, and she understands the degree of strain that this disease will put on you, then asking her to either get tested, or to not have kids is the only humane position. \n\nYes, there *might* be a cure on the horizon. I know this because we have been told this for 11 years now. But *maybe* is not a viable strategy for a long term illness. \n\nGet married, go travel, have fun, live life, then if you still want kids, then get tested. Because it is not just her with HD, it is you, and the whole family, even if only in the sense that you will not see them because you simply cannot leave this person alone for more than minutes at a time. \n\nPlease, please, I beg you... either get tested, or do not have kids. It is so hard and it takes so long to care for someone with HD. If you have a kid with HD, the best possible outcome for that kid is for you to outlive them. Please do not do that to yourself.  We decided to not get tested and we are going through IVF to ensure our kids will not inherit the gene. It is all a very personal choice. Feel free to PM me if you want more information.  Am I wrong in thinking you can test the baby in the placenta and there is treatment whilst in gestation? I am so late to this. But is IVF a lot more expensive then going through a regular process? I am only asking so I can see if it is even a feasible option for me. IVF is expensive ~$15-20k per cycle. Add in PGD testing (for HD) and you are up to $20-$30k. This is all with no guarantees. We are currently over $50k out of pocket with no baby. Here is hoping we get a positive result soon. Feel free to DM me if you have additional questions.  I know how she must feel. My dad, his 2 brothers, and my grandma all tested positive. It felt like my life was cursed, and it saddens me to see some people here who have been in the same boat. How fucked up is this disease? It just needs to end.\n\nWhen I talked to my genetic counselor after I tested positive, she said I can still have kids if I want (and the week before my result date I found out I was pregnant..), or we could try invitro-fertilization. However, that route is EXTREMELY expensive and I would not recommend unless you have that cash or it is the last ultimatum if she is positive and you both want kids. It is a really emotional process;  getting tested. If it is positive, it will change her whole world. She is got to decide on her own when she is ready to get tested. I think it sounds like she has a good support system. I really wish I could get advice from my dad or my uncles, but they have been gone for years.

", "Harmless virus may be the way to get gene-silencing material into the brain ", "My 72 year old father was just diagnosed with HD, with a CAG repeat number of 41. Can my two siblings and I anticipate a higher CAG repeat number and earlier onset if found positive, which is likely for at least one of us?  Unfortunately, yes. It likely would not jump from 41 to 50, for example, but there is the possibility that it could jump up a couple numbers, such as 42-44, which would mean earlier onset. However, the longer the expansion, the more unstable it is, so 41 is a \"good\" place to be, comparably. Diagnosis at age 72 is much later than many patients suffering from HD who often get diagnosed in their 40s or 50s. Wishing you the best. Not necessarily. My FIL had a CAG also of 41 but my wife\u2019s count is 40. Her uncle who is 13 months younger than her father also has a count of 41 and did not start showing symptoms until 5-10 years after her father. I saw a neurologist at northwestern\u2019s center of excellence yesterday, and she told me that higher count can happen, and does play in to age of onset, but there are other genes at play as well.  You can get a good idea of when you will show symptoms based on your family history. So for instance, my count is 42, but my family\u2019s general age of onset is much later. Therefore, I can likely expect later onset. Also, my grandma had a count of 40 I think, but my second cousin has a count of 39, and she started symptoms in her mid-60s whereas he started early 60s. Thanks. It is a very surprising late diagnosis as we have no record of HD in our family. When did your fil\u2019s symptoms appear? I suppose your wife is not symptomatic yet? The thing is, my father\u2019s diagnosis is a complete shock because we have no record of it in our family. He is the only one to base our family history on. The silver lining is that he is very late onset, I guess. Thanks for the info. My grandma was around the same age when diagnosed. We think her mom had it, based on family stories, but obviously there is no way to be sure. Late onset is a silver lining, but it still sucks. I highly recommend reaching out to the nearest HD center because they can help. Thanks He was diagnosed at 59.  Symptoms started about 5 years before. Lived to 68. He was also the first diagnosed in the family though his mom was diagnosed about 5 years after him around age 80. We do not know her CAG.She lived to 83 though died from a fall and not directly from HD (balance issues from HD obviously may have contributed to the fall but it is hard to say).

I am sorry if this comes off rude and insensitive I know there is people that really have this here and my heart goes out to everyone. But I have been having neurological issues for almost 2 months. It started with a shaky body and now just some tingling and numbness and hemifacial spasm and numbness in my forehead. Numbness on top of lips as well. All this happened after I fell drunk and knocked myself unconscious.I am 24. I have no family history of HD however when I put my symptoms on Google sometimes it pops out. I hope I did not offend anyone here and if I have feel free to remove my post. I am just a person trying to figure out what is wrong with them until my neurologist appointment in June. Medical student and family member of someone with HD. Based on your description and lack of family history, sounds very very VERY unlikely to be HD! \n\nYour traumatic brain injury (ie: concussion or post concussive syndrome) likely explains a lot of these symptoms. I hope you get answers soon and good luck! Thanks for your reply and yes I would of thought so, but jumping into the rabbit hole of googling and a long grueling wait to be seen by a neurologist the only thing I can do is try to remain calm. \ud83d\ude1e I tell myself it is most likely due to the fall I had because I was perfectly fine the week prior. But it is so hard trying to calm yourself down. I never knocked out unconscious drunk before with a head injury, and I will not lie I did not take it easy the first week . You can see a geneticist who can run a test for it but my opinion is that it is related to the head injury. You may have better luck speaking to a neurologist about that first. I would not know how to ask given there is no history in my family. And I am hoping so. I read an article about a guy who is depressed and he is testing for HD cuz he is having neurological issues and it scared me. If you have numbness it is not HD. Eat a bag of dicks. Read the Wikipedia page on hd and fuck off. We are not here to support your bullshit. I actually have it, I do take insult to your post. I am sorry tommy I did not mean to insult anyone. My sincerest apologies. I just do not know what is wrong with me and it is literally killing me. I did not come here for pity just maybe thought it was probably the start of HD because I was depressed for two years. And just reading a plethora of what it could be. I am sorry once again. Actually you might want to dig your family tree if it is HD. My mom has it and I have now found 6 other members of maternal grandmother family with it uncle and first cousins to my grandmother. Confirmed by talking to DNA matches. I have and no one has died of HD In my family. My moms side has prevalence of cancer. Both her brother (died of Leukemia) mom (died of breast cancer) her sister had (cervical cancer) but she is doing good and my dads side well most of them lived to their 90s. And his family is big and no family history of anything.So I am not sure I do not think HD directly kills someone. My point was extending a tree out. My grandmother's father had 1 brother (HD confirmed by death record but not what killed him) and 5 sisters. One of the sisters all four of her children (grandmother's first cousins)had it and now one of the granddaughters. I have talked with descendant of a few of the sisters. One DNA match confirmed her mother, grandmother and grandmothers 3 brothers had it. Another match confirmed he had heard about it in the family but his branch did not have it. Then another first cousin to my grandmother who does research on tree did not know about the disease. Information in a family can vary No fuck you and your hypochondria. Your post history tells us everything. You did the same shit on a ton of other subs. You are doing the same nonsense on ibs, leukemia and a bunch of others. Get out of here. I do not know why you would jump to HD from these symptoms. Surely it is more likely a consequence of your head injury. Try to be patient and do not google things before your neuro appointment.", "Looking for advice on how to share HD diagnosis I was diagnosed back in Nov 2020 after symptoms had progressed over the course of 8 months.\n\nI have kept the news pretty close so far, maybe a dozen or so close friends and family. I was also honest with my co-workers when I stepped down from my work as a special needs educator/care giver.\n\n\nDue to several personal things falling into place at once, I have decided that now is a good time to officially announce my HD diagnosis.\n\nI was looking for advice on how (and how not) to share to Facebook and other such social media. Any advice is welcome, really.\n\nThank you My advice would be do not.\n\nMost people just do not or do not want to understand. If they do they are just going to ridicule and exclude you for having HD. Online as well? Yeah prepare for the hate comments and shit. It sounds to me like you have informed everyone who needs informing. \n\nIt is of course your choice, but personally I would not tell \"everyone\" about it. Not that HD is  anything to be ashamed of but I would worry it would potentially be an opening for unpleasantness (Internet doing its thing) which might be an issue for me as I progress with my symptoms. Who would give someone hate comments for telling them they had hd? To be honest I have no idea. I just went through that a couple of weeks ago. First of all, I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. You have come to the right place - this community is so helpful and supportive. Sharing the diagnosis with the masses on social media is something I struggle thinking about. Not to have a \u201cwho is got it worse\u201d competition, I personally think announcing something like a cancer diagnosis is a bit easier because everyone knows and understands the basics of a cancer diagnosis. Now with Huntington\u2019s, it is so rare that it is likely pretty much  everyone you know will likely have no idea what it means. So that invites the question how much informtation about it you would want to include in your announcement and also how much pity you want. And I am not saying wanting sympathy and pity is a bad thing! Sometimes it is nice to hear \u201cwow this disease sounds like the worst thing ever\u201d because it is. But I worry that it may become mentally draining for you to receive these comments from many people especially all at once. I agree with the other commenters - it may be better to just have these conversations with those closest to you in a more intimate setting. Confused as to this question. You already said you told a dozen friends/family and even professional colleagues. I do not understand how social media plays into this at all. Then again, I do not have social media.\n\nWhy do you have to officially announce it on social media if you already told friends and family? If you respect the people who love and care about you, you should have a conversation and not give them such devastating news via social media \"announcement\".  \n\nIf you have hundreds of close friends and family that you need support from then you have got a long call list. But if you do not care enough to have a personal conversation with them, why do you need them to know??", "Disability Themed Short Story Anthology Call for Submissions Hello Everyone,\n\n\nI am a current undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University.

We are both 20 y/o. I am wondering if anyone can provide me with insight about possible treatments that are emerging, or even any possibilities of a cure which are being researched. Thank you so much!  As far as a cure goes, it is unlikely. Most research and treatments being done now are for symptoms such as delaying the onset of symptoms and the severity of symptoms. \n\nThere is a lot of things we just cannot cure as humans and a genetic disease is high up there. We can all hope for a cure but with disease like these I think we also need to look at reality and where we are actually at in science and medicine. Sorry for your boyfriends dad. Hopefully your boyfriend does not have it. \n\nRegards- 21(f) with huntingtons Right now is a good time to have Huntington's Disease, as funny as that sounds. There is much hope for an HD treatment or cure to be produced within the next five years. There has been incredible discoveries and advances made in HD research in just the last 2 YEARS! I have had much fun reading about all the new therapies in the pipeline. \n\nHere are some therapies in the pipeline, and there are more than these:  ( \n\nHere is also another website to check out, which is very informative:\n\n ( Huntington's Disease will have a treatment or even cure, in the next few years. I know someone in Parkinson's research, and they explained to me that Huntington's will have treatment long before Parkinson's Disease, and very soon. One of the most hopeful treatments that are already doing human trials, is the Roche HD lowering trial:  ( Do you know how one would begin volunteering for these trials? Or is there hope that they would be releasing some sort of treatment for public usage? Still completely unsure if my boyfriend does have it, just struggling deeply with it as I see a long life with him.. \n\nThank you for your comments Have you experimented with any of the trials aimed towards delaying the onset? Even 5-10 years would mean the world to me.. sigh You know someone in Parkinson's research, that is great. The person I talked with specialises in huntingtons and was brutally honest with me which is what we need. It is unlikely there will be a cure and definitely not in the next few years. Stop giving out false hope. \n\nRight now we are doing treatment testing for symptoms. Please only take advice from someone specialised in research on this disease not other health problems no matter how similar. I am sorry but can you not pull made up statistics out your  there has been nothing released to say there will be a cure in 5 years at all and it is never a good time to have a terminal illness I do not care which way you meant that. \n\nThis is a serious and hard topic for sufferers and it is beyond me that you would say something like that along with your false facts. OP Do not take online people's advice especially when it comes to science and medicine you need to book an appointment with a specialist who can give you facts and statistics. This sub is filled with ignorant people trying to butter up what this disease actually is and what it does and how complicated it is . I feel so sorry for both your other half and yourself.\nMy view and position on it is this. My partner has it.... It is a part of her, it is something I had to honestly think about and accept myself, so god knows how she does it.\nDo I love her?, yes. Do I want to spend my life with her? Yes... HD limits this time, but does not stop.me.wanting that time with them.\n\nIt is something you need to go away and think about honestly and brutally...\nIs there research into HD... Yes... Might there be a breakthrough? Possibly .... Who knows. \nDo not let that colour your thoughts on it is my honest advice. I appreciate this. We are scared for testing but I am supporting him as he is saying it is what he wants. However I am concerned with how it will affect his mental state if he does have it. As we are so young it is even scarier.. \n\nThank you for your honest opinion, \nI appreciate this. I am starting to think I would rather 30-40 good years together rather than 100 with someone else... Yes, there are trials being done all the time. \n\n ( That is how you have to view it...I honestly hope there is a solution, or cure, or something... But it could not factor into my decision, as you cannot pin your hope on that.\n\nCannot remember who said it, but it is the hope that kills you.\nConversely... It is the not knowing that might be a bigger risk for his mental state. As it will always be in the back of his mind until he knows one way or the other.\n\nI would honestly rather have ten good years with my fianc\u00e9 than forty with someone else.... But we are young.. so should squeeze a few more than that out of it.... I am sorry to disappoint you, but the clinical trials being done for Huntington's Disease has been much more successful than you know. Please research online, and educate yourself.\n\nWhy must you be so negative, and victimize yourself? I have HD too. Is not it better to be positive instead of negative? Stress literally kills more of our brain cells, and because we have HD, we kind of need every brain cell we can hold on to.\n\nThings will change for us, there really will be a treatment in the next 5 years that will slow the HD gene, and prevent further damage to the brain. Why is that so hard to believe? Why do you want to be so negative? Just honestly curious... You are right, what is your viewpoint on kids? One night we were looking up baby names and then the next we get this news. I just feel so lost and all my friends are sick of hearing me worry about it and he is trying to not think about it in the meantime before the test but it is all I can think about.. yet I cannot bring it up to him because I do not want to worry him more.. I am lucky in that I am British and have the NHS. \nGenetic screening, IVF etc all exist as options for us. Children have not been ruled out.\nAs far as baby names go, I recommend Gary .. apparently they are dying out! I appreciate your lightheartedness \ud83d\ude0c. Do you know if this is also offered in Canada? I tried searching this up and I cannot find any reputable resources It should absolutely be available, yes, but depending where you are in Canada, you may or may not have coverage for IVF and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, so it could be expensive. I am deadly serious... Garry is a beautiful name for a baby girl....\nI have no idea what the Canadian options are I am afraid. But I am under the impression you have a.similar deal to us in the UK, so I imagine there will be options available to you.\nThe best way of finding out is when you go for the test, ask. They will have so much relevent information for you both. As well as advice on how to deal with either a positive or negative result.\nThe one thing I would say is think about taking out life insurance before you get tested. We did not, and that is the one thing I would go back and change.", "Hello everybody, I am a 29 year old male from the Netherlands, and I just finished going through the predictive test. About half a year ago I started the process of going through the test. It all started with me and a friend talking about why I was unwilling to seriously date any of the girls I met. He was worried about me, and I decided to share what all of us at some point have or will have experienced.\n\nI told him about how my mother died because of HD when I was twelve. About how she was in a home for six years prior to her death. I told him I had a 50% chance of having the disease myself. I told him how I did not want to put anybody I cared about in a position where they had to take care of me. I told him I would never want to have kids until I was certain I did not have the disease. I told him I would euthanize myself before the disease could take complete hold of me should I have it. I told him everything, and for the first time I had a serious discussion about my life and the uncertainty of my future.\n\nWe talked about it, and we both agreed I was living my life like I already had the disease. I was holding back on everything in life, and distracted myself by practically living in the gym. We assessed that considering I was already living as if I had it, there would be no loss in knowing if I had the disease. At this point I knew, and accepted it was time to contact my doctor. \n\nMy doctor was understanding, and helpful. He referred me to the right department at the hospital (sorry I do not know how to put this in English properly, so it is a department). Unfortunately I could not just get tested. I had to talk to a psychologist first to assess my state of mind (I am assuming). Fortunately it only took one conversation. I was sure of what I wanted, and aware of all the risks that came with knowing. The only prerequisite to taking the test was that somebody I trusted would go with me to get the result of the test. After this talk I got the green light to get the test. They took my blood, and the waiting began.\n\nThis part was by far the most stressful. To protect myself, and to protect my job, I decided to tell a colleague I trusted about what was going on. He was the senior of our department, and he helped me through a tough period where I honestly was not doing as good a job as I should have been doing. I did not tell management or HR about what was going on, out of fear of being denied promotions or raises due to the potential risk of my health. The senior had my back, and kept any mistakes I made on a low, and nudged me on them so I could fix them before anybody noticed.\n\nYesterday was the big day. My friend (from the first paragraph) and I went to the hospital, and were both completely nervewrecked about the possible outcome. We waited for what felt like an eternity, until the doctor finally came over. As soon as I saw her heading over the nerves dissappeared, as if my mind was saying it was willing to accept whatever outcome:\n\n***Doctor: Hello.***\n\n*She was holding a big stack of folders as she attempted to reach out her hand to shake mine.*\n\n***Me: Hi.***\n\n***Doctor: Please follow me.***\n\n*We followed quietly...*\n\n***Doctor: Please have a seat.***\n\n*We took our seats, as she closed the door and sat down...*\n\n***Doctor: ...I have good news.***\n\n\nAll I remember is a giant weight falling off my shoulder. I remember asking her if she was sure I did not have it. She said something about the length of the genes being a good 17 in length, and how this is the fun part of her job. Anything else she said I cannot remember.\n\nToday, after my first good night of sleep in weeks (10 hours), my mind is clear. I am able to process my thoughts properly, and for the first time I feel sure of myself. As if a part of me healed overnight. I am ready for the future. For the first time, my mind is clear and my will is absolute.\n\nFor those struggling with the same 50/50 chance, who are living their lives as if they are already dying from this disease, I urge you to take the test. I know it is easy for me to say this now, but I would have said the same thing a week ago, and I did the same thing yesterday. Only once you know can you truly set out a future for yourself, be it five or fifty years, you can plan ahead.\n\n\n\n&gt; TL;DR Started with the predictive test process roughly half a year ago, and heard I did not have the disease yesterday. My advice if you live your life as if you already have the disease without knowing, is to take the test. Inform someone you trust at work so they have your back at work, and someone from your private life so they can support you from the beginning until the end of the testing process. Only once you know can you truly plan for the future without that voice in the back of your head casting uncertainty.", "I am creating an app to help Dementia patients perform their daily task independently. Please complete my survey.

I want to cry. I have seen how if effects my granny and my mom just said that if she ever gets to how bad my granny has gotten she wants to die. I am about to burst into tears.\n\nI am scared that I have it too. I know there is a 50/50 chance of having it if one of your parents has it but I am still super scared of that 50%. I have horrible luck and I take after my mom in almost every other aspect. Does me taking after my mom increase my chances of having it? My great grandmother looks like my grandmother, my mom looks like my grandmother and I look like my mom. I am horrified. I want to live a long and happy life but I may not be able to.\n\nEver since I was little I have always had these little involuntary head shakes. I also rock back and forth in my seat, move my foot, bounce my leg and other things. I feel completely fine physically. I workout, I sing and speak clearly (unlike my granny, unfortunately) and I am a bit clumsy, but I have always been that way. Symptoms tend to develop later in life and if I did have a rare case of JHD and the things I listed above were symptoms my body would be in much worse shape than it is now, no?\n\nI have not been tested, my mom refuses to admit to me that she has it so there is no way I will know until she either admits it or until I am 18.\n\nAre we close to any cure? Is there anything that can be done to stop or slow it? Am I being irrational? Please tell me how likely you think it is that I have it. First of all, take a deep breath, and try and be calm about this. I know you are probably shitting yourself right now, but that wont help you. You will have the same problems but you will be covered in shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith regard to this bit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Ever since I was little I have always had these little involuntary head shakes.

It is \\*very\\* easy to spot things if you look too hard. I have done all of those things and I do not have the disease (although my parter likely does). Focussing on them will do little but give you stress to deal with as well.\n\n\"Are we close to any cure? Is there anything that can be done to stop or slow it? Am I being irrational? Please tell me how likely you think it is that I have it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be honest, I am far from the best person to be giving advice on anything, so I will stick to facts. As it stands, various cures and treatments are in development but they are not there yet. Nobody can give an accurate time on that right now. And most importantly, you are **not** being irrational. You are being stressed and scared (understandably). Anyone in your position with the recent developments would have their mind going at 100mph. You have got an entire subreddit full of people here who can help and give you advice - do not forget that. It does not matter whether you look like your parent, your odds are still 50%. \n\nJHD is extremely rare and is more likely if your father was the one who had HD (it seems like it has to do with how the DNA is packaged in the sperm). \n\nDo not focus on your day to day behavior, as kernelmustard said, those are normal behaviors. And yes, if you had JHD and had been displaying symptoms since you were small, the disease would have progressed by now.  \n\nIt is completely reasonable to be stressed and scared. However, there is not much you can do right now. When you are 18 you can get tested to determine if you have it. What helped my close friend (who found out they have the mutation for HD at 18) was learning about stoicism and focusing on what they could actively do in that moment. If they cannot change something, they do their best to accept it and focus on what they can change. I honestly do not know how they have managed it, but that is been their approach and it has worked pretty well for them so far. Their sibling who also has the HD mutation has focused on enjoying life while young (working in a well paying job, but also focusing on enjoying life because retirement is not guaranteed). \n\nThere are several promising treatments in the work. The one I think has the best shot (I am a cell biologist/neurodegeneration researcher) is called antisense oligonucleotides (ASO\u2019s). ASO\u2019s bind to specific types of RNA and stop the protein being made from it. So a certain type of ASO could stop the toxic Huntingtin protein from being made. There was one ASO where the clinics trials just got shut down because it was ineffective, but that ASO stopped both the mutant (toxic) Huntingtin protein and the normal Huntingtin protein from being made. So the benefit of stopping the toxic huntingtin may have been balanced out by the harm of stopping the normal Huntingtin protein. There are more specific ASO\u2019s which stop JUST the mutant huntingtin protein from being made and those may be the ticket to preventing HD. Scientists are hard at work trying to figure out how to cure or delay HD and if you are not 18 yet, there is a decent chance a treatment will be available before you show symptoms. \n\nOnce you get diagnosed (or are 18) you can look into being involved with HD research to help people get a better understanding of the disease. It is important to understand the progress of the disease and at what point before obvious movement changes that people are affected by the disease. That may help you feel like you are doing SOMETHING to fight back against HD. &gt; is more likely if your father was the one who had HD\n\nDo you have a source for this? It is my first time hearing of a difference between male and female parents having differing results. There is a lot of treatments in development that are showing a lot of promise. My advice to you would be to wait to get tested until you are able to get the insurances you need. My wife is at risk and when we are were both getting long term disability insurance, there was a question specifically about HD. Having the diagnosis makes it much more difficult to get yourself covered. For now, try not to think about it. Enjoy your life. \n\nIt is specifically for Juvenile HD. Large CAG repeat expansions in the Huntingtin gene occur more frequently when the male parent has HD. Large repeat expansions are still very infrequent. There is at least one cure I know of from these farmers who started something called the shepherds gift. It has worked tremendous on sheep and mice. However this has been a thing for many years and they have raised lots of money and every year they go to the FDA they get shut down. So is there or are we close to a cure? Yes absolutely. The real question is, when will the rich shit heads making money off selling shitty prescription pills for \u201ctreatment\u201d finally allow actual cures to come into play.

He was abusive to my mum when I was a kid and still hates her and makes up insane lies about her. I understand its partially his illness but I am not strong enough to not let it get to me.

The earlier the better in my opinion, but I understand that being part of a trial this early could make you feel scared.

There are a lot of factors affecting onset and it is not quite that exact. \n\nAs a rule of thumb, your CAG size can provide an estimate of average age of onset, and family history can suggest whether you might be earlier or later than average, but I do not think it is generally possible to accurately predict down to a range of 3 or 4 years. Yes, for sure, i totally get it. It can be 30,40,50 years old but I just do not want to live like that. Now I am already 27. Thx for the research. What are u going exactly there? Fair enough! Just wanted to make sure you were aware!\n\nI am actually involved in research info genetic reasons why some people get HD very early or very late! That is awesome! \n\n( \n\nAny toughts about that?\n\nI am totally fine with natural supplements not heavy medications with tons of side effects. It is not my exact area, but I do know there have been reports of oxidative damage contributing to HD, and so it makes sense that an antioxidant would help with that. It certainly seems like it could not hurt to eat foods high in myrecetin - the article lists vegetables, fruits, nuts, berries, and tea, which are all great to have in your diet as it is. \n\nI do know that clinical trials based on targeting oxidative stress in people who are already symptomatic have not been hugely successful, though. With lots of HD therapeutics currently being researched, it seems like earlier treatment is better, so maintaining a lifestyle where you are eating high levels of antioxidants before symptom onset might be more effective. This is all complete speculation of course, and as I said, it is not my exact area of research.

I am 14 so I hope a cure comes in time for me and my siblings if we end up having it, and maybe even for my mom. My mom was 49 when she died. I am 29. I really do not have high hopes for myself. I think I will be one of the unlucky ones that just barely misses out. These things move so slowly and I feel like it has been \"we are almost there yet\" my entire life. Zero I am confident a cure will be worked out but I have no idea when. I think you have a very good chance of benefitting from dramatic improvements in treatment if not an outright cure by the time HD would impact you or your siblings (and I pray you do not even have to worry!)\n\nMy boyfriend is 33, his mom died when she was 46, and he assumes he will not benefit. But the next generation probably will. There is a fine balance between being optimistic and realistic. For you, I think optimism is warranted. I gave my children the only sure thing: genetic testing before having them to make it a non issue. As for me, I already know it will be better then it was for my dad, because we know I have it, and we he was misdiagnosed for years. More would be nice but I do not depend on it. It is great that you did testing before having children. If I ever have children and am positive I am either testing or adopting. Me and my sister were accidents and she and my dad did not want to terminate. My brother was somewhat of an accident too I am not sure about a 100%, slam dunk cure, because the brain is so complex. But I do think a treatment that slows the progression of the disease will be found in this decade. Is the loneliest number that you have ever seen\u2026 Thanks for asking this. I am gene positive and Seeing other people's opinions and feelings Brings me some comfort. My dad died when he was 56 and He would always say That He hopes they will find a cure in my lifetime. I am not so optimistic, I am more of a realist. But I do think it is so exciting to See how close we are To drugs that will slow our symptoms down. I honestly did not think We would have made it this far15 years ago when I would think about this. Science is amazing! Thanks for the input! I agree that science is amazing. It is probably too early for me to get my heart set on a career since I am a highschool freshman but researching huntington's and other diseases and looking at what causes them, the progression, and possible lines of treatments is extremely fascinating to me and I am thinking about a career in genetic engineering or something similar. If in my lifetime we can make it as far as to getting an HD cure or treatment I will be ecstatic. You sound very mature for your age. I was your age when I found out my dad had it, and believe me I had to grow up faster than other kids my age. You sound like you are the same way. Whether you go into a science career or spend time volunteering, etc, you are totally going to make a difference in the future. You are still so young, stay positive that you will see a cure in your lifetime! I am 26 btw. Thank you, I appreciate it. Honestly I feel like a major part of it is being the oldest sibling, that can definitely age you a bit. I have always been the one they go to if my parents are not there or it they have a secret and with the diagnosis I am constantly worrying about them. I do not want them finding out anytime soon and being a constant ball of anxiety like I am at the moment. I also worry about what is going to happen to them once/if(if there is a treatment) my mom gets bad. My little sister is 11 and my brother is 7. My dad has a very demanding job and works a lot so I have little bouts where I worry about what will happen to him if push comes to shove and he has to grow up with my mom getting worse and worse to the point of tragedy. He is such a sweet boy and he is super close to my mom so it is not fun to think about. Hopefully if that ever happens he will be old enough to drive or me and my sister will be close by so we can help out. \n\nI really hope something will come along if you could not tell LMAO That is a lot to have on your plate and in the back of your mind.

So my aunt (59) on of my dad's side of was just just diagnosed with HD, she has been displaying cognitive issues for the past of couple of years. Not close to her so have very little information.\n\nMy dad is 74, he is a very young looking, spry, agile 74 year old displaying no symptoms. He is reluctant to do the test.\n\nHow rare is it for someone to get to 74 and not display any symptoms?\n\nShould I get tested? I am 36 and planning starting a family. I would definitely get tested, you cannot force your dad to but like you said knowint this side of startong a family will be a big benefit That is a hard one. I would almost suggest your clear but since your planning on starting a family I would just get tested to make sure. This isnt something that you want to get wrong. My mom has it, I have not been tested yet, but my wife and I made the decision not to have kids a long time ago. Possible Huntington's disease was only a small part of it though. At this point, for your dad if it shows up it shows up. His testing does not matter so much, as he is lived his life and had his kids. For you wanting to start a family, however, I would absolutely get tested so that you can make the most informed decision possible before deciding to have children if HD is something that you do not wish to chance passing down. My father did not start showing symptoms until around 70. We thought we were in the clear. Still, it would not have changed anything for me.\n\nIf he does have HD, he presumably has a relatively low CAG count. I do not know how correlated counts are in a family. Hopefully, very. My grandmother is well into her 80s and only got diagnosed last year after losing half her siblings to it over the last decade and my uncle insisted on getting himself tested. Both of them had very high score results? I am not 100% on the correct terminology but the doctors were amazed at her age and how minimal her symptoms are in comparison to her score. It effects everyone differently. I will get myself tested eventually if my mum ends up diagnosed. Thanks for the insights everyone, I have learned a lot since first posting.\nIt really sounds like someone could easily be HD positive, live a full happy healthy life and go to the grave without knowing they had it.\n\nI was hoping and expecting the consensus would be that if someone got to 74 symptom free they probably do not have it.\n\nSince I posted my dad has decided to look into testing. Everyone thought my grandfather had Parkinson\u2019s when he died. My dad was diagnosed with HD in his late 70s. He still denies the diagnosis (that I saw, on his chart) and he does not show strong physical symptoms. I will not get tested unless I decide to have kids.", "Diabetes type 1 and Huntingtons Found out yesterday that my dad (61) has Huntingtons, my first plan was to get tested immediately, but now I am not sure about anything anymore. \n\nJust 3 years ago I got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and the initial shock was comparable, but I cannot believe this disease boils down to a coin flip.\n\nI guess Im just here to vent and ask some questions, me (28M) and my gf (29F) got our lives just turned upside down and Im trying to  seek a psychiatrist.\n\nIs there anything I should know? Is type 1 diabetes somehow also related? Hi- juvenile diabetes is not related to HD.  I would caution against rushing into testing for HD. Aside from the mental toll, It can have an impact on things like life insurance and long term disability insurance that you may need to consider.  Are you in the USA? You could seek out an HDSA Center of Excellence or local chapter for some resources or a recommendation on a genetic counselor.  Take some time with it as it is a lot to process.\n\nEdit: for background, my wife is positive for HD (pre symptomatic) and I have a brother and two aunts with Type 1/juvenile diabetes. Thanks for your reply. We are still in shock, and Im scared for my GF, I dont want her to go through this. Im in Norway so Im looking at resources here. This all feels like a dream.\n\nIf you want to answer, here is some more questions, Im afraid to Google some of it.\n\nIm thinking to take time of work (sick leave), what is your opinion on that? I mean life must go on, but atm I just cant think straight. I even started feeling my mind is failing me.\n\nHow do you deal with the emptiness you feel? How do I live better and more efficiently without being sad? Is there alot of suicide in late stages? You do not have to get everything figured out at once and the initial stress will pass.\n\nSo your situation is similar to mine and my wife\u2019s.  My then GF now wife and I were 27 (we are now almost 40) when her dad was diagnosed at age 59. We knew nothing about HD and it was a shock. In hindsight, her dad took the news surprisingly well as it helped him to make sense of a variety of things that he was feeling and doing but did not know the cause. For me, my reaction then and now was to research as much as I could and learn as much as I could. It really is the only way for me to feel like there is any control in a situation that involves an incurable disease.\n\nI understand your concern for your GF and it is something you will have to discuss. Every relationship is different so i do not think I can offer much other than tell you about my situation. I was and am very happy with my relationship, now marriage. I have never once considered this a dealbreaker. I have witnessed my mother in law care for my father in law as he progressed and eventually passed away.  She set a good example in handling both the stress and the compassion needed. Early on my then GF, now wife, told me she understood if it was going to be too much for me and I truly never considered ending it.  Everyone is different though and I am aware that it puts an incredible amount of stress on relationships. \n\nI would make the time to do some things you like doing. As for taking time off from work, it all depends on your mindset and job. For some people work can be a welcome distraction but if it is a job that requires you to be empathetic to others or take on others\u2019 problems, you may want to use a little leave to care for your self first.  (Again depending on your line of work, I would probably hold off on telling your employer anything about your dad\u2019s diagnosis, at least at first)\n\nYou are going to get sad and your GF is going to get sad because the situation sucks. But you will not always be sad and neither will she. \n\nFor us, we do not worry about living our life more efficiently, we just live our lives. You do not need to put more stress on yourself that you need to figure life out.  I know that having HD in our lives has made us more decisive about certain things and this has been a good thing. Early on we somewhat impulsively made a huge move from our hometown that worked out great. When I saw that her dad was beginning to have difficulty walking, it was the push I needed to propose (we had dated and lived together for years at this point) so that I could ensure her dad would be able to walk her down the aisle.  When she tested positive herself, we almost immediately started looking into a process called IVF with PGD which can basically ensure your child does not inherit HD and just recently had our second (and last) HD free child. For us, these were all things we wanted but would have likely put off or maybe never gotten around to had it not been for HD. \n\nIf you ultimately decide to test, no matter the result you are the same person you have always been. This is something in your genes set before you were born and you will have a little more knowledge about yourself to inform your decisions. The initial stress will get better and you will be thinking more clearly soon. Wow just wow. Thanks I will be reflecting on this answer. Hi, just wanted to say I tested positive earlier this year after my dad was surprisingly diagnosed late last year. You will go through so many emotions. \n\nIn the between time after dads diagnosis and my results, I could not settle. My only thought was \u2018I have got to get through this as quick as possible. I cannot have this over my head\u2019. \n\nI do not regret my decision to find out. If I had not, I would forever be stuck in that state. Now, I know I am positive. It does suck. It is taken 5 months or so to go from \u2018it is fine it is just the card I have been dealt\u2019 to \u2018actually, I feel angry about this and I am pissed off\u2019.\n\nSometimes you can say all the right words, but your feelings take a bit longer to catch up. And it is all ok. No matter what, it would be weird if you did not have feelings about it. Life has changed for me and my partner. We are no longer going to have kids but he is sticking with me so that is good. It is important you and your partner have very blunt conversations about the \u2018what ifs\u2019. What if you have it? What if you get sick young and she has to leave work to care for you? What if you have a child? What if you do not have a child? It is hard but so important that you are on the same page. \n\nAs far as I am concerned I have every right to have the odd bad day. Or week if I want it. I am going to have a significantly reduced lifespan and I am perfectly entitled to feel a bit hurt by that. It does not mean it will consume me. It just means I have feelings and I am strong enough to let them process. Anything you feel right now is just as valid as your actual result. \n\nI personally immediately got referred for councilling. My filter was:\n\n\u2018Can I live with that unknown. Where every twitch or sickness will make me wonder if this is it?\u2019 For me that was a no. It would do me no good. \n\nMost people choose not to be tested.\nI would say go and do the councilling anyway and get your blood test. It does not mean you have to get your results but the results would be there in the future if you ever wanted them. The councillors will go through a lot of information with you. Your girlfriend can go with you. It is helpful to have a second ear to reflect afterwards but if you are planning a life together it makes sense for her to be there too. They will cover the illness, reasons and consequences for getting your results, ways to have a healthy child. Worth it just for the info. It will be hard. I will be thinking of you. \n\nYou are welcome to message any time even if you just need a cathartic vent. Thank you so much. It feels better to not be alone in this, but I feel sorry for you aswell. I will week counceling on monday, and I think that is the only way to deal with this. Again thank you. Feel free to message me any time for whatever reason too Do you know if it is a 50% chance and if you have it its still a small chance you are in the grey area? So its acctually less than 50% you will develop it? Do you know if it is a 50% chance and if you have it its still a small chance you are in the grey area? So its acctually less than 50% you will develop it? If a parent has it it means they have one good copy of the gene and one bad copy. One from each of their parents. It only takes one bad copy to have the disease. This is known as \u2018Autosomal dominant\u2019. Most diseases take two bad copies to be a problem. One from each parent. Huntingtons only needs one bad gene.\n\nYou have a 50/50 chance because you will either inherit the good gene or the bad gene from your parent.\n\nIn very rare cases you can carry two bad genes if both parents have it, but this is incredibly rare. When you have the test, they test both of your genes so you get a result like 45/19 (45CAG repeat from one parent, 19CAG from the other parent)\n\nIf you test positive on one gene (40 CAG repeats and above) you will definitely develop the disease. It is a firm positive sadly. The disease will kill you if nothing else takes you out. \n\nIf you test 36-39 CAG repeats that is the only gray area. You may become symptomatic, you may not. If you test 36-39 repeats there is still a risk of passing it down to your offspring because the gene is not stable and mutates more often as the repeats get higher. I would still go through IVF if I would tested in the grey area to make sure my offspring did not inherit it.\n\nAs the gene is unstable it is more likely to mutate upwards rather than downwards. If you inherit from your mum, it is usually around the same CAG repeat. Eggs are quite stable. \nSperm on the other hand is a matter of luck simply because of how many there are \nEg: if you inherit from your dad one sperm could have the same CAG repeat as him, another could have 50, 130, 80, 42, 43, 39. It just comes down to which one out of the millions reaches the egg. The higher repeats like 80\u2019s upwards is where Juvenile Huntingtons shows up. It is usually much quicker to develop and more aggressive. \n\nEven with the theories of being 50/50 it all just comes down to luck because we cannot see inside our genes to make an educated guess on what the outcome could be.\n\nIf your dad has a 40+ CAG he is firmly positive and you would most likely also be 40+ but there is a chance you have not inherited the gene, or you have but it is mutated downwards.\n\nThe only way to know would be to get tested.\n\nI am really sorry you are having to go through this. I really am. It is just a whirlwind of thoughts. As hard as it is, nothing you think right now will give you any answers. It does not matter how positive or negative you think right now. You either already have it or you do not, the only thing you would be gaining by finding out is planning your life better. The genetic councilling you have to go through before getting the blood test is really great for all this information. They are very sensitive and very capable of helping you ask the right questions. I would do the genetic councilling anyway.\n\nOne good thing is since your dad has tested positive, you would be able to do Non Disclosure PGD-IVF if you did not want to find out your own result but you wanted to guarantee a healthy child. Your genetics team would give you this info too.\n\nOne last thing. I would not look into trials too much. My genetics team were really clear about not relying on that if you tested positive. Trials come and go. The most hopeful one on the pipeline was cancelled a month after I tested positive. It is brutal but I would advise you go into this assuming there will be no treatment then anything else will be a happy surprise.\n\nI would sit down with your girlfriend and talk about the pros and cons of testing. Read articles. HDA.org in the U.K. has some great resources. I personally found it really hard to look into it too much beforehand beyond the science and facts, and I still have not really watched any videos of people with the disease. It is a line I cannot cross yet. My dad is progressing scarily quick and that is hard enough. You will have loads of thoughts. Write them down. Talk. Think out loud. It is all ok! You will repeat things over and over again probably. The brain might be a bit of a mush sometimes but it is a hard thing to suddenly land on you. It is not a normal situation. \n\nI started mental health councilling during the genetics councilling process. I have suffered with depression since a young age, but it is worked in my favour in that I can identify when I need a bit of extra help. I still do councilling now with the same woman. I think if you have mentioned a psychiatrist then you are already aware it will be good for you, so well done for recognising that. You are stronger than you think, and even though it is quite sh*t you will also be totally fine at the same time. It is a huge contradiction. It will just take some time to work through.\n\nI hope some of this helps. If anything is incorrect here I am sure someone will correct me or share what they have been told. Thank you! Let us know how you get on. All the best x &gt;If your dad has a 40+ CAG he is firmly positive and you would most likely also be 40+ but there is a chance you have not inherited the gene, or you have but it is mutated downwards.\n\nThanks again, but could you elaborate this part? You mean its more likely? We dont know his CAG yet, I think he will get it from his doctor on monday. Sure. I will try this way. \nThere are two important questions as follows.\n\n**Question 1: Will you inherit the gene?**\nThis is 50/50. Put simply it is binary. You will either get your dads good version of the gene or the bad version. If you do inherit the bad gene then it is on to question 2\n\n**Question 2: Do you have reduced penetrance or full penetrance**\n\nIf you have inherited the bad gene this CAG repeat would be anywhere from 36 upwards. \n\n* 36-39 is the gray area where you might not be symptomatic but you can still pass it on, or you might be symptomatic late in life. This is called \u2018reduced penetrance\u2019. \n\n* 40+ CAG repeats would mean that you will definitely become symptomatic in the future. If you have 40+ CAG repeats, this is known as full penetrance. \n\nBecause the gene is unstable there is no way of knowing until you get tested whether the bad gene will be the same CAG, a higher CAG or a lower CAG in you. It is still 50/50 for inheriting the good or bad gene initially though. The second question is just helpful to help estimate the age of disease onset or if there is a risk of passing it down to your own kids \n\nI hope that helps. It does, thanks again so much. I see you got this answered already from u/Wearemakers but if you have other questions, please  ask. Yes thanks tho! I have been thinking, and I whatever the result I want to live more and do those things I always said maybe to. Im not sure if I want the result or not yet. The last days Ive been very tired and panicky, hoping to get someone else to speak to fast. Im mostly worried about my GF. I want to give her the best life I can whatever the result. Its heartbreaking to see her pain I will add that if you did test positive, it is most likely that your CAG repeats would be the same or similar to your father\u2019s. Expansion is possible, and becomes more likely the higher the CAG of your parents because the gene becomes more unstable, but assuming your dad\u2019s repeat count is ~40 then it is most likely that yours would be about the same.

I was told yesterday.  I am obviously upset but what upsets me more is that I am going to move home (about 4hrs from where me and my bf live now) and I dont think hes willing to go long distance :(.  I am heart broken.  I wont see him until next weekend so it is difficult to talk but he knows I am moving.  I may be jumping the gun, I feel like I am wired to the moon. Stop. Breathe. Relax. Focus on this very moment. All is well, and will be for a while. But not now. Let this news sit with you. Do not make drastic changes for at least a week. Talk about your fears. Talk about your sadness. It is all very normal. Let your bf know this is what you are doing. Take each day slowly. Then after a week, do some research. There is a lot of things that you can do to prepare yourself, your bf and your family and friends. This is a slow thing. Do not give it more speed. There are not many of us in the world. Something like 0.0013% of the world's population. But you are not alone. \u2665\ufe0f I agree with u/rocopotomus74 do not jump into and start making discussions and big changes immediately.  This is a scary diagnosis I know but 43 is not a high number of repeats.  I do not know how old you are now but there is a strong correlation between number of repeats and age of onset of symptoms and the lower the better obviously.  If you are still in your 20s you have years of \"normal\" left to live your life on your own terms before symptoms get in the way.  I totally understand wanting your family at a hard time like this, but take the time to talk to your bf.  And consider all options before you make a decision.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you are ready to dig into some research come back here.  Many of us have good resources we can connect you with. Listen if he leaves then he is not the one for you, do not worry things will work out, what is your age? My ex of 2 years had HD,44 repeats. She hid it away for two months without telling me and was scared of the same reason, but she was still the same person she was before and she deserves the same If not more love. Talk to him about this, he will be understanding. As a partner to someone with 44 repeats (we are both in our mid 20\u2019s), there is great possibility he will not leave you. When my partner got tested he left me to give me an out for about a year. I did not want an out and we eventually got back together and will be for however long we have. We also did long distance for about 6 months so believe me there is hope. Do not make any decisions for awhile but when you are ready you need to both sit down and communicate how you both feel and address the next steps. Sending you lots of love and prayers. Yes. This. I am 25.  And you are so right. Thank you \u2764 This.  Thank you. Bless her.  It is so hard to talk about it. And bless you! Thank you.  It is a total bummer but I am going to take this next year to holistically heal myself.  It is a deep wound, but I will be ok! 100% right. You will be ok. My husband got diagnosed 5 months ago and has 43 repeats. He is 31 and not symptomatic. We have a beautiful 7 month old. Live your life to the fullest because you still have a decent amount of it ahead of you. I love my husband and I am not going anywhere. I married him in sickness and in health. That is what love does. I hope your boyfriend feels the same and if not, you will still be okay. \n\nWe are all in this together. You have still got time before symptoms should appear, join the Facebook support groups they are amazing people, and research your diet and what supplements you should take, by the time symptoms start we should have a new weapon accessible to us, with your age CAG count and time between now and symptoms you stand an incredible chance of surviving it good luck hun \u2764\ufe0f I know this post is old, but I thought I would try to offer some reassurance just in case you have not already talked to him. I think my ex was in the 40's. We ended up breaking up, but I can tell you her Huntinton's was not the reason. I loved her and that was more important to me than the disease. If anything, I wanted to be there for her to give her support. Thank you for the reply!  We did end up breaking up but that was my choice more than his.  Hes been so wonderful but we lived in a city and I am just not a city gal.  I needed to come home to try and heal myself and let him get on with his life too.  Theres obviously been a lot of guilt surround the situation but he never made me feel bad at all.  It is going to be a long road but I am alright really.", "Consequences of getting tested. My mother had HD and for the longest time I decided I did not want to get tested. Recent events have me questioning whether or not I should get tested and I was wondering what effects a positive test would have from an insurance standpoint? I get insurance through my employer, but I was wondering if anyone who has, or has known someone, who had the test taken and how it effected their health insurance? Any answers would be helpful. You can receive the test, \u201canonymously\u201d you would have to pay out of pocket, but it would never show on any record that you even tested! I am going to do this when I test. I would talk to a genetic counselor near you about this. And find the closest clinic that tests anonymously. Insurance, especially from employers is not supposed to discriminate against preexisting conditions, however they do find ways around this, and if you ever change your job/employer things could change as well. Hope this helps. I did not know you could do that, that pretty much sounds like the way to go. Thank you so much. It sounds like you have the answer you are looking fir.\n\nFwiw, the official position in the US is that test results cannot affect your employability or ability to get health insurance. I believe life and LTC can still do as they wish. Before I was tested, I had to speak with a social worker and genetic counselor to ensure I \"had everything together\", so to speak. Long term care insurance and life insurance acquisition can be complicated (or even impossible) with a positive result. But long term care insurance and life insurance are different than health insurance.\n\nIn the USA, health insurance and employment cannot be legally affected by your genetic information (per the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008).\n\nThe HDSA has a really informative FAQ, which can be found ( And if you go ahead with testing, your genetic counselor will be a great resource.", "Results day tomorrow!! I am getting my blood test results tomorrow and I am feeling a but confused with how I am feeling, particularly because my dad die of prostate cancer at 42 when I was 3, before he developed HD and my mom decided to not tell me about HD till my wife was pregnant. So my question to anyone that can help, how did you feel before finding out your result, positive or negative??? Thanks in advance Sorry I do not have anything helpful to say about your situation, just wishing you good luck tomorrow. This has got to be a long day for you. Thank you!! We were nervous but also looking forward to finally having an answer. Unfortunately, we found out right after I gave birth so I can kind of relate. The results came back positive with a CAG of 43. Now we can stop wondering and start preparing for the future. Oof about your mom not telling you until you had a child on the way. Like a punch to the gut. Worse then my mom's games that is for sure. \n\nHope you get a negative and do not have to think about it ever again!\n\nETA your question. \n\nI was sick of not knowing. I was depressed and struggling with everything.\n\nAnd then I was positive. I could not get off the couch for weeks except to see my therapist. The first time I was driving home from that Google took me down Huntington drive and I cried the whole way. I lived three doors down from that street and it is a major street so it was not a surprise.\n\nBut. But. NOW I am 1000x better then I was when I was living under the cloud of uncertainty. I know so I can make choices to make it better, like not buying a two story house with the master on the second floor, or IVF for any kids. I finished college top of my class after testing. I have a career I love, a job I love, and am expecting twins (by IVF genetic screen so not passing it on).\n\n So I highly recommend testing. But give yourself lots of space to accept the answer. Even a negative would be an adjustment, although without the weeks on the couch. That is extremely fucked up of your mom. By the sounds of your post, it kind of seems that you have not really researched/understood the gravity of the disease. The post has a strange upbeat excited sort of feel to it which seems very out of place for this sub and this disease. You are a major bad ass. Just thought you deserve to know!!! I was nervous, but optimistic that I did not have it. The test came back positive and it was quite a blow. \n\nIt is been almost a year since I have got the results. I am glad I got tested. Knowing does not change the truth that I had the gene the whole time. It is empowering to know and now I feel less confused about decision making and planning for the future.\n\nI am crossing my fingers for a negative for you. Please let it be negative! Thanks so much. You really touched me. Well, I have done all the factual research I can but since I have never experience the disease nor have met someone with it, your right I dont understand the gravity of it.\n So thank you, having someone say it really does help , there is still so much I dont know about it Thank you, this might be a hard question but, have you thought how/when you were going to tell you child?? thank you for the message!! I have only ever spoken to my wife about it and now you guys, this is helpful, \nMaybe a hard question but, do you have day where I gets you down and how do you cope with it? Wow, that drive must have been the worst thing the world, I have not put to much thought into the weeks following the result tbf, and you have helped me do that, so thank you. So I am currently in the army and I have been told I get 1 day off if the result is positive.. so I dont know if keeping my mind distracted at work would help or just make things worst. \n I am curious to know how you mom told you, if it is not too hard of question? Usually people wait to get tested and have to go to genetic counseling before requesting the test, did you do any of that? My wife and I just had a baby girl via IVF. She did not want to be tested and we did not want to risk it. Best decision we ever made. Hey Goodluck. I too got tested before my wife and I started having kids to see which route we would take. What java said above about not being able to live with the uncertainty anymore is so true. I felt like a black cloud has been lifted over my life, and you will too. There is not an answer you\nWill not be able to handle. If you are negative, be grateful and humbled and carry on with your life the way you always wanted to. If you are positive, do the exact same thing. Clinical trials have made unreal break throughs and I think in 5 years people with huntingtons will be able to live completely normal lives minus some spinal injections. I would not worry about your child at all, by the time they come of age hopefully through the advancement of medicine this will all be a non issue. Congrats on the baby! I am sure you feel some resentment towards your mom for holding out, but maybe she did not know any better. Good luck and just remember that you are fine either way. You do not know how strong you really are until you are cornered. I am here if you want to talk !! We have not talked too much about it yet. I think as time passes we will meet with a genetic counselor on the best way to talk to her about it. It will certainly be a hard conversation. She will have our support no matter what. That is all I can offer her. I am sorry you are going through this. \n\nFor what it is worth, our genetic counselor all but guaranteed that by the time my daughter is old enough to show symptoms there will either be a cure or treatment to help her. That gives me peace of mind. \n\nStay strong. You are not alone. The world needs more people like you. I do not really remember how we were told. I was in high school (so like 18 years ago?). Dad was sick, had been diagnosed (wrongly) a few different times by then. I suppose we provide had a family dinner or meeting? None of us really understood what exactly it meant, at the time or i would remember it more. I think that was probably when I learned my dad's dad had been suffering early symptoms when he killed himself, long before I was born.\n\nI do not think I really started to understand how bad it was until a few years later when I was taking a college health class and used it as a subject for a paper. I think that was the first time I really dug deep into it. Although I knew I had the potential to have it, and dad was still getting worse. \n\nMy mom has often, since I tested positive, said have babies anyway, trust God to protect them. If the have it they will still be lovable! I was like... Hell no. It is my job to protect my potential kids so no baby until I can afford IVF. Also, bitch please, I am positive and I am loved. It are not about that. Somehow she gets to never understand that, and keep pushing her opinions and actively complicate our IVF (the lab asked for a sample from her to make the test more accurate and she said no) and still be grandma? \n\nSo not the same as what your mom did, but still lousy and hurtful and I am supposed to let it go and move on. As if. I wonder, because my brother is considering doing that, how does it work so you do not get your own result at the same time? Did you not look at the genetic report? Did the Drs have issues withholding information? \n\n\nI am expecting IVF twins and I agree, best decision ever was ivf even though it is a rough road to travel.\n\nCongratulations on the baby. :) I disagree, lol \ud83d\ude02 I can be a major ass and a pain to deal with. Natural red head and it shows. \n\nThat is kind of you to say. \ud83d\ude01 Thanks. We are two females so I donated my egg to her and she carried with donor sperm. Of course I do! It is only natural. The truth is that the knowledge is always in my heart and I carry around sadness. At first small things used to be really triggering like getting emails from work about our retirement plans. It is easy to spiral into negative thoughts about the future, especially when you have essentially been told that you are going to die a long slow drug out death. Plus I can actively see what it is doing to my father. It is hard. I do not think that it will ever get easier, but it is more tolerable to live with it every day. \n\nWhat I focus on is today. Today I am healthy. Today my dad is still alive. Today I can drive. I can go to work. I can cook and eat a meal. I can solve complex problems at work. I can make art. I can have friends. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, all we really have is today anyways. The future has always been in our imaginations. We could be gone tomorrow in an instant - look at Kobe. A bright light, snuffed out quickly. \n\nSo I just hug my friends and family tight and I live for today. I might start getting symptoms tomorrow or it might be 20 years from now. Or some amazing scientist could solve all this and I will never ever get it. Who am I to know?  I do not have time to dwell on facts that are not true yet. The facts today are that I am happy and healthy and I am going to hold on to those facts. Lmfao @ \u201cbitch, please\u201d \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso I visited my cousin in LA last year 6 weeks after my diagnosis and everything was called Huntington, you are right omg!

Negative :) sorry for the late replay been extremely busy at work Wow you are so lucky", "50% Probability b/w 2 siblings I realize that any child of a parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the Huntingtin gene, but does anyone, in particular, know the statistics/probability of two siblings BOTH inheriting HD or BOTH \\*not\\* inheriting HD? Or has it always just been the case that one sibling gets HD while the other remains HD free? Probably works by asking the right question.  What is the chance a child will inherit Huntington\u2019s? 50%.  But if you are asking what is the chance that both siblings will inherit Huntington\u2019s then you multiply the chances... 50% times 50% so 25%.  Each child still retains its individual chance of 50%.  \n\nIt is the same 25% chance for both not inherit.  So there is a higher chance that at least one child will inherit than both inheriting.  \n\nDoes this make sense?  It is the same probability you see when calculating chances on coin tosses. Yeah, it is simple math. 50% probability * 50% probability = 25% chance of both having it and a 25% chance of neither having it. My stepdad comes from a family of 5 kids and 4 out of the 5 kids are positive for HD Second this. I know someone who has three girls and each of them were positive. It is the luck of the draw unfortunately. Each individual has 50% no matter how you cut it. If you have a sibling they are positive do not take that as a sign you are less likely to have it. You are chance is still 50%. In a similar boat. My dad comes from a family of 3, 2 of 3 tested positive and the third just is not getting tested. Each individual still has 50% of inheriting the gene regardless of how many siblings they have who are also at risk. A brother's result has no bearing on his sister's result.\nBy way of example: my mother and both of her siblings all tested gene positive. I am sure statistically you would expect at least one to be gene negative but that is not how it works. It is true that each individual has a 50% chance regardless of the results of any other siblings, but it is also true that there is a 25% chance that two siblings are both negative or both positive (and a 75% chance that *at least* one sibling is negative or *at least* one is positive).\n\nI have two siblings so there was an 87.5% chance at least one of us was positive. I am positive, my one sibling is negative, and as you said my at-risk sibling is still 50/50 regardless of our test results. That is not the way it works. Each person has a 50/50 yes. When looking at weather both get it there are only so many possible outcomes. Sibling A = positive Sib B = neg. I think you have to find out how many equally possible outcomes exist and calculate off of that. Each child is an independent flip if a coin. A coin has 50% chance of being heads or tails, and is not affected by what any other flips were or will be.\n\nAlso, not a sex linked gene, so boys and girls have equal chance of getting it. (last time I saw my dad's sister she was telling me not to worry, I am a girl- guess what? I have it) Ugh, that sucks. Sorry. So far half of my family has tested, and we are 50/50. I am the unlucky half). I am sorry. It is a tough journey but having supportive family makes it so much easier. Hugs to you. Yes, I agree. However, the original question appears to be less about the statistics of one sibling being positive and one being negative and more about the impact one result has on the other.\n\nI have unfortunately seen families torn apart because people do not understand the difference between statistics and the reality for each individual. Yes all have 50 percent. My mom had 6 siblings and only 3 had the gene. Both me and my sister tested positive. Brother untested. Epidemiologist here (basically a fancy word for statistics haha). That is absolutely how it works. Each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene. Just like with each pregnancy, there is a 50% chance it will be a boy and 50% chance it will be a girl. However, in order to find the probability that BOTH are positive (or negative) you multiply the individual probabilities together. So, 0.5\\*0.5 = 0.25. If you are looking at a family with 2 kids, there is a 25% chance that BOTH kids will be positive. Just like there is a 25% chance that both kids will be boys and both will be girls. Of course, the results of the first kid does not impact the results of the second. But if you are looking at the probability of the family unit as a whole, that is now the statistics work. If there are 3 kids in a family, there is just a 12.5% probability that all 3 will be positive (or all 3 will be the same gender). Interesting one of my grandmother's aunt all four of her kids had it. Not sure about the aunt since the cousin mentioned her grandmother and all brothers had it and got it in their 60s like my mom. Then the mother of the lady had recently displayed signs in her 50s likely sped up by stoke. Now am trying to trace family with it especially since it has a genetic link. The first known case in the family is grandmother's uncle in 1952 and he was 1 of 7 kids of my second great parents Albert Byers and Minnie Zimmerman. We think my grandmother had it but was hiding it because of religionous reasons. So including my mom I now have seven descendants confirmed with diease.", "Reduced penetrance Hey all,\n\nIs there anyone who has experience with a reduced penetrance HD running in the family (CAG 36-39)?\n\nMy mom has CAG length 39, and I am getting tested soon. I am not sure how many repeats my grandma had, but she got slight symptoms only at around 70. My mom is 60 and has no symptoms. Honestly there is no rime or reason to this disease. My grandma dies at 80 and no one new she had it as she showed no symptoms. Her son started showing symptoms at 65 so that is when we new that she did not escape the dreaded disease that killed her mother at 45. My mother also did not start showing signs until about 68 she has cag 42. I also have cag 42 symptom free at 52. My sister has cag 43 and is in a nursing home since 55. Then another person with cag 39 symptoms in their 30\u2019s. I have tried tracing things and it gets crazy. Good news is it is your mom that has passed it down so usually the cash will stay the same. Good luck with testing I am praying you will have a negative results! I have a cousin who is CAG is 39. As far as I know she has no symptoms (she is in her early to mid 40s). Her mother/my Aunt has a CAG of 42, same with her younger sister. \n\nI would recommend discussing with a genetic counsellor to get a clearer picture, but as I understand it *generally* speaking people in the 36-39 range present with HD later in life, if at all. There are however always exceptions and the disease does not necessarily present the same for everyone even within the same family, even if their CAG # is the same. Depending on where you are you will get the opportunity to meet with a genetic counsellor in your testing process (that is how it works for me in Canada at least, not sure about other countries, hopefully that is available for you)\n\nUnfortunately your CAG number will not tell you whether your symptoms will be mild or severe, or early or late onset. The predictive testing can only really tell you what CAG repeat category you fall in (normal 10-26, intermediate 27-35, reduced penetrance 36-39 or disease causing 40+). There is no way to predict how the disease progression will present in any individual.", "HD Virtual Flash Dance ", "Haunted by a Gene - For the first time, Dr. Nancy Wexler reveals that she has inherited Huntington's, the disease she has spent her life studying. ", "Been depressed for 15 months - with a negative diagnosis I should be happy. I should be fine. I should not have lost hope in this life. But yet I did, despite not ever going to have to deal with HD unless my kids are born with it.\n\nWhat do I do? How long have you known it runs in the family? For me personally there has never been a time in my life I did not know about it, and on some level I have decided I have it despite not being tested yet. I could see how a negative diagnosis could completely upend how I perceive my life, even possibly leading to depression.\n\nDo you have any siblings/cousins that may also have it? There is definitely the possibility of survivor's guilt.\n\nYou should really talk to a professional. Before being tested did you talk to anyone to get ready? I know it a lot of places it is standard practice to give you a sort of psych exam before to make sure you are ready for whatever answer comes. If that is the case for you I would recommend reaching out to those same people.\n\nAs a side note, if you and your partner are HD free there is such an infinitesimally small chance your children will have it that it is not even worth worrying about. I have tested HD gene positive. I inherited the gene from my mother who committed suicide when she was still capable of doing so.\n\nYou do not need to be happy or fine with your family\u2019s medical history. I chose to get tested because the only thing more scary than knowing was not knowing. Knowledge is power, my friend. I personally use the diagnosis(my neurologist said I can bet my life on developing symptoms unless I die of something else first) as a means to live my life in the best way possible.\n\nI have chosen to not have genetic children. This hurts more than you know because I love my husband so much and I would love to pass on his DNA. He is also older now and if we went through the painstaking process of IVF, we would be likely to have an autistic child. It is not worth the risk, but I am not sure if I can adopt with my medical history.\n\nI live life to its fullest, without worry of cancer or other diseases. There is nothing worse than dying of HD (which is basically Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s wrapped around into one) so other lethal diseases are not as scary. I eat, I drink, I smoke weed and I vape nicotine. There is no reason to quit. \n\nI highly recommend thinking/meditating on what being alive means to you. Do you want a feeding tube to keep you alive? Do you want to be connected to a respirator when you cannot breathe on your own? Who do you want to make these decisions for you if you cannot? PLEASE make record of your wishes now, before it is too late.\n\nAs far as your depression, take life as it comes. I probably think about my future on a daily basis, but I do not let it get me down. I try my best to stay in the present and surround myself with people I trust who know about my gene positive diagnosis.\n\nHD is one of the worst genetic diseases. If people who are possibly gene positive stop having children, we would have the power to fully eradicate it. I have made the very painful choice to not pass on my potentially harmful DNA. I wish others in my family would do the same, but religious beliefs get in the way...as they usually do when humanity\u2019s progress is concerned, \n\nMy father may very well have encouraged my mother\u2019s suicide because he was seeing his current wife while my mom was sick. I will probably never know the truth, but I just wish my mom had waited 12 hours for me to say goodbye. It would have been nice to have some closure. Since May of 2017. My adoptive parents kept it secret from me my entire life - until I was old enough to get tested.\n\nI do not have any siblings that I am aware of. My birth mother died of it 2005/\n\nI did not really have time to talk to anyone other than the people at UW who were testing me that summer.\n\nI am single, but I really want to get married one of these days.

", "Before they need full time care, but still need help and someone checking in...? My dad died last week, which is terrible, but right now the matter at hand is that he left my mother as she enters the mid stages of HD. It is obvious to many people who have watched this disease attack our family, but of course, not to her. She will not even consider it. She has moments and whole days where she is fairly competent, and times when she is combative, uncoordinated, and cannot express a complete thought. She has obsessive thoughts. She has difficulty swallowing many foods and has tailored her diet to avoid them, citing GERD. She still drives. I have not allowed my son to ride with her for ten years and invented my own car sickness to make sure I am always the one driving when she is with me, but no one in my family, including my dad when he was alive, would support my push to get her to stop driving. \n\nI live across the country. Living with me is not an option. She also hates where I live (big city versus her rural town), she would not be safe or comfortable there, and I cannot imagine moving her away from her familiar surroundings and few remaining friends. I have a brother who lives near her, but who is also convinced she is still fine to live alone and is more a drain on her meager financial resources than anything. I finally convinced her to see a doctor for a physical next month, and I hope so much that she sends up a million red flags. Doubtful that she will mention the HD risk. \n\nDoes anyone know what my options are here? I would like to at the very least get someone to check in on her several times a week to make sure she is taking care of herself. I have considered a medical alert system that she can wear to call for help if she falls. Can I legally call her doctor and mention HD? Should I? I am anticipating that  she will probably require full time care within a year if she progresses the way her siblings did.  I would like her to be able to grieve my dad before we rip her from her home, but in the meantime...? And how do I know when it is time to just step in and go against her wishes? Why do parents have to make things so difficult for their children? Why do they refuse to face reality and fail to make their end of life wishes known? Anyone who hides their head in the sand when these matters are concerned is just creating more pain for their family in the future. I would absolutely share your fears with your mother\u2019s doctor. You may also need to become her power of attorney before things get too bad. Your mom is lucky to have you. Thanks. I intend to be tested soon too. I started the process a few years ago, but stopped for a few reasons. I started living and planning as though I have it, so a positive test can only make a difference in my actual medical care, which is quite important as I get older. I would also like my son (born before I knew of this family plague, thanks Mom) to have the information as he makes his own family plans in the next few years.\n\nMost of my family who are not living in denial think I am terrible for not just bringing her to live with me now. There are so many reasons, but I will admit that a huge one is that the years I spent living (very) near her were the unhappiest of my life, largely due to her behavior. It is hard to know what is the disease and what is just her. My own good years are most likely limited; I will not spend them miserable. If I could change all the other prohibitive factors, I still would not live with her. But I love her, and I will not let her suffer unnecessarily either. \n\nPower of attorney is going to be a real argument. I asked her for her bank account passwords last night and told her I wanted to be able to help her more easily if she gets locked out online or cannot navigate the site (realistically I want to make sure she is not giving her money away or being swindled), and she resisted. I am not looking forward to this battle. \n\n This can be stubbornness. Or a result of damage to the connections between the caudate and frontal lobe. Lack of self awareness is because they cannot recognize symptoms or evaluate their own behavior.  I hear you and I completely empathize with your situation. Even though it sounds harsh, your mom needs to fend for herself if she continues to refuse your help. You can only do your best and if she does not want assistance, so be it.\n\nJust in case you are feeling any guilt about putting yourself and your family first, do not. It is great that you are focused on your own happiness and sanity while you can. Use this as a learning experience so your son will not have to go through the same stress and anguish. He will appreciate it more than you know. Of course. It is a huge reason why it is so difficult to help her. It is possible she is being completely genuine when does not understand why everyone is so concerned because she simply does not recognize her own physical and mental deterioration. I was tempted to get her on video to show her the obvious chorea ...but I was a more than a little afraid of her having that sort of realization without professional help.  I have already talked about my own end-of-life plans with my son. He finds it morbid, but does appreciate that he will not have to wonder what I want.\n\nIn a happy update, I found out that my dad had the forethought to have durable POA documents drawn up for her, giving it me if he was unable to fulfill the duties.

I want to hear your story.\n\nMy friend, 53 F, has battled HD for 20 years. I cannot help but wonder if THC or CBD helps with symptoms. I am a regular smoker so I am not part of the drug war, but I have never heard pot helping tinnitus, being high makes it temporarily worse. When my grandfather was at the last stages of HD, we had him try CBD. For a time his speech, and mood improved. It also slightly reduced the intensity of his movement while asleep. Granted all of this was minimally notable changes, but it seemed worth continuing. He was never one for complaining, so realistically it is hard to truly know how it it felt for him but our observations are positive for what it is worth. My mother started recently using CBD oil and it helps with her chorea tremendously. Now, when she lays down, she does not move at all. This is incredible because usually she is moving nonstop until she is sleeping. He discussed CBD with our daughter\u2019s neurologist and he said that the medications that she was currently on could likely interact with it so we have shied away from it. ty! I have tried CBD and it replaces some of my (mild) chorea into slower more parkinsonian like behavior.  I will want to walk and occasionally my body responds with a delay.   \nI tend to have a little of that kind of symptom anyway, and stuttering, too.  I prefer it at bedtime, as u/kelibs described.  \nI do not tolerate THC very well.  Weed used to make me feel stupid and self-conscious and foggy.

Dad left the picture along time ago, and other family members are caring for my grandmother who has ALS. Mom was diagnosed with HD over 10 years ago, but the past year- year and half have been the worst. \n\nMom fell in July walking to the pool, was admitted for elevated WB count, and then we found out she had aspiration pneumonia. They sent her home with meds and at this time it was kind of just decided by family that I be her sole caregiver (12 weeks pregnant at this time mind you). \n\nWhen mom first got home it was great. She was compliant. She knew she needed my help. She received ST, OT, and PT for a little over a month but was  discharged because she had plateaued.  A couple weeks later my husband and I took a trip up north for 4 days (we payed her caregiver extra to take care of her during the weekend). When we came back mom had been nothing but belligerent, nasty, quick to snap. She is gotten verbally and physically abusive with me. She does not raise her voice to anyone else, just me.\n\nI have tried talking to her about how much easier it would be if she agreed to do assisted living- especially with me being pregnant and expecting my first child (I am an only child btw). And she goes \u201cI know it would make things easier for you but, I am dying in this house. I am not going to an assisted living/nursing home\u201d. Which I get completely but I am starting to resent her. It is getting to the point where I can feel myself dreading the next day because I do not ever get a day off. I am there over 12 hrs a day &amp; 7 days a week. I take her to all her appointments, pick up her meds, feed her, laundry, cleaning, and everything else you can think of. \n\nI just needed to vent. I am so flustered and beyond frustrated. It\u2018s not fair that I am in this alone. It is not fair that she will not compromise to make it easier. This disease sucks and that is all. I am really sorry to hear that all this is happening to you. I also had to take care of my parents when I was around your age, since both of them were sick (my dad had HD, my mom had another dementia). My dad had a lot of behavioral issues, including verbal and physical. I really empathize. \n\nCouple options: can you talk to her doctors and explain the recent change? It might really help to find an HD specialist. I know they can be rare so you often may to go through HD organizations like the HDSA to find them, but, properly medicating an HD patient is so important. My dad was not properly medicated until he ended up in a nursing home with an HD wing, and the difference was so profound. Another option: it sounds like she has a carer. Can they do some of these tasks? Can you hire a maid / housekeeper / some other help? Because this is not tenable. Does your region have any kind of elder assistance office? There may be social workers there who can help connect your with resources.\n\nOther option: who does she live with? Is she in your house? My dad did not want to go to an assisted living facility, but, it was not about what he wanted. I was able to frame the move as my mom needing care so that helped, and I used every tactic (being honest, being firm, being forceful, cajoling, bribing) I could think of, but in the end the fact was was that he needed to be cared for by professionals, and this decision was not a discussion. I know that sounds awful and I imagine it was not the most gracious way to deal with it, but I was 22 and there was no way I could take care of them. Your mom is verbally and physically abusive. That is not a safe environment for you, and it is not for your child, either. It is not even a safe environment for your mom. Maybe you could check out assisted living facilities / nursing homes in your area. Definitely see if there are any HD . Find aspects that your mom would like- activities, amenities, etc. I would try different tactics until you find one that works.\n\nAre you in the US? I think you could really benefit from talking to the HDSA or someone like it. They have resources for caregivers too, like how to respond to HD patients screaming. And hopefully they can connect you to things *you* need, like a therapist or a support group. None of this is fair. And I think you really could use someone to talk to about that. Even if your mom does move to a facility, you will still be doing things to take care of her. You need to have support for yourself. I am so sorry you are going through this. I hope you find ways to take care of yourself.  Hey, is it your maternal Grandma who has ALS? Are you and your family sure it is ALS and not HD? Since HD is a genetic disease, it would have needed to been passed down from someone. \n\nI also second going to an HD clinic. They will best known how to go forward with your Mom. It is hard at the stage is at because she seems \"normal\" to people who do not know her. So some people may not think she needs assisted living, especially if she is saying no. I had this struggle with my Mom. Talk to your closest HD clinic and they will help you. If you are in Canada there are clinics here too. There are ones in BC, Calgary, Ontario and Quebec. \n\nWhat are you doing to take care of yourself? The clinics may be able to offer you respite care as well, where a PSW will come help your Mom while you tend to your needs. \n\nDo you have a spouse to help you with your Mom and the baby on the way? \n\nHD sucks, I am at risk myself and just had my blood drawn on the 15th of October. I also have two sons.  I know HD is hereditary it runs in my family more than just my mom. Yes we are sure my grandmother has ALS, she went to s pencils hospital to be tested specifically for ALS. It was my mom\u2019s dad (maternal grandfather) was the one who passed the HD down to her. \n\nWe are in the states, so there is not really clinics here. My mom has a neurologist who specializes in HD, she is been seeing him since she got diagnosed. I am married as previously stated, and my husband does help with helping take care of my mom. I am just at wits end, I am not able to care for her anymore. I am beyond stressed and taking care of mom is just getting harder.\n\nMy mom\u2019s way past beginning symptoms, she is in the late stages of HD. Her neurologist, family members, and primary care doctor all agree she needs full time care. But my mom is the one denying any such care. She wants to die in her house with hospice care eventually. My mom has a CNA that the state provides and she is phenomenal she is been with mom for 2 years. There is not much the state can do for me as far as helping take care of mom. Even with me being pregnant, the state cannot provide more for mom just because of my circumstances. I have applied for more hours multiple times and continue to get denied. It does not help that my mom was a nurse 11 years before becoming symptomatic so she knows how to play the system. \n\nI am so sorry to hear of your recent testing for HD. The best advice I can give is allow help when you need it. Make sure you have plans set way ahead of time, and make sure there 100% helpful to not just you- but to your kids and significant other.  We have a HD specialist who has been with mom ever since she was diagnosed. So for around 19 years, we have an appt coming up this week and I intend to let them know of the changes. My mom has been on medicine for the HD for over 8 years.  We finally found a mix of medicine that seems to really help her chorea. The behavioral changes are not truly new, she is always been nasty. But lately it is just a whole new level. \n\nMe and my aunt are both active members with the HDSA but the thing is that my mom does not want half of the things she needs. She out right refuses any assisted/nursing facilities ( she was a nurse for over 11 years before symptoms) and I completely understand. It would just make it so much easier for me and my family, considering I am the only child. \n\nMy mom does have a CNA already but my mom only has 25 hours of care per week, which is 6 days a week 3 1/2 hours per day. My mom\u2019s CNA cooks, cleans, does laundry, showers, and does basic care for mom. Also considering my mom\u2019s only 48 she does not qualify for any elder service despite her HD.\n\nShe lives in her own house. My husband and I  live with my in-laws for the moment. But we are planning to move next year due to him starting his career. We offered to move my mom in but she wants to live alone, and I am not going to force her to move in with me. Nor, am I going to have her live with us and treat me the way she does  around my child. \n\nI used to be a CNA so I know my mom needs to be in a care facility but she refuses. I have had the state called on her and she knows how to work the system so they deemed her perfectly fine to live at home. Trust me if there were a way that I could get her to go into a care facility I would. She is just overly stubborn. I know I would have to help care for her but doing it by myself would not be a thing anymore. \n\nThank you so much for replying and understanding!  \"like how to respond to HD patients screaming\"\n\nJust wondering, what do you mean by that? What screaming? This is so hard - we are trying to decide what to do with my Mom when the time comes. She obviously does not want to do assisted living or a nursing home. \n\nWhat about adult daycare? Just to give yourself a break? The ones around us will do pick up and drop off and it would give you a few hours to yourself...\n\nAlso, is your Mom on any mood stabilizers? My Mom went on one (Depakote) last spring and it changed our lives. Seriously, made her 100% better to deal with (and I think made her feel better in general - she is sleeping more regularly, seems clearer, etc.). It was AWFUL getting her on them (she was maintaining at that time that she was asymptomatic and had \"the best brain in the family\") but it has turned out to be well worth the trouble.  Like, what to do when they are yelling at you or otherwise being verbally belligerent / aggressive.  That is good that you have an HD specialist. Is she on any meds to manage her behavioral symptoms? My dad's psychiatric symptoms were really the biggest issue, and it took the longest time to get him on the right combination of those. \n\nI am glad your mom has a CNA. But since you mention in your OP that you are doing laundry and cleaning, do you think there is a way you could supplement the CNA? If the CNA hours cannot be raised, maybe you could find other services to cover the cooking or cleaning that the CNA cannot do in the hours they are there for? My parents were both in their 50s when they were ill; I never reached out to elder services thinking that they would not qualify, but, it is possible that elder services will have a social worker that can still help you. If you have tried this route and gotten nowhere, totally ignore this. But one of my biggest regrets looking back was that I dismissed options thinking they would not help. Like, I assumed there were no HD specific nursing homes so I did not look for them. I assumed elder services would not help so I never reached out. It was not until a social worker at a hospital started working with me and my dad that we found an HD specific nursing home and other resources, and it was the best thing that happened for my dad. If all elder services can do is get a social worker to look over your mom's story, that might be worth it. A fresh set of eyes could be useful. It may not help, of course, so worth it to manage expectations, but it could help. \n\nHer living in her own house certainly complicates and simplifies things. It sounds healthiest for you and your family that she is not living with you. Such a tricky situation still though. I am very sorry.\n\nAs for the care facilities- I understood my dad's extreme aversion to them too. He may have been more advanced when I got him into a facility; he would not have been able to convince anyone that he was capable of safely living at home. My dad was incredibly stubborn. He would not even admit he had HD, so his reaction to the thought of a facility was....intense. It became a battle of wills, and I just had to make mine stronger. I also had power of attorney and medical proxy and all that sorted out by then, so I suppose there were intermediate steps beforehand of me taking over the decision making. Still, it boiled down to me just taking control, almost like how you treat a child. That approach could absolutely have backfired. I do not know why it worked for my dad. You mentioned in another comment that you are in the states so there are not really clinics- you just do not live near one? \n\nAs a last comment, the HD nursing homes I lived near had long waitlists. It might be worth it to start researching and visiting now, even though your mom refuses to go to one. It might mean less work &amp; time for you later when she finally cannot avoid reality anymore. There are plenty of good facilities, but I really cannot speak more highly of the HD specific units. My dad was a sullen, angry, volatile patient until he got into his HD unit. He started laughing and joking again once he was there. I think it was the only place he felt normal and accepted, and the fact that they could adjust his meds in house was such a game changer. It made me regret not realizing the utility of a psychiatric nurse on staff at a facility. \n\nI hope your local HDSA chapter has been helpful. And I want to apologize for how much advice is in my post. When I was in your position, I felt very overwhelmed with all the advice I got, and I felt like no one really could understand my position anyway. I obviously cannot understand your position, and I recognize that while vaguely similar, what worked in my situation may not work in yours. I wanted to give advice anyway though because these are the things I wish someone had told me / I wish I had listened to. Definitely know that you are not the only 22/23 year old dealing with this, though we are rare. I am really sorry again that you are going through this. \"It fucking sucks\" is such an understatement. And I hope you find support for yourself, too.

He was diagnosed in his late 50's and is over 60 now and still doing relatively well. I am in my late 20's, female, married, at risk with no symptoms, and ready to start a family. I have decided I am not ready to get tested yet. I know everyone is different, but not knowing my status is the only way I can hold onto a little bit of hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been saving for IVF and PGD (pregenetic diagnosis) for sometime since I knew this might be the only option to ensure my future children do not carry the gene. I originally thought I would find out my status prior to pursuing IVF but learned there are options for IVF/PGD without knowing my own HD diagosnis. I met with one fertility clinic and have another consult coming up. The first clinic was optimistic and understanding of my situation. My husband is supportive of me remaining \"at-risk\" and pursing IVF/PGD. However, I have been reading more about IVF and know this will be a long, expensive, emotionally/physically draining process and does not guarentee a child in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone gone through IVF/PGD? Really any advice or discussion related to starting a family when you are at risk for HD is appreciated. Thanks :) My son's wife is about to start. He did not want to second guess everything in the next few decades. I hope you get a bit of , Live every moment. Child birth is hard in lots of ways for lots of reasons, you are doing yours for the best if reasons.  My wife and I are going through this right now. Her father had HD and she is untested non-symptomatic. To be sure there was no possibility that she could have her status revealed to her, I had my eggs extracted to be implanted in her. We have ten viable embryos ready for implantation and we are actually implanting on Monday 10/1. We did all testing for me, but we saw a genetic specialist and go to support groups which have women who have gotten pregnant with non HD children via gene testing. \n\nWhat specifically would you like to know? Do you mind sharing about how expensive it was? Do you know if it is more expensive whether the male or female is the one at-risk? Is it a long process? \n\nI am a 22 Y.O. male at risk, not thinking of having kids anytime soon, just curious to gain some knowledge of how this goes, for the future.  Hi- my wife (cag 40) is currently 5 months pregnant after undergoing IVF with PGD.  She inherited from her father (cag 41).  We are both in our mid-30s, held off on children for a few years while deciding what we wanted to do but ultimately knew she would test prior to us having kids.  Because of the high cost (in USA) and stress of the process (both emotionally for both of us and on her body) we did not want to go through it if she was not positive for HD.  We had no known fertility issues and it ultimately took us two tries for it to work.  We are really excited and I can try to answer any specific questions you might have or will pass your questions on to my wife. I am in the same boat as you so I totally understand. There is a PGD IVF Fb group that you could find a lot of support in. I find this area particularly hard to find a good support group because a lot of people react really strongly to you deciding to make sure your kids do not have it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe social worker who manages a bunch of HD cases and has for decades and works with my family said these would be the ideal situations if they could tell every prospective HD parent this (based on you living in the USA):\n\n1. Go out of country. (if you can, I know that is super privileged from a financial standpoint). The reason for the being that we do not have guaranteed protection with pre-existing conditions. If your insurance company finds out you have it, they will take all your money for shitty insurance...and if ACA gets repealed then (god forbid), then no one will cover you. Also, it can save you thousands of dollars. Our medical system is not really that amazing, and Greece can do the same procedure for half the cost and just as safe. \n2. Pay in cash, not through insurance, if you can. Again, keeping the trace info to a minimum. \n3. Make sure you use a hospital  network that you probably will not use again. With a lot of medical charts moving to cloud systems used by multiple hospitals in the same network and can pull files from anywhere in that same network. Technically they should not because it is a hippa violation, but rules get broken all the time so I would not trust it.\n\nHope that helps a little. We are trying to find and IVF doctor that will let us not give our SSN (b/c that is not legally required) and let us pay cash. It is not easy, but it is safer in the long run in case the ACA gets destroyed by the cheeto in chief or the republicans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother method, is for you to just get pregnant and test the embryo and abort if it has HD. It saves you thousands and reduces the chances of coming out of all this effort without a kid. But you also have to carry it around and think about it for 8/10 weeks before they can test it. Which for some people just is not an option from a mental health standpoint. You can also fly up to Canada and get it tested and come back down for an abortion to keep that off medical records as well.  (please no hate over this comment, just trying to make sure people who find this resource are full informed of all the options regardless of how they feel about each of them) It depends on where you go, (see my earlier comment).

Final thoughts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Hello readers, let me preface this with a couple of disclosures. This writing may contain vulgar language, difficult to discuss topics, and Huntington\u2019s disease-specific jargon. This is a very informal piece of writing, as I am just trying to get a few things off of my chest. I feel as if there is a great need inside of me to write my own thoughts down. I said to myself a year ago around this time that I would do this but I have put it off ever since. I am hoping that writing this would alleviate some of the dark and deep thoughts that keep me up at night from their sporadic conjuring. This very informal piece of writing is about my thoughts and feelings about Huntington\u2019s disease and how it has impacted my family. I hope it can be used as a guide to help others understand what is going on in the mind of someone who is significantly impacted by Huntington\u2019s disease and/or for others who are also impacted by the disease to reflect and share ideas with one another. This writing will be quite long so I would like to provide an outline above to make it as less confusing as possible to navigate through with perfect clarity. A little info about me to help you understand my situation; I am 19 years old, I live with my parents and my brother, and my brother, father, and I are both HD positive as well.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuntington\u2019s disease, those two words alone make me so uncomfortable. It is as if I would rather hear the noise of other rather foul things than the two words that title a mere disease; except it is not just a mere disease to me, it is the dictator of my very existence. Everything I do, I do by thinking about Huntington\u2019s disease, and how it impacts my decision to choose something or the latter. Sometimes my decision making is skewed by the ever-changing perspective I have on the disease. I do not currently know how many repeats that are contained my DNA, though I am in the process of obtaining that information. I try to make important life choices with the thought in mind that I would be a \u201cmess\u201d in my mid-thirties and die in my mid-forties, forbidding any unforeseeable circumstances. It forces me to think with the mentality of either saying, \u201cFuck it\u201d or \u201cHow will this impact me later on?\u201d. I keep to myself for the most part, I do not have many friends for the fact that it is hard to be open and personal with others when engaged in a relationship. I think about finding love in the future all the time, I would love to get married and have kids but that is just something someone of my \u201cstatus\u201d can only dream about. I have educated myself a great deal on the disease of which I consider to be a huge factor of my existence. I have written many papers and made my graduation project based on the topic of the disease. I have talked with the wonderful doctors and nurses that work at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, where I participated in a study to store a vile of my blood in a bank for experimentation. I struggle with having faith and hope due to the circumstances of my situation. I do not enjoy hearing that the lord is just testing me, I find it hard to believe sometimes even though I would love to. I am content with a cure not coming out in my lifetime, and I am perfectly okay with dying. I have always thought about death from HD as some sort of defeat, which is why I sometimes wish death upon my self in other forms so I would not be defeated by the disease that has tainted my family tree. I would never kill myself for the sake of my mother, she has already been through so much, and even then I do not believe that I would have the willpower to do so. I try to look at life as a gift because even though I will not grow old, there are many others in worse situations who die young. So I try to appreciate all that I have been given in life. I struggled with thoughts that I had juvenile HD for a while. I would be in the middle of a test and my leg muscles would twitch uncontrollably for a few seconds, and I would ask my self why am I wasting my time worrying about a silly test when I am about to die soon. Those same twitches used to keep me up a night all the time, but the doctor at Wake Forest insisted that is was some sort of benign fasciculation. I still have doubts about it but learning that was like learning I was a free man, for the time being. I would also like to mention that I am truly grateful for those before me and the sacrifices they made to make sure that I would be in the best possible situation for whatever happens to me later in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love all of my grandparents, from both sides of the family, but I just feel a stronger connection to those of my Father\u2019s side. A connection that is derived from a genetic disease. The story goes that my grandfather went to the doctor expressing minor symptoms so they sent him out to get tested. He found out that he tested positive for HD, so my father immediately got tested and got a positive test too. However, my father\u2019s test results unveiled something so unbelievable that the staff had to do a double take. The test showed that my father inherited two copies of the gene, one from each parent. Nobody could believe it, as my grandmother was in denial it helped her put together the pieces of the puzzle that were her mother. I had not known this information until recently after my grandmother\u2019s funeral. My mother did not tell this to me or my brother because with that sort of information, it would allow one to figure that there would be a one hundred percent chance of inhering the disease. After learning of that information it allowed me to in a way, connect the dots to everything. I am rather tall so when I went to get a drink from the fridge at my grandparents\u2019 house one day, I saw a \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d document for my grandfather signed off by the doctor at Wake Forest. I initially questioned why anyone would have that sort of documentation, but after some consideration and having similar thoughts, I came to an understanding of their decision. The bizarre part about this was that years later I saw the same document on top of the fridge but it was for my grandmother, and it was signed off by the same doctor at Wake Forest. I was so confused at the time, and it irritates me now that I could not have understood what it meant. My grandfather was a carpenter, a jack of all trades and truly a master at all of them. I looked up to him a great deal when I was young, and I was concerned when I heard that he was being fired from multiple job sites and retiring early. It then made a lot of sense given his diagnosis, and he quickly became visually symptomatic. I am grateful for spending a lot of time with him, especially in his later years. He gave up smoking and drinking so he could prolong his life a little longer, which is like climbing Mount Everest for someone with HD. A side note from that; the doctor at Wake Forest mentioned to me that it is very unlikely for people with HD to get cancer (except skin cancer), which helped me understand why my grandfather and my great uncle never developed any form of lung cancer, but my grandmother had melanoma at one point in her life. My grandfather\u2019s rapid deterioration has helped me in a way visualize how my death will ensue. I sometimes am regretful for not spending much time with my grandmother in her later years, though I am grateful for spending a significant amount of time with her and my grandfather when I was younger. I never even suspected her of having HD, she was not visually symptomatic in the slightest. My mother likes to use her as an example as the perfect scenario for someone with HD, as she had the highest number of CAG repeats out of my dad and grandfather, and she was a successful bank manager who lived into her sixties with little to no symptoms. I did not attend my grandmother\u2019s funeral because my mother wanted to in a way shelter my brother and I from the information that would be told during the service, and I am grateful for that because at the time I do not think I was ready for that. During the later days of her life, apparently, she went through a period of enlightenment and wrote down her thoughts on sticky notes and placed them all around her house. I say apparently because I was not there as my mother wanted to shield the idea that my grandmother had the disease from my brother and me, again of which that I am grateful for because I do not think I was ready for at the time. I just wish I could read what some of her final thoughts were, but nevertheless, I love and respect my grandmother more so after my realization. I always thought that my grandmother died from starvation because she did not want to live anymore without her husband; though that was somewhat true, I never had a clue to what the real cause of her death was. We spread their ashes on a tree that overlooks their house, the house that my grandfather built himself. I wish we had the money to keep the house but unfortunately, we had to sell it, but at least their ashes lay with one another. Their deaths were extremely hard on my father, and I am truly grateful that he has my mother at his side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are probably the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. I love each one to the point where it is genuinely difficult to find the words that can describe how much they mean to me. My father is someone who I have looked up to my life. He is extremely smart and knowledgeable about a lot of things regarding dad-like topics, just like his father. It is extremely saddening to me to see him deteriorate the way that he is. My father used to scare me senseless when he got mad back when I was younger. His face would turn red hot as he screamed and slammed his hands on whatever he could find, it was as if I was looking the devil himself in the face at times. As I began to gain a better understanding of the symptoms of HD it has given me an explanation to his uncanny behaviors. My father has gotten to the point where he falls, spills drinks, and makes a mess with whatever he does; so we rarely if ever eat out anymore. In a way I am pleased with the way that is so, it allows for our family to eat together with no distractions or pressures from the outside world. It is extremely embarrassing to notice the stares and whispers while out with my father, I have grown to accept it but even then it is still challenging. I have a lot of fond memories with my father but I get frustrated when the embarrassing ones crowd my mind and overshadow the fond memories I would like to remember. I find is absolutely saddening to see how my father treats my mother sometimes. The things he says and does are at times so unspeakable, I really want to blame the disease for his actions. It makes me wonder if that same type of behavior will be the same that I will exhibit later in my life. It is like the flipping of a switch sometimes, one moment he is the most lovable guy that I am proud to call my dad and another moment where I am looking into his eyes and asking myself who or what is controlling his mind. My father attempts to help around the house when clearly stated not to, at times his thoughtfulness is admirable but often times is stressful as it ends up being more work than originally required. It makes me tear up every time I think about how he participates in studies down at Wake Forest just so one day there could be a cure for my brother and I, the nurses there told me that he is not doing it for himself but in fact that he is doing it for me. I know it is pretty clich\u00e9 to say that my father is someone who I consider to be a hero but the sacrifices he has made help me consider him as such. My mother, on the other hand, is the strongest woman I know. She has given up everything in her life for my brother and I. I know she could have easily left my dad a long time ago, but she decided to stay for whatever reason and I am truly grateful for that. Taking care of my father has become a full-time job as of recently, so she sacrificed her career to take off work to help him and care for herself. I say take care of herself because the amount of stress that she has endured from my father over the years has taken a great toll on her health. I love my mom to the moon and back for the sacrifices she has made for me and everyone else in the family, and I cannot put into words how much she means to me. She is an example of why I do not plan on marrying and having kids in the future. I feel like she is trapped in a life that she does not deserve, and I would not want to wish that on anybody or make anyone feel that way. My mother has proven time and time again her strength and wisdom through her perseverance in the life she was given. My mother is a nurse and I am grateful to have someone in the house that is knowledgeable on medicine and medical practices. In the past months, my parents have been attending church on a regular basis and I am delighted to see that the two of them are doing much better than they previously were. My father drives everyone crazy sometimes and I know he does not mean to and sometimes it is at the fault of the disease. Which leads to my greatest fear of all, I am afraid that after my father passes away that I will feel relieved in a sense that we do not have to worry about taking care of him anymore. I do not enjoy entertaining these thoughts because it feels wrong to me yet they still crowd my mind sometimes. I love both of my parents with all of my heart and appreciate everything that they have done for my brother and I. As far as my brother goes, he is an entirely different story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love my brother but he sure makes it extremely difficult at times to do so. I know it is hard for both of us to realize it now, but in the future, we are going to be all that we have. Sadly, I do not think he is anywhere close to coming to that realization. One of the nurses at Wake Forest made an excellent point to not have much baggage when you get to your years of deterioration, and to try to travel light. What she meant by that is to try to be physically fit and active to prolong deterioration and to make the whole process easier by being prepared for the fight, giving those a better chance of living better and longer until the very end. My brother is what one would call obese, and I am very proud of him for making great strides to become healthy. My only real gripe with my brother is that I feel that he does not appreciate our parents enough to spend any time with them. Our dad is dying and he could not care enough to spend any time with him. The excuse of being uncomfortable around him and seeing how he is deteriorating is getting really old with me. The only time he gets to spend genuine time with my dad is at the dinner table, even then, he arrives late and leaves early most of the time. It is also very frustrating to see him talk to our mother the way that he does, after all of the sacrifices that she has made for this family. I do not know what it is going to take to get him to change, something like a drastic occurrence I suppose. I used to wish that I was the only one of us to inherit the disease, to in a way make up for how I treated him in our younger years. Now that we both have inherited the disease, I do not know what to think. I am just now coming to a realization that I have never put much thought in the idea of him actually having the disease as well. I am fine with myself dying from the disease if I must, but the thought of my brother having to go through the whole ordeal frightens me. We butt heads and argue often, but I just want the best for him in life. When our parents both pass away I hope by then we are more than capable of guiding ourselves to a path that best suits our needs and continue to stick side by side with one another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo end this informal piece of therapeutic writing I would like to give thanks, to those who read this extensive little spiel, and the members of my family who have expressed everlasting love through significant sacrifices. I am very appreciative of the life I have been given with the hand that I have been dealt. I plan on participating in as many studies and trials in hopes to help find a cure for the young kids with their whole life ahead of them who do not realize that one day they are going to receive some information that is going to feel like a gunshot to the stomach to learn. I feel that everyone should be appreciative of what they have been given even if it is not much. Huntington\u2019s disease has stressed me out for years, and it has kept me up at night almost every day with dark thoughts. I wanted to use this piece of writing to help me calm some of the thoughts that keep me up at night and to connect with others and share different or similar experiences. If you need someone to talk to who has some sort of experience in this depressing field, feel free to message me anytime. I came up with a slogan for my family that says, \u201cAgainst all odds\u201d, and I believe the inheritance of Huntington\u2019s disease is something that forces many individuals to show true strength and courage to attempt to defy the odds and be more than a mere statistic. Hey great piece, thanks for writing. You mentioned Huntington's disease lowers the risk of cancer, but not skin cancer. Does it have no effect on skin cancer, or does it increase the likelihood? Do you have any sources? Sorry to hone in on such a specific part of your piece, I am just particularly interested in that for the moment.  Thanks \nAll I have is the doctors word and no scientific proof. He said that something with the Huntington\u2019s gene attacks cancer cells, leading to a less of a chance of getting cancer. He mentioned that it has no effect on skin cancer so you still need to see a dermatologist ever once in a while. My grandfather and his brother had smoked so much in their life it explains why I guess they were immune to lung cancer. My other grandfather who only smoked earlier in his life developed lung cancer really bad, and he did not have hd. My grandmother had melanoma (skin cancer) a couple times, and she had hd. I am not condoning taking up a habit like smoking, but if you are that stressed out that you have hd I guess it is okay. It is nice to have one less thing to worry about while dealing with the disease. Thank you for writing that all out. Really helped put into words how I feel regarding this disease's impact on my own dad and family.  Yeah\nIt is sad to see the people you have looked up to your whole life deteriorate in such a slow and painful way. Then you realize that you will be in the same exact spot where they are in the future. It is just a sad endeavor all the way through, but it is better to make the most of every day and every second you get to spend with those you love. If a parent has Huntington, do you inherit the same length of gene and does it begin to present around the same age? Or is the length and presentation random? I am not entirely sure... I would assume that there is a slight correlation. Though my grandmother had the highest amount of repetitions in the family and was not very symptomatic. My father on the other hand has less repetitions than her and his age of onset is very sooner; his severity of symptoms is also way worse. My great uncle is really old and he is doing well, he claims it is because he is into lifting and eating healthy. \n\nYou could use that information to somewhat estimate how you will progress, but ultimately I would get tested to see how many repeats you have. I have not gotten tested, and I want to soon to see how many repeats I have.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone or anything else (with someone who has some experience with he), I am all ears. Thank you! I only found it my dad has it today and he is 80 and I am only 26. I have spent all day in a hole looking for info about this disease and need to take a break from thinking about it. I think I will get tested as soon as I can. I was never given the chance to get tested, but I would seriously consider both options. Personally I would want to know, and on the other hand you have the ignorance is bliss idea. I would rather have a plan for my life knowing how it all will unfold. \n\nI used to always think about hd (24/7), trying to make assumptions and crazy plans for down the road. It used to keep me up at night (still does sometimes), it really helps to get distracted. What I mean by that is to do what you love (sports, hobbies, activities, etc). Try to get out of the house as much as possible. \n\nI would also try to spend as much time as you can with your immediate family and relatives. Even though they may be a constant reminder of hd, I still think it is important to be close to them. I am glad to hear it is gotten easier for you to not think about constantly \u2014 the distraction advice is really good for someone like me. Plus that is how I want to live my life with or without HD.

Are you talking about things related to cysteine like this:  ( ELI5? You can look at these two reviews:\n( and ( I think it basically comes from the finding that MSN (medium spiny neurons) are particularly vulnerable to glutamate excitotoxicity and these are the neurons affected in HD. Mechanisms are not fully clear (as most in HD, unfortunately, we are close to gene therapies, but basic pathogenic mechanisms of HD are still not fully understood). Problems with glutamate transport/reuptake might be actually not in neurons themselves, but in astrocytes ( Astrocytes are important for microenvironment and homeostasis of neurons and are responsible for large part of glutamate reuptake after its release at the synapse. If this is malfunctioning, glutamate stays there and MSNs might be first type of neurons to be damaged. oooh i see now, this really was enlightening, thank you for taking the time to reply!", "Update on my last post Hey, it is the panicked 14 y/o lol. I cannot link my posts since I am on mobile but you can find both of them on my post history\n\nSo I talked to my dad about it. He confirmed that my mom, uncle and grandmother have HD. I knew my mom and grandmother have it but I did not know my uncle did. We talked about it and he told me that he could tell I did my research but that I was overreacting a bit. I told him that it is likely that there is going to be a cure in 10-20 years and he immediately cut in and went \"sooner than that, they are already working on some sort of injection or some sort of nose spray.\" He told me not to panic and that there is still the 50% chance that I do not have it. He explained that HD is partially the reason why my mom's been acting the way she is. He said that he and my mom agreed that they would be fine with me figuring it out on my own but that they did not want to deliberately tell me until I was an adult. He said not to worry because even in the worst case scenario with me having it and having no cure, people in my family have not shown any symptoms until their 50's/60's and my great grandmother that has it is still alive at 80 years old so it is not like I am going to die tomorrow.

He did not take the news very well and said he is not okay with the chance I could have it. Sure, I was not 100% happy with the relationship but I wish this disease was not the reasons things had to end. I guess I am going to have to tell ever potential partner about my deepest secret and just have to do a sort of russian roulette until SOMEONE thinks they can take living with a potentially sick girl. \n\nI hate that this was the nail in the coffin. I hate that I know it will be the nail in many, many other relationships I have. Why do we have to fucking deal with this. None of us fucking deserve to worry about being lonely or having to break up good relationships, romantic or otherwise, because of something we cannot control. I am so frustrated. Why cannot I be a normal woman who breaks up for normal reasons? Why cannot I just have my life in MY control rather than some disease?  Good rant. Get it out. Fuck HD!!!!! HayeBail, that is not the guy you want to be with anyways, or any other guy who cannot commit to being there for the \"worse\" part of \"For better or for worse\".  There is a pretty good chance they would have dumped you for something else if it was not for the Huntinton's.  I know you are just ranting and your emotions are going to be running high for awhile after, but it will always get better.  Hang in there, and you still have people who love you, go spend some time with them if you can.\n\nFor what it is worth, I have a whole lot of Huntington's positive folks in my family who found significant others willing to to live with that as a part of their relationship.  Those are the most amazing sort of people, who basically volunteer to take on Huntington's (maybe more difficult than HAVING Huntington's), and they are out there.  \n\nIn the meantime, stay strong.  It is an awful disease, and it will create difficulties in your life that you have to be prepared for.  Sending you my love and prayers! Yeah! Fuck HD! Thanks. I appreciate your encouragement Fuck HD! I met my wife 21 years ago, and she told me that she was at risk about two weeks into \"dating\" (sleeping together.) I did not care at the time, and even though it is basically ruined both of our lives, I would not change the fact that I stayed with the person I love. \n\nYou do not want to have somebody who bails when shit gets really bad. Better to lose them now. \n\nBig hugs.  Do not let it get to you. You deserve better. I met my wife a few years back and she she broke the news about her family HD, long story short, she went through the proccess and got tested with very difficult news. But I still married her anyways. We are very happy and even though I know the tough times are coming everything has been worth it and I am ready to be there for her. You will find someone who will be there and care for you. They will give you the unconditional love you deserve. Stay strong, stay positive and keep moving forward. \n\nF HD btw  I know I am biased cause I am very lucky to be married to someone extremely supportive. But I fully believe that he is the one because of that. If a guy cannot handle the fact that you may be sick then fuck him, he is not the right one. Do not let all these guys make YOU feel bad about something out of your control. Do not let HD make you settle for being lonely or being with someone shitty just cause you have baggage. Everyone has baggage and you deserve all the happiness in the world regardless of if you are positive or not.

", "Making someone with HD symptoms feel more comfortable. Hi guys,\n\nMy partner is doing well I think shes starting to get out of the initial shock of finding out. We do know she is had some symptoms for at least couple years now (hoping just clumsy but that is how it is).\n\nNow to me she is as beautiful and perfect as the day I met her. However recently her speech, social skills and coordination have been progressively getting worse my new nearly blind neighbour picked up on her balance. And when talking to be she is unfamiliar with I sometimes have to help when she cannot say the word or picks a completely different one.\n\nI can see she is getting frustrated with stuff she cannot do, do you guys have any insight on perhaps ways I can act more supportive without making her feel frustrated as I know she is still perfectly capable doing day to day tasks.  When she is having trouble with the word finding, try to give her all the time she needs. I know it can seen awkward to wait and let her struggle, but often the interruption can be just as frustrating as the word finding difficulties. If she just cannot find the word, acknowledge how frustrating it must be for her. Jimmy Pollard's book Hurry up and Wait is a great read about being a HD supporter/caregiver. Anxiety is a huge component with HD and can also affect some of the symptoms you are describing. I suggest meeting with the doctor to discuss medication options to help alleviate some of the anxiety to see if it helps.  Thank you I will give it a look, its been a bit strange since she was quiet when met her but generally could talk ok, but has been progressively struggling more and more and sometimes she forgets to finish the sentence just starts. Its awful she gets so frustrated and I just want to help her. What you say makes complete sense.  We have got another meeting in a couple of weeks hopefully, I will bring it up then thank you :)  My lady went in and out of that. It lasted about half a year. Right on do not push it, wait. I made paths by my house smoother, have more to do. Clean up trip hazards. Use memory aid devices like calendar programs with reminders.

Regular therapy as well, suicide is very serious and medication is not always a good answer.\n", "Is this an appropriate place for this flyer? ", "Need help getting tested Hey guys. I am 20f and my father has Huntington\u2019s disease. My dad has never really been a part of my life because I was basically a \u201cteenage fling\u201d baby. So I have no idea how the testing process goes or how to even start. I would ask my mom but I know the whole idea upsets her so I am at a loss for what to do. I am not even fully sure I want to get tested. I was hoping someone on here could give me some idea on how the process goes so when I do want to get tested, I know what to expect. I am so sorry you have to deal with this on your own. Myself and others will try to help to the best of our ability. The link is a good website to start to familiarize yourself. But in regards to testing, it is just about doing a ton of research first. \n\nDo you have specific questions about testing or just getting started?\n\n My first suggestion would be to talk to your doctor if you have one that you go to regularly. They will be able give you a referral which is usually needed for specialist genetic testing. \n\nNot sure where you live, might be some differences in the testing process in different countries but I can tell you what my experience has been like in a major city in western Canada. \n\nI am 28f, and Huntington\u2019s is on my paternal side as well, although my Dad has not been tested and so far has no noticeable symptoms. Because we do not know his results, I have been told my prospective chances are 25% rather than 50% but the testing is all the same. Usually you will get a referral for genetic testing from your family/general doctor, and you are then contacted by the genetics clinic to start the process. \n\nI received my referral for my testing from the neurologist who conducts the Enroll HD study in my city(worldwide long term observational research study for people with and at risk for HD), which I have participated in annually for 7 years. \n\nWhen I was contacted by the genetics clinic they explained the process over the phone and then mailed me some family history paperwork to fill out and send back. They also asked for a signed consent form from the affected parent/family member* if possible* giving the genetics clinic permission to review their test results and confirm family history and CAG number. Since my Dad does not have results my Aunt gave her results. \n\nI do not know if this is standard procedure everywhere. After sending back my family history the way it went for me was: \n\n* 1st initial appointment with a genetic counsellor to go over in detail what Huntington\u2019s is, how the inheritance works, what the CAG # is all about, what you can expect from the process. \n\n* 2nd appointment with a psychiatrist, mine was very brief (about 30 minutes) over zoom due to the pandemic. \n\n* 3rd appointment was with a neurologist and the genetic counsellor together. \n\n* My blood draw was a separate appointment on the same day as the neurologist -  but as I understand you can do that part at any point. \n\n* Final appointment is the results, which I have not gotten yet - just had my blood drawn last Thursday. For my results appointment it will be with the genetic counsellor and the neurologist, they will receive the results in a sealed envelope and do not open it ahead of time. We open them together, my spouse will also be there. I have been told it can take 3 months or so until the results are available as they do the testing in batches throughout the year. \n\nThe entire way through the process the genetic counsellor has made sure I know that this is all completely up to me - if I change my mind at any point I am not obligated to know even if I have gone through these appointments. She told me I could literally call her the morning of my results appointment, or even in the room right before they open the envelope and say that I changed my mind if I suddenly do not feel ready. The results will just be kept there unopened for as long as I want or forever if I decide I do not want to know. \n\nIt took me this whole time (about 7 years) to finally decide I actually wanted to go through with it and even book the first appointment. I actually waited so long that I had to get a new referral. Officially started the process in August 2020 (was supposed to be earlier but Covid delayed things) and I am thinking I might have my results by August - September, if not before. To give you an idea of how long it can take. \n\nEven if you are not in Canada, this is from the Huntington\u2019s Society of Canada\u2019s website and has a lot of good information about predictive testing.   In addition, if you can...establish life insurance first..term, full...whatever you can get BEFORE you go in for testing. In general ( there may be exceptions, or laws in other countries for this situation) no life insurance company will touch you after a positive test result. Thank you so much for this. This helped me a lot. I feel better that you waited 7 years to get tested. I do not know If I am ready to know yet and knowing that you waited makes me feel like not knowing is okay. Thank you. I never even thought about that. I definitely will when I decide to get tested. Thank you. I feel so much support already here already. I am starting to realize I really do not know anything about HD other than the symptoms. I will definitely look into the resource you shared. This might be a dumb question but want is a CAG number? All genes are made up of different groups of the letters A, C, G, and T. Everyone has two copies of the Huntington gene. It is made up of repeats of CAG. The gene produces the Huntingtin protein. Too much protein causes HD. It is the expanded repetition of CAG which results in the overproduction of protein.So, a CAG repeat number of say 25 will not develop HD, but someone with 40+ will. When you receive the results you get two numbers which represent the CAG repeats on each of your copies of the Huntington gene.\n\nThere is also anecdotal evidence to suggest that a higher repeat number indicates an earlier age of onset. So sorry to hear about this...I  wanted to chime in and say, there is no rush, I told my 21 year old cousin the same thing. I am the oldest of 16 cousins and just barely got tested last year. Live life a little more, build a strong network of friends and family. Make choices in your life that you will be proud of later on: have hobbies that fuel you, a career that is meaningful and fits who you are, foster deep relationships with your loved ones, and create memories fitting of a well lived life. \n\nKnowing that it is been in my family for at least 15 years has made me take the time to appreciate life in all its forms. I feel like I have been awakened to appreciate the beauty and hardship in each day. Be happy, be sad. Feel those emotions, be mindful. \n\nBeing in the right headspace and heart-space will help when you are ready to take the test. \n\nAlso, it is not a bad idea to look into getting tested anonymously. For me, I am just never sure what is going to happen with the healthcare industry, I have a hard time trusting them. So, before you do get tested, line up Long Term Disability, Long Term Care and Life Insurance if you need it. You can always get rid of what you do not need. Happy to explain what each is. In short, Disability is for when you cannot work anymore (ex: the age you stop working until you are 65ish,), Long Term Care is for when you need assisted help in the home or at a home, Life Insurance is for after you are gone. \n\nI hope this helps a little...best of luck :) You are so welcome! If you have any other specific questions or want to talk more about it feel free to DM me any time.\n\nIt is definitely 100% okay to feel unsure about being ready. Deciding not knowing ever is also 100% okay. Everyone has a right to know, or not to know if that is what they have decided. That is the way my genetic counsellor told it to me when discussing whether I wished my Dad has been tested. Part of me wishes he had, so I could know if my chance was 50% or not, but ultimately it is up to him if he does not ever want to know his own status and that is okay. \n\nIt is a very big heavy thing to think about so young, especially if you do not feel like you are able to discuss it with your immediate family or friends. It can be very isolating to have to try and navigate how and when to get tested if you do not know where to get support or information. My best advise is to learn as much as you can about the testing and what it can mean, and find groups or spaces like this where you can connect with other people in similar situations. I am 30f. I was in your position for just about my whole life. I watched my mom deteriorate for 20 years until she died in 2015, and my dad and my brother were very emotionally closed off and almost tight lipped about the subject; it always seemed really taboo to bring it up so I never did. \n\nAs I got older I knew that testing was an option, but I did not feel like I wanted to know the answer, until I had a supportive husband who encouraged me to do it. You can ask your primary care doctor, or you can look for an \u201cHDSA Center of Excellence\u201d which are filled with great resources. It depends where you live tho; I am in CT/USA. I can tell you where I got tested and more details if you want to message me. Unfortunately I learned a few weeks ago that I am positive for the gene mutation and it is been a bit of an emotional roller coaster for me. But eventually you need to know. I have depression and anxiety and poor sleep, so I was always left wondering, \u201ccould these be HD symptoms?\u201d And now I know. This is true This is true \u261d\ufe0fI have 45 CAG repeats and I am positive. Fingers crossed for your results \ud83e\udd1e Thank you. I did not even think about this.. I will definitely do that. Thank you for this. A lot of my family members have tried to push me into getting tested but this made me feel a lot better. May I ask what made you finally decide to take up the test ? What changed in the 7 years? Just to help my friend who is in the same dilemma Part of my decisions to finally go through with it has to do with my current relationship. We have been together 6 years, and have started talking more seriously about future plans - moving to a different province, buying a house, getting married. I felt like before we made all these plans or moved away we should know my results. We do not want children, so that did not factor into it. But all the same I feel that my potential for HD should be factored into our long term plans. These just were not things I was thinking about at 22 when I first got my referral for testing. I was single and young and it felt too big, too far away at that time. But it feels more real now and I feel more ready to know. Thanks a lot. My friend is going through something similar. Thanks for sharing your experience, I hope it helps my friend too When my dad needed to be tested, we asked his PCP for a referral. He sent us to a Movements Disorder specialist, who did the blood draw.", "New drug for Huntington\u2019s disease to be tested in Vancouver.

I always knew it was in the family but could never get tested (money, referrals, some refuse cause of your age/mental health) but now it is hitting me as a real possibility. It is hard to talk to most people about this as they do not know much about the disease and they really do not know what to say. I am newly married and now I am struggling with the idea of bringing kids into the world or having to leave them so early in life if I do have it. I also want to start planning for my husband and future medical bills. However, I do not want to live my life in fear of what could happen and my brother and sister have chosen the \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d route.\n\nAny advice on all of this? Love to hear from anyone who is willing to share. Thanks in advance. From your post it seems like you are leaning towards getting tested. If so, make an appointment at an HDSA Center of Excellence for a consultation. You are not obligated to follow through with testing and you must have a consultation first anyway prior to getting tested. \n\n I was surprised to read here  that a small amount of (UK) people wants to find out. I certainly could not live with not knowing and found out quite young. Are these  recent study results any comfort to you? As  far as nursing home care insurance my son had it quoted at $400 / mo. He thought about getting it, then getting tested. But did not. Really there is no way he would continue to pay that for 40 years. He will be prudent with money and retire early. \n\nIf you are a mutant, there is a plus side. About  15 years before age of onset you get  a boost in neurotransmitter activity. I am collecting stories, so far about 20% were doing really good at that stage. My wife and her sister were managers about that time. So plan to get a nobel prize about then.  Hey, you should look up the Huntington's disease youth organization, it is a support group for people like us from around the world. I recommend  joining. I am the same boat as you with regards to testing. All I can say is it is a really personal decision, some people are okay with knowing and some people are not. I really recommend you join the group and get a variety of opinions from people who have been tested and what their life is like afterwards :)  Hey very sorry about your mom. I would get tested before having kids for sure, that is only fair that your husband. As far as planning for the eventuality of being sick, I would try to get long term care insurance before the test, just in case.  This is a great suggestion. The volunteers and paid workers in this organisation are extremely committed. Even though it says 'Youth' in their title, they can help with people up to 30yo or point you in the right direction, and are global.  It is a hard decision to make. I definitely did the \"ignorance is bliss\" thing for many years until I started having these annoying symptoms happening that made me feel like a zombie or like my brain was all clouded. Could not remember things, could not concentrate, which was unlike me. There was a point I reached when getting tested seemed like a bigger sigh of relief than living with these symptoms because it is scary to be doing things like driving, and there is a subconscious part of you there, but you cannot even remember driving or how you got there.\n\nI think the children aspect is different for everyone. I had a cousin who got tested specifically because she wanted kids but not if she was positive. But for me, I have always wanted kids. I wanted to be a wife and a mother for as long as I can remember. Why should I give up my hopes and dreams over a disease? Yeah, it sucks BIG TIME, but I cannot even imagine my life without my daughter. It might take some time to make this decision, but it would not hurt to talk to a therapist about it. You might just have an epiphany that will lead you the way to your future.", "Any advice would be helpful Sorry for the long post, I had some stuff to get off my chest.\n\nI am 23f, have not been tested but my mom has it and is slowly (but surely) deteriorating due to it, one of her sisters has it and her dad and one of her brothers both died from it. I graduated from college a couple years ago but have not been able to find work in my area in the field I want to work in. I have been living at home and working for my dad while I \u201ctry to figure things out.\u201d I see how Huntington\u2019s has affected my mom and I see how everything she does is changing because of this disease and I am terrified. I can barely be in the same room as her when she eats dinner because she has started choking on her food a lot and I just cannot deal with it. I am stuck in a rut because I am scared to get tested and find out I have it but I am finding it extremely difficult to get motivated enough to try to do something with my life because what if I do have it? I feel like then anything I do in life to try and succeed will be for nothing because I am just going to die a slow painful death anyway and there is nothing I can do about it. I do not know what to do and I do not have anyone to talk to. I have tried talking to my dad but he just does not seem to understand where my head is at. My parents were in a very different situation to me when they found out about my mom. They were in their 30\u2019s, already had two kids and a successful business. They had their lives planned out already by the time they had to deal with a life-altering disease. I do not have any friends (I am very introverted and the only friends I have ever made were because of school and when I left school I lost those friends) and I do not feel comfortable talking to any other family about it. Maybe someone here can help me figure something, anything, out? Any and all advice is appreciated. Hey I understand your fears I also tested positive, my dad was in late stages and I had two children, you must go to your doctor and explain how you are feeling. It is taken me 5 years to be okay with my journey, stress and worry are what feeds the HD so its important that you find peace. If you do have it, there are currently some amazing trials for treatment in the works, 5 years has made a massive difference in the possibilities of a cure for Huntingtons disease in the medical world. I understand your fears with your mum choking, it is important that you are there when you can be for your mum try to remember and speak about all the happy/funny times you shared and let her know that you love her \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f Hi! Please hang in there! \n\nI would recommend finding an HD Center of Excellence near you. You can visit hdsa.org to find centers located across North America. Because you are not showing symptoms, it is recommended that you undergo what is called Predictive Testing rather than genetic testing at your doctor's office. This way, everything is anonymous, and you will have some counseling visits so you can make sure all your questions are answered before getting your results. They will also discuss in more detail why getting tested anonymously is favorable for people who do not have symptoms.\n\nIf you contact the HD Center of Excellence, they can most likely connect you with resources such as support groups which can be extremely helpful for caregivers. You do not need to know your results to go. It is just a safe space to talk with others in your shoes. The center will also have a social worker who can provide you with other helpful resources! \n\nFinally, you can participate in research anonymously at the HD Center of Excellence through a study called ENROLL-HD. This is a study that is open to people who do not know their results, as well as people who have symptoms and/or have been diagnosed. It is an extremely important study that helps doctors and scientists around the world learn more about HD in hopes of finding future treatments and hopefully, a cure. \n\nIf you contact a Center of Excellence or look on hdsa.org you can learn more about the really amazing research that is going on right now! There are incredibly passionate and intelligent scientists, physicians, and healthcare providers who truly care about ending this horrible disease! \n\nFeel free to private message me if you have any sensitive questions or need any help finding a center! Did you ever asked your mom if she actually wants to eat with you? Or do you know how she feels about eating in front of family members compared to strangers? Why can you be just barley in the room when she eats? Are you disgusted, afraid of her choking or does it make you think about your (hopefully not) possible future?  My dad stopped to eat in front of anybody because he was ashamed, I used to sit next door so i could hear if he needed help.               \n\nYour life is not over even when you get positive. You can and will make a difference for 1 person or for many if you do not give up! It is hard but you can do it. What are your goal in life? Do not let HD change them. You sound like you are dealing with a lot right now. I am so sorry to hear it. This does not help your internal situation, but can your mom see an SLP to see if anything can be done for the choking? Pureed food, or head positioning? That sounds like some serious dysphagia, which may be inevitable, but getting food in the lungs is not good. There may be small things that could help her a lot.", "How do I support my friend? My best friend (F33) was just diagnosed.  This comes as a huge shock because neither of her parents or any family members that she is aware of have it.  I told her for sure to get another test  just because only 2ish% of people that have it have parents that do not show symptoms.  It just seems insane.\n\nBut how do I support her? How do I tell her things will be OK when they obviously will not? How do I grieve with her but also let her know she is supported? Is it worth it to say that I will be here with her through it even though we know I am not the one that will deal with any of the actual heartache? How do I provide comfort or anything??? Just be there for here any way she needs. Considering her parents do not seem to have the gene this may end up being a conversation about infidelity, it would not be the first time I have seen these situations. Do not try to tell her things will be ok, because they will not. \n\nIf she develops a morbid sense of humor, do not try and tell her that is inappropriate. It is can be a helpful coping mechanism, to lessen the blow so to speak. To remember that everyone dies.\n\nEta, I am HD+ That is what I was thinking...I did not want to say it will be OK, because this is not a disease that has different chances or anything.", "Ketamine therapy or psilocybin? Has anyone who tested positive sought out treatments like this? Interested to hear if anyone has or is open to it.", "Baby Making Time My wife has a 50/50 chance of having HD, and we would prefer not to get tested. For us, it is one of those things we do not think about unless we have a reason to. And for the past year, we have thought about it A LOT.\n\nWe are family planning, and we have been thinking about the best approach for us. Early on, we have decided our #1 goal was to ensure we would not potentially pass on this disease.. but we did not want to get tested. So that really leaves IVF PGD, which is DAMN expensive. It was a long shot (considering her parent is not officially disabused), but we applied for coverage through BCBS in MA, and just found out we are covered for IVF PGD non-disclosure. It is baby making time (still need to pay for PGD aspect)!!! \n\nThanks for all of the support to everyone posting here! You all rock!!! I am sorry, I cannot even... Congratulations!!! The title made me chuckle.\n\nBut congratulations! I am so happy for you guys and I wish you guys the best! Congratulations! I know IVF can be a long process, but I hope everything goes smoothly! my sister did it and i am ready to see my new niece! good luck!", "When do you realistically think that there will be effective treatment available for people with Huntington\u2019s Disease? When do you realistically think we will have effective treatment for Huntington\u2019s, or when will we find out whether the clinical trials are successful? \n\nIf anyone knows, I would also like to find out what problems people might face even if there is a cure? For example, let us say they find out after clinical trials that Ionis httrx treatment is a success, how long would it take for it to be  available to people with HD? Would it be straight away? Would everyone who is at risk rush to get tested so that they can cure themselves of HD if they have it? \n\nObviously it would be awesome news if they have effective treatment, but if it does not cure the disease, and just slows down or halts the progression, then it would be detrimental that this drug is available as soon as possible to help the people that are already symptomatic.\n\nPs I do not actually have HD, I just know someone that does.\n\nThanks! Short answer: Never.\n\nLong answer: the \"cure\" is basically already here in the form of genetic testing and genetic counseling concerning family planning (read: preventing anyone with HD from breeding).\n\nIf those two things occur among all suspected people affected by HD, HD will die out and be \"cured\" for the population (except for a very small number of random mutations occurring). \n\nThat as well as the fact that HD is basically a self correcting problem along with a very small population affected does not make HD a priority for research.\n\nI mean honestly, compare the number of cases and deaths from cancer or HIV to HD along with the funding for those two illnesses and you will begin to see a clearer picture.\n\nAdditionally from your tone in this post as well as the nature of your writing I think you are trying to bargain or rationalize your \"friends\" inevitable death. You have got to move on from that and just accept it. Whatever you need to do to accept it, you have got to do it. It is true that education of patients, and  technology like preimplantation genetic diagnosis will be one of the best ways to reduce further cases of HD. It is probably unrealistic to expect uptake of this to be 100% though, and you are right that some cases of HD are caused by new expansions, so it will never disappear completely. \n\nHD might not get as much research funding as cancer or HIV, but there are some promising clinical trials ongoing. I am not saying any of these will be an immediate cure-all but there is definitely been progress.  I do not think it is out of the question that there will be a gene-therapy-based cure someday, and possibly somewhat effective treatments earlier than that. Some types of therapeutics currently being researched are not specific to HD, but are meant to improve brain function in neurodegenerative diseases in general - this means they will potentially have more funding behind them. \n\nThat is not to say that any of this will be soon enough to help OP\u2019s friend, but it is not to say it will not either. The Ionis/Roche phase 3 trial looks like it is meant to end in 2022. Add a couple of years to that for drug approval if the trial is successful, and that is still within the lifespan of many currently-symptomatic HD patients. Will it be a perfect cure? Probably not, especially for already-symptomatic patients. But any extension of life and improvement of life quality will be valuable, and there are several more therapeutics coming up through the research pipeline behind HTTrx. Personally, I feel very mixed about the current publicity around scientific advancements in treating this horrific disease. On the one hand it is great to think that one day in the years to come the effects of the disease could be nullified however on the other hand the 'promise' is giving false hope to those suffering today.  \n\nThe sad reality is that anyone who is displaying symptoms right now will die of the disease and there is very little than can be done to slow down it is progression. Before my sister passed from HD last year I got so excited every time I read a new and promising article but I knew deep down that her mortality had already been realised.\n\nSorry that this sounds so negative I am still coming to terms with it. Feel free to give up, but how dare you trying to bring others down with you?\n\nChances for a cure might still take 10 years, but it might very well happen rather soon, that they find a way to bring hd to stop progressing. We will not have a cure, but we WILL have an effective treatment, no different than an HIV or diabetes treatment. You will have a long term treatment/maintenance regimen that will provide a relatively normal lifespan to those with HD. This treatment is within reach and I will see it in my life time.\n\n It Looks like the one that needs to come to terms is you. The negative tone in your response indicates to me that you are still dealing with inner turmoil due to HD. Feel free to give up, no one will blame you. But do not try to take away the hope that people have for a treatment, especially when that hope is warranted. Comparing HIV and cancer to HD is stupid. We are much closer to an HD \u201ccure\u201d than a cancer \u201ccure\u201d since cancer is a collection of diseases (and there are effective treatments for cancer) HD treatments are currently in clinical trials and hope is flourishing within the community because of the promise that these trials are showing. I do not really wish to argue with you over this, so I will not. Please, just do not answer for the sake answering without taking into account current strides that are being made in the effort for a treatment. \n\nAnd no, thankfully I am no longer immediately affected by HD. But this does not mean that I do not want a treatment for those that are. Yeh I know what you mean. I have only been following news about new potential treatments very recently, and every so often you come across an article with a very optimistic title about treatment, only to discover that it is a ten year old article and not much has changed. I still have hope though, and believe it is not a case of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when.\u2019 \"giving up\" you make it sound like there was a fight to begin with You are saying it is not? Ok. You have said all you needed to say. I am done with this conversation. Good luck HD is a mendelian monogenic neurodegenerative disease. That alone is enough for researchers in the fields of neurodegenerative disease AND researchers in the field of genetic therapy to study it, ya dingus. It has carryover affects for lots of other diseases. It is a disease with a straightforward cause, unlike many other neurological or genetic diseases. \n\nYou sound like a eugenic nazi or something with your \u201cpreventing anyone with HD from breeding\u201d comment. \n\nThe random mutations will still occur as well as all the people who by some reason or another straight up do not know they have HD in their family due to adoption or their parent dying from another cause before HD could manifest. \n\nIf HD were a \u201cself correcting problem\u201d then do not ya think it would have corrected itself already? People live asymptomatically for far beyond the years it takes to make babies and by then they have already passed it on to the next generation. Sometimes their kids have already had kids before they know they have it themselves. What Is self correcting about that? \n\nI am sorry about whoever shit in your wheaties but there are people researching a cure for HD right now and those people are working on it 24/7. The science is only just now getting good enough to truly be promising for HD. And there are 8 companies right now who have their drug in development or clinical study for HD alone. \n\nComparing the funding to Cancer or HIV just invalidates your own point. People with those disease live far longer lifespans than they ever have in the past  HIV is on the verge of a true cure. Our movements disorder doctor told us that HD is within 10 years of a cure. He said that of all the movement disorders, HD is the closest to a breakthrough. \nWith his very dry personality, I do not think he was blowing smoke. He may not be correct, but it is a nice thought. \nMy brother and sister were diagnosed last year and our father is in the late stages now. We know it is far too late for our dad, but with my siblings, they have a chance. Neither are symptomatic and the only thing I can hold onto is hope. Science is on our side. Yes I am, along with all the entire history of HD and everyone that has ever died of HD. Every single tragedy, every single death involving HD is screaming this same lesson at everyone constantly.\n\nI am telling you the truth here and deny it. What arrogance. Do not even bother with this guy/girl. He has his own lessons to learn and own path to follow. He is not open to discussion. This is exactly what I thought as well. I bet this person is a blast at parties. Hope is so important. It is all we have right now. Our genetic counselor told us something similar. I think about 5 years for the Crisper type drugs to come on the market, perhaps less. The action is solid and the tests are running good. A shot in the spine once a month and no new degradation. Since it is an untreatable disease FDA gives it a fast track. My lady is 50 and 37 CAG experiencing early onset dementia, It will likely come in time so that she has only minor chorea.  I think in 3 years there might be a way to slow it down, and in 8 to 10 years there will be a cure, but I wonder if neuralink will change this, I hope it does and speeds up the process so a cure can be found sooner. Huntington's will keep on coming on. One in seventeen people are in the grey zone for expanding CAGs that present symptoms of Huntington's. Even if we try to breed it out eventually down the line it will come back again. Following the same line of thought, every single disease we have managed to cure/treat so far, from tubercolosis to smallpox, was in vain because they had already claimed so many lives.\n\nThe human genome is our source code. Everything we are, everything we think, we do, we are capable of is inherently determined by that code (learning is an extension of these capabilities). Our looks, our predisposition to certain behaviors, the average intellectual level of individual population groups, it all depends on how exactly your individual copy of that code looks like, with significant variations among different groups. Evolution had millions of years to get rid of at least as many defects in the form of survival of the fittest, there is virtually no reason for us not to help with the some worst ones that it failed to eliminate throughout all this time. Especially not in an age where medical imaging is advancing rapidly.\n\nArrogance is believing the whole world must dwell in the same pit of apathy you do. &gt;tubercolosis to smallpox\n\nThose are viruses, HD is a genetic disorder. You are literally comparing two incomparable things.\n\n&gt;pit of apathy\n\nYou misunderstand my comments and views on the subject.\n\nApathy is doing nothing, I am not doing nothing I have just come to accept the inevitable.\n\nI did make a decision, which is the complete opposite of apathy. Being apathetic and deciding to be apathetic is virtually the same.   \n\n\n&gt; Those are viruses, HD is a genetic disorder. You are literally comparing two incomparable things.   \n\n\nHow is that a problem though? We have stopped genetic diseases before, and we are on the verge of genetic editing becoming available as a treatment. Not to speak of all the diseases with a genetic origin that we have managed to halt with conventional treatment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are claiming there is no point in trying when we are right at the gates of of a whole new are of medical science with infinite potential. That is either genuine apathy, or subversion. Pick yours. Something is/will/can happen - can I do something about it - no - take no action/accept it.\n\nThat is a rough overview of my thought process. It is not apathy to not struggle against the inevitable. \n\nIf a \"cure\" shows up then yes that is good, but I am not holding my breath.", "41 repeats Hello- recently (10/23/18) received my genetic testing results. I (26F) tested with 41 CAG repeats. I have known for roughly 12 years that HD runs in my family on my mother\u2019s side. My grandma had it and died when she was in her mid to late 50s by choking (common in HD patients). Her mother was suspected to have it and died by suicide (also common in HD patients). I know my mom (49) has it, and seems to be showing more mood related symptoms than physical symptoms. I do not know any of their repeat counts. Due to their deaths and a strained relationship with my own mother, I will likely never know their repeats counts. \nMu mom, who is rather unhealthy in other ways, is not exhibiting a lot of physical symptoms as of right now. With 41 repeats, it makes me wonder how long I will be able to enjoy my body before I start to lose control of it. I am also worried about my personality changing without my control. how long do you all think it will be before I start to show the physical symptoms? I think I am pretty healthy. I am decently active due to my job which has me walking and standing for most of the day. My neurologist said that I am currently asymptomatic. I am just trying to find ways to cope with this very new and very real part of my life and I think knowing a ball park figure of \u201cyou will likely start to has symptoms around this time\u201d would be helpful. \n\nSorry if this is poorly worded. I am kind of in a weird mental space at the moment.  At my HD center they told me that the CAG count can have some influence on your manifestation timeline but it mostly comes down to a healthy lifestyle (eating healthy and exercising), trying to avoid being stressed (using CBT or mindfulness was recommended by my psychiatrist) \n\nMy Aunt has a CAG of 41. She is just about 50 and has minimal movement symptoms, some balance issues. She has been on antidepressants for a while, and has some memory issues. She can still drive and do most daily tasks though. If you did not know she had HD she would appear normal. \n\nI just had my blood drawn on the 15th of October, so I know your anxieties you must be feeling. \n\nTry getting into some studies, even the ones that are not drug treatments. The studies help to better understand HD, thus make treatments better. \n\nI am going to sign up to all the studies I can once I get my result if I am positive, might as well make the best out of a shitty situation right?  Hey there- Im really sorry you are going through this. HD sucks.\n\nWhile I am sure everyone on here will confirm that everyone is experience is different, I can tell you that my Mom\u2019s CAG repeat is 41 and she did not start showing noticeable symptoms until she was in her late 50s. She is 68 now and still pretty independent with the help of mood stabilizers and austedo to help with the chorea.\n\nDo not lose hope!! You are very young and there are a lot of awesome medical advances just in the horizon. Hugs. Thank you for responding. I am still processing everything. The first few days felt kind of like a dream. It is been about a week now and it is really setting in. It is relieving to know that someone with my same repeat number is doing well at almost twice my age! People keep telling me to participate in studies.  I think that is a great idea, but I am not exactly ready to get involved with that yet. I have a follow up appointment with my genetic counselor and neurologist in December. I think I will have had the time to digest everything more by that time and after I am able to ask my questions to them with a more clear and level head I will likely be able to ask about studies as part of the \u201cwhat is next\u201d portion. \n\nI truly hope you get happy results!! Good luck with your appointment!  thank you so much for your response! Your comment really helped me feel a bit better. Wow! 68! I hope I am so lucky to be in her shape by that age. I have not totally lost hope, my world is just a little rocked right now. The initial shock is wearing off and now I am facing the \u201cone day I will not be able to do this\u201d and \u201cwhen will I start getting bad\u201d part of this thing. I am so thankful that there are people around me that support me and care about me. It is just extra difficult because they want me to be so positive and want me to have this great outlook because I am \u201cso young\u201d but like....I just want to be a little negative about it right now. I want to be kind of sad and a little mad. I know I \u201chave my whole life ahead of me\u201d but dang man let me be pissed haha I know they mean well but I just want to be sad for a little bit. \n\nSorry for the rant. You are great, you made me feel a little better. I am so glad your mom is doing well. \u2665\ufe0f Yeah it is for sure scary. I do not know what my Mom's repeats are but she is 58 and bedridden and mostly unable to speak. She also has to eat through a tube. It takes a lot out of me to visit her because I know she never wanted to get to be the way she is now. \n\nI was really scared before my blood draw and consultation that I was going to start getting sick soon. But they really put getting sick in a way that is less scary. Symptoms can be manageable if you work with your family and HD team and keep a positive mind. Do not let the illness take you, you take control of it and stay one step ahead. \n\nAre you feeling depressed? Are you on antidepressants or doing anything to keep your mind/spirit healthy?  Be sure to exercise, eat well, refrain from smoking and try to live as healthy as possible. It delays the symptoms of HD. Be strong and positive! You can do this! Hi, I just started posting in this sub a few days ago... I get you. I do!\nMy SO is in a similiar boat, got 42 repeats, is only 28.\n\nThe thing is, people are talking about your age to make themselves feel better. Do not get me wrong, I am hoping for any kind of treatment in the next few years, because I have no idea how to deal with the thought of having the love of my life leaving this world way too early. First her character and years later her body will follow... if she does not decide to suicide, that is.\n\nJust life your life man. Do not put anything on hold, do what you always wanted to do. I know I will make sure my SO sees as much of the world as possible. I lost my mother to HD (choking) just 18 months ago and I am sorry that you are going through this. I had myself tested before my wife and I had kids and although I cannot remember my repeat number, the neurologist said I was not in the HD range but a \"high normal\" so I suppose I could become symptomatic in my very old age.  My mother's number was in the 60's I believe and she became noticeably symptomatic in her early 50's but was not treated until her early 60's after her diagnosis. You have time on your side. I wish you all the best.  You are absolutely right. It is so great your SO has someone like you to care for her. I have got great people by my side as well. I just hate that I am emotionally exhausting them.  I am not feeling one thing or another for a very long period of time. I will start feeling sad, then mad, then normal. Then I just randomly start to cry. So it is hard to say. I go back to work today so hopefully that will help a bit.  I am so sorry to hear about your mother. That is very devastating. I suppose maybe it is somewhat easier when you know what to expect from the disease. But then again maybe not. \n\nThank you for the well wishes  Keeping busy is good! But try not to over do it. \n\nI will look up the self help work books my psychiatrist at the HD clinic recommended for you. If that is something you are into. \n\nThe doctors/psychiatrists told me it can take up to a year to come back to \"normal\", which totally makes sense. \n\nDo you have any support with friends and family?  I am sorry to hear about your news.  I just turned 29 and learned on 10/18/18 that my CAG repeat number is 43.  Huntington\u2019s is a huge surprise to me and my family.  My dad had rapid onset of symptoms in the spring (although in retrospect maybe some mild mood symptoms earlier on) and passed away in July but he was 70!  His repeat number was 40.  My genetics counselor and neurologist gave me some hopeful news about research and so that is what I am trying to hang onto right now.  Time and health on our side at the moment.  I know what you mean about the news feeling like a dream... Damn, sounds like we are roughly in the same boat. Do you mind if I message you?  Oh, wow. You are so kind. That would be great. \nI do, my people are really wonderful and have been so helpful. I am very lucky to have them  Not all all!", "Found on another sub. Just some words that someone here might find helpful. No need to get into a \"my disease is worse\" competition. ", "How is everyone feeling? Hey beautiful people, hope everyone us well today!  Right back at ya! Feeling good here! Not so good. Sorry to dampen the mood. Visited my dad today. He is really declining. He reminds me of his mother in so many ways. he will continue to decline, which indicates my own decline. And to the growing fear that my child will follow suit. Fuck this disease. It sucks and it is so horrible. I feel you. I have kids too. Currently untested and symptom free however. Lets hope for the best with treatments beinv available soon. We all have hard days and we stand together for you.  Fucking like shit. My mom died and the was not the worst thing to happen in the last 24 hours. What else is going on?  Had a rough week so far. My wife (mid stage HD) had an episode Monday night where she attacked me physically for trying to throw away a toilet paper roll which had fallen into the toilet. She took it out and left it on the counter to dry (eww!) It spiraled into one of the worst, most violent episodes we have had to date. I lost my temper and said the most terrible things to her. I am really ashamed of that. \n\n But yesterday and today she has been super sweet. I truly hate this disease, but I am trying to not let it define us.  That is good you are trying to be understanding. Just try to remember the sweet moments.  Thanks, yeah I am really trying.  It can be scary. Being at risk for HD I always worry when I lose my temper on my toddler that I am getting sick. Then i remind myself that toddlers are testing for any person, and usually I am pretty cool headed. Although today has been awful and he had been so bad (I am sick with a cold and ear ache plus I have my period). And he keeps hitting me with his toys and trying to escape out of our sliding glass door. Plus he has been peeing his pants on purpose. Feeling at my wits end.  Yeah toddlers are so exhausting lol. I was watching my 2.5 y.o. nephew a while back and he pissed me off on purpose multiple times. \n\nThe fact that you can even take care of a toddler at all is a pretty good sign.  I also work with them so getting sick would be hard; not being able to work with children anymore. I have a classroom of 16month-2yr olds. And my toddler is 2.5. I feel like 2.5-3.5 are the hardest ages so far... Perhaps 8 may also come in second to that. My oldest could really get under my skin at that age =p. \n\nI hope it is a good sign, my family has always said they think I am negative. Not that you can go off gut feelings. But it would be nice it it is true.  Not good at all. I have way to many horrible things happening at once. Wish I could catch a break  Want To vent? My husband, daughter, and I have had an awful year. I got genetic testing done in January for Huntington's disease.A week before my February results, I found out I was pregnant. To be honest, I was terrified. We could barely afford taking care of my 3 year old, let alone a newborn. The next week I found out I tested positive for Huntington's. \n\nI have known for a long time I wanted to start a family young (I was almost 25 when I had my daughter) just in case I did test positive. My dad tested positive when I was only 6 years old since my parents had me late in life. I only ever knew him as a sick dad and he passed away when I was only 15. Now that I knew I had Huntington's, I was able to become more comfortable with my pregnancy, knowing that I was still young enough to enjoy my kids lives before my health begins to deteriorate. I want my daughter to make memories with me before I start showing symptoms. It was so hard being an only child in my situation and I got on board with my pregnancy a lot faster feeling relieved my daughter would have someone she could talk to and relate to when things got rough. Then in March I discovered I had miscarried. My doctor thought I was only 5 weeks along, but when I started bleeding a lot, she sent me to the hospital where they confirmed the miscarriage. I was actually 11 weeks, almost out of the woods for the first trimester. But the baby must have stopped developing a long time ago.\n\nThen in mid-April, my mom passed away unexpectedly at only 63 years old. She was my very best friend and I took the news super hard. I had just seen her the day she died. My daughter and I stayed with her for a few days because our heat went out. I can take solace in knowing my last few memories with my mom were happy ones. My mom adored my daughter, and my daughter adored her. My mom was just smitten with her. They had such a wonderful rapport together and I think what hurts the most is knowing she only had barely 2 years with my mom. Do not get me wrong, my mom did A LOT for our family, but I had her for 27 years and it was not enough, let alone 2. I just hope and pray my daughter will remember her as she grows up. I try and keep her memory alive as best as I can.\n\nMy husband had to work this past Sunday. There was a disgruntled customer there who was trying to steal money, and my husband caught him. The guy took my husbands keys off the counter and stole our car. Our only car. It took my husband a half hour to notice. Luckily they caught it on camera to show the police, but they took 3 hours to get there, so that guy could be long gone by now. We are beyond devastated and are just about at our breaking point. We have had such an unbearable year so far, and it is only May. We spent the rest of our tax return money on that car, and we literally have nothing left to buy a new car. We are at the point again of barely scraping by each month. We cannot afford a car, we just cannot. And we need cars to go to work.\n\nHe actually started a GoFund me page, I think I might post it.. but we just are at the end of our rope, we have absolutely nothing  Oh dear yeah that is really hard. I have two children of my own. I am waiting to see a genetic counceler to start my testing. \n\nWill your insurance cover the cost of the car? Or perhaps even your husbands work insurance could look into it? \n\nAre your partners parents supportive and in the picture? ", "\"Roll Call\" Hey I thought it would be nice to get to know one another and share a bit more in a major thread. Aside from making it feel like an AA meeting let us all say 'Hi' and share some things about ourselves or our family. No pressure so share status/names etc. \n\n\nI am 27. My Mom is HD + so are my Grandma and two Aunts. I grew up knowing what HD was and ver immersed in my Grandma and Mother's illness. I had to be taken away from my Mom due to her mental degrade causing her to make unsafe decisions regarding the care of my brothers and I. She is now in a home unable to walk and eating through a g-tube. It hurts so much to see her like that. I want to get tested in the near future. I think a positive diagnosis would probably make me upset, but would not really change my life much at all. I have mostly tried to think that it is pretty likely I am positive so best to try and think that way (less disappointing). \n\nSo happy to have found people who understand.  Hi. I am Rahil. Reading your post was relieving as I am also in a very similar situation. I am 26. My mom also is HD+ as was her mother, my aunt and an uncle. My mother has always been diagnosed since I was born as Bi-Polar but my brother and I had suspicions that she showed major symptoms that she had HD. She has kept to herself for the past 10 years or so. Talking to herself and only able to answer very simple questions, if repeated enough. She shakes often and can never sit still. She is starting to lose balance when she walks around the house. She was officially tested and diagnosed a couple months ago. I have an older brother who is 27 and we both are planning to get tested in June. Although, I am unsure if I want to because there is nothing I can do about it right now.\n\nI know there is a lot of hope with HD, especially with CRISPR. If you do not know what that is, it is a microbe that enables gene modifications. Currently, scientists all over the world are using it and it is truly a gamechanger. I am confident a cure would arise in the coming years as technology gets better. They are already scheduling human trials for sickle cell disease. If proven to be successful.. it is a major step for those like us as sickle cell is caused by genetic mutation also. \n\nHD is also a single gene mutation which is viewed as the easier of the genetic mutation related diseases for CRISPR.  Yes I have read about CRISPR! And it has me SO excited.  I was not going to comment here but after seeing a theme with 26/27 year olds with mother+2 siblings+grandmother stories I decided to add another.\n\nI am 26. My mother is the youngest of 4, with her closest brother being 11 years older. When I was 6 my grandmother passed away due to complications from HD. At 14 my mother's oldest brother passed, and at 19 the second brother of three passed. \n\nShe is just starting to show symptoms now, and I have been down this ride enough times to know what is coming. I have three siblings, one who is 25, and the others are 36 and 37. Statistically one of the older pair has it as well, and will start showing a couple years after my mother dies.\n\nUltimately I share your sentiment about assuming your positive, but not getting tested. Best to plan for the worst, but allow yourself to hope for the best. My friends always question why I do not get tested, but I feel like this community can understand the reasoning behind that decision. Hi, I am Keli. I am a bit younger than those who have commented, I am 19. My mom has HD and my grandma had it. I did not really know what HD was until about 2 years ago when I found out my mom had it. I knew my grandma was sick but I was too young to understand exactly what it was, I would just go along to the visits in the nursing home. Currently my mom is having trouble walking, and it is getting very hard to understand her. She is had a choking incident and a fall that has bruised her ribs. Unfortunately she lives out of state and has for half of my life. It is a really tough situation, we do not want to put her in a home but my siblings and I cannot take care of her and neither can my aunt. However my mom is extremely stubborn and would absolutely hate the nursing home, but it is the point where she needs constant supervision. My sister just got tested and she tested negative! I get my results the second week of May. I am not too worried about it, I am hopeful for a cure in the future but ultimately if I have it it will not affect me for quite some time.  Hi, I am 29 and my dad has Huntington\u2019s. He was diagnosed in 2011 and he is currently 48. He has been having loads of trouble with talking, walking, and swallowing. \nI have two siblings and my sister and I have decided to not get tested right now, while my brother starts the process in May. We have all had the initial assessment and were told that we were not showing symptoms, but it could be too early.\nMy sister and I both already have two children each and we both wish we would have gotten tested before having children. That threat is terrifying. \nI will say, when I decide to get tested, if I am positive, I have decided to tell my dad I am negative. I refuse to allow him to die knowing that he passed this along. Hi, I am a 39 year old mother of 2 beautiful daughters. My dad is 68 and has been diagnosed with HD. My family has been \"lucky\"  (if you want to call it that) with a later onset of HD (CAG repeat of 40). My husband and I decided I should get presymptomatic testing before starting our family because we wanted to prevent passing it on to our future children.\nThis past year has been difficult because my dad has been starting to twitch and stumble, so the decline is starting. However, my family and I are feeling hopeful and pray daily for a cure in the near future. Hi, I am a 24yo female that is recently married with no kids. HD is on my mother\u2019s side with her father having it, one uncle, one aunt, and herself. She has been symptomatic for almost 7 years with things progressing very fast. I chose to get tested for the sake of future kids and my own curiosity. My husband has been very supportive - he knew this was a possibility before we got married. I am now struggling with what to do next. I have a very demanding retail management job that requires long odd hours and weekend/holiday time and now I am debating quitting to spend more time with my mom and to start a family. I am also just lost emotionally. I always knew I would probably get HD but now it is a reality and an early mortality is very hard to grasp at 24. I am very thankful for this subreddit because most people are not aware of HD and it is hard to talk to people about it, especially since my family does not know I have tested positive.\n\nIf anyone has any advice/book recommendations/feel good mantras - I would be more than happy to hear them.  Thanks for sharing your view on not being tested. My brother has not been tested and I always wondered why. He seems to have that \u201chope for the best\u201d attitude towards it and I seemed to be the opposite but I still respect his decision.  That is my mom's greatest fear and one that is made her cry countless times. Knowing she could have passed it on to us. Thing is that we are so close that I do not know how well we could hide it from her if we were to test positive. But that is a damn good idea and find you admirable for deciding that.  I am sorry to hear you have tested positive. The medical field has been making great discoveries though and I am confident they will continue to do so. You still have lots of time even though it may not feel like it! I recently finished a book called Inside the O\u2019Brien\u2019s, you should check it out. My sister and I really liked the book. CRISPR and IONIS-HTTRx are our most promising hope yet. Stay strong and keep praying. We are almost there Remain strong. Keep hope. Believe me when I say that. Technology is escalating to levels that no one thought were possible. Google and read up on CRISPR. It is new and growing fast. It is going to change our destiny. It is a few years away but we are fortunate enough that a lot of major countries have their best scientists on it. They, in theory, already found a cure. They just need to work out some kinks. \nLive your life with anticipation of a full life. At this rate, you will most certainly experience it.  Thanks for the kind words Hi I am 27 and male. My grandmother had Huntington's disease, and lived to be 87. She developed symptoms in her 50s, eventually losing her ability to speak and walk. I do not remember her exact number of CAG repeats, but it was in the mid 30s, somewhere in the \"gray zone\". Her sister lived to be 91, and only began showing symptoms in the last year of her life. My mom believes she is starting to notice HD symptoms in herself, but I have not noticed anything when I visit her. \n\nI go back and forth on getting tested. One thing my uncle who chose not to get tested said to me was, \"If finding out that you are going to develop HD would change the way you live your life, you should be living that way anyways\". Which definitely struck a chord with me. If I decide to have children at some point, I would probably like to have IVF with genetic screening performed, to prevent them from inheriting the disease. ", "Starting the testing process in case Has anyone ever tested positive before a parent here (parent does not want to get tested or talk about it ever)? My grandparent was not diagnosed until his mid 60s and my at-risk parent is approaching 60. I am in my 20s so I would like to get tested before having kids and for other financial reasons and what not. My risk is also not zero at the moment, as my parent has a 50% chance and so do I possibly. I also have some gut feeling that my parent has it. Starting the process soon. \n\n*I posted here before but removed it, I had some wrong info * I tested before my mom and was positive. It was a nightmare telling her, but she also was not super anti-knowing, just did not want to bother getting tested herself. My genetic counselor made us do a session together before they would release the results since they impacted her as well. Honestly unless you have a no-contact relationship it might be really hard to keep your results from your parent if that is what they want. It is pretty fucking traumatic! Best of luck to you. How old were you when you tested? I am so sorry for what your going through! Keep your head up and let us hope they find a cure soon! Hope you and your mom are doing well Yes.\nIt turned over a stone and revealed some wriggling worms.\n\n\nTurned out, the parent *had* tested and they did know, but practiced full-on denial outwardly.  Insisted they did not have it.  And that was, apparently, to make the kids in the family believe they could not get it.  I am afraid to say there was some naive hogwash like \"the Secret,\" that engendered this half-baked idea that if you just believed hard enough with your pure heart, then you would not get it.\n\n\nWhich... was a big sack of stupid nonsense. Obviously. \nAs you would expect, some resentment came out of it. Yeah, this actually is not an uncommon scenario here. I would consult with your genetic counselor as to how to proceed with your parent, depending on how close of a relationship you have and how you communicate. I would not inform my parent. I would have no problem keeping that from them I do not think. Especially if I go in assuming they have it. Thanks! I am two years out and doing great. Had a kid with ivf/pgd and have really shifted my perspective on what is important in life I was 29 &gt; Turned out, the parent had tested and they did know, but practiced full-on denial outwardly. Insisted they did not have it. And that was, apparently, to make the kids in the family believe they could not get it. I am afraid to say there was some naive hogwash like \"the Secret,\" that engendered this half-baked idea that if you just believed hard enough with your pure heart, then you would not get it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n:O Yeah, they may not even want to know and that is their choice. They could still have it even if you are negative so I would leave it alone like you are planning. So you were 29 when you tested positive before your mother had results? How old was she at the time you found out? Was she showing any symptoms or not anything major yet? I am very curious this is a similar situation I could be in. How did they hide it? Were they late onset? How old were you when you got tested? I am seeing through studies that about 14-33% of presymptomatic tests for people at 25% risk (due to untested parent), end up testing positive for the mutant. I wonder how many people in this thread are in a similar situation. Excuses, of course. \nClaimed everything off was this or that other condition or complaint. I do not live nearby, so I did not see a lot. And erratic behaviors were, to my memory, a part of this personality for years and years. \nI got tested around 33 I guess. I was 29, my mom was late 50s, my grandma did not get sick until her 70sish? She still has no noticeable symptoms thank god. My grandparent who died lived into their early 70s on independently until 64. So I am thinking my parent might be late onset. By no noticeable do you mean you have suspicions?", "Any websites where you can chat? my father (48) has advanced HD and my grandmother (70) along with me (18) has been caring for him. right now, it is really difficult- mood swings, speech issues, and the 1am calls that wake me up and have me frantic until he tells me it is just because he saw something that made him think of me and he would not remember in the morning. it is hard to be mad because i know he is doing it out of love, but it is such a frustrating time. anyone know of any resources i can use to speak to people, even just to rant? i have a sister, but she is younger and struggling to come to terms with it as it is. any help would be appreciated. thanks I am sorry you are going through this. There is a few HD support groups on Facebook.  I do not know of many others but I think that would be a great idea though. You are a remarkably strong person to be able to remind yourself what your father is going through in those moments of frustration. ( This is a FB group for young people to talk about HD. It has a lot of members so you are welcome to join. :) FB has support groups and I am in a very similar situation. If you ever want to rant without any judgement, please message me.", "my dad called today he is forgotten my name. did not realise this was a symptom of hd. has this happened to anyone else? My mum forgot my face once, but she was not expecting me. She calls and knows who I am now though, I think taking her medication on time has helped a lot. I saw a devestating poster at my school once that said HD is like alzheimers, ALS and Parkinson\u2019s all rolled into one. There is too many symptoms to count. I am sorry :(", "CAG repeats update So after nearly 2 months my partner has been informed of a definite diagnosis of Huntingtons with 59 repeats how high is that, looking online most. Do not go past 56? I believe the average is around 42. Repeats can go much more than that though. The range of repeats indicates whether a person will develop HD or not, so past 36 I think the repeats indicate how early they will develop the disease. Here is the major study/graph that people tend to reference:\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 59 repeats, this puts the average age of onset of neurologic symptoms in the mid-20s. However, some people with 59 repeats do not have any symptoms until late 30s.\n Sadly she has been having neurological symptoms already at 28. Im hoping it will slow down because I want our daughter to know her as she is now.  Sorry to hear. Not sure if there is much help to offer. This protocol below has been shown to work to slow neurological symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. No one has tested it in Huntington's yet, but it might be worthwhile reading the study and running it by your neurologist. Look at Table 1 to see the different components.\n\n I have seem some studies slowing it down but been informed it does not work for everyone.  If there are trial sites near you two in the UK and your wife is interested in participating in the ( it might be good to send the study coordinator and email to ask if they are recruiting.   \n\n\nI am so sorry to hear that her count is so high. CAG count is related to age of onset, but it is not the only factor. Please do not give up hope and keep on top of her health! We are so close to a treatment.   \n\n\nIf you ever need anything, please do not hesitate to reach out. And if you ever start a gofundme to raise money for a trip to Disney, please let us know. My sister and I would both like to help out in whatever way we can.  Unfortunately, 59 is extremely high. Onset in the 20s. 30-40 is generally considered the neutral zone....you may get it or you may not. If you do, it will most likely be late in life. Above 40 is where you will develop it. The more repeats, the earlier the onset. Yeah she has been having symptoms, defiantly being a rollercoaster this month. She is taking it better then I would.", "Feeding tubes? Hi everyone. My mom is hopefully a few good years off from me needing to make this decision but I was hoping to gather some information from this community and those who have been through it. When your loved one entered the later stages, did you decide on using a feeding tube? Why or why not? \n\nMy mom refuses to discuss anything about her future with these disease. When we do it sends her into a deep depression. Makes things harder for me but I am prepared to make these decisions for her if it allows her to live these years in denial. If that makes sense. I know my mom pretty well and I am confident about any other potential decisions I may have to make except this one. \n\nResearch I have done online tells me to consider when the benefits of feeding are no longer present. I honestly struggle to find a reason that it would be a benefit in the first place - the outcome is inevitable and there is no chance of improvement. But maybe I am misguided with that thinking\u2026\n\nThe reason I got thinking about this in the first place was I saw a tik tok account with a young guy who is mom was in LTC with a PEG tube. Completely bed ridden, non verbal, looking very rigid. It kind of shook me a bit even though I know what is coming. I love my mom more than anyone in this world and I want to make sure I am doing right by her regarding medical decisions\u2026.\n\nI appreciate your thoughts. Thank you \u2665\ufe0f For me (I am gene positive asymptomatic), feeding tubes are a hard no. My mom (symptomatic for over 10 years now and doing unusually well) is the same. For us both, the progression of the disease to that point that a feeding tube is needed marks a quality of life that we are not looking to extend through extraordinary means. Feeding *help* would be fine, but if I am so gone that I cannot even participate in swallowing a liquid diet? No thanks, just comfort care at that point please!\n\nI am sorry that your mom is unwilling to discuss with you, that is really putting a lot on you. Do you think she might be willing to talk to a professional (with you) to help? There are medical psychologists who specialize in helping individuals and families process hard stuff like this! The feeding tube would be required long before that point, as a choking prevention. Choking is big cause of later stage death. But it can be still early enough for the patient to be talking or present. But maybe not. Every case is different. \n\nMy dad got one. I do not remember exactly how late stage it was. He died in 2009. \n\nI am HD+. I do not know what I would want either. I think it is more about what my husband and kids want, at some point. I wont be really aware of what is going on, and they are going to have to live with the memories. Thank you so much for your insight I really really appreciate it. \n\nYes I agree - if she required it at a point where she was still able to kind of communicate and the quality of life was not completely awful I think that would make the decision much easier for me. But then Of course the onus may later be on me to choose to then withdraw it if she did not pass from something else first of course. Ugh this is all just so much for me. I hate thinking about it all but it is like one of the only things I can do\u2026 Thank you so much for your comment. I am glad that your mom is doing well. My mom is kind of the same too! I am cherishing these good years because there have been more than I expected when she originally got diagnosed. I am with you 100%. I am not tested yet but if I did have the gene I would want to basically perish ASAP once my quality of life started to decline and my loved ones began to be affected. I am very interested in MAiD for myself as well. But for my mom it is hard since she does not have these clear cut views that I have and this shit is so so awful to talk about. We have recently been referred to a specialist clinic in our province where there is a neurologist and neuropsychiatrist hopefully they will be able to start these conversations for us. So, to each their own, but I definitely would not give up as soon as quality of life starts declining. I mean, there is still a lot of life worth living with impairment! Social assistance, and good meds, and patience can extend things pretty well. But there is a floor for me, and feeding tubes is pretty much my bright line for being done. My mom was full stop DNR and no tubes there was no debate. My view is colored by my age at the time as I was 17 when she was first placed in assisted living and 21 when she passed from no longer being able to swallow. Over those 4 years declined rapidly and was very quickly difficult to recognize as the loving mother I once knew. I could not really handle it and by the time she passed it was horribly a relief. I regret not being there for her more leading up to that point, but her being kept alive past that I do not think would have helped her or me. She would have had no quality of life and she had seen that in her own mother who was kept alive on tubes, and I would have continued to live in guilt wishing I was strong enough to visit and spend time with her even as I could hardly recognize her or tell her about my day without wanting to cry. Sorry I kind of started rambling. My husband already told me that when it comes to that point in his journey with HD, he does not want a feeding tube.   We are years away from that point but it is going to be hard to honor his wishes. Hi. I am a healthcare worker who works with the HD population. I think there is alot of factors that play into this decision, however when I see an individual in the later stages, unable to communicate/swallow/eat and nearing the end, I educate the family (very gently) on feedings for life sustaining measures vs. quality of life; as in- what is the end goal were trying to achieve here and is this beneficial for the patient? I advocate very hard for patients needs and wants and typically when the patient is in these later stages, family may want tube feedings because it is very hard to let their loved one go- which is understandable. I think it is also important to know that individuals can aspirate on tube feedings, so although they are getting nutrition, they are still at risk. Please feel free to message me and ask any questions. I work in a facility with an entire floor dedicated to individual's with HD and I frequently work with them. All the best \u2764\ufe0f Exactly I think it is different for everyone. and honestly I am only 23 so it might change for me as I get older but like right now I am so depressed and hopeless I feel like I have nothing to live for and like it will not get any better so that probably has a lot to do with how I am feeling about interventions hahah Wow\u2026 fuck this awful disease. I am so sorry you had to go through that especially so young. I am 24 and I felt like that was young\u2026 I am just so pissed off about this stupid disease and what it does to you and the people around you. I know I do not want her to persist in that kind of state for any longer than she has to. She has not explicitly told me about her end of life wishes but she has told me she hates being a burden. Thank you for sharing, I am so sorry. I cannot imagine how hard it will be to be someone is spouse going through this. Enjoy these years. Fuck this disease. Thank you so much for what you do and for your comment. It makes me happy to hear there are people who provide compassionate care to late stage HD patients and their families. I work with the HD social worker in my province and she has been amazing. \n\nI think it helps to know thst I will not be alone making this decision and my moms healthcare team will be able to help support me. I just do not want to feel like I am making the wrong choice. I know I do not want to prolong her life if the quality of that life is so poor that she cannot communicate any longer. But I just worry about the gray areas or any other kinds of situations that might come up - like if she is still able to communicate somewhat but can no longer eat enough, then I would feel it would be the right thing but then the onus may be on me later to then remove that tube which I think would be hard on me because I would feel responsible for her life ending if that makes sense. My only advice is that happy memories and memories of quality time spent with them are literally priceless. Hold her hand, look her in the eye and tell her how much you love her. Make sure she knows just how much you love her. It will help her and in future years the memories of making sure she knew will mean the world to you as well. \n\nMy mother poured all the love she could muster into raising me. That love is a part of me and always will be. Every time I smile at someone I am sharing some of that love. I believe that her love through me and others will endlessly echo through time. Wow, well this just made me cry so much! You are so right. It is hard to balance school/career (I am in medical school) and spending time with her. If I was able to spend every min with her I would honestly but she fights me tooth and nail she wants me to graduate so badly! I have to do it for her I know it. Honestly at this point it is more for her than it is for me. \n\nI can just tell you are such a compassionate caring person and your mom is shining through you just like you said. \u2665\ufe0f My Mum was the same, she wanted no life saving measures whatsoever under any circumstances. She lost her ability to swallow much sooner than anyone expected, while she was still living quite independently at home, and lasted nearly a week after that with only comfort care provided at home. \n\nAs hard as that was, I think it would have been harder to see her linger in a bed for months or years hooked up to tubes. It is definitely shaped my opinions on end of life care for myself. Hello and welcome.  This is probably one of the best questions to ask and a hard one!  My feelings on this are feeding tubs were meant for those that needed the nourishment during times of illness that eventually they would recover from. But now so many are being used to prolong one\u2019s suffering especially when there is no getting better \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79 it is the body\u2019s way of preparing for the next journey in life. I am lucky my mom had it written no feeding tubs at all as she saw her own brother linger a cruel slow death. I too have that in place and I know when comes it will be hard no matter what. Bless you and your family You definitely will have TONS of support in this, healthcare professionals will give you the education you need and recommendations based on what stage she is in. I have to say, when I see an individual unable to even swallow, appearing trapped in their own body, you have to ask yourself, is this a good quality of life? You will learn so much as things change, it will become more clear with the decisions you should make for your mother's well being. Do not feel responsible for ending her life, feel good about making the most comfortable, best decision for your mom. Again, please feel free to reach out at any time :). Thank you for this response. I am sorry about your mom. My mom is the first one in our family to have this disease so I think it is hard too because she is never seen anyone decline from it.

How you allow that energy to manifest is a different subject altogether but there is no doubt that living at risk brings an intensity to life that some people will never find.  I am a 34 yoa male at risk and try to keep in mind that the flip side of the coin is that i havent taken a day for granted in quite some time. As a teenager the energy was expressed as anger and i hated the sensitivity and intensity that came with it. I see now as an adult that people who are really struggling in life are lacking a connection and become somewhat apathetic. So when the spirit is strong and seems to be overwhelming, appreciate that you are still able to feel because some people are just going through the motions every day with no driving force. Also know that if you are under 40, You are a pioneer of discovery as no person before you has had the ability to be the executor of their own philosophical conundrum. If i tested negative tomorrow, would i lose my edge and become complacent like so many others out wandering aimlessly? Who knows? But flip the script when you get the feeling that you got the shit end of the deal with this and realize that you have some serious purpose in life just living. \ud83d\ude18  Thank you for this. Though my life is turbulent and often full of mysteries, being at risk has driven me to push myself, learn new skills and hobbies, and to take those chances in life that could normally be shrugged off by others. I am glad it has given you the same surge of life.  Thank you! My boyfriends children are all adults now.  18, 20 and 26. The two older girls are getting tested soon.  They only want to have kids if they are negative. I hope they can find a way to see this positive outlook that you have. I might find an appropriate time to share this with them.  Respectfully, please consider not doing so in the context of procreating. This was a lovely post and can stand alone just fine with regards to  maintaining some positivity, but the decision to have kids is a huge one for anyone and is not really on the table for outside opinions. Add the Huntington's issue and it is doubly no one else's business. Respect them as adults and support whatever decisions they make for their lives. Definitely. Easier said than done but it can be done. If i had a dime everytime somene told me \u201cbut you dont know if you have it.\u201d They mean well but they have no insight to the repercussions of a positive test. So for me without having a family myself, living in the unknown has enabled me to be spin most situations to my advantage as no situation is ever 100% the right choice except maybe spitting in someones food being 100% wrong or opening a door for a crippled old lady 100% right. Almost all decisions are somewhat arbitrary and all the manipulative tactics being done on the public to get them to buy things or get them to vote a certain way can be done by one to one\u2019s self to help them to cope with the unfortunate reality they are dealing with. I failed a lot when u was younger as a result of living in the negative percintiles as well as the percentiles of life aspects that i had no control over.

These gymnastics can enable bad habits and negative thought loops if not careful though so make sure you are stretched out and at full strength before you go jumping on the beam.", "Can any doctor order the genetic test for Huntington's if they are willing? Or does it have to be a specialist. I am completely opposed to genetic counseling and I believe that it is dehumanizing and unfair. I have contacted many providers, and all of them have denied me the right to know my own condition until I dance like a monkey for them and show up to multiple genetic counseling appointments. As I am sure you are all aware, this is completely ridiculous. No one would deny you the right to know whether you have an incurable brain cancer. If I just keep going to GPS until one is willing to order the test, will they be able to? I see that there is a genetic test for Huntington's on labcorp.com that providers are able to order.", "How do I prepare myself for getting tested? When I was 20, my dad died of HD. I am 31 now. My partner and I are discussing marriage and children, so I guess it is probably time to get tested so I can take that into account. \n\nI am scared. \n\nI have a counselor, but she does not specialize in anything like this (her area is mostly adhd in children, actually). I feel like I should have a therapist lined up who specializes in terminal illness. But beyond that\u2026what do I do???\n\nI am scared\u2026 I do not know if there is any way to truly prepare for it. Growing up, I lived with my Grandad, who had Huntington's and watched him decline until his eventual death, but growing up with it, it sort of became a part of life for me -- Not really a part of life I wanted to go through, but I would mostly accepted that it was, at the very least, a possibility.\n\nMy Mum was diagnosed (on symptoms) nine years after my Granda died and it was then that I ultimately decided to get myself tested.\n\nThe process for me was very short, I live in Scotland.\n\nMy Mum was diagnosed in the September and they asked me then if I wanted to be tested and arranged my first appointment there and then, which was scheduled in for the October. At that appointment, I met with a genetic counsellor. We talked about Huntington's, what I knew about it, how I felt about it, etc.\n\nThey essentially try and prepare you for the worst and make sure (as much as they can) that you will handle that news, should it come.\n\nAs I said before, I would mostly accepted it as part of my life, to the point where I just assumed I had it. Working on the basis that if I had it, I had it. If I did not, then that would be great, welcomed news. In my family, it tends to hit around 50. I was around 30 at the time and, as I said to the counsellor, if I did have it, I would still have another 20 years (ish) of quality life, but I could also get hit by a bus tomorrow and die, while living with Huntington's is not something to look forward to, it is not something you can get too caught up with in the short-term. Life goes on.\n\nAt the end of my first appointment, I was given the choice of having my blood drawn for the test at the next appointment, which would be in November, the only issue with that being that if I did that, the results would come in December and due to the dates of my appointments, it would be the week of Christmas. So I could either have the best news/present for Christmas or the worst.\n\nI opted to go ahead. The November appointment, we talked some more and confirmed that I still wanted to go ahead with the bloods, etc.\n\nThen, in December, I went back for my results. They made a point of making sure I was bringing someone with me to that appointment, and two of my friends agreed to come.\n\nSitting in the waiting room, the counsellor (who would be giving me my results) walked past. We were early and she saw me and seemed flustered. Again, I assumed I had it and while I was nervous for that to be confirmed, I was at peace with it. She excused herself for a moment and then came back and got me to take me through to her room.\n\nIn the November appointment, we talked about how I would want the news delivered (good or bad), did I want her to just come out and tell me, or did I want to be eased into it. I would said I wanted to be eased into it, but on the day, I just wanted it over and done with.\n\nUltimately, the news for me was good news. I did not have it. It was kind of a shock, to be honest. Having prepared myself for so long to have it, but a welcome one. The counsellor was happy that she was getting to deliver happy news. I think my first actual words were 'Do we hug?', to which she responded that she would be more than happy to.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nI know that does not exactly answer your question, but I guess the answer is there is no way to fully prepare for anything. You have to do what is right for you, at the right time. Though I realise that if you are looking to have kids, it puts you in a slightly more difficult position, as things become a little more time sensitive.\n\nWhile I was able to get tested and have results in three months, my cousin (who also tested negative) was visiting the counsellor for a lot longer before he got tested. Everyone is different.\n\nFeel free to message me though, if you want someone to talk to about the process or just Huntington's in general. This is so helpful. Thank you so much. My free award is totally out of place here but you really helped me out so I will give it to you anyway. I hope no one gets offended by it. Before I did my testing, I did the following to prepare:\n\n\\- Got a therapist experienced in working with patients suffering from disease/illness. He was already very educated about HD. I made sure to ask during the phone screening. Waited until he recommended that I was in a good enough place, and had enough skills, to accept the results without letting it ruin my mental state.\n\n\\- Did 3 years of Dialectic Behavioral Therapy, as a way to learn radical acceptance and healthy ways of processing my emotions. This included learning mindful meditation.\n\n\\- 3 meetings with a genetic counselor who works at an HD research center.\n\n\\- 2 meetings with a neurologist who researches HD. I was already in therapy when I decided to test. He had never heard of this disease but he helped encourage me on my path of testing. To get the ball rolling I called my heath care provider and said I was interested in getting tested. They sent over a referral within a week. I then had a meeting with a genetic counselor to talk about family history, pros and cons of getting tested, life insurance policies etc. She then referred me to a genetic physiologist (outside of my health care provider). I then had about a 4 hour long session with her to talk about my history with HD, how it had affected me, and talked about my options. She required my husband to be present so she could explain everything to him, since my result would affect him as well. By the end, she made the decision on if she felt I was ready to test. She then sent me to the main genetic doctor in my area, who I had one quick meeting with (just a quick meet and greet, and to make sure I was 100% ready to test). He then sent a referral to get my blood drawn. 10 days later, that same doctor gave me my results. Then a month later I had one more session with the genetic psychologist to see how I was processing my results. \nAll in all, the whole testing process was very short. From the initial phone call to my results was 3 only months. I hope this helps!", "HD marriage advise I am 30 with 45 CAG repeats and do not have any obvious symptoms yet. \n\nI hate to turn to Reddit for something so close and personal like this but I needed to specifically ask people who have knowledge of HD and the massive undertaking of living with and/or caring for someone who is symptomatic\n\nSince I found out I am positive my husband has really stepped up and committed himself to my emotional care, assuring that he would take care of me for my whole life.\n\nbackground info:\nwe have been married for 6 years and together for 10\nWe are so broke that we have zero financial freedom on a very long term basis (I am working on it)\nMy husband has been emotionally abusive for years but when he is not, he is my best friend and I love him dearly; so I have had some really strong conflicting feelings throughout our relationship about leaving vs staying\n\nand obviously I am still here.

This is just restating the church's well known position on research involving embronic tissue. ( was a much more surprising and welcome message of compassion - including support and a blessing for scientific research:\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters,\n\n\nI welcome you with joy, and I greet each one of you present at this opportunity for meeting and reflection dedicated to Huntington\u2019s Disease. I wholeheartedly thank all those who worked to make this day possible. I am grateful to Dr Cattaneo and to Mr Sabine for their introductory words. I would like to extend my greeting to all people who, in their body and in their life, carry signs of this disease, as well as those who suffer from other so-called rare diseases.\n\n\n\nI know that some of you have had to brave a very long and difficult journey in order to be here today. I thank you and I am happy you are here. I have listened to your accounts and the difficulties you must face each day; I understand how much tenacity and dedication your families, doctors, health care workers and volunteers have as they support you in a journey that poses many uphill climbs, some of which are extremely difficult.\n\n\n\nFor far too long. the fears and difficulties that characterize the life of people affected by Huntington\u2019s Disease have surrounded them with misunderstandings and barriers, veritably excluding them. In many cases the sick and their families have experienced the tragedy of shame, isolation and abandonment. Today, however, we are here because we want to say to ourselves and all the world: \u201cHIDDEN NO MORE!\u201d, \u201cOCULTA NUNCA MAS!\u201d, \u201cMAI PIU\u2019 NASCOSTA!\u201d. It is not simply a slogan, so much as a commitment that we all must foster. The strength and conviction with which we pronounce these words derive precisely from what Jesus himself taught us. Throughout his ministry, he met many sick people; he took on their suffering; he tore down the walls of stigma and of marginalization that prevented so many of them from feeling respected and loved. For Jesus, disease is never an obstacle to encountering people, but rather, the contrary. He taught us that the human person is always precious, always endowed with a dignity that nothing and no one can erase, not even disease. Fragility is not an ill. And disease, which is an expression of fragility, cannot and must not make us forget that in the eyes of God our value is always priceless.\n\n\n\nDisease can also be an opportunity for encounter, for sharing, for solidarity. The sick people who encountered Jesus were restored above all by this awareness. They felt they were listened to, respected, loved. May none of you ever feel you are alone; may none of you feel you are a burden; may no one feel the need to run away. You are precious in the eyes of God; you are precious in the eyes of the Church!\n\n\n\nI now turn to the families. Those who experience Huntington\u2019s Disease know that no one can really overcome loneliness and despair if they do not have people at their side who, with self-sacrifice and steadfastness, make themselves \u2018travel companions\u2019. You are all this: fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, children, brothers and sisters who, on a daily basis, silently but effectively, accompany your family members on this difficult path. For you, too, at times, the path is an uphill climb. For this reason, I encourage you, too, not to feel you are alone; not to give in to the temptation of the sense of shame or guilt. The family is the privileged place of life and of dignity, and you can cooperate to build that network of solidarity and of help that the family alone can guarantee, and which the family is first called to live.\n\n\n\nI speak to you, physicians, health care workers, volunteers of the associations that are involved with Huntington\u2019s Disease and with those who suffer from it. Among you there are also workers from the Ospedale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, who, both with assistance and with research, express the contribution of a work of the Holy See in this most important field. The service that you all provide is valuable, because it is surely your dedication and your initiative that give tangible shape to the hope and motivation of the families who trust in you. The disease poses many challenges related to diagnostics, therapy and assistance. May the Lord bless your work: may you be a point of reference for patients and their families who, in various circumstances, find themselves having to face the already difficult trials that the disease entails, in a social-health care context which often is not oriented to the dignity of the human person. In this way, however, difficulties multiply. Often adding to the disease are poverty, forced separations and a general sense of dismay and mistrust. For this reason, national and international associations and institutions are vital. You are like hands that God uses to sow hope. You are the voices that these people have so as to claim their rights!\n\n\n\nLastly, geneticists and scientists are present here, who, for some time, sparing no energy, have dedicated themselves to studying and researching a treatment for Huntington\u2019s Disease. Clearly, there is a great deal of expectation surrounding your work: resting on your efforts are the hopes of finding the way to a definitive cure for the disease, but also of improving the living conditions of these brothers and sisters, and of accompaniment, especially in the delicate phases of diagnosis, at the onset of the first symptoms.\n\n\n\nMay the Lord bless your task! I encourage you to always pursue it with means that do not contribute to fuelling that \u201cthrow-away culture\u201d that at times infiltrates even the world of scientific research. Some branches of research, in fact, utilize human embryos, inevitably causing their destruction. But we know that no ends, even noble in themselves, such as a predicted utility for science, for other human beings or for society, can justify the destruction of human embryos.\n\n\n\nBrothers and sisters, as you see, you are a large and motivated community. May the life of each of you \u2014 both of those who are directly affected by Huntington\u2019s Disease and those who work hard every day to support the sick in their pain and difficulty \u2014 be a living witness to the hope that Christ has given us. Even through suffering there passes a path of abundant good, which we can travel together.\n\n\n\nI thank all of you! Please, do not forget to pray for me, as I will pray for you. I was touched by his appeal for people with HD to be treated with compassion.  He is the first guy out of the Vatican, the first world leader, to publically recognize HD.  \n\nI will take it.

I thought that my dad had been tested but I found out yesterday he has not . He is 58 and has no symptoms but I am still terrified he might have it and i might have it . I am 25 and starting to think about starting a family with my SO. I am so anxious and crying thinking about it and feel like I need to get tested. Idk how to calm down If your grandmother has it, there is a 50/50 chance your dad has it. And if he does have it, there is a 50/50 chance you have it.\n\nSo statistically, there is a 25% chance you have it. The odds are in your favor.\n\nHowever, that said, if you do plan on having children, I would suggest getting tested. Live your life. I have two wonderful children and a grandson who all may be at risk as I got tested and carried the gene. I would not change a thing other than I would not have gotten tested! I am so glad I am here by the grace of my parents and so lucky to have my children that god graced me with. I pray every day that My kids escape this crappy disease!!!! Good luck no answer is the right one just my opinion \u2764\ufe0f Is it confirmed that your grandma has HD? What is her CAG length? I ask because 90 is very old for someone with HD, so if she does have an official HD diagnosis, her CAG length must be very low (40 or 41), or could even be in the intermediate range (36-39) where some people never develop symptoms until old age.\n\nMost people behind developing symptoms in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. Your grandma's age is very odd as well as your dads, being 58 with no symptoms. That is a good sign. The odds are definitely in your favor.\n\nI would recommend if you are having children to either look into getting tested yourself, or there are ways to do IVF in which they can create an HD-free embryo (and you do not even need to find out your HD status if you prefer not to). Stay positive! Being fearful is completely understandable. It is huge to realize the potential impact that HD can have on your future. If your father is not getting tested then you will have to decide if you want to know for certain. \n\nI will say that HD typically comes on at about the same time as your parents as your CAG count will be similar. It seems like its presenting later in life if your grandmother is 90 years old. My mother started showing symptoms in her mid 40\u2019s and made it to 67. I imagine your grandmother started showing symptoms in her 70\u2019s or 80\u2019s in that case. There are treatments which could slow the progression that might be available in the next 5 years that could give hope for us all. Thank you. Yes it is confirmed but I do not know what length and I am not sure if I could find out . I thought that usually the next generation might get it sooner so idk maybe my dad could still develop symptoms between now and whenever my grandma did .

Thank you! Thanks. I fucking hate this. Thanks for sorting! I have exactly this hd without known parent with HD. 10% of cases are New according to the wickepedia artikel. Cases like this definitely exist, and are more common for HD than for many other single-gene disorders, but I think the mod\u2019s point is that most people who are on this sub asking if they might have HD, based just on a twitch and some google searching, probably do not have HD. \n\n10% of HD may come from new mutations, but when only 0.015% of Europeans, and less worldwide, have HD, that is a 0.0015% chance that some random person with a twitch has actually got HD. Even less likely since many of these people are young (really uncommon to get HD young without family history) and have no other symptoms besides an occasional twitch which could be caused by tons of things. \n\nI assume the mods are not going to turn away people asking these questions, just direct them to a stickied info post so there are not tons of posts asking very similar questions. thanks! reading posts like that piss me off a bit more than they maybe should haha", "I am scared.. My grandmother has been 'sick' for a long time now. Recently I asked my mother what she had, turns out to be HD. So this means my dad has a 50% chance to get it and me 25%. \n\nThe last year(s), I saw and felt some small muscle movements (very rarely), mostly in my leggs but also in my arms. Never thought about it being something bad. But since I know HD is in our family, I start feeling and seeing them more and more. I am only 19 and I am afraid of what is waiting for me the next couple of years.. You got the odds wrong. Your dad has a 50/50. He he has it your chances are also 50/50. If he does not have it, you cannot have it.\nMore than this, you have time. It is a slow muthafucker. The leaps in understanding in the last ten years is huge. Even if you do have it. It can be decades before it even shows up. Read all you can. Alleviate your fears. And remember you are not alone. \ud83d\udc4d PS. Those twitches could be anyone of a million other things. You need to accept that you will look at these things with HD in mind, but that does not mean that is what it is. Talk to a professional, get some guidance. Be strong. I am the type of person that always prefers to have more information rather than less, even if that information may be upsetting. If I were you, I would get a genetic test done to see if you inherited the mutant huntingtin gene (which causes HD). Based on this test, if you have the gene, you would also be able to determine when symptoms are likely to begin. I would prefer to know because it would mean I can either stop worrying about it or make plans to deal with the symptoms when they arise. Not everyone would make the same decision. But, I would be upset and anxious due to the ambiguity if I did not get tested. \n\nOn the bright side, it is extraordinarily rare to have symptoms onset at 19 and if you are going to have symptoms they are likely to occur around the same age that they began in your grandmother, presumably much older than 19. My dad has HD. I choose to not get tested and live by the idea that \"nothing is wrong until something is wrong\". Ignorance with this topic is my bliss. \n\nThe worries come every now and again, but I have that comfort with me for now. Muscle twitches are called fasciculations and are completely normal. The majority of the population gets them. Look up benign fasciculation syndrome. I have them all the time. All day, all night. Have had so for a decade. My grandmother died of HD, or it led to her death.  My 60 year old father was recently diagnosed and his symptoms have really accelerated in the last few months.  My brother and I are in our early 30's and its horrible watching this happen to our grandmother, and now our Dad and its scary to think my brother and I both have a 50/50 chance of getting it.  Im hoping the gene editing technology really improves soon.  Hopefully a cure is just around the corner.", "Girlfriend tested positive Unfortunately I discovered this subreddit under bad circumstances. Today my girlfriend was told that she tested positive for the HD gene. We are now preparing to face the cold, upsetting reality of this disease.\n\nI will be reading through this subreddit and the resources the specialist gave us to learn as much as possible about Huntington's disease, what to expect for the symptoms, how to care for someone with the disease, and any possible treatment for symptoms. I wish you all a happy and safe new year and I hope to respond to all advice I happen to get. Find out the CAG number, that will let you know when symptoms are suppose to begin. I am sorry. Look into physical therapy, and exercises; there can be a significant amount of help there, especially if started early. Stuff like blowing in a sprirometer and keeping a ball at the same level can increase functional life span a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are several drugs going through clinical trials that are very promising. It looks like within five years she could get a shot in the spine every month or more and effectively lower her CAG count age of onset by 10 points of more. That means if she has under a 45 CAG it would pop it out of the danger zone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor instance this just came out.  ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow is her family? That can be a large part for good or ill. Some families have figured things out so that it is not so bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalm is best, low stress. Eat healthy. As a husband with the gene, my wife has been educating herself as much as possible since we found out. While your gf is likely going through some form of depression now (at least I did) realizing that you care and have true unwavering love will go a very long way.  \n\nTry and look for a HD support group in your area. Just go and meet the other folks dealing with a similar situation. At the very least, you will get to know others who can empathize and will likely get some reading material on being a caregiver.\n\nMost importantly and most complicated, you need to ask yourself if you are in this for long haul with her. There could be nothing worse than the obsessive nature HD can trigger, and having that foundation of trust with her before symptoms get worse is paramount.  Let her know if this is how you feel (if that is how you feel). If you do not... that is ok today. HD is very very hard on the support team.  Having HD can inspire strong feelings of guilt or embarrassment for being a nuisance on the people around them.  It is your life too, you are worth living your best life.  If you can do that, you are doing the very best thing you can - being a source of happiness and love for them.\n\nGood luck, stay strong, and as someone else pointed out - keep the stress low and the diets healthy. Thanks for all this information, I appreciate it. Thank you for the advice. I love my girlfriend with all my heart and I want to be there for her, no matter what. I wish you the best. You too! Sounds like she is in really good hands ;) I wanted to ask, by some of these clinical studies, are you referring to RG6042?  I read that they are in Phase 3 of testing, but I do not know what that means for a timeline of approving the drug (if it is successful) or how expensive it would be. Maybe all of that is still unknown?\n\nSorry if I ask questions that might not have answers, I was reading more on this disease today and got extremely sad. It is rough in ways you cannot understand. After the first shock wears off, it is just life everyday. \n\nClinical trials work in the 1,2,3 path with log increase in cost. 1 is will this hurt people, will it do anything, what dose is good. 2 is really looking at if it works. 3 is interactions with other drugs, a wider population and all the final things the FDA needs. en.hdbuzz.net/203\n\n is the best clearing house for knowing about the drugs. I am glad you asked, putting this together has helped me better understand the current state of work. Generally the 1,2,4,6 work is a shot in the spine. HD is a great candidate for these treatments due to the way it works. Costs should be in the 70k range a year, with a gift back for most of it. \n\nWe have: \n\n\n1. Roche trial from Wave work. \n2. UniQure announces key details of its planned trial to assess the safety and ability of AMT-130 gene therapy - so super new\n3.  A potentially failed trial of a previously OK drug. \n4.  Isis Pharmaceuticals, and the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche. The drug, called ASO-HTT-Rx, is a therapy that aims to treat HD by targeting the gene itself.\n5.  Dimebom another previously OK drug did not work. \n6. Ionis and Roche  This one seems to work. It is one of the most promising things to come along for HD ever. If everything works she gets a shot in the spine every month and never sees symptoms. \n7.  Pfizer has announced that the first-pass analysis of its \u2018Amaryllis\u2019 trial, testing a PDE-10 inhibitor drug, shows the drug did not meet its target of improving Huntington\u2019s disease symptoms. thank you for the information. the estimated price scares the hell out of me because we do not make that much in a year combined, but if that is what it takes, i need to consider it. It is a tax game they play. Your out of pocket will be limited  by your insurance. Thank you. It is something I will have to prepare for in any case. Check out HDYO.org", "Can CRISPR Conquer Huntington's? (PLOS) ", "My wife is a saint and I need to worship her ", "How much does stress play into onset of symptoms? Does stress develop Huntington\u2019s sooner and faster?  I have not heard about any research into that. I have heard that in general anything found to slow brain aging will also slow symptom onset, but not by a significant amount. I believe that it plays apart, I am 37 have a cag of 44, have been symptomatic for 5 years. That is why I always tell ppl to make peace with it I know it is hard, I truly believe it feeds and fuels it by you  being so down and in a destructive frame of mind What are your symptoms?  Do you have much corhea showing up?  Keep your head high friend. Thanks only slight twitching I have just made 4 months sober and am now working on my weight, I have recently made friends with someone who is on the Roche trials In my early 40s, male and only some cognitive signs, but as my neurologist says, we do not always know if it is HD, so we treat the symptoms individually. I went through an incredibly stressful period and turned to substances to self medicate (just cannabis).   Clearly the wrong direction.  But \n\nHowever, I that therapy did not give me any answers either.  I kind of floated around in depression for a couple years, got super healthy (diet and intense exercise) and got rid of some toxic relationships.  That felt good, but I STILL have issues. \n\nSo I went back to cannabis and I am truly a happier person. My wife and I met with my neurologist (and psychologist and therapist) again yesterday and we have all kind of agreed that stress was the biggest issue in my life, and that not managing it could absolutely increase chances of symptoms (opinion, not fact).  So we have a healthy routine of balance planned - not to avoid stress specifically, but to have an \u201coutlet.\u201d   \n\nWork can be really stressful and I am often speaking (sometimes performing) to crowds.  Rather than take some higher paying jobs, I have made decisions that make me productive, happier and has a nice balance.   Stress will never go away, but with good decision making and an outlet or two to look forward to,  you can minimize the impact stress has on your life.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. I am also not advocating for pot, as it may not work for you. My point is, do the work to find where your stresses are coming from and adapt as best as you can. Every minute with your loved ones is precious, make them as enjoyable as you can. ;) This is something that interests me too! I am curious with the ability of finding out if you have it when you are pre-symptomatic, if there will be fewer neurological symptoms and emotional stress.\n\nI tested gene positive at 18 and have come a LONG way with wrapping my head around my future while trying to be happy. I was pretty down for the first couple of years, but I am 10 years down the line now and it does not bother me as much. Last year I went back to my genetic counselor and she asked me if I regretted testing. I still think I made the right decision.\n\n I am hoping all the 'violent' and anger symptoms can be avoided by living the best life I can now. I think for my dad, he did not know he had it and found out after an incident at work led to him taking early retirement. \nSo fingers crossed for different results! I also heard years ago passed from father to child can speed up the process, it was my HD therapist, it is never been researched but I do wonder There is a greater chance of CAG expansion when the gene is passed down from the father rather than the mother, that might be what your therapist was talking about. An expansion would certainly speed up symptom onset generation to generation. Would it affect my children, I am female If you are gene positive then each of your children has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. If they inherit it, I believe the most likely outcome is that their mutation level is the same as yours, but there is a smaller chance that the gene expands or contracts. Father\u2019s have a greater chance of passing on an expansion and mothers have a greater chance of passing on a contraction.\n\nI know a family where HD was passed down from grandma to mom &amp; aunt to granddaughter and contracted each time, so it is possible for it to contract over generations.\n\nBut there is no way to know until your children are adults and make the choice to get tested. How is the trial going? Is your friend seeing any change in symptoms? It is only been less than a week so hard to tell atm", "Separation Anxiety ", "Mental Illness and HD Hey everyone, I am looking for some insight. Trigger warning for suicide.\n\nI have had mental health struggles since I was 14 (I am 24 now). I have been hospitalized for suicidality, been in therapy, tried various medications, etc that have not been very helpful. I think my life is generally a dead end and for the most part, I truly do not see the point of going through the motions of life.\n\n(I hope that nobody takes my post this way, but: I *do not* think that life is not worth living being HD positive. I just think that personally, I would not be able to bear it.)\n\nI guess what I have recently been thinking is that there is not really a point in trying to \"get better\". That is, the thought of continually working and trying to get through my mental illness only to find that I am HD positive makes me not want to try at all. \n\nI am wondering if anybody has had major mental health struggles, and how to overcome the belief that it does not matter if you kill yourself, because whether HD positive or negative, you would still want to die. I come from a family of six and have somehow avoided major mental health issues. So I cannot speak feom direct personal epxerience. HD took my mom three years ago. My brother has tested positive. His primary symptom was sudden onset of severe depression. He has worked with that via professional counsel and medication. I know that he would definitely say that his life is worth living even after watching HD take his grandfather and mother.\n\nYou make no mention of personal connection with HD. Do you have HD in your family? Hey! My husband was suicidal when he was your age. Then, in his early 50s, he started HD symptoms. Btu you know what? the years in between were AMAZING. He travelled all over the world, got married twice, played in bands, had friends, animals, lots of great food and great sex, made important music and mentored a whole generation of musicians in his time little sub-genre. Every day I think of some amazing experience we had. Things can change. You might stop feeling this way. They might find a cure. Or maybe you will squeeze 25 amazing years in between the shitty ones, like he did. Thanks for sharing your experiences. Had your brother experienced depression before he was symptomatic?\n\nI am not sure how I left that out, but yes, my mom was diagnosed with HD a few years ago. Her diagnosis was when we discovered it ran in the family. My brother had no symptoms at all before he was symptomatic. Depression and some loss of cognitive skills are his only symptoms so far. His decline is only noticeable if you know him well.\n\nI am sorry about your mom's diagnosis and all that implies for her, you, and anyone else in your family. Is she symptomatic? Thank you for this, it was really moving. I hope I can lead a life of such vitality. May I ask how long it was between when he tested positive to when the symptoms began?\n\nShe is in the mid stages now. Her symptoms are mainly cognitive and behavioural. My sister and I have both decided not to test for the time being. My mom was tested because she became symptomatic. She was 68 I believe, so delayed onset, for which we were very grateful. Most people decide not to be tested. Does not seem to be much point since there is not really anything to do at this point.\n\nSomething you could consider though that might give you that bit of purpose you seem to be looking for: consider signing up for studies. They have ones for people who have been tested and not tested. Some will test and not tell you the results unless you ask them to. You and your sister could provide valuable research data. Sorry, I meant the time between your brother's result and the major depressive episode? I do wonder whether a positive result would lead to that for me.\n\nYeah, I am trying to enroll in one at the moment, it is a really great way to feel like I am doing something. Iirc his depressive episode was not long after he got his results. His depression was attributed fully to HD. It was not a reaction to his diagnosis, if that makes sense. It would have happened even if he had not been tested. The past is gone and the future is a dream. You only have now. Live for the now. I (26F) have struggled with depression and anxiety for many years and just recently was diagnosed with ADHD also. I will be honest it was very hard to learn of my positive results. I chose to get tested after finding out my mom\nwas positive and exhibiting symptoms. I thought it might help me somehow 'live life to the fullest' in someway but I will be honest it was a very hard pill to swallow. I do have my moments of \"is this all worth it when my future is so grim?\" and it is hard to deal with. \nI know this probably is not the answer you want to hear but I believe it is important being honest in this community. I do not want you to feel like you are alone in your sadness because many people seem to be so positive and put on such a brave face and to me it feels so isolating. I definitely do not support you ending your life I just want you to know you are not alone. I still think there is a point in life even being HD positive, helping my mom through her time of need is a big one, and I feel like even if I might live a short life I want to try to help those around me. \nI know you say you have not had much help with meds/therapy but I encourage you to try again. Especially if you decide to get tested, knowing what I know now, a therapist specializing in end of life care/chronic illnesses would be a great help. \nI try my hardest to stay positive every day and move forward in life even knowing what my future holds. Try not to give up hope. This honestly was really validating to read. I also feel scared, sad, and alone when others seem so optimistic and hopeful, and your post helped me. I think you are strong and brave, thank you so much for sharing your experience. Hey, I am 25 F, HD positive and have been feeling the exact same way.  I hit a real low point and I am slowly crawling out of it.  It makes you feel like everything is being taken away, and that anything you work towards is a waste of time.  I was really on the brink.  But I am slowly getting out of this dark place.  If you want you could message me and we could talk?  Maybe I can take you out of this with me?  We can Sashay away from the darkness \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude18 Thank you for sharing your experience, i am glad to hear that you are slowly feeling better. I would love to  talk, I will send you a message :) Same :( Same,26F I do not have any insight in terms of mental illness I have been lucky in that regard. My dad is in late stages of HD, I tested negative, and my brother has not tested yet. I just wanted to simply thank you for the list of complete honesty. You are vulnerability is admirable and I hope you can find somehow or another that your life is worth living. Society, people, the world can learn a lot from you and the example you live your life. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel; even if that light is dim. Find something worth living for, we only get one shot in this world. I appreciate the transparency and it is people like you have the potential to humble and change the world. Best of luck !", "Tested positive at 49 counts 7 years ago, I am 29 years old and the symptoms have begun showing My name is Joanna, I am 29 years old from NY state, I work in fashion and as of today, December 26th, 2021, I am officially early stage Huntington's. I have not spoken to any doctor because it is quite obvious that it has started. For the past several months I have started getting random tremors more and more, I sometimes get this feeling of weakness in my legs while I am walking and I have had minor episodes of slurring here and there. Also typing feels \"weird\". \n\nMy family situation is such that I watched my father die from Huntington's complications (he was at 47 counts), I do not have a mother and my grandparents passed away few years after my father passed away. Aside from distant cousins I have only ever heard about, it is really just me. I inherited his house which is where I have been living ever since and I make a good living working doing something I like. None of my friends or coworkers know about my diagnosis and I am still thinking about what to do now. \n\nAside from Huntington's, I also have other bothersome conditions like irritable bowel disease, some significant skin issues, allergies and an eye condition. I really, really, reaaaalllyy do not want to get to late stage because it is not a pretty sight and there will be no one to look out for me. So my idea is to basically live the rest of my \"livable\" life for as long as I can before coming up with a way to kill myself. Sorry to be this blunt but I do not really have a choice. \n\nI have considerable money saved up, I know my area and I know people. I can concede that what I have in mind is pretty stupid but basically I will do all drugs, drink all the alcohol and hook up with everyone from Tinder until I feel like I cannot go on anymore and somehow OD on cocaine or heroin. If I cannot control the disease, I want to at least control my death and that is how I want it to end. Last Saturday I went out with a stranger from Tinder and had sex with him while high on cocaine and it was the most amazing I have ever felt. I can totally do that for the rest of my time I have left.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you have in mind. Thanks.", "Recent positive test My(28F) bf(30M)found out last year his father is not his biological father. His bio dad had HD so he got tested and is positive for the gene. He has an appointment next week with the neurologist to see if he is diagnosed. We only got the results 3 months ago.\n\nI am having a really hard time dealing with it. It took me a week to talk to him about how I was feeling. I am trying to be supportive and optimistic but I cannot help but feel dread about the future. We have been together for seven years. Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Wow. This is all so hard. My only advice is nothing clever or deep. It sounds like a good therapist might be a good idea. Maybe some joint sessions if BF is up for it.\n\nEach of these things has very real but different impact on each of you. Some of your questions and pain will be similar. Some will be very different. It could be helpful to have a professional help you sort things out. I am so sorry you both are going through this. It may be hopefully some years still before the full brunt of the disease kicks in, and in that time you may both develop ways to cope. I married into a HD family and my MIL who is the caretaker of my HD+ FIL told me she used to be really fixated on the disease when he was first diagnosed in 2014, but now she does not think about it much at all because it is become their norm. Currently he is extremely advanced in the disease. She is been able to find a way to have a sense of humor and still enjoy her life, spending time with friends while still looking after her husband (with help!) When I was worried my own husband might be HD+ she was really someone I looked up to for how I might try to approach the rest of my life. It is definitely not easy and they have their share of bad days but she goes to occasional counseling, and they have found the right combination of medication to stabilize his emotions plus physical therapy for the chorea. They have been able to so far get by. I really believe you can get through this. I definitely second the recommendation to talk this through with your partner and a professional That was my biggest my problem. I did not want to talk about how I was feeling since I feel like it affects him more directly. I do think I am going to look into a therapist for us to go talk to We are hoping. We do not know a lot about his bio dad, and he passed away in 2018. The one good thing is he has a half sister from the bio dad. She also tested positive for the gene which sucks but we can talk to her about it. I am going to look into a counselor tho. Please do not feel bad about needing your own support. HD is devastating for the person who has it, but it can have serious ramifications for their families, especially someone like a spouse who will end up a caregiver. There is a lot you can do to be prepared, but you have to actively plan for many of those things. You will need every ounce of outside support you can get. \n\nI knew I was at risk, and I told my husband that very early on when we were dating. We talked about it pretty frequently and he said he understood. It did not really hit home for him though until my mom starting getting worse. I would seen advanced HD and described it to him, but he would never seen it first hand. He had a lot of feelings he was afraid to share with me, and he was making decisions that I did not realize at the time were based on those feelings - decisions that I would have asked him not to make until I was tested and we had more information. I had seen two genetic counselors and been in therapy in the past before we met, but he 100% should have talked to a professional during that time, and I wish I would have pushed the issue. I just did not realize how stressed he was about it because he was purposely hiding it from me. It is not a solo journey. Do not hesitate to get help. HD caregiver spouse here. There are no easy answers or really much in the way of comfort, unfortunately.\n\nDefinitely get yourself a therapist, and gently suggest that your SO either goes with you, or goes on his own. \n\nHere is the hard part:\n\nYou will at some point have to have a series of difficult conversations about what will be expected of you, and how to care for him once he requires assistance with everything. \n\nWhere will he want to live? How will you pay for medical care? Who else in his family will provide assistance when you are unable? How much of your life (career, kids, relationships, physical health) can you tolerate losing to this disease?\n\nBecause Huntington\u2019s will take it all. I am not trying to scare you, but I wish someone had given me this advice years ago. \n\nTravel while you can. Make memories. That will help when things get harder. We have talked a little bit about it. But we do realize making more memories now is important. We have never been in a rush to get married, and still are not, but that is one thing that has moved up on the priority list. \n\nThat is also the stuff I do not want to discuss with him. I am the youngest of three girls and I have always been the caregiver. We currently live with my parents who are in their 60s and have custody of my 10 year old niece. We both help with them as they do have some health issues. Plus my niece actually listens to me much better. I feel like I will always be taking care of everyone and it is really hard to think about. \n\nHe also had a brain abscess in late 2019 which was so difficult. He spent two months in the hospital and had to have surgery. His memory got slightly worse after that but that was to be expected. It makes it harder now because I worry it may actually be the HD since we did not know then he had the gene. That is so much for you to deal with. Start building your support network now. Get someone who can take over for you on a regular basis. Build the scaffolding around your life that you will require.\n\nValue your own well being. You will have to be very healthy to get through this. However we will you are now caring for yourself, find ways to give yourself more. It will feel selfish, but this is for the good of everyone involved.", "I need to make friends who understand! Hi! I am 25 just finished school and found out about 5 years ago essentially my entire family is at risk of Huntingtons. My papa is dying of it now they said he had about 8 years left almost 5 years ago. His mother died of it when I was really young, I only remember meeting her once but it was honestly terrifying. While my friends are great they just do not get it. They have no clue how terrified I am. I just need someone who understands. I am so sorry! Huntington\u2019s is so rough on families. I wish I could tell you I understand completely- but I am not specifically at risk. I married into it- my husband is at risk, and my children. The fear is crippling. Have you looked into support groups?  Not really I do not even know where to start... Check out HDSA.org\n\nThat is a good place to start and has a lot of links to other sites. At the very bottom of the homepage there is a link specifically for finding support near you. I am not sure where you are located. I am fortunate that I am near large cities in CA. I went to an event in May. They are making so much headway in research right now. There are even opportunities to be a part of the research. I was able to hear people discuss how they are coping....one man with early onset HD even said how becoming involved and serving the HD community has helped turn HD into something he has learned to live with in a positive light rather than something dark and very nearly evil. Obviously I am no where near being able to look at it this way when my children\u2019s futures are at risk, but this is my goal. \nBe patient and forgiving with yourself. This is a process. And it is a very scary and uncertain thing. But you can decrease your fear by getting to know the beast, so to speak. Get involved if you can. Research. Keep reaching out on here. The HD community on Reddit is not super active- but we are here. And we \u201cget it\u201d more than others. I am constantly surprised by how much the general public does not know about HD! I had to educate my parents and family about it. Awareness is a good thing. So teach your friends about it too. It probably will not help your fear...but it might help THEM understand it. \nYou can do this!  Thank you\u2764\u2764\u2764 I am 27 and mother was diagnosed 5 years ago as well. I never met my grandma who died from it, but I watched two of my uncles and an aunt all pass during my early teens. I totally get it. Before or after I knew I was at risk, nobody could fully grasp what it was like to live with such a horrible disease surrounding your life. Try as I might to explain it. \n\nI was just talking to another at-risk user recently and realized how nice it is to talk and be heard and understood about this. It is easy to feel trapped in your thoughts and like you cant reach others. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk.  Grandmother, father, uncle and i have it. I have one biological daughter at risk. Its fucked. But you are not dwined by HD. Know and remember this. You are Crylynn93!!! hd is slow and the treatments and understanding is growing much faster now. learn about mindfulness, living in the now. That is my best advice. You have friends, you have family. You have love. \u2764 Thank you, I really need to remember that. Sometimes it feels like most of my life is controlled by HD.  I totally inderstand that.   sorry to hear about your recent need.  Having others understand about HD is very hard.  I come from an HD family and grew up in a similar situation where I did not feel anyone knew about HD, but once I met people from the HD community, my life changed for the better.

I am almost 30. I feel like the depression/low mood is a symptom of the HD that has been aggravated by the military. Should I keep my HD diagnosis anonymous or bring it up? I am 30 and otherwise healthy-ish (I feel like I am slowly losing it mentally). I have not bought any life insurance or long term care insurance yet. When you say a high CAG repeat, how high is it? My recommendation would be to find a HD center of excellence and see if your symptoms could be related to HD. I have no military experience so I do not know if it would be smart to bring it up that you are HD+. Perhaps another member on r/huntingtons has military experience and could chime in. 42 CAG repeat. I would like to see a neurologist and see if my brains affected or not via imaging. I think the general consensus is that if I am HD+ I will get additional disability and life long medical support through the VA I actually think you have to serve 8 years and then after that the va will cover anything that happens. I am in the same boat rn. I have not gotten tested. My dad did not either. My gma died from it at 45. And my uncle just passed at 39 from it The 8 years is my understanding, too - not specific to HD, but just from having a father who was in the navy and is now disabled. I think 8 is the magic number for full benefits from the VA. I would suggest getting private life insurance and LTC coverage before putting your diagnosis on record. You would be surprised what insurance companies can get their hands on and it might include your service records, definitely your health records. You can always cancel the policy later if it turns out you are all set with what the military/VA offers you.

From what I found a male parent with HD is generally associated with an increase of CAG repeats. This obviously suggests that the number is not necessarily the same. \n\nSo, is it generally the same? Is the mechanism by which it increases or decreases understood? (I am assuming that number changing through a mutation would be pretty rare) I might be completely wrong here. I read a long time ago that the issue with HD is that chromosomes are mass produced recklessly in men. Some of that fallout happens with the HD gene. This the child of a male carrier has a higher chance of an increase in cag repeats. Mother to child it is pretty consistent, father to child it can vary widely. Yep! Mother to child it tends to stay the same, father to child it often increases. If you remember any links about it feel free to throw them! That is good news for me actually. Thanks. No way man, it was year and years ago. I tried to trace back HD through my family line. Luckily I have the same CAG as my Dad at 42 repeats. My grandmother had HD and we traced it back to her mother. The case runs cold but that might be because one of her parents were in the \"grey\" zone so they were carriers, but might not show symptoms. Me and my dad are also 42! When it is passed down maternally, the CAG repeat tends to remain stable. When it is passed down paternally, the CAG repeat tends to expand, which is often associated with younger age of onset and more severe disease. This phenomenon is known as \"genetic anticipation\", and the mechanism is well understood for HD. \n\n\n\nI traced HD back 5 or 6 generations. My branch of the family had HD passed down exclusively through women. Most of these relatives developed symptoms slightly later and lived longer (one even lived to be 80). The branches that inherited through male relatives tended to develop the disease much earlier, and many died before they were 60.", "Huntingtons and Military Looking for advice. I am 22 years old, at risk for Huntingtons, and am wanting to join the Air Force. Does anyone have any experience with this? If they know I am at risk will I have to be tested before I can join? Which country? The US. Sorry, should have clarified. I did four years US military. They do not test you for it at MEPS.\n\nDo not breath a word about it until your contract (s?) is completely up because enlisting while being positive for HD is the definition of fraudulent enlistment. Thanks for the info and your service. I am not sure if they will be able to see it on my dad's medical records, so I guess I am not going to say anything about it unless I have to. My mom was not diagnosed until I was in.  From what I was told then, from the MDG/CC , if I was not yet exibiting symptoms of HD I was qualified to continue service.  YMMV.  I actually had a couple years gap in service after I found out; I had to find peace with my families diagnosis.  I eventually got the genetic test, was myself negative, and rejoined.\n\nWhat AFSC are you going in to?  If you are going into a job that requires a security clearance, and you did not disclose this information, it will not be good for you.  You will likely be separated from service, and face the fraudulent enlistment.  I say this to discourage withholding information like another poster suggests. It is possible that they could find your father's medical records but doubtful. For myself I know they did not even find half of what was in my medical/criminal past. A lot of the military entrance is scare tactics to influence you to snitch on yourself. \n\nHonestly go ahead and try to join if that is what you want to do. Worst thing that happens is that you get rejected. Good luck. As a general rule, you are much better off not to share that you are at risk to anyone who keeps any sort of medical, insurance, or employment records. If you begin to become concerned that you are experiencing symptoms, seek out advice at that point. I have personally known people who were denied opportunities and timely access to lifesaving health procedures because of risk, even without a positive test. There is so much stigma and misunderstanding attached to HD that you are much better off not having it on record unless you have to seek care for it. I was able to join the army with it in my family history, but this was also in 2009 during a surge. And, you know, the army.\n\nStill, I was able to use Tricare to pay for a test as well as a solid two years of therapy.\n\nIf the test turned out positive, I was at least going to have some decent health and life insurance. You can retire after 20 years and still enjoy some time before symptoms get really bad. If it was negative, well... then I would have to figure out what to do with this new lease on life.\n\nTurns out I got lucky. I wish you the same luck, man. They wont be able to see your parents records, youll be fine. Been in the Navy for 8 years and my brother just joined the AF. \n\nThey wont ask about it specifically so dont bring it up You could try to contact ( His mom got diagnosed while he was already in the Army, but with his experience in HD research and public advocacy, he could give you some useful tips. I served in the Air Force for 6 years. They did not ask about HD and I did not tell them. Same. 6 years served with no symptoms. It was probably 10 years later I started getting tremors. Actually, one of my best friends joined the Air Force in the 90s without disclosing her genetic history - she spent 8-10 years active and another 10 or so in the reserves, and THANK GOD because now that she is symptomatic, the veterans\u2019 health benefits and retirement benefits are taking care of some major expenses that would not be covered by her husband\u2019s insurance.

Her father passed from it. What do we need to do before my significant other is tested? Disability, life, long term care insurance? Any other pointers on what to do before getting tested or going about getting tested? Any kind words, words of hope, or promising studies would be helpful as well. Much love to you all and prayers for you and your families. Looking into insurance options is a good idea, especially if you do not have any insurance at the moment. Your mother in law not being tested is actually helpful in this regard, as insurance applications will ask if either of your significant other's parents have been diagnosed with Huntington's chorea and you have to answer honestly. Before being tested I talked to my insurance broker and first discussed insurance options for me, and then insurance options for my child because my status will affect their insurability.\n\nThe other thing you should do is discuss testing openly with each other and decide whether or not your significant other wants to be tested, and if they are ready for that. Not everyone wants to know, and not everyone is in a good position to find out even if they do want to know.\n\nRegarding treatment, there are some promising clinical trials underway right now.  ( is a great resource to read more about that. Good luck with the process, I am in the middle of it right now. Message me if you want to discuss anything. We have a very similar situation. My mother-in-law has it and was diagnosed a few months ago. My husband was diagnosed with it on Friday. We made sure to sign up for life insurance before taking the test. We also took the test anonymously (no insurance) because you can get kicked off life insurance if you are diagnosed with a life threatening disease within a year of signing up for it. So I would say do that ASAP. Also, look into long-term disability insurance. We are doing that now. Do as much as you can without revealing to your insurance company that he may have it. Rates will increase like crazy. I believe it is now illegal to deny someone insurance for pre-existing conditions but they can jack up your monthly rate. \n\nAs far as encouragement, look up all the treatments that they are working on currently. I think there is five total? Two in phase three. They seem promising. I am trying to be hopeful without banking on a treatment. \n\nI hope this helps. Best of luck. When I went to get tested, I met with a clinical social worker and she walked me through everything I should do prior to receiving my results. That included life, disability, long term care insurance, my medical power of attorney, last will and testament, etc. It was daunting, but I personally found a lot of comfort in having everything in order before getting my results.\n\nIf you and your SO are in the US, I highly recommend seeking out a ( I went to one and they provided me with a lot of resources prior to being tested.

The study also made me realize I have been having symptoms for the past 2 years or so (depression, anxiety, inability to focus, forgetting things I should not be, twitching, etc). Since this realization, I have been trying to hide it from my mom and sisters but it is getting harder and they are starting to notice. My grades are slipping, the twitching/fidgeting is getting worse, and I cannot even remember the last time I slept more than 5 hours.

I am not an expert on it, but it might be worth looking into. It does not sound like you have it based on your family history.\n\nSo you think this came down your dad's side of the family? Your grandparents lived to nice old ages so it is unlikely they had it, which means it is highly unlikely your dad has it, especially since he is still alive at 69 and not overtly symptomatic, which makes it highly unlikely you have it.

The point is, there are \"problems\" associated with this condition -- but only because we do not fit in well with the world around us. But there are also significant benefits as well. The way our brains work make us really, really good at some sorts of things. The point is, your son will be fine. \n\nI really admire you and the way you are reaching out. YOU CAN DO THIS.

The best part of people is that there are so many of them, and so many of them are good, honest, loving folks. So if you encounter a jerk, just move on.\n\nFinally, remember that sometimes jerks are the way they are because they are hurting from something.

I got stuck with the rep though. I got to a point where I needed to increase my rep with a faction, but could not because they all hated me. I think it might have been bugged.

The two councillors I had did such a good job over the three sessions that I am totally happy with their level of empathy and professionalism. I expect they need to be quick about it because it just needs to be done if you have agreed to it.

A friend of mine from Ireland and I did that years ago. We somehow got lost and ended up in some field somewhere with a very angry Scotsman yelling at us in, supposedly, English. Otherwise, though it is a beautiful country. \n\nTake your time. It may feel like there is this intense rush sometimes now because you know what you know, but i promise you have some time. And I am always available if you need someone to vent/talk at. Sometimes that is what is needed. Hot Cheetos haha! Are that even a thing? \nAlso, I can totally visualise your Scotland tale. I have moved 25 minutes further north and I could not understand the guy who owned the local paint shop. Or is that the Huntington\u2019s. Too soon for that kind of joke? Hm, nah. It is all the same is not it really. It does feel time limited now, but biological clock is also ticking. I think we are open to adopting or no kids at all though, so there is not really any rush I suppose. Only what I *had* in mind. I feel glad we do not already have kids. They would be in my position now, and I am glad I can protect them from this in a way. My Irish friend was just as confused as me, and he is from Belfast where vowels are optional. Oh my god I forgot that you poor British people are cut off from the cultural and spiritual power that is American junk food. Yes, hot Cheetos are absolutely a thing and yes, they are exactly as addictive as heroin. I am trying to find a site you can visit to buy them. Needs be I will freakin mail them to you. \n\nIt is never too early for jokes. Some of my worst moments thinking about it have been broken by a terrible and tasteless joke. Humor seems to take some of its power away. \n\nYou have options. Adoptions absolutely an option (I am an adoptee, though so obviously I am biased). There are plenty of choices here and you do not actually have to commit to anything right now. Haha. I have a few friends from Belfast. I never made that connection of vowels being optional. I see that now! Ironically, I am from Wales originally and people frequently joke there are too many vowels. While it is true we have more vowels alphabetically, the confusion actually happens with the extra consonants so LL is one letter and represents a sound, also Dd, Ch amongst others. \n\nI will have a look into hot Cheetos. I saw a woman on TV pour some into water to make a sauce for a chilli with some pasta. I really hope you do not mean that. \n\nOh god. I think I just had a moment of clarity. You mean hot Cheetos as in spicy or chilli flavoured Cheetos? Not like hot as in you have heated them up or dipped them in a hot side?\nWhat an idiot I am ha. There is a great crisp here you might like called Monster Munch. They do Flamin\u2019 Hot, Roast Beef, or Pickled Onion.", "GB Sciences has applied for patents and announced intent to do an FDA-sponsored pilot study for Parkinsons  I do not know anything about the state of medical marijuana research for brain disorders.  \n\nYahoo Finance article says : \"In October, the company filed the first of several patents covering complex cannabinoid-containing mixtures capable of enhancing dopamine secretion and protecting neurons from mitochondria-induced free radical damage occurring with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body Dementia, and Huntington's disease, among others. The company hopes to start an FDA-sponsored pilot study over the next 12 months targeting Parkinson's disease.\"\n\nThat sounds like a step in the right direction.  However, the statement immediately following, \"In December, GB Sciences also licensed a patent to develop new cannabis-based therapies for the treatment of heart disease.\" kind of sounds like the company is throwing darts at the board, just hoping anything will get traction.  \n\n ", "I can barely look at my mom without thinking about how she will end up like my grandmother My grandmother is 62. She can barely walk, can only make a few noises and just sits on the couch watching TV all day unless she is on the boat with my grandfather. She cannot go out barely at all because COVID would probably kill her. \n\nMy mom is 41. She has mild chorea but other than that has no symptoms. My grandmother started getting bag at around 52 years old. In the morning when my mom's driving me to school, her fingers will tap against the steering wheel and anytime I see it I cannot help but think that she is just going to get worse. Whenever I talk to her I always wonder how many more conversations like this we will have before she is too far gone. \n\nShe and my dad are insistent on saying that there will be a cure or treatment in the next 5 years but I am having a hard time believing it. Maybe I am just pessimistic or maybe the news is still too fresh in my mind but I find it very hard to be optimistic. My mental health is declining and my will to live is shredded. I do not want to lose my mom like that. \n\nI am not too scared for myself or my siblings. I am the oldest and we are all young enough to where I am semi-confident in at least something being developed before we can suffer but I am so scared for my mom. That Is scary man It is okay to be scared. There is a whole community here for you!\n\nIt is the pits, there is no escaping it. I try to look for the silver linings. Here is what i heard:\n\nYour grandmother has a family that cares enough to ensure she is as comfortable as possible. No doubt, if she were lucid, she would say thank you! \n\nYour mom cares enough to drive you to school. Remember her love and care. Shes going to need a lot of it if there is not a cure in next 5 years. \n\nI find these silver linings in my life help me keep perspective. And help me find my desire to keep living. \n\nTake this time to have the experiences that will be the stories you want to tell your grandkids about; \n\n- be well My family is going through this exact same scenario. It is crazy to experience the decline of your loved ones. We never know when treatments will be approved so we always just keep hoping everything will work out. My mom is now 55 with symptoms and my grandmother passed several years ago. If you have any questions as to how I handled it, please do not hesitate to reach out. But know you are not alone and it does get easier to handle once the freshness of the diagnosis wears off. Just appreciate the little moments while you still have them It is okay to feel scared. Know that she is your mom and will always be your mom. The time you have right now with her is precious. If you can, please get in contact with a counselor. This helped me when my dad was declining. \n\nCould I ask you about your thoughts on this? Oh. Yes! This makes me excited. I am probably going to start showing signs of hd within the next 15 years. This will hopefully be ready to slow or stop my decline. \n\nAre you interested in getting your mom into a trial? Is she interested? I doubt my mom would want to. That would mean my little siblings would have to know about her diagnosis (she did not even want me to know), plus she even gets uncomfortable hearing about good news with HD developments because of how much she hates thinking about it. I could bring it up but I highly doubt it. I am underage but I am somewhat interested in participating in HD trials whenever I am an adult if I am HD positive\n\nIf this does work out my mom will probably be in a worse state than she is right now (mild chorea and can be a little irritable sometimes) but I am hoping it can at least save her from becoming like my grandmother. My grandmother's alive but she can barely walk, cannot really talk, and is kind of just stuck sitting on the couch watching TV. I do believe that she enjoys life, though. She loves my mom, uncle, grandfather, and her grandkids and she always tries her best to look as good as possible when we come over for a visit and schedules her hair appointments accordingly, it is adorable. My grandfather only works 2 days a week and is her caretaker and he is always taking her on boat rides and spending time with her too. I hope and pray my mom never ends up like her, but if she does I hope she can be taken care of as well as my grandmother is.\n\nStay safe! One of the hardest parts of hd is its finality on you and your family. \nYou are right to not change her. Maybe take the ghandi approach and be the change you want to see.

Ideally she wants to talk with someone a bit older who has already seen the arc of Huntingtons, but she is open. Looking forward to talking with you. Thank you!!

", "In an Odd Position - Should I get Tested? Hi There.\nI am in an odd position, and I think some of you might be able to give me some insight on what to do. My grandfather passed away in his early 80\u2019s when I was 15. Our family always thought he had some sort of mental issue, although I never knew anything conclusive. I am 24 now, and this past year my father told me that before his death, my grandfather was tested as part of a trial program of sorts. He was positive for Huntingtons. My dad could not remember the full details - I believe he was diagnosed into the \u201cgrey area\u201d ( \n\nI obviously very anxiously asked my dad if he was tested. He said he was tested. I pressed further asking if he was positive for it. He did not give me a straight \u201cno\u201d. He danced around it a bit by saying something like, \u201cYou have nothing to worry about. Put it out of your mind - you should not worry about passing it to your future kids or you yourself getting Huntingtons\u201d\n\nI have a odd relationship with him, and I did not press him any further. It is left me with a very uneasy feeling, and after seeing *Into the Lions Mouth*, I am thinking again about the possibility of my dad having lied to me. He is very much the type of person that would try to avoid hurting me, and It would not surprise me if he said what he said while he tested positive in that \u201cgrey area\u201d.\n\nI do not want my life\u2019s decisions to be made for me. I am debating on just getting tested so I can know for sure. I want to make informed decisions if I do have Huntingtons. It would change how I live my daily life sure, but it would also greatly change my expectations for starting a family with my wife. Thoughts? I do not even know if I *can* get tested without proof of a relative being positive. Is that true? Also, any ideas on how expensive it can be? I know it will not be covered by insurance. I am in the US. Thanks for any insight you have.", "I do not want to lose my mom I know I have been posting here a lot, I am sorry\n\nI do not want her to die. I am pretty sure she has some perosnality symptoms and twitches and I cannot stand the thought of her getting as bad as granny and then dying. I feel like my brain is being poked at with an ice pick and it will not stop. She can be mean sometimes but most of the time she is very sweet and caring and I do not want to lose my mommy. It is so unfair. Why did our family have to have this? The only things we did to deserve this was being born. I cannot do it. Therapy is not an option right now, I cannot tell anyone I know and I just cannot. \n\nIf I have the disease I am never getting married or having kids. I cannot put anyone else through this. It is only been two days since I found out my mom had it and part of me already feels like giving up. I feel completely miserable and I cannot tell anyone about it. I have my online friends but they cannot offer much support at all and I just cannot. I do not want to kill myself but I also want to escape the pain. I want a start over button that makes it so nobody has the disease anymore. Right whenever I was sure that my mental health was doing great after a two year long off and on suicidal episode I have been thrown right back down again. I feel trapped. I just want to vent to someone and then hug them but I cannot. I cannot do anything. It is a very tough disease and i am sorry that, you, me or anyone has to put up with it. It is very unfair.\n\nYou can still have kids though, if you use IVF they can select the eggs that do not have the disease and your child will be safe, that is what i am doing right now. I am so sorry man. You are right, it is not fair. I know, but I still do not want any children or spouses to have to go through what I am going through with my mom Really sorry for what you are going through. Believe me when I say that you are not alone, and there are people who know how you are feeling and how hard it is.  \n\nYou say therapy is not an option, but there are resources that can help you come to grips with the situation: not sure where you live, but places like Huntington\u2019s Disease Society of ( or ( are run by people who understand and can help. They also sometimes offer group sessions that are free to attend for at-risk individuals. \n\nYou say you are 14 - I highly recommend checking out the Youth Groups like the ( or ( As much as it sucks that there are others going through the same thing, it can help to learn about how others cope and live their lives. It is not fair and you are not alone. HD or not, your life matters. Please go talk to your school counselor or some friends. Just keep breathing. I lost my mom to HD and I am still upset about it. I do not cry about it anymore but the pain does go away. I have got two healthy kids now and as much as I would have wanted them to meet my mom, I am glad the disease stopped at her and did not get me. If I had it, we would have done something different about having kids. It can be done but it would have been expensive. Do not worry about that now. Just love your mom and yourself. All I can do is tell you your not alone. Watching my mom go through that was the hardest times in my life.  The only real advice I have is it is okay to be sad, to cry, to feel and to express those feelings with her. I promise stuffing all the feelings away only makes it worse in the long run. My biggest regret is that I distanced my self from her because I could not face my feelings on the matter. So please try and talk to your mom. if she does not already know tell her you over heard about Huntington\u2019s. You absolutely should not have to face the emotional toll of that diagnosis alone. My dad did not tell me what my mom had till I was 25. \n\nI can relate to the kids thing. Never having kids, doubt I will get married, and if I date I am upfront in the beginning about what my medical future looks like. But Even tho I get sad and scared of the future sometimes, I am grateful for this moment I have right here to enjoy. I can tell your kind. As someone put it to me when I said essentially the same thing \u201csomeday you will find someone who will chose to stay even if they do have to go through that. \u201c There is undoubted tragedy in this world but there is also undoubtedly love. I am sorry you are going through this. It is really hard. I lost my dad to this disease and I tested positive a few years ago.\n\nI do not know if it will help you, but it did help me, to remember that everyone dies. I could die tomorrow in a car accident. My husband could die today. Right? Tomorrow is not a sure thing for anyone. I only know my life will be shorter then average and I might have a rough end. It is morbid, but it is true. \n\nI try to make the best of today because of this awareness. And I do not mean in a Yolo way, but not judging those who want to go out that way. For me, living my best life meant finishing college even though I tested positive. Completion of my decade long goal of license in architecture. Having a family (IVF means my babies do not have to live in fear). Being present now so I do not regret missing it later. Hey there, HD caregiver spouse here.\n\nPlease take a moment, and breathe deeply. I know how scary this disease seems at the moment. But this condition comes on very slowly. It is not something that will hit you all of a sudden, even though you no doubt feel as though you have been sucker punched. \n\nBreathe.\n\nYour mom needs to meet with a neurologist, who will get her on meds that will really help a lot especially in the early years of onset. Sit down with your mom, have a good cry together and learn how to be a caregiver for her in some very basic ways. Allow yourself to begin the grieving process but do not become overwhelmed by it. This is a VERY long journey. \n\nBut as for you, well, just live your life. Be a kid, be a teenager. Do not start writing your own eulogy just yet. We do not know what treatments will be mainstreaming in the coming years. There is a spinal tap treatment that looks especially promising. Get through high school and maybe college, and take life by the horns. \n\nTravel, travel, travel. Once you are old enough, travel as much as you can while you are young. \n\nI am sending love and solidarity and my PM are open if you have questions. Thank you for the advice, I appreciate it. During the days it does not leave my mind much but I am able to distract myself and have a peaceful day. The nights are just pretty hard since I have nothing to distract myself with which usually prompts these panicked posts lol\n\nI thought I heard that the spinal tap treatment was cancelled because it did not make it past stage 3? If it was not then please let me know I will have more info on clinical trials next week. This post made me cry in agony for you. I am so, so fucking sorry you are family is going through this. I was exactly your age when My mom got diagnosed. I am 23 now\u2026 almost 10 years of pain. But I can tell you that reaching out for support early is one of the best things you can do so kudos for that. Having a support system of people who truly understand what you are going through is so important. Even if it is just online. So many of your words ring true for me too. \u201cI do not want to lose my mommy\u201d fuck it kills me thinking about life without her. As she declines it keeps getting closer and closer\u2026 and it hurts so so much. I cannot lie to you and say it will get better because it will not. But you will learn to survive and adapt. You will learn to cherish the time you do have your precious mom and how important it is to make her proud and tell her you love her every chance you get. \n\nPlease message me any time and we can cry together. Sending love Please let me know of that information once you get it Thanks for the kind words, I appreciate it. I am uncomfortable with PMs and my mom would probably never let me on the internet again if she caught me messaging an adult but I appreciate the offer, I hope things are well for you. My anxiety is making things suck right now more than anything. My anxiety causes me to have small little muscle twitches and also causes me to rock in my seat and move my foot around and now I am constantly overeacting to it and worry that they are symptoms lol. I really hope that there is some sort of cure or treatment before she becomes miserably bad. I do believe my granny enjoys life to a certain extent and is living better than most with her condition but you can tell that it brings her down a lot and I do not want my mom to end up that way. She is only 41. Her granny has the disease and is in her 80's but she has the mental and physical abilities on an infant. I do not want my mom to be that way. It is horrible to watch. I understand the fear very well. I was younger than you are when I learned about my mom's diagnosis, and back then I did not truly understand the magnitude of what was happening to her (I was only 8 years old.) As I got older, the panic started seeping in and I also felt very helpless and afraid. My mom was dying, and not getting better. But now that I am older, I feel like I can see things more clearly. Because I know what it is like to lose a parent struggling with HD. \n\nI want you to not give up hope. Things may seem bleak, but you never know what kind of medical advances could be made in the next several years. Also, when you worry and panic over something you cannot control, all you are doing is suffering twice. The best thing you can do right now is take a deep breath, and start making memories with your mom. Go to the grocery store with her. Sit down and watch a movie. Go on a walk. Talk to her. Let her know that you love her, and support her. Take pictures and videos with her... Trust me you will want those.\n\nAnd while you are doing this, do not forget to breathe. And remember to also take care of yourself. (Hi, it is me from your more recent post about anxiety over twitches and such. Here is the comment I ran out of time to send)\n\nI am so sorry you are having to face this at such a young age. My heart breaks for you. I wish I could give you a hug (I certainly could use one myself). You have every right to feel angry, because you are right: it is profoundly unfair. \n\nI am afraid I do not have much in the way of advice to offer, as I found out only 3 weeks ago that my husband has HD, and we are both still reeling from the shock. He is 30 and his symptoms seem to have already begun. I have been filled with despair ever since, and am often completely livid at how unfair this is. I can say with 100% honesty that out of everyone I have ever known or even met in my 34 years of life, my husband is the one who is the least-deserving of this fate BY FAR. He is, without a single doubt in my mind, the best person I will ever know. He has dedicated so much of his time and energy to helping others and trying to make a positive impact on the world, and he has already managed to succeed in many ways, and at such a young age. Describing the things he is done to help others would fill an entire novel, so I will just leave it at that. \n\nSo anyway, I am living through a similar nightmare myself right now, so I am not a good candidate to give advice on ways to help you cope with this horrible turn of events. But perhaps it will help a little to know that you are not alone in your fear and your grief. My husband and I, our families and friends, and countless other folks in this community are all grieving alongside you, and hoping for science to save the day. I have just begun my journey to coping with my loved one\u2019s HD, and I have already come across so many organizations, support groups, doctors, therapists, and more who are ALL working tirelessly to help people like us get through this. Heck, last night, I came across not one, but **several** podcasts that are dedicated to HD news and research. Having the support of such a large and passionate community is **SO** important to successfully navigating through the hardships of life, and I can already tell this particular community is just overflowing with wonderful people who care deeply\u2014many of whom are dedicating their entire lives to improving the lives of people with HD and/or finding a cure.\n\nAnd for what it is worth\u2026 I happen to believe there will be a cure in time for you (if you turn out to be positive for the gene). I will not pretend that I am knowledgeable in genetics, neuroscience, biology, pathology, pharmacology, etc., because I am certainly not. **However,** my husband happens to be very knowledgeable in most of those areas, so I believe in what he says about the matter. He is not sure if there will be a cure developed in time for himself (it mostly depends on how fast his disease progresses), but he is very optimistic that anyone under a certain age (he estimates around adult age) will see a cure before their symptoms begin. He also believes there will more than likely be a treatment to slow down the disease\u2019s progression before it is too late for him. Based on what you have revealed here, there is a very good chance that will also apply to your mom.\n\nSo the only advice I have for you is to hold onto hope, and take it one day at a time. Let yourself grieve, but also think about ways to prioritize time with your mom in the near future. Focus on creating new memories with her and making the most out of your experiences together. The only silver lining I have been able to come up in the face of this nightmare is the way it has forced me to get my priorities straight and focus on what is truly important in life. I am beginning to realize that so many of my problems from before the diagnosis were trivial, and worrying about them was mostly a waste of my time and energy. As horrible as this experience has already been so far, I think it will also give me insight that other people often do not have. Before the news of my husband\u2019s HD, I was utterly lost in life because I felt I had no purpose. I have suffered from depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and other serious mental health problems for several years. But now, my purpose is suddenly very clear to me\u2014I need to be the best partner I can possibly be in the years to come. I need to make every moment with my husband count, to support him and help him find joy in life. And when the time comes, I will need to take care of him to the best of my abilities, and give him the nurturing he deserves. It sucks that it took the prospect of such a terrifying fate to make me realize all of this, but that is life, I guess. It is cliche, but we have no choice but to play the cards we are dealt.\n\nAs for the the anger and the \u201cice pick\u201d to your brain feelings (and what a great way to describe it!), I will describe what I have used as an outlet to release my fury and despair over my husband\u2019s diagnosis when I am just completely overwhelmed by those feelings: I go to our guest bedroom, close the door, and just take everything out on the bed and pillows (I do not do it in my bedroom because my pets always hang out in there and I do not want to frighten them). I just start punching and kicking until I cannot anymore. Since the bed and pillows are soft, I can wail on them as hard as possible without hurting myself (other than pulling a muscle or two because I am old and out of shape, haha). I also scream into a pillow as loud as I can muster\u2014the pillow muffles it extremely well, so I can scream my lungs out without alarming my husband or pets. It is kind of crazy how much better I tend to feel after doing this. These feelings of fury I have been experiencing ever since learning about HD are completely new to me\u2026 I have just never been an angry person at all. So when that anger and frustration overwhelms me and my body itches to punch a wall, I have to release it somewhere or the rage will become pent-up and manifest in much less healthy ways. \n\nThis is just a suggestion, of course\u2026. that is just what seems to work well for me, and I realize that you may need a different outlet to release your emotions. Please feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to one-on-one. I have been desperate to talk to someone about this stuff ever since my husband\u2019s test results came back, but he has forbidden me from speaking to anyone we know about it because he does not want our families and friends to look at him or treat him differently. I totally understand his reasoning, but it is taken a large toll on me to respect his wishes because I personally find catharsis in talking to others about my struggles. Keeping it all inside makes me feel like it is slowly eating away at me. So\ntalking to strangers on the internet has to be enough, at least for now. We will be at neurologist on Monday and I will let you know. Wow not a good way to find out and so sorry your now having to deal with all the emotions that come with it. Do you live with your mom? Hi, I am a bit late but was there any hopeful information? Hey there. Well, it turns out that my wife is no longer in the category of patients who could benefit from experimental medicine, so we decided not to go through the process. As a result we did not learn too much about it. She is been symptomatic for 15 - 20 years, and we are really more interested in keeping her comfortable at this point.", "Advice for dealing with belligerent Huntingtons patients? My uncle has Huntingtons, and he seems to have the type that has extreme denial and belligerence (he throws furniture across the room). My aunt had him taken by police to the hospital, and he is currently in the psych ward. My aunt just went to see a lawyer for the first time last week. I would love to learn more to support her. Does anyone have any experience/tips/resources for gaining guardianship/placing in a nursing home/dealing with assets?  Your going to need power of attorney too handle his business and to speak for him. Ugh, I am so sorry. My dad had those sorts of symptoms too. It was terrible until he was medicated, and even then it was a serious issue. It is great that you want to support your aunt. I imagine that she really needs it. When I was taking care of my dad, I wished I had had people to do legwork for me (like finding places and calling places and what not). Maybe you could offer to do that? \n\nIf you are in the US, I would reach out to an HD Center through the HDSA. It is hard to find a neurologist / psychiatrist who has seen HD patients before, and the right combo of meds can make a huge difference. HD Centers have physicians that work with and advise local doctors on the drugs that typically work best. I imagine your uncle will need anti-psychotics and anti-anxiety meds, so, he will definitely need a local psychiatrist. For assets, you need an elder care lawyer who does estate planning lawyer. Really, it is worth the investment. The HD Center staff should also know of other resources in your area. \n\nAs for nursing homes, you should look for HD specific nursing homes. I cannot recommend this more. My single biggest regret was that I assumed there were no HD specific places, so I just picked a nice assisted living facility. It did not work out, and my dad was in and out of psych wards until a social worker found a nursing home with an HD wing and got him a bed. It was a godsend. He was so much happier and more comfortable there, and they were able to manage his outbursts so well. It gave us our dad back for a couple months. If there are no HD units around, then definitely be sure to look for a nursing home that has a psychiatric nurse. That will mean that if your uncle needs a med change that it can happen in house instead of needing to happen in a psych ward.  Thanks for your reply! I am sorry you had to deal with all of it with your dad - it is just so horrible to watch. Unfortunately my uncle has been refusing all medication, so the goal is to get him placed in a nursing home ASAP because he is become a danger to my aunt's safety (getting him to the hospital took 3 cops to subdue him) I think that we have been focusing on places with Alzheimer's wings, as we were told that they usually take HD patients. Is there that significant of a difference in nursing homes that have HD units?\n I am sorry, I should have been more clear. My dad also refused medication for years, since he \"did not have HD\" and there was \"nothing they could do anyway\". We only got him on meds when his chorea got too bad for him to ignore I think. Also, the meds helped him walk in the beginning, so we bribed him with the promise of that. \n\nI am totally guessing here but I imagine that nursing homes may not accept him if he is not medicated. If he is a danger to your aunt, he could be a danger to their employees, too. My dad got kicked out of his assisted living facility for being belligerent and he was medicated. Hopefully the psych ward puts him on something and from there he might be easier to medicate. Contacting an HD Center really is a good option here, even if they are far away. They may be able to help coordinate with the psych ward to get him on the right medications, and / or help your aunt with ideas of how to get him on meds, since they deal with volatile people all the time.\n\nAs for nursing homes, just because they take HD patients does not mean they are experts in them. My mom had AD or another kind of dementia so I saw firsthand how different they can be. HD is pretty rare, and most doctors / nurses / aides in assisted living facilities (and psych wards) that I met had never treated a patient with HD before. AD patients can also be aggressive so a great AD nursing home might be great, but I really recommend at least looking to see if there is an HD unit anywhere within an hour or two. HD patients have different needs and my dad did a lot better when those needs were addressed by experts. For instance, they had better wheelchairs, chairs, and beds for helping to contain the chorea. Their psychiatrists hit the right medication combo for my dad that had eluded all other doctors. Their aides were better at treating HD patients like they were normal because they WERE normal in that unit. They were also better at handling outbursts and while my dad still had them, they were never the full scale meltdowns he had at other places. My dad was a sullen, taciturn, ball of anxiety that was prone to throwing coffee cups at aides and undressing in the hallway before he went into that unit. Within a couple months he would laugh and joke and tell us how grateful he was to be alive, just like how he was before he got sick.\n\nAnd, the unit also knew when it was time. When my dad was having a lot of trouble swallowing, it was way more difficult than I thought it would be, since it was not like I did not know where this was leading. The nurses on the unit knew exactly what we should do (hospice, no feeding tube), when it would happen, what it would look like, and so they were able to support us much better than I think another nursing home would have. HD units are not exactly common (there were only 2 options anywhere near us and I live in a major metropolitan area) but I really cannot recommend more at least looking around. I wish I had gotten my dad into one years earlier. I think it would have improved everyone is quality of life significantly.  He needs medication.  An HDSA social worker in your area might have a lead on a specialist he might see.  BUT I cannot recommend this enough, hit up an HD support group.  \n\nI hope you can show up and listen to people's stories.  They have such wisdom to share.  I mean like support, yes, but also tactics.  Strategies for dealing with difficult mindset, and denial.   Put up your hand and ask if anyone has any experience or advice.   Thanks for responding! My aunt already goes to an HDSA support group; however, no one in the group has experienced the denial/combativeness. I may try to find one myself to see if I have a different experience. Thank you! I just looked for HD units - the closest one is 300 miles away, so definitely not an option, unfortunately. I am hoping we will find some way to get him medicated....previous attempts lead me to not being incredibly hopeful. That is astonishing.  \nGood for them though.  If you do not have to fight with someone about meds, probably makes things a bit easier. That is really unfortunate. My dad ended up at one an hour away and while it was difficult, it was worth it. 300 miles is a different story. I hope so too. You might be able to call them and see if they know of any places close by that might not have HD wings but have had HD patients. \n\nMy dad was impossible for years, so I really empathize with the medication issues. He was an emotional and physical danger to others. At some point I basically railroaded over him and refused to accept his refusal and got him on meds. But, that was only possible after literally years of arguing about it and when he was less physically able to lash out. It also helped that he and I were very close. I recall psych wards being a last-ditch option to get him medicated, so maybe you uncle will be started on something there? Your aunt might also want to talk to the social workers at HD Centers and also the social workers at the psych ward; if you uncle still refuses meds post-psych ward, they may have some good ideas from prior patients on how to get him on something.

Currently, I always forget things like in a split second and would forget about it. I would be doing bad in school if it were not for my friends.

See a doctor and get out of this sub ffs Where are the fucking mods on this sub man?? How many times can this happen? You do not have Huntington's disease. If the gene did somehow expand, it would not expand to the point where you would be developing symptoms at 17. With all due respect, please go see a doctor, as this sub serious for those with HD. JHD usually starts much earlier than 17. I understand your concern, but this is most likely something else. Your best option is to bring up these concerns with your doctor, it could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency or something more serious, but again most likely not HD.

I have done a lot of google searching but have just found support groups, all of them virtual, and I am not sure that would go well for them. Any help would be greatly appreciated. They live in the Baltimore area if that helps.", "I need assurance I have been passively doing family research on Ancestry and unfortunately have to find people who passed from HD to know for certain they are my immediate family on my mom's side. I have confirmed HD tracing down from my 3rd-great-grand father. He was 44 when he passed. 2nd-GG-father was 42, great-grandma was 35, grandma was 36, and an uncle was 22 when he passed. I believe my family has juvenile HD since they all passed so young (my grandma and uncle showed early signs in their teen years).\n\nMy grandma had 3 children, one of which endured HD. My mom and uncle are in their 40's ... no signs of HD. My mom had 5 children and we are all ages 21 to 30. We have not shown HD signs too.\n\nIt looks like my mom and siblings are in the clear ... but the best way to know is to take a genetic test. Even though it looks like my family had juvenile HD, is there a possibility of showing HD symptoms later in life? What do you all think? Cannot say for sure, but I would think, that with what you describe above, your Mom does not have the gene and neither do you or your siblings. Sure there is a possibility, but if she has not yet shown any symptoms that is a very good sign that you may be in the clear. Seconding this. Your mom has outlived all prior generations that were afflicted with HD. I would say the odds are pretty high that she is not a carrier if she is not symptomatic yet, therefore neither you nor your siblings are carriers.\n\nOf course, you should get tested to know for sure. My family member got diagnosed in her 50s. I would not rule anything out unfortunately. First - I am not a doctor, nor would I consider myself an expert.  Please do not take anything here as professional advice.  I am a caregiver for a spouse with HD, and what I write below is what I have been able to put together over the years of research I have done in that role.\n\nI would agree with most, that chances are good that your Mother does not carry the gene as she has outlived previous generations, but more importantly has not shown symptoms at the same onset age range as previous generations.\n\nThat said, the genetic test is the only way to know for sure.  More pointedly if your mother were to be tested negative, you would then know that you and your siblings are all in the clear as HD is not recessive (cannot skip a generation).  If you Mother is unwilling to be tested, the only other alternative is to be tested yourself.  If you are interested in starting that process, I can point you to a couple resources that will walk you through the process, but that is a big decision on it is own - only you can decide if you want to be tested or not.  I would highly recommend consulting with a qualified professional if that is the direction you want to go.\n\nThere is a loose correlation between age of onset and the CAG repeat value (which is what they look for in the genetic test).  The higher the number, the earlier onset is the generalization.  Typically when the gene is passed from the maternal side (mother to child) the CAG repeat value stays fairly constant.  That is to say that if a mother has a count of 50, and passes the gene to a child, that child will have a repeat of approximately 50 (and therefore we could correlate that age of onset would be fairly consistent with that of the mother).  When the gene is passed from the paternal side, there is a higher chance the CAG will increase from generation to generation.  Example - a father has a CAG of 40, and passes the gene to a child, the child will have a repeat higher than 40, in some cases 8 to 10 (or more) higher.  These are very general statements, and just a guideline, as I do not know that anyone has figured out the exact science behind this.\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is very few people, if any, die from Huntington's.  Deaths are mostly attributed to the side-effects/symptoms.  This is also a very general statement.  Here is an example - one of the symptoms of Huntington's is Chorea (random movements).  Chorea is often (but not always) one of the earlier symptoms to show up after onset.  Random body movements and driving do not mix, so easy to say that someone with \"early\" signs of Huntington's could die in a car accident.  So as your doing research keep in mind the age of death does not directly correlate to the course of the disease in each generation - some could have passed at or near onset due to something other than disease progression, so you cannot \"guess\" onset based on age of death.\n\nEqually, sometimes the early symptoms to present in Huntington's are more subtle.  Slight memory issues, emotional abnormalities (irritability, etc).  Some patients do not develop the more notable symptoms until later in the disease progression.  That said, even though your mother has not been diagnosed, and has not shown the \"typical\" onset symptoms, she could have some of the lesser symptoms without really realizing it.  \n\nI do not say any of this for any reason other than to justify the need for a genetic test to be absolutely sure.  There are just too many variables to be comfortable with a guess.\n\nThis is a link to the HDSA guidelines for Genetic Testing.  It does a better job explaining some of what I have described here, as well as lays out guidelines for who should be tested and when.\n\n(\n\nI hope some of this helps, and wish you the best of luck in your journey.", "Joe Smith, pro baseball player, is shining a spotlight on HD with his foundation ", "What is you are CAG count and how has it affected you?

My uncle was diagnosed at 70, and my aunt was also diagnosed around 70. Mom does not want to get tested, so far no symptoms at 61. Because of this, I am unclear on whether getting tested myself is crucial enough to impact her life (I am 31). \n\nThe reason I am posting is because I have struggled my whole life with depression and anxiety (since late childhood), and it has taken me a long long time to process and accept the history of verbal/emotional abuse I experienced growing up, and the impact on me of substance abuse &amp; mental illness both in my immediate family and among my mother\u2019s family of origin (as it turns out, all of my relatives who have been diagnosed with HD). \n\nWhen I first learned about HD through my grandma\u2019s diagnosis, it was explained to me as only motor and cognitive impairment (nothing psychiatric or to do with mental health). I am struggling to understand if my own mental  health issues are themselves symptoms that I have HD. Does anyone have any insight into intergenerational patterns of mental illness in HD families? I am really really scared and overwhelmed. I have been on a journey of accepting my struggles as a result of my upbringing and not \u201cmy fault,\u201d and this information about HD and mental health is really challenging the stability I have found. Thanks for reading. \n\nTl; dr: Mom may have HD (is untested and no symptoms yet), and mental health issues are very prominent in my HD family. I have a lifelong history of depression and anxiety, partially due to abusive family system. Are my issues symptoms of HD in myself? My 2 great uncle had HD and spent the last 15 years of his life in mental hospital dieing in 1952. There is a connection to mental health. If worried get tested and maybe do not tell mom if positive. My family also seems to get signs later in 60s for my mom and several of grandmother's first cousins. Since am not having kids and it probably coming in 60s I have not tested. Also look into treatment for mental issues even if its not HD related. Thank you for this, I really appreciate it! I am looking into getting tested myself, and I am also working on treatment for mental health issues separate from HD. Thanks again, and my best wishes to you. There is a connection to mental health, however, families with Huntingtons in their line have high rates of depression and anxiety regardless of if they are the HD+ person. It is not a sign that you have it.\n\nI tested positive a few years ago, and have been much better for not living in a cloud of fear and uncertainty. So I think testing is a good thing. Thank you for this perspective, and for the reassurance. What you say makes a lot of sense. I am glad that you have been able to find some peace. I know I have roughly ten good years left to make the best of. I know how to protect my family and kids from it(IVF twins with gene test before getting pregnant). I have time to make plans to make the end easier on myself and my family. I have a really good therapist.\n\nSome days suck. Most of the time it is background noise. That sounds to me like the best and bravest way to move forward and adapt to life, and I admire it (despite knowing it must be tough on those sucky days). \n\nI think my problem at the moment is that I cannot allow myself to stop worrying about the fact that it is not *impossible* that I could get an early onset. I have just gotten out of a pretty gnarly long-term depression &amp; set of unrelated bad life circumstances, and it feels devastating to keep worrying, and know that there is no certainty. I am working on this in therapy, and I am hoping that will help me get to a place where, if I decide to test, I can accept my HD lot in life and keep living as best I can. I know because that was how I felt before I got my test. I hope you find peace. Whether that is with knowing or not, it does not matter.

If you ever plan to have kids. That was the only reason I got tested. My mother was taken from us from Huntington's and I could not pass that along to my kids. Luckily I was negative or my kids may not exist. I just got tested and am waiting for results. I knew it made sense for me because I am not the type to live in the positive side of the 50/50 anyway (I will live as if I have it if I do not know) and I want to start a family and will not pass it on to my children. But, my brother is capable of living more optimistically and is not planning to have children, so it does not make sense to him. I think the pros and cons are very personal and specific to the individual.\n\nFor me, the benefits are:\n\n1.) HD-free children, through PGD IVF if need be\n2.) Financial and career planning\n3.) Participating in research and clinical trials, if positive\n4.) Not wondering I tested positive, but have been presymptompatic for 12 years, and hopefully many more. I tested because my family kept it a secret until I was 18 and I needed to know because knowledge is power. I have relatives who did not handle their diagnosis well, so I wanted to live as many years as I can to the fullest before my symptoms start! I have a sister who was diagnosed with MS at 30, so I have the mindset that everyone have their own personal struggles and at least I know mine in advance so I can plan.\n\nI thought it was better than symptom chasing and playing the \"what if\" game. A few months after I tested I got out of the relationship I was in because I realized that he was not the right one for me. I finished up my 1st university degree and decided to pursue my 2nd degree so I could do what I am passionate about for work.\n\nI am currently married to my high school crush and we are expecting our first child in December. Some people have their opinions on things I should and should not do because of the diagnosis, so they can either be a supportive part of my life or not be part of it (ie. Step mother telling me I was selfish for wanting to have children). Testing is hard and it can take a big toll on your self worth, especially if you do not have the right support system, but I think it was worth it for me. There are a lot of research opportunities and clinical trials available for HD. Knowing your status also allows you to plan for the future (family, career, long term care, etc). It is a deeply personal choice but getting the opportunity to participate in potentially life-changing clinical trials is a silver lining. For me, I think knowing for certain would crush me. So I prepare myself financially for the future for my family and I, I live life to the fullest and if it does not come when I am older.. that will be a nice surprise. But know with certainty that I am positive, would pretty much destroy me.. I guess I do not want to kill that light of hope. \n\nThe down side to that is the symptom chasing that can happen. I get it, I am in the same dillemma as you are.  You are not alone in this! \n\nI am not even 20 yet ( I will be in 2 months or so), and I tell myself: what is the point of knowing I have it or not so early on? I do not want to have kids this young, and the only thing it will do when I test positive is destroy my mental health and my future....\nI have heard of people doing a test at a young age, not even thinking about their mental health etc, and I do not want to do that to myself. \nMy dad has it, my aunt has it, my grandma had it, a few of my dads nieces and nephews had/have it, and my uncle is about to get tested. I feel like there is not much hope to begin with, so why kill the little hope I have that I do not have it so early on?\n\nI am also scared that I might be paraniod when I grow older, especially if my siblings get tested, no matter the outcome. If they test negative, I have to have it, and if they test positive, well, then I should have it too, right? \n\nGetting tested is such a sensitive subject, and I am not so sure anymore what to think about it.....

She is been showing mostly cognitive symptoms for the last 6 or 7 years now. She has been showing physical symptoms for maybe the last 3 or 4. \n\nI feel selfish for even saying this and I know there are families out there that have it worse than mine. But I keep asking myself what my family did where I cannot have a normal family. I cannot even talk to my mother because I do not know what is going to set her off. It can really be anything. I feel like I do not really have a relationship with her because I just cannot talk to her. \n\nHonestly I get jealous when I see normal families. Or families where anyone has a great relationship with their mother. I know it is selfish and I hate my self for thinking it but I always wonder what in the hell we or even I did to have to go through this hell. I selfishly want my mom back from when I was a kid and I could talk to her about anything. It kills me even more because she will not get help. She is in complete denial about anything and everything to do with the disease. She goes to her doctor but lies to his face about it and tells him everything is fine. If they try to prescribe her meds she will not take them or she takes them for a few months then stops. I am just lost. I am getting married in 2 1/2 years and I do not even know if my own mother is going to be alive for it or cognizant enough to know what is going on. And I hate myself for thinking it, but I keep wondering what we did to deserve this. Similar situation, but with my dad. \nIt is sucks. You will feel guilty and selfish probably forever, but it is normal. \nRecently my dad's personality has changed and he is becoming angry and argumentative, which is not like him. I know this is his decline. \nI am jealous of people who do not have this horrible disease to deal with.\nI am jealous of my own family members who have the option to look the other way in regards to my dad. Unfortunately, I am his caretaker, so I do not have that option.\nYou are allowed to be angry, but it may be beneficial to you and your mother for you to seek out someone that you can vent to without repercussion.\nI can be that person, if you need. The frustrated feeling is normal for us. Also, families dealing with HD have a really high hit rate for depression. If you are not already hooked up with a therapist you should find one. Wedding stress is not going to help. Hopefully your fiance is a help to you.\n\nAs an aside, I started planning my wedding hoping my dad couple go before he died. That was December. He died in February. It sucked. We got married in June. Realistically dad would not have been able to come anyway. He was to sick, and this way no one had to stay behind and watch him. \n\n\nI do not know what your mom's progression is like, but I would expect she will still be there in 2.5 years. But you should try and get medical power and go to her Dr appointments so she cannot lie to her Dr. Someone will need to eventually, and it is better if the transfer is while she can facilitate, I think. I would but unfortunately I live in another state and going to school full time so I cannot be there. My dad is trying his hardest but I know this is a strain on him too. Thank you for your kind words Similar, but my mom had issues beyond her HD such that my childhood was pretty low key abusive even before she was symptomatic, so I have no good times to look back to. We do not have much of a relationship at all now bc I realized I could not be her caretaker and take care of myself and she is alienated everyone else in her life. I feel for her, but even when she is relatively able to cope w others, I set her way off so I pay for her care and keep my distance.\n\nHang in there. It is a difficult situation and you must be compassionate w yourself. What you are feeling is perfectly normal in the HD world. A therapist/therapy will be extremely helpful to you. Only to vent and drain the tear ducts. My wife has alienated both of our grown at risk kids because of her symptoms. Resentment and the desire to have a normal family like others is normal but also impossible. The HD dragon has been unleashed and now everyone involved suffers the consequences. Try to keep the good memories on the surface. You are prolly thinking who has time for therapy. That is something mom may have helped you with prior to HD. You can do it at university probably for free. I am not there for my kids as much as I would like because of HD and my caregiver roll. It all sucks. I totally get the need for someone to talk to. I feel like that is why I am currently working on my clinical social work grad work. But your absolutely right, it is finding time in our crazy. One thing I am lucky with is having a fiance who is completely understanding and always there for me. And she completely understands the disease and the risks for me and still said yes.", "My wife mother is the only one in her family with HD. Wife pregnant and feeling scared. I am new to this sub. I met my beautiful wife when she was 30, she is now 35 with no symptoms but her mother passed because of HD at 65. They did not know what she had as she also had cancer and Lupus. My wife is the youngest of 4 kids who are all in their mid 40s and early 50s. Not one of them has displayed signs of HD and all of them have kids. What is weird is her mother is the only one in her family of like 10 siblings to have HD,  both her father and mother died in their 70s/80s of cancer. I think her CAG number was high 30s or low 40s. Doctors declared she was an extremely rare case. My wife is pregnant and does not want to get tested as we found this out after our pregnancy. Based on the research I have read, the lower CAG number of her mother is likely to be inherited to her (worst case scenario and my wife tests positive) since it is passed from mother to offspring, as opposed to being passed from father to offspring were odds are repeats would be higher. I feel afraid of losing my wife and damning my kid with this disease at no fault of his/her own.... I feel guilt. Any thoughts or opinions greatly appreciated. Thanks! Thanks for sharing that. My father is currently living with it and the symptoms are severe. I can relate with the whole deterioration thing as he is now a shell of himself to the point that I have a lot of anger and frustration when I spend time with him because who he is now is not even close to who he was and it kills me. I have a brother living at risk that does not want to get tested. The thought of him going through what my dad is currently would destroy me; but it is what it is and we spend time with each other and make the best out of everything. I say live your best life man. If your wife does have it, there is now hope. We are like 3-4 years away from spinal shots that can have her live a completely normal life. Clinical trials started that have made amazing break throughs; like the biggest in 20+ years. As for your children, I would not worry at all. By the time they get of age the medical field will have advanced so much that I would like to think this type of thing would be a non issue. God bless you and the fam, congrats on the baby and do whatever you want! The mind is powerful and can play tricks on you, but you seem to have it all under control. You guys got this! \n                                     -Joe Thanks man, I truly appreciate the time you took to respond to me. I am just finding all this out so I am still unaware of clinical trials like the spinal shots you mention. That is definitely good news. Can you elaborate a little? Like sources etc? Not that I am incredulous, but I am cautious. I have decided that my goal in life is to make my wife happy, irrelevant of how much time she has on this earth, she is 34, so be it a decade or hopefully more. Thank you again! I am 31 and 29weeks pregnant and it also runs in my family. We did not plan on the pregnancy so I am pretty upset, we are very sure my dad is Symptomatic now. He is going to get tested in Feb, once we get an answer about him, I am most likely going to get tested if he is positive.  I am getting tested purely so that I can try to get in on a study or something, this way if my kid winds up with it a least I can help out in some way finding a medication to help or a cure. I feel really guilty about it, and I am constantly questioning myself, my balance, my speech. It is really frustrating and sad. I am sorry your wife is going through the same. \n\n\n\n\nThey are doing a lot in terms of research now which is really incredible. I am really sorry to hear about your situation. I am feel I am becoming hyper vigilant of my wife. I look at her to make sure she does not have symptoms. It is frustrating. I hope everything turns out well, I am hopeful for an effective treatment. You think that will happen? And how old is your dad?  (  is a good site for all up to date stuff.  ( is a good site for all up to date stuff. Before I got tested, every time I tripped, took a wrong step or anything like that I would think the same. I would not worry overthinking any of that. Easier said than done though, because I thought how you thought. Maybe you are just clumsy :)! If it makes you feel better I took the wifey (who is huntingtons free as it runs on my side) on a hike. Not that many hills, inclines minimal. She rolled her ankle twice and promised to never go on a hike with me ever again. She cannot even walk without getting hurt LOL, and this was a girl who played soccer for 15 years. \n\nCONGRATS ON THE BABY! Thanks bro. I am happy you are HD free. Like I said, my wife is 35. So worst case scenario, I have a at lease a few more decades with her. I am praying for an effective treatment, and based on the research, it seems they are close, very close. My dad is 63, we realize now he is actually been symptomatic for a while. He has a lot of PTSD, which lead to drinking and stuff so for a while we just thought that was it.  I think there will be a cure or at least something to slow it down coming out soon! I hope so. Yea I try to keep it out of my head, but it is always kind of lingering in my mind. Thanks !! \ud83e\udd70\u2764\ufe0f Hoping neither of us have it at all, and a cure is on the way!! Your go-to source about HD should be hdbuzz.net\n\nIt is really awesome and easy to understand. Dang. Ok. I realize I was kind of misinformed. About this disease. I thought it was something that once symptoms hit you you, it was over within months, like cancer. I did not know it was something that a slow and gradual decline. And yes, I am hopeful for a cure. Irrelevant of whether my wife has it or not. No one should go through this. It is on a scale really so it can effect people in many different ways. One of my cousins is in a nursing home in his 40s already, and his brother also has it just not as severe and he is pretty normal. So that can be confusing. Just looked over some papers on the pathway for a cure/treatment for Huntington\u2019s and wow.... did not know we were so close. It is exciting. Very happy with this news and great reliable source. Thank you! That is crazy. My wife\u2019s mother was fairly well considering her situation and independent and did not deteriorate until her last years. She was fairly lucid and passed away in her mid or late 60s. Her CAG number I believe was pretty low like mid or high 30s Yea it really all depends on that number. It is a crazy disease. It is... my wife\u2019s moms numbers were low. So I will just hope for the best and pray . Thank you a lot for responding. I really appreciate it. You guys made me feel better and become more confident that even in a worst case scenario, there is really big hope for effective treatment. I am in the same boat, my mothers uncle has HD and likely his son also has it. But no one else in the family, none of his brothers &amp; sisters have it and we have a big family, my grandma had nine kids including my mother and none of them have HD, I am pretty sure my great grandma had about ten kids as well and his the only one with HD. It started off with a breathing complication.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that my grandma's children are all over 50, and all have children. Out of all the grandchildren my grandmother has I think I am the youngest being 23. And my grandma's brother is the only one with HD, we are all terrible for staying in touch (mental health is a big runner in our family. Schizophrenia, autism &amp; depression runs rife especially in the women) last I heard his son has not been confirmed whether or not he has it, but he has a 50% chance due to his father having it. I am considering having a test on own DNA. I was in almost the same exact position as you. I found out my MIL had it two weeks before I gave birth to our first child. Two months later my husband got tested and found out he had it. My world has been flipped upside down. My MIL did not show typical symptoms either. She did not get diagnosed until her mid 50's.  \n\nThe best advice I can give you is to store the cord blood of the child. It was about $3,000 for us (family chipped in). But there is promising developments with cord blood, stem cells, and Huntington's. It gave us hope as far as treatment and recovery goes. Now our daughter is 6 months old. She is our world and I am so happy to have her here. \n\nAnother thing is to treasure every moment. Put your phone down and be with your people. Savor moments. Spend less time cleaning the house and more time talking and playing games. Absorb every moment you can with your loved ones.\n\nAlso, people with Huntington's can still live a valuable and full life. My husband is 31 and I am so happy he exists, even if it is not for as long as I would have liked. Our genetic counselor said that if our daughter has it there will be meds or a cure out there to treat her before she would even show symptoms. Apparently the meds are looking very promising. \n\nTrust me when I say I know how you feel. The ideal of having a family with someone that has this disease is traumatic. The ideal of picking up the pieces after they are gone takes my breath away. But we cannot help who we love. We just have to enjoy them for as long as possible while they are here with us. \n\nI am sorry for what you are going through. Best of luck.", "Why do my friends try and convince me that I will not get HD? \u201cYou may never show symptoms\u201d I tested positive in my twenties. No one tells you how to deal with knowing you have a terminal illness but one thing that is remained consistent is the number of people who try and wish away the disease. \n\nMy former life coach said, \u201cyou may get hit by a bus\u201d until I told her what she failed to understand is that I am the bus. \n\nI do not feel negative about Huntington\u2019s all the time. I am not depressed. Yes it frames major life decisions but it is not helpful when close friends and family will not dare to acknowledge it could affect you. \n\nTo be an adult is to take responsibility for your actions both now and in the future. I need to plan for my 401k with or without HD. I need to plan my what kind of career I will have with or without being disabled. \n\nHow many times have you heard these statements??\n\n- \u201cI thought you got tested and it came out clear\u201d\n-  \u201cI thought you inherited the gene but it would stay dormant\u201d\n- \u201cYou may never show symptoms\u201d\n- \u201cYou cannot predict what will happen\u201d\n- \u201cScience will cure you. I am convinced.\u201d\n- \u201cI do not think you will get it. You are not the type.\u201d\n- \u201cYou should get tested it again. I do not think you have it.\u201d\n- \u201cYou should not plan your life around a disease.\u201d\n\nPlease stop telling me that I am wrong about my diagnosis. Yup and a few others odd statements.  The ones I hear are in reference to my step-daughter.   I generic \"I hope she gets better soon\" is the most common. \n\n \n\nWith so many of these comments, I think we all on here know, come from general lack of knowledge and understanding of how the disease actually works and how it is diagnosed.  They are so used to other genetic conditions like diabetes or certain heart conditions where a healthy lifestyle can actually mean you get to avoid symptoms or at least reduce symptoms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ones who play doctor and say how they think you should treat it or whether or not they really think you have it are just rude.  Obviously someone diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder will have a specialist who knows way more than these people. So those comments come from a place of frustrating and sometimes willful ignorance.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do understand why people want to tell you to not plan your life around a disease and with small decisions that is fine... great even.  But you are exactly right, it needs to make you think differently about your career and long term goals because it is going to affect them.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will slightly... only slightly agree with the cure thing.  The studies on ASOs and CRISPR technology is looking really promising.  If you are not showing symptoms yet, you may see much more highly effective treatment or even a \"cure\" in your lifetime.  My daughter's neurologist and I chat about the studies each visit.  He is team CRISPR and I am team ASO (mostly because I think it will be ready sooner and therefore able to treat my daughter sooner).  We do not know yet if reversal of symptoms will be involved (probably not a lot for patients who have significant damage).  So I do think \"Science will cure it.\"  I used to take these comments on face value. No one wants you to lose hope or limit what you can achieve. I believe the official term is \u2018toxic positivity\u2019. I am thankful my close friends know better than to try to invalidate my experience. I am learning how to speak up so I can educate others about how certain responses can be unhelpful even if they are well intentioned but it grinds my nerves sometimes.\n\nI also believe that science will cure us. The biggest question is when. If you plan your life around being cured you could miss out on prioritizing important experience earlier on in life and live in regret. Until we know I need to plan for both eventualities. \n\nHD has motivated me to take chances that have paid off in a big way. When you have a short timeline you have to hustle. In other ways it is limited some life choices. This is natural for all of us. We have to weigh each decision personally. \n\nI hope your daughter gets early access to trials that can give her a meaningful future. I was reluctant to sign up for the Generation HD Roche trial because I am not yet symptomatic and I know other people need it so much more. ASO seems like it will reduce the disease progression but not stop it entirely. They ran into problems with the spinal delivery method which paused the trial. I think CRISPR might be closer to a cure. They are still working out how it behaves and I am not aware of any human trials. I just want to know if ASO means I will be able to continue to do my day job or if I should plan for a longer less severe disability. Being gene positive is a lot to handle for sure. Keep your spirits up I know it is hard!! Plan for the worst, hope for the best. I think for a lot of people, it is really hard to understand something like this. They care about you, and do not want your fate to be your fate. It is true, you could get hit by a bus tomorrow, choke on a grape next week, slip on the ice next month, etc, but people just do not know what it is like to have more of an idea of how you will go that others do. I do not think it should keep you from living your life, but you are allowed to feel the way you do. Some of it might be ignorance, some of it is just wishful thinking. Spot on, I have heard everyone of those. It is frustrating, most days are good, but I always have this shadow of worry. I experienced exactly the same thing after my Mum\u2019s diagnosis and again after I tested positive. I think what others posts are saying is spot on, that people do not have enough experience to know what to say but want to say something, but it is still frustrating. It feels like people want you to look on the bright side, but sometimes there just is not one.\n\n- I had family members that have just ignored it completely and have never said a word\n\n- a friend started sending me different superfoods and supplements to try to get my Mum to eat\n\n- a friend compared my son\u2019s risk of testing positive with his kids risk of having mental illness because his wife\u2019s family has some history of it\n\n- \u201cyou might get hit by a bus before then\u201d or \u201cit could be worse...somehow\u201d\n\n- my Dad of all people asked me if I would accepted my Mum\u2019s diagnosis yet *two days after I found out about it* and I went on a 20 minute rant about the implications for me and my son\n\nIt is all well meaning and coming from a good place, but it all just feels so tone deaf and can hurt to listen to. I am still undergoing the councilling but I had a friend make the comment about getting hit by a bus. The way I responded was \n\n\u2018You do not know that you will get hit by a bus. It is not 50/50 every time you leave the house\u2019\n\n\u2018You can do things to mitigate the risk of getting hit by a bus\u2019\n\nAnd\n\n\u2018Besides. How would you feel if getting hit by a bus in a few years was the BEST you could hope for if nothing worse took you out first?\u2019\n\nI have had some people not able to talk at all about it, or others being too hopeful, assuming I am doom and gloom for talking factually. It is hard. I have to be very clear I need to understand what choice I am making to find out. There is no sugarcoating it, and I do not want my grieving period minimised if it is not the result I want. \n\nThat is about it. It is rubbish. Sigh. \u201cLook on the bright side, you might get hit by a bus and die before symptoms start!\u201d\n\nYeah, thanks for that. :-| Thank you for putting this into words, so many times friends or family try to wish it away, say they are praying I do not have it, or say that \u201cwe are so close to a cure\u201d. I cannot depend on wishes or cures that may not actually work what I can depend on is my actions now and how they will help me in the future. YES. It is so frustrating because it minimises our plight\n\nMy own husband always says \u201cyou will not have it because you do not look like your dad\u201d or when my brother tested negative he said \u201che does not have it so neither will you\u201d \n\nIt is like... areeghhhhhh!!! Take a fricking science lesson, please. \ud83d\ude02 Let us not forget people frequently live to their 90\u2019s now. If you pass at eg 60, that is roughly 30 years you have missed out on, not counting what you consider as \u2018meaningful\u2019 years. It is completely ok to feel robbed. That being said I suppose you have to come out the other end, but I am not ready for that yet and that is ok. Yeah, exactly. 60 is not as old as it used to be...it is not even retirement age.\n\nMy grandpa just turned 99 and his dad lived to 102, so without treatment I will get symptoms around the halfway point of what could have been my natural life. I sincerely hope you and everyone else here are only ever mildly symptomatic, or there is a meaningful cure/treatment in our lifetimes. I wish I could give you all a big hug. \nI really hope I am all clear next week. At the moment I value that hope, but the permanent limbo will not help me manage my life and family planning. \nThanks for giving me an avenue for a good vent last night. It was really helpful. Next week! That is got to be weighing on you right now, rant all you want. Message me if you want to keep ranting, I am happy to listen and commiserate with you.\n\nI will tell you this, even with positive results I feel for me it is better to know. Good luck next week. This may sounds strange but THANK YOU! I needed to read this &amp; feel validated for a hot minute. \n\nI am so tired of hearing that shit too! I am 25 and only found out in November, it is fresh news! People trying to convince me \u201cI will be absolutely fine\u201d or \u201clooking back at this when I am 80.\u201d\n\nI needed to hear that last statement. Thank you. For me, it is just a horrifying prospect.  It is choking on a grape or getting hit by a bus slowly for YEARS.  That is the difference.  The agony of knowing the trajectory of loss while watching those you love suffer by watching.  It is really a horror movie.  It sure does take the wind out of your sails when it comes to thinking that you would do a better job than anyone facing a life challenge.  I was never particularly judgemental but I now see my hypothetical optimism as having been arrogant.  HOW did we all get here?\u2764\ufe0f", "Hey there friends! I have not posted in a while but I finally got accepted to a closed FB support group with a fairly large audience. \n\n\nFeeling bleh. Lately. Worrying about how grumpy I have been lately. Wondering if I am symptomatic or if I am just rightfully pissed off and annoyed at current life circumstances. \n\nAlso awaiting my genetic counseling to start.  Sitting here also worrying if these are nervous twitches or I am symptomatic. People who are in our position, its so difficult to dismiss even the slightest possible symptoms that are most likely just a product of our rightfully earned anxiety. I wish you the best of luck", "Ironic meme format? This is what I think when I see success kid because I have arm movement that looks just like this. ", "Early onset in family My grandmother passed away from Huntington's when she was in her mid 40s, with her daughter (my aunt) developing it when she was just 21, and dying when she was about 35. \n\nMy father was kind of a dead beat, and overdosed on heroin (on thanksgiving no less) when he was 39. Those who were in his life toward the end, said that he showed no signs of Huntington's. While he was never tested, he was at risk of having the disease, and if that is the case, I am as well. \n\nMy questions pertains to the early onset of my grandmother, and the extremely early onset of my aunt, would my father have been victim of the early onset as well if he had it? I know that the drug abuse could have sped up the onset, but I also know that women tend to get it earlier than men (although not necessarily 20 years earlier)\n\nI have such a pessimistic personality and I cannot stop fighting with myself about this disease. I have put off getting tested for a few years now (i am 25, M) but recently I have been freaking out about it. It is hard to say. My mother-in-law has it and hers looks so different from the rest of the family. Her mother, grandmother, and sister all got it and died from it by the time they were 50. However, my mother-in-law got diagnosed with it when she was 58. She is definitely an outlier. \n\nMy husband ended up deciding to take the test and he is gene positive with no symptoms. \n\nIt really seems like there is a typical pattern when it comes to the age of onset but there is always a chance that someone is like my mother-in-law and is so different. \n\nI realize this does not help you much. The good news is that they are making huge strides in medicine every day. We have hope that when my husband (31M) shows signs there will be something he can take to help. \n\nBest of luck. I have heard that presentation in offspring tends to follow the parent's presentation if you get it from your mother.  But it is not an absolute. \n\nHD took my grandfather and mother. I hace not been tested and I am ok with that for now. It sounds like getting tested might offer you some peace of mind? Peace of mind if it comes back negative. I do not want to begin to think of how I would react if I tested positive for it. Thank you I appreciate your insight. Yeah, that is the conundrum is not it. My brother got tested because he is the kind of person who wants all of the information. 41 CAG repeats. :( One sister got tested and she is clear. My other sister and I have not been tested. We have decided it will not help us until there is something that can really be done about it. Which, who knows, it may not be very long.\n\nIt is always there under the surface for me. I twitch and I wonder. I cannot come up with a simple word and I wonder. I get a nervous tic and I wonder. For now I have decided that the occasional wondering is better than possibly knowing I have it. My wife does not see symptoms in me. Neither does my brother's wife.\n\nWe each have to decide and it is a difficult decision. If you find that HD is taking up more of your attention than you would like, you might want to set up an appointment with a genetic counsellor. This is the kind of conversation they have with a lot of people. The more repeats, the earlier the onset of the disease. Usually if HD is passed from the mother\u2019s side you usually have the same or similar number of repeats as her. When it is passed from the father\u2019s side you either have the same or more repeats. So getting it from the father is usually considered to be worse if you have it at all. FWIW, learning that I am gene positive has been very liberating for me. At first it was very tough to know, but now (15 months later) I feel empowered with the information while I am still asymptomatic. There is no right answer. Do what is best for you. It took me 7 years from finding out I was at risk to work up the nerve to test.", "What can I do to slow my (22) mums (52) decline? My mum was diagnosed last year, is there anything we can do to slow it down?\n\nDiet, exercise, sleep more, medicine, anything like that? Unfortunately there is not a whole lot you can do. Our genetic counselor said that exercising, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, and stimulating the brain (games) could possibly help. \n\nOne recent doctor came out and said that smoking, drinking, and just not maintaining a healthy lifestyle can speed it up. \n\nI wish there was more we could do but I think that is our only option until something happens in the medical field. \n\nBest of luck Thank you \ud83d\udc95 No. Taking care of herself can make her more comfortable, meds can help with the symptoms. But nothing stops it and nothing slows it down -- yet. Look up intermittent fasting. Some promising research there. I would just focus on making the most of the time you have, I tried all the healthy stuff with my wife like no alcohol and giving up smoking but she hated it, she felt like she would rather live less with the things she liked than longer without them (not that any of them are proven) See my posts. I am not promising any Miracles but my wife\u2019s treatment is going well. Do not let her drink too much.", "What made you decide to get tested? Hi everyone,\n\nI recently discovered that I am at risk for HD. My father discovered he was positive for the gene a few months ago and my parents told me over Christmas vacation (merry Christmas right?). I was wondering what encouraged or motivated others to get tested and how testing impacted your lives. Is it always a good idea to get tested? \n\nThank you for any comments or advice, I am 25 currently and just a little scared about what the future will bring for me, my siblings and my dad.  My partner decided to get tested simply because the not knowing either way after being made aware of the possibility was effecting her mental state... When the results came back with a positive repeat score, she and i could move forwards and begin to process what it meant, even though it was the hardest news in the world to sit though and hear. I am sorry to hear about your father. Sadly I do not need to get tested to know if I test positive for the gene. Though I do plan on getting tested sometime in 2019 to see how many repeats I have. I know people have different perspectives on the whole idea of getting tested. Personally I would want to know everything, just so I could have a plan to how I would like to live my life before my age of onset. I am 19 and going through college, it is really hard trying to make important life decisions at a young age with the mentality of that I am going to start to deteriorate in my 30s. I would definitely talk to your parents. My mother has been very helpful with guiding me and supporting everything I do.  I would advise you to spend as much time as you can with your father, it is hard but you will be glad you did. Good luck with whatever you decide to do. Also do not let anyone pressure you into doing something like this, do what ever you want based on your own decisions. I already had a son when my father was diagnosed.  My personality is such that I would have had to get tested and known one way another, but I had to know if my son was at risk. Fortunately I tested negative, which mean my son was safe. I am meeting with the doctors for the first time on January 4th to start the testing process. I have known I am at risk for the last 7 years. I just want to know so that I can financially and emotionally prepare my loved ones for my loss of income and the requirement for understanding and care I may one day need. My dad has HD and unfortunately his early symptoms showed as aggression and he chose to self medicate with alcohol. I do not want to alienate my loved ones the same way he did before we all found out he was sick. I would rather people know I was sick than not know and think the worst about me.  I found out my grandmother had it when I was 10. My mother got tested when I was 18. I tested at 23 (as soon as I could afford to, it used to be expensive, not sure now). From the moment the genetic test was developed, I knew I would get tested. I am not the type to deal well with 20+ years of unnecessary uncertainty.  Thank you, currently I have only told my partner and it is just killing me inside. I just want to scream it at everyone right now. I think I may wait until I am financially capable of paying for the process but I do know that I will probably end up getting tested.  I am glad you are there for your partner. My partner has also been very supportive since I got the news of my at risk status. I hope that he will continue to be supportive if my test results are not what we are hoping for  Huntington's does not change who she is or what i love about her. It just makes our time together more valuable. I may be showing my ignorance now.. but as a British person the process here is obviously covered by the nhs.. does not American (i assume) insurance help cover these costs? I think if you want to be tested 'anonymously', you might to pay out of pocket in the US? That is how I remember it being when I was tested 8 years ago, but things might have changed since then.  I was 25 when my dad was diagnosed, with no known family history of HD, that was 9 years ago.\n\nI had recently married and I reasoned that getting tested did not affect whether or not I was positive, but it would give me the knowledge to be able to better inform any future decisions.\n\nI decided not to continue with a career in teaching and do something that I really wanted to do instead, I decided to pursue photography. This did not happen due to other things, like kids and a divorce, but I have had some success with it and I am happy with that.\n\nIt was hard finding out about it at first and at various points in between, but I do not think I could go that long not knowing. I totally get the 'ignorance is bliss' argument but it is not for me.  \n\n&amp;#x200B; For me it was about having the power to make choices based on the results. A positive result has been the most amazing gift and the worst curse. \n\n- I have taken every chance I can to fill my life with fun and adventure. \n- I have worked harder than others on my career which made me independent and successful.\n- I decided to end my life by the age of 40 and I grew comfortable feeling like I have met most of my dreams to die happy.\n- I closed off my mind from dreams about love or a family because I knew I would never be able to say goodbye.\n\nI committed to the decisions I made to have a say in my future but I have also had to live with those decisions. Now there is a potential cure I am doing everything I can to undo 10 years of programming. \n\nWhy do you want to get tested? This is exactly how it is been for me, too. \n\nI spent 7 years telling myself that I would never have a family and that I would find a way to commit assisted suicide if/when the time came that I was too incapacitated to do anything for myself. \n\nI got so used to the idea of dying young. \n\nAnd then, suddenly, we got the news this past January that the trial was successful and it felt like my whole world got flipped upside down *again*. \n\nI also met someone around that time and it was the first I let myself think about a future and maybe even a family. \n\nIt is definitely been so weird trying to re-program all of those thought processes. \n\nBut it is a good weird, I guess.

I am interested in getting myself tested, but kind of at a loss what to do.\n\nEverything I see says a referral from your primary, but my primary is a 45min drive one way. A lousy excuse, sure, but is there a certain type of doctor? Can I contact someone direct? You have to see your primary family doctor, he/she is the only one that can make a specialist appointment for you to talk to a team. You may be able to zoom/Skype with your doctor if it is to far out of the way for you. It depends on where you are. I was able to contact a neurology department at a teaching hospital directly and get tested anonymously at no cost because it was funded by their research grant. If you are located near a teaching hospital that does HD research, maybe try reaching out to them. I highly recommend that you think about why you want to get tested before you make that decision. Because my grandmother was positive. Because 7 of her 10 kids are already gone. Because I show a lot of the early indicators and have my own child I need to consider in the long term. You have a parent that has it, yes? Grandparent.\n\nOf her 10 children, 7 are dead. I do not have a reliable history and I do not have continued contact with that side of the family.\n\nAt 34, I have a few too many symptoms to disregard :/ I see. You will need to see your doctor first. They will refer you to another doctor. You will also likely have to meet with a genetic counselor before hand to make sure you understand what is at stake. \n\nYou mentioned you had a child. My advice would be to get life insurance and get as much in place as you can before you get tested. Once you have this on your medical record, getting affordable insurance will be forever out the door. It is one of the best things you can do to help the future of your family. I know it is not a fun topic but it might give you some piece of mind that they will have financial support if you are not longer around. \n\nI know some states allow for anonymous testing that do not involve any doctors and it will not show up on your medical record. You will have to pay out of pocket. I believe if you decide to go this route you do not need a referral. Right, but your parent, her child, do they have it?\n\nIf not, you do not have it. Got to ( to find a center of excellence near you. Call them and make an appointment. Whichever one of your parents who is the child of the grandma with HD will probably need to be involved too. Find a support group, if you like to. I am one of the few people on here that actually has HD, so take other\u2019s words with grains of salt. Some of them are very scared to get tested, which I think is cowardly. Idk. I have not seen or spoken to them in 20yrs... This is not true across all insurances in the USA. If you are self pay, you do not need a referral. I was on Medicaid in Seattle and did not need a referral either. My bad I am in Canada and that is how it happens up here: It would probably be way easier to make contact and perhaps find out your parent was negative than getting tested. i talked to my PCP and after asking me if i was SURE i wanted to know, he set me up to be referred to a neurologist Not sure why I am getting downvoted, but that is what I was getting at. If you have truly lost 7 of your aunts and uncles to this and your mom/dad is still alive, that bodes well for you that mom/dad is not a carrier because they would likely be gone as well. &gt;I am one of the few people on here that actually has HD, so take other\u2019s words with grains of salt. Some of them are very scared to get tested, which I think is cowardly.\n\nCan we please try not gatekeeping who can post in this subreddit, or calling people\u2019s extremely personal decisions cowardly? Nobody is posting here for fun, everyone is impacted by HD in some way and I think it is important to remember that.\n\nThe rest of your comment was quite helpful though. As someone who regular sees a neurologist and gets treatment for mid stage symptoms, my experience is more extensive than most people on here. I do think many people who do not get tested are cowards, I am allowed to state so. It is a huge weight off the shoulders and I will advocate for it every time. Your experience may be more extensive than many, but it is limited to your specific situation. \n\nCase in point, last week you and I both replied to someone is question about testing in Canada - I live and was tested in the same country and province as that person, you do not, and as a result your advice was not accurate or relevant to their situation.\n\nI just do not think it is helpful to call people cowards or imply that only someone with HD could have useful insight.  Personally, I tested anonymously about 8 years ago. I did not need a referral from my primary (as I was just out of college, I did not even have a primary doctor at that time). I contacted two hospitals that performed the test and based my decision on who could get me in sooner. Had to go to a few meetings with a team of doctors (therapist/neurologist/etc.) before I could go through with the test. It was a few months process. \nAs someone who is been in the doctors office to hear both a negative result (mine) and a positive result (my sibling), I highly recommend having a support person. I wish you the best of luck in your decision.", "My mom just told me we are both at risks for HD (please offer advice) Hey guys. I just got the news that I am at risk for Huntington\u2019s, and that my grandmother died from it. My mom has not been tested, and she is not sure she wants to, but I feel like I want to know. Do you guys have any advice on coping with this new knowledge or what I should do? I am a 24 y/o female btw, and I am truthfully very scared.  At risk does not mean shit. Get tested IF it matters to you. Start a GoFundMe me or find a research uni nearby if you need to offset the cost. 10y ago it was over 400usd and insurance will not help you in the US.  When my dad got the results from his test and confirmed his HD diagnosis, we finished the appointment and I took him home. I then went directly to my doctors office without an appointment and told the receptionist that I needed to be tested immediately because my father had been diagnosed with HD and there was a 50% chance I had it. The doctor had to research a little to find out what to do, but then drew blood and sent it off for testing. I had to know right away because at the time I had a 10 month old son and I had to know if he was at risk. Honestly though, even if I had not been a father I would have gotten the test right away. I know some choose not to get tested and everyone has to do what is right for them, but that is not something I could live without knowing one way or another. I got lucky and tested negative, but my older brother has it and is entering the end stages now, thirteen years later. \n\nYou have to decide what is right for you. Some do not want to know, some like me have to so they can plan. I hope hearing another person\u2019s experience helps, good luck making your decision and if I can help you decide in any way by answering questions please do not hesitate to ask. Hi there, I am very sorry. It is a truly devastating thing you are going through and being scared is normal. \n\nThere are many things to consider when it comes to going through genetic predictive testing. A good first step would be to speak with a genetic counselor. Even if you are not sure if you want to be tested. They can explain all the ins and outs of the process and help counsel you towards making a decision. \n\nIt is completely your decision as well. Even if your mom is not sure that she wants to know. For you, your decision is your main focus. But I would think about a genetic counselor. \n\nWhat country are you in?  I am so sorry to hear. My husband is going through this now as well. It is not an easy decision. I will tell you that some genetic counselors will ask your mom\u2019s opinion too. A positive result on your end is a diagnosis for her too. Maybe talk to her about it. Maybe this is something you guys can face together. Here is some reading for you.\nThe easiest way to get tested is to join a study. (\n\n( has local counselors who can guide you through the testing protocol. Their caregiver guide gives you an idea on what to expect and how to deal with it. The protocol is not a joke, lots of folks kill themselves right away after a positive result. \n\nUnderstanding HD ( is the best  I have seen so far. It really helped me understand how to help my wife who is in the later mental stage. \n\n(\n\nMuch of the literature says there is no treatment and nothing you can do. To some extent that is true, but there are at least two CRISPR techniques that are moving through trials, and physical therapy does help. Also as the onset is tied to immune system breakdown, keep your immune system strong. (  (  ( These last two are a shot in the spine every month, with a good chance of never having symptoms. That is a big breakthrough. \n\nLast, children, you can use in-vitro fertilization and embryo selection to make sure any kids do not get it. Please do that.\n\n\n\n\n\n The whole process for me was just under 1000 dollars. I am only 19 but needed to know. If you want to have a family definitely get tested. I jus wanted to know so I had the chance of having a peace of mind. It is a difficult decision, so take some time to think about it. It is very scary but there are resources out there to help. America unfortunately, where the health care is shit. What is a genetic counselor?  Wow thank you so much for all the literature  Certain insurance pays for it now. Call your closest HDSA center of excellence and ask to speak to the social worker (even if you do not go to this clinic or if it is a state away). They will be able to talk to you about your options, help with insurance and discuss what testing entails. They will also be able to set you up with a genetic counselor, neurologist, support group etc  I am also from America and genetic counselors are hard to come by - I would try a neurologist.  My fianc\u00e9 and I are truthfully not interested in ever having kids, even before I found out about maybe having HD - how important do you think testing is then? If I do have it, I am going to know either way.  My fianc\u00e9 and I are truthfully not very interested in having kids, even before I found out I was at risk. How important do you think it is I still get tested? If I do have HD, I will know either way in my later years.  Mine did, Blue Shield. I got tested because I had to know what my future held, if I was looking at the possibility of succumbing to a degenerative condition I wanted to know so I could plan accordingly.  Beyond that, it is a really tough call.  Having that diagnosed positive could make it prohibitively difficult to get life insurance if that is a consideration, that is a pre-existing condition that I suspect most insurers would not want to touch.  Beyond that, it is a heavy shadow to have hanging over you as you go through life.  I knew I had to know and if I did not find out I would be constantly wondering about it.  I would wonder at the slightest symptom of illness or health problem if that was HD kicking in, and I knew I could not stand the uncertainty.  If you do not think you would torture yourself with wondering by not taking the test, I can certainly see the rationale of it.  Live now, experience life to the fullest, do not let the possibility of HD hold you back.  \n\nAn argument for testing though, is that research on the cure is constantly being conducted and experimental treatments are being pioneered.  Knowing for sure whether you have the diagnosis means you could seek out those treatments and be in line for them right when the have been validated by experimentation and show therapeutic promise.  There is a lot to be said for that because the onset of HD symptoms can be very sneaky.  With my dad, he had long dealt with depression (something with high co-morbidity with HD) and for a long time we ascribed some of his personality quirks and challenges to getting things done to depression.  It was a slow process over years of realizing that there was more going on, that his decline in ability to do day to day tasks was moving too quickly beyond his age and that something more was going on.  He did not have a lot of the tics and odd chorea movements that might have been more of a diagnostic clue that it was not just depression.  HD expresses itself differently in everyone and he saw multiple doctors (GP, neurologist, psychiatrist) on multiple occasions until the test for HD was ordered as a rule-out and we got our answer.  With the way HD works, when it starts to express itself fully it starts killing brain cells and once they are dead, they do not come back (at least now, maybe they will find a way in the future).  By the time my dad got a diagnosis in 2004 things had progressed and he died in 2008.  His HD specialist told us that usually from diagnosis due to actual onset of symptoms you have 10-15 before HD ends your life, but he only had a bit less than four because it took so long to diagnose and things had already gone so far.  I do not know if getting the diagnosis sooner would have enabled better treatment given the level of knowledge about HD at the time, but it sure would not have hurt and would have enabled us to plan better for his care.  As it was, we barely were able to get me power of attorney so I could make medical and financial decisions for him in time - he had almost lost the ability to sign his name and give informed consent.\n\nMy point is, if you know you will develop HD you can be tracking research and treatments and hopefully be in a better place to take advantage of the latest treatments to ameliorate or cure that condition before the onset of symptoms.  I think that is a big point in favor of knowing, but that is my $.02 which I encourage you to ignore if it is not helpful to you.\n\nMy last thought, is you guys do not want kids right now (and that absolutely is a valid choice), but that can change down the road.   You may wish to know whether you have HD or not so that should you start to second-guess that decision you know what risks could be involved.  \n\nI hope some part of all this rambling is helpful to you.  I am so sorry you have to face this decision, but I wish you all the best in doing so and figuring out what choice is right for you. If you do not want kids and are in your early-mid 20's, a generally young age for symptom onset, I would not see getting tested as being a time-sensitive priority. Think about it thoroughly. A counselor can help you understand these things more, but the various ways in which a positive OR negative test result can affect you psychologically are more far reaching than you initially think. Give it time. Learn everything you can about the disease and listen to others who have been tested. See if there is a support group in your area and speak with them. Make sure that this test is what you want and what is best in your life. \n\nI am sorry to hear about the news. I found out I am at risk 5 years ago and coping has been difficult. But for me, I feel as though I can lead a fulfilling life without the knowledge of my status. I hope you can find what works for you.  Wow honestly thank you so so much. I really was not thinking that there could be lot of barricades to getting treatment, but thank you for opening my eyes to that. It is a tough decision for sure and my mom actually did get tested after I was born, but she never went back for her results, and I am sure she still does not want to know. It is sad because she is showing signs, memory problems and not being able to hold a job and mood swings, but I still think she is preferring the ignorance is bliss route.  Thank you very much for your kind words. I think that you are right about waiting, and that much more research is needed and definitely a support group or two. I just do not want to give this disease my youth and my tears before I even know if I have it, and then even then I do not want it to rule my life if I do get a positive result.  That reminds me of one time with my dad when he had not gotten a diagnosis yet. He had been living on his own, but eventually he hit the point where I knew he was not safe by himself, he just could not take care of himself anymore. I brought him to live with me while I took him to doctor\u2019s appointments to try to figure out what was wrong. He was having more and more trouble with activities of daily living and getting frustrated. There was one time when he was trying to write out the alphabet and was struggling both write the letters legibly. He got more and more frustrated until he yelled FUCK at the top of his lungs and threw the pad and pen across the room. My father was an incredibly sweet and even meek man, and that was the first time I had ever heard him swear at age 67. He was just so frustrated with not being able to do something so basic and simple and not knowing why. It was still hard after the diagnosis, but I think it helped him to know why, not to feel crazy that this was happening.  Not going to lie, this disease is probably going to rule your thoughts and actions from here on out regardless, until you and everybody you know who is blood related to your mother tests negative. If it is just you two, that is easier to achieve but just one positive result and all bets are off. But you do not have to let it steal your youth. \n\nYou can start living life not knowing and as if you got a positive test result. The line \"live life like you were dying\" works here. Go out and experience new things. Instead of the mindset \"I will not be able to do this eventually\", use \"I might not be able to do this eventually.\" The former is more depressing and restrictive and the latter is more open and motivating. You can always revisit the option of getting tested later. That is how I live and my experiences are really the only advice I can give, but it works for me. I think about it every day but i fill my life with good people and great experiences that keep me learning, growing and overall keep my mind off of it. \n\nOn another note, my grandmother was adopted and had 8 children before she knew, so I am seeing your situation from the next generation. I hope this still works for you. This disease sucks. If you would like to talk more feel free to PM me.  Hey I just wanted to say that your post really resonated with me, and thank you so much for taking the time to write it. I have decided that I am going to wait on testing. It is just not something I need to know right now, and I do not want to change all my life plans because of it. In the next 2 years, I will be graduating college and getting married and buying a van to travel the country (which was the plan before I found out about all this) so I really do not want anything to change or be tarnished by this a positive result. Thank you again for your words, they spoke right to my heart.  It means a lot that my advice was helpful to you! Keep doing what you are doing and do not let anything hold you back!  It means a lot that my advice was helpful to you! Keep doing what you are doing and do not let anything hold you back! Hi   - so sorry to hear about your recent news with your Mom.  My suggestion would be to speak with as many people as possible before making any rush decisions.  I am from an HD family and currently help run a non-profit, (  Beyond our website, we have two resources I would suggest.  \n\n1)  We have a paid professional on staff that we call a \"youth worker\" who works daily with young adults around the USA in your exact situation.  It is free and she is very easy to work with.  You can contact her at  to setup a call.\n\n2)  If you are on Facebook, we have a group over over 1,000 young adults in a closed group that will offer you lots of opinions, thoughts, support and advice based on your situation.  If interested in joining the group, friend me on FB (BJ Viau) and I can provide you access to the group.\n\nI hope one of these options helps you out!  Best of luck.", "This is me in the article. I am working start a Huntington Society of Canada chapter in my area. ", "Huntingtons Disease Essay Hello everybody, I know this is not a conventional post and I sincerely apologize for that in advance. I have been asking questions on r/Huntingtons for the past month and I appreciate all the comments. The prompt for this essay was: \"Adolescents should be encouraged to defer predictive or predispositional\ntesting for adult-onset conditions until adulthood\nbecause of the complexity of the potential impact of the\ninformation at formative life stages.\" I would love any and all comments/suggestions :)\n\nPredictive Testing for Huntington's in Teenagers\n \nImagine being unable to control your body, swallow your food, or speak to your loved ones. This is the physical and emotional suffering that Huntington\u2019s patients endure late in life. Huntington's Disease (HD) is a hereditary, cerebral disorder which causes integral components of the brain to die (HDSA, 2015). Genetic testing can provide an early. As a result of the adverse effects on the mind and lifestyle, there is an ongoing debate regarding the ethical issues surrounding predictive testing for teenagers. Although it is essential to have information about one\u2019s health, teenagers should be urged to delay predictive testing for Huntington's until adulthood because of the intricacy of the information and its effect on formative life decisions. Making choices about having children, especially during teen pregnancy, and, most importantly the effects of preselection, are all the items worth considering.\n \nHuntington's is a hereditary disease caused by a mutation in the HTT gene (IT15 Gene) located on chromosome 4 (Sathasivam, 2013). The normal copy of the gene manufactures the huntingtin protein; the mutated gene is larger than it should be, because of a large number of CAG repeats. Not much is known about how the interactions between the protein and the brain lead to the death of many important sections of the brain (HDSA, 2015). As brain cells die, the patient becomes increasingly unable to control their movements, emotions, and thoughts. Although there are variations in the symptoms, almost all HD patients pass away because of complications resulting from the inability to control motor functions, the problems include choking and falling.\n \nAlthough there is no cure, there is a simple blood test that can be used to screen for the disease (Genetics Home Reference, 2013). There are three outcomes of the test: negative, positive and uncertain. A negative result means that the individual will not develop HD and that both genes contain normal CAG repeats. A positive result means that the individual is at high risk for HD (Nordqvist, 2015). It reveals that they have 40+ CAG repeats. The result does not, however, forecast the time of onset or type on symptoms. The last result is uncertain; some people with a CAG repeats (36-39) never develop symptoms, while others develop drastic ones (Nordqvist, 2015). Genetic testing can sometimes be a particularly useful tool to avoid passing on the gene onto future generation.\n \nMany adolescents wonder about what it feels like to have kids and get married. They dream about the experiences they will have and the joy that a child\u2019s laughter will bring into their lives. Through these dreams, they begin to formulate ideas of having long and prosperous lives. A positive result would start to seem like an impossibility. For many teenage parents, a positive result for HD would cause even more complications within their lives. The added stress could result in severe psychological trauma that adversely affects daily life. Consequently, this may take many years to overcome and result in other psychological disorders such as depression, insomnia, and anxiety (Alary, 2012).\n \nHuntington\u2019s does not just affect the decision of having kids and impact teen parents; it also causes preselection. Preselection, in this case, refers to a phenomenon where the family unconsciously classifies their children as carriers or non-carriers (Smolina, 2007). An example of preselection is the gender segregation in India, boys are encouraged to start businesses, and pursue higher education. Whereas, girls are expected to be housewives, bear children, and discouraged from pursuing a higher education. Similarly, if the family members think that child A is unaffected by HD, child A will be urged to seek post-secondary education, have children, and look for a promising job, whereas child B (who is seen as a carrier) will be given different advice and there will be significantly lower expectations for him or her. There may also be an unequal distribution of financial support, love, and nurturing.\n \nUltimately, adolescents should be encouraged to postpone predictive testing for Huntington\u2019s until they are over 18 because of the complexity of the information and its impact on formative life decisions. Decisions such as marriage, reproduction (especially in the teenage years), and to a different extent, the effects of preselection all need to be carefully considered. Huntington\u2019s is an awful disease, and can devastate a child if they learn that they have it before they reach the right age.\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAlary, B. (2012, June 18).

They where mainly cognitive changes. She would easily get confused and would need something explained to her multiple times and then forget what was said shortly after. She struggled to learn new things and to read. Then she started getting into car accidents. Her reflexes and ability to be steady on her feet worsened. She also started to show increased anxiety and depression, which lead to insomnia.\n\nAll of this is much worse now but these were the first things we noticed. \n\nI am sorry you for what your dad is going through. It is not fun but you are not alone! Best of luck. \"when you knew it was the start of this disease\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah, that is not really how it worked out for us, but looking back on everything at a later date and then learning about the diagnosis/disease/symptoms, the signs were clearly there, we just had no idea our mom just was not kind of crazy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(early 90's) Mood swings should have been a big indicator for us. Angry for what seemed like no reason. Lots of yelling. What seemed to us as unreasonable behavior. After the divorce from my dad, she landed in an abusive relationship that would go on until I was in my early 20's. I am of the opinion (my own, it may not be shared, I get it) that the environment in which a person lives has some impact on how the disease progresses. A mentally and physically abusive husband, not always willing to notice changes, make and keep doctor's appointments, etc. in my opinion, did not help the situation. They moved 1200 miles away when I was in high school, so regular visits were not really a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(mid-late 90's) Hand-writing degradation. My mom was always writing notes, letters, etc. She took a lot of photos and there was a HUGE notable decline just prior to and during her time in NV. We would get photos with descriptions on the back that look like they had been written by a child just learning to hold a pen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(early 2000's) Then, the gait and the twitching (chorea). I visited her in NV when my friends and I took a road trip to California after graduation, we popped into NV for a quick visit. She looked drunk the entire time I was there. She was known to drink a beer or two, but never to the extreme where she was staggering around or slurring her words like she did that day. I begged and pleaded with her to make a doctor appointment and that I was worried about her and it revealed the disease. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe knew nothing about the disease at that point. It was not until I was around 24 (about 3 years later) and she was living back at home with us that we started learning about wtf was actually going on and what our options were. She had to go into a nursing home (back home with us) in mid-late 2004 as our house was not set up for anyone with any type of mobility issues and she did not have the mindset or ability to take care of herself during the day while I was at work and my then gf was in class or at work.

Hey everyone, I am 20 years old and a college student with a mother who has HD. I would like to get tested but I am unsure of the steps necessary. Can someone help me out? Also, my twin sister does not want to get tested but I do, is it unfair of me to ask her to come to receive my results with me as support? Hey \nThe exact route would probably vary depending on where you live. \n\nIn the UK I got referred to a genetics counsellor who will talk to you about the condition (obviously, if your mother has been living with it for a while, you will know a lot about it, it was new to us.) they will ensure you understand about what a positive diagnosis means and about treatments, options fit having kids etc. They also make an assessment and may ask you to attend some sessions before getting the test. \n\nOnce you go for the test, it is a simple blood test and the results take a couple of weeks. This was the hardest period for me. \n\nI would say take your time and consider whether you do want the test, there is no rush. The test does not change anything, but it is hard living each day knowing that you will get these symptoms some day. On the other hand, its probably also hard to not know. \n\nFor your twin sister. Are you identical twins? If so, then would not you both have the same status? In which case, yes it would be unfair to expect your sister to come. It is probably unfair to have that expectation for anyone. \n\nEither way, if you have someone else who could come with you, it may be better. Do you have a friend who you could rely on and trust. \n\nIt is going to be emotionally exhausting regardless of the result.  Thanks for the advice first off. I appreciate it. Me and my sister are fraternal so I think we would be two independent cases. Maybe not expect her to come, but I kind of just wanted her support. I understand that it makes her nervous to confront it. But you are right, it is probably unfair of me. I think i will just be accompanied by my parents or one of my best friends. Thanks again. In the US you are most likely looking at about $800 in costs; half for the consultations and genetic counseling, half for the test. They will usually ask you to do research on your family history and provide a brief health summary of parents, grandparents etc and follow back some generations. They do a lot to help you understand and give the genetic test some thought. \n\nI will also let you know that you should not feel rushed to get it done. Most with HD do not show symptoms till around 30-50 years old, so you have time. But if you are set on getting the ball rolling, go to the HDSA website and search for a support group. Meet some other people who are also living with or are affected by HD, hear their stories and get a grasp for what it is like. Never hurts to have another support system. The group leader can then help you get started with a genetic counselor. \n\nAnd if you need support, I would suggest a friend. They will be able to express empathy and provide strength for you, whereas it can severely emotionally affect somebody who is also at risk and closer to you.  My dad had to go to his PCP first and got a referral to a geneticist who did a physical exam then made appointments for a genetics counselor and the blood test. I, however, did not have to have a referral. My dad's movement disorders specialist set me and my siblings up on a grant. I am 28, have one son and another on the way. I agree that if you can, wait for the test. I have gotten the physical exam completed and am waiting for the counseling and blood work but I do not know if I am going to go forward at this point. \nGood luck and try to not get in your own head too much.

Hoping to get some guidance about what the steps are. We live in Canada, my soon to be husband\u2019s mother carries the gene. He has not been tested yet and does not know if he wants to be. What options do we have when it comes to having children? Hoping someone has gone through this and can give me some insight.\n\nTIA!   IVF, they can remove the gene if he has it so it is not passed down to your children and he will not have to get tested. There are great organizations like HelpCureHD who may fully find it if you fill out the application. \n  Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. These are your options, if your husband tests positive:\n1) Fall pregnant naturally without any genetic testing\n2) Fall pregnant naturally and have a Huntingtons test on the foetus at 8 weeks. If the test is postitive then the next step is a termination.\n3) IVF with Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD). This is standard IVF with an extra step where fertilised embryos are tested for HD and only HD free embryoes are implanted.\n\nThere is also the option to try for a HD free baby without your husband being tested. Instead of testing for HD, they will test to see if the embryo has inherited their genes from you or your husband's side of the family. You would terminate or implant embryos based on that assessment. \n\nThe HDBuzz website is a good resource, and has an article which goes through these options in detail. I would suggest you check it out.\n\nI have used used medical terms like embryo so I can explain properly, so this post may seem clinical, but when it is happening to you it is your baby, not an embryo, which makes all of the above options incredibley hard.\n\nThere is no right option, only one that is right for you and your husband. Be kind to yourself whilst you make a decision.\n\nBest of luck. My husband and I had our first naturally. We found out his mom had HD two weeks before our baby was born. \n\nWe are now going through the IVF process to test the embryos and use a non HD embryo for our second child. \n\nIt is not an easy decision. A genetic counselor might help. \n\nBest of luck. I feel the need to speak to this. They do not remove the gene from the embryos. They test them all and proceed with the ones that do not have the gene. I wish there was a way to remove it though. \n\nBut there is a way to do this process without you or your husband finding out if it is possible. \n\nWe are going through this process as we speak. Thank you for the clarification I did not know that Personally, I would not marry someone who would not get tested. Knowing for sure either way is a huge weight gone. The unknown really gnaws at me. I also do not think starting a family with this secret is a smart idea. I am positive and in mid stage symptoms, btw. No problem! It is very confusing and took a lot of questions for me to figure out how it worked. I certainly hope someday we can remove the gene though. It is a wonderful thought.

I do not see my brother often, but it is obvious he is exhibiting signs of the disease. We feel like my dad is ignoring the symptoms. Since we see him infrequently we notice the changes. My first question is....how do I bring this up to my dad? My brother became my dad's best friend after my mother died. I am afraid saying something might anger and hurt my father. I love my brother and father and only want what is best for them. Also, for those who have had siblings who were diagnosed.... have you had to deal with survivor's guilt and, if so, how did you handle it? Thank you in advance for reading this post! How old is your brother? You could just tell him to get tested. He is 42. My mom's illness put a strain on our relationship when we were young and it took a long time to get over it. We talk, but we are not close so most of our conversations are superficial. I think it would be best coming from my dad since he has been through this with my mom. I would say just have an honest conversation with your father about it. Be gentle with your delivery; honestly goes a long way. My mom died from HD and now I am at risk. Unpopular opinion maybe but I would say... Do not. I would not want somebody telling me. I am already stressed by every twitch and stumble. Not much can be done when you are diagnosed anyway.", "Nurse practitioner/case manager looking for guidance Hi, I am a nurse practitioner in a clinic program for complex patients. In my role I provide a combination of case management and medical care. I am about to start working with a patient with a presumptive diagnosis of HD (symptomatic and positive family history). I will also be working closely with his mom and sister, who have already cared for two family members through the ends of their lives with the same diagnosis\n\nI have been reading up on HD research and have read the materials on HDSA.org for healthcare providers and social workers, which were amazing. I fully expect to follow my patient\u2019s and his family\u2019s lead since they are already experts on their own needs and on HD, but I would appreciate anything advice you are willing to share that could help me do my job better. What do you wish your provider had known or done? Did you have someone on your team who made a big difference for you/your loved one? How did you prioritize how to use your time and resources over the course of the disease?\n\nThis is my first Reddit post, so I am not sure if anyone will see it, but thank you in advance if anyone responds I wish that nurses or doctors had not assumed my fathers cognitive abilities declined as well. Though they have now, for the first couple years it was only his physical abilities. He would get very frustrated being talked down to or slowly to, he could understand everything but due to HD he could not speak back. \n\nSome great things my dads team does now:\n- says hi all the time\n- calls him doctor (he was a surgeon pre HD)\n- just are nice and understanding of his frustration. He does not get mean or anything, mostly fed up that his mind can move faster than his body. And sad that he cannot live with his family anymore. He needs 24hr care so he has not lived with us for about 10 years. \n\nAt this point in my dads journey there is not much else we can do, they just try to make him comfortable and connect him with family and friends as often as they can. He is going down the dimentia path as well so each time I see him it does not get better but I know that his team is doing all they can and it is just how it will be. \n\nHope that was helpful Physical therapy can effectively extend the quality and length of life. Especially breathing exercises. This does not get out enough. I found it impossible to get my lady to do them though. \n\nA quite peaceful life is the next thing that can really help with quality of life. Regular schedules, predictable and well planned adventures. Knowing the plan for the day ahead of time helps with agitation. Kudos for your care in asking this is such a huge step, I wish more providers would start there first like your doing. Remember they are still there the far off look or gaze is very deceiving reach and connect beyond that\ud83d\ude0a Thank you! So helpful! Thank you. I am curious, did you sit down and have a conversation with your dad about his wishes for his future care in the early stages of his HD? If so I would love to know more about that process and what worked or did not work\n\nBefore I was a nurse I worked with autistic folks who rightfully hated being talked down to/talked about right in front of them, so that is already a pet peeve for me :) Thank you so much! I have not heard about breathing exercises before. Do you remember if it was a physical therapist or respiratory therapist who provided that service? No we did not discuss. I was 16 when it all started and not in the place or maturity to handle that. He has his sister close to him who discussed all that. He also got himself a long term care policy in the 70s which thankfully was not used until 2013 and has paid for everything so far P R and speech all do it. Centers of excellence such as Northwestern in Chicago tie them all together with Neuro and Psychs. Thank you! Thank you so much! I appreciate your help Thank you for taking the time to ask this. This shows that you are truly passionate about doing your job well and I appreciate that. \n\nMy dad died of HD and I am 25 and gene positive. I do not have a ton to add because I was young when he had his care team and I do not remember a lot. With that being said, what has stuck in my head is how his HD doctor took care of my mom just as much as him. Make sure your pt\u2019s family is also your pt. She made sure my mom knew that whenever she needed help, advice, or an ear to listen, she could call his doctor. She was understanding and patient. My dad was very aggressive as his disease progressed, but that doctor was calm and supportive, even when my mom could not handle it. Please be patient. My mom would call that doc whenever my dad was having a crisis and she was available. My mom has not forgotten that and brings its up a lot. \n\nOh also! Stay up to date on clinical trials that he could qualify for. Make sure the family knows all their options for drug trials and research he could be in. \n\nThanks again and good luck Thanks for this guidance. I absolutely want my patient\u2019s family to know I am here for all of them, not just my patients as an individual, but I had not told them that explicitly and now I definitely will. They were not interested in hearing about clinical trials during our initial visits, but I will offer the discussion again in a gentle way in a few months - hopefully they will be feeling at least a little more supported and have more emotional resources available once we have worked together for a while", "When symptoms first started how often did you experience twitching? The last three weeks I have been having muscle spasms in my legs, and it is been really bad today. How often do spasms happen for you guys/gals?\n\nThere are a variety of factors that could be at play for why I am twitching, muscle fatigue because I am a weight lifter and I take in huge amounts of caffeine (not good I know but I think I do it responsibly) I cannot really speak much to this but you are right that you have got some other factors to consider there.  Have you been to a neurologist for assessment in the last year?\n\nPS I do hope caffeine is not a big deal though because a lot of people might be in trouble there.   Is caffeine bad for Huntington's? I do not think research has born that out.\n\nThere was a retrospective questionnaire about HD and caffeine usage a few years back.  But no one agrees with the \"findings,\" because it was a retrospective.  And furthermore, if you are having trouble focusing or are tired, you reach for caffeine.  \n\nHD Buzz agrees that the 2011 \"caffeine questionnaire\" should not be conflated with an actual study, and that they do not really indicate anything, especially when the results for Alzheimer's and parkinsons research said that caffeine seem to delay onset of cognitive symptoms.  \n\n My wife just turned 30, her chorea is really bad. She drinks a shit ton of caffeine which I believe as a nurse has only worsened her symptoms. But she refuses to give up caffeine. Maybe you can? ", "Mixed Feelings My mom finally aknowledged that she is experiencing  symptoms and wants to talk to her Dr. about studies and medications. On one hand I am happy because she is been in denial so long until things got worse. But on the other hand I feel like she wants to talk about it now, but I feel conditioned not to bring it up because it always ends with her angry...I do not know if I am looking for feedback, just want to put the thoughts somewhere, but you guys are all awesome and I hope you all have a good day! I was there with my mom at one point, too. She spent so long in denial...at least a decade, but since her diagnosis, she will literally tell anyone she interacts with. I used to dread having to point out that something that was happening could just be a symptom and not an entirely new illness. It will probably get easier for your mom too, and for you. Sorry you have to deal with this! That is exactly how my husband and I are with his mom. She is been in denial for YEARS. She does not realize how bad hers is either. The only thing that has helped is weekly therapy and talking to her about Huntington\u2019s like it is separate from her. It is hard to explain. \n\nWe might say \u201cDo you notice the Huntington\u2019s getting worse?\u201d rather than saying \u201cDo you notice yourself getting worse?\u201d. It seems to help to separate her from the disease. It helps her talk about it. That might help? \n\nGood luck That is exactly the same as my Mum. She was in complete denial up until the official diagnosis, and then immediately like a switch flipped began telling everyone about it. It honestly made things a lot easier for everyone, as though the diagnosis let her finally name and acknowledge it. I long for this day that my mom will accept what is going on! I feel immense guilt each and every day because I feel like I should be doing more to try and get her to see a neurologist, take her meds, etc but she lives in complete denial and gets so angry and defensive and just shuts down when I or anyone tries to talk about it. She goes to a new doctor pretty much every time she needs a med refill because the doctors try to ask her about her HD and she gets angry at them and flies off the handle. :(", "Free publications in PDF format from Huntington's Disease Society of America ", "When to get tested? My mom past away about 4 years ago from Huntington\u2019s and I have two older brothers. They are choosing to wait to get tested but I keep going back and forth. I really want to know but I have to consider the possibility of me having it. If I were to have it, I can foresee me going into a deeper depression and I do not see that going so well. But if I were to not have it I would feel guilty because I do not want my brothers to get it. I would rather have it than them... does that make sense? Also another thing that is stopping me is the cost of testing. I am in college and living on my own so I do not know how I would go about paying for all of that. I have researched and it looks very expensive. \nSo basically... when did you decide it was time to test? How was the testing process? How to handle good/bad results? And is it as expensive as it says online?  I decided it was time to test when I was convinced I had it. My girlfriend knew about it and encouraged me. I was already in a mental state where I knew it was going to happen so I needed to do as much as I could before symptoms set in. When I did get tested, I thought I could get into medical testing or treatment earlier, maybe help others if there is drug testing. I found a genetic doctor via the HDSA website and she was great. The test itself was a blood test and cost about 400 dollars. I got the results back and only had 17 repeats, doctor told me I would not have symptoms. The sense of relief was incredible. \n\nI know it is not an easy decision but in my opinion, knowing is better than not. You and all your brothers each have a 50/50 chance of having enough repeats for symptoms, however there is a chance none of you could have it. I was 28 when I got tested but was convinced I had it since 18. \n\nThe decision has to be yours. If you are certain it will depress you then I would say do not get tested. You have to consider your quality of life and how it will be affected by the knowledge. Maybe sometime later you can get tested, you are still very young.  It sounds like you have a lot going on already and I know how stressful college can be. I would wait until you are in a more stable environment where you can afford to take a few mental health days(or weeks) should you get a less than desirable result. It does not sound like you are in a good place right now to get tested citing your statement that if you tested positive you worry you may be more depressed but if you tested negative you may have survivor\u2019s guilt. To me that sounds like a lose lose situation and I do not know why you would put yourself through any of that. \n\nI have known for the last 7 years that I am living at risk but only now do I feel the emotional stability to get tested. Also, I do not know where you are in the world but here in Ohio I have to meet with lots of doctors and THEY will determine if I am ready to get the test and they can choose to not give me the test if they do not believe that I am emotionally stable enough to handle a positive or negative result. So, you really should work on reframing this in your mind if you actually want to know. It will be healthier for you. \n\nFor me, if I test positive then I know that I have a few years left to make decisions for myself and I will take advantage of that to improve my quality of life the best I can. If I test negative, then the weight of all of this will be off of me entirely. Your situation of course is different. My only advice is to consider the positives that each possibility would give you and hold on to those if you truly want to be tested. \n\nGood luck.  Does anyone know if you can get tested without insurance? I know the blood test itself is around 400/600. But how much is the counseling and do they require you to be insured???  I was tested without insurance at a local hospital in my state for around $500 (in 2012) which included two counseling sessions, the blood test, neurologist, etc. I also tested anonymously. They did not have a requirement for insurance (I assume you mean life insurance). Their only requirement was to have someone with you when you receive your results.  I called about testing and the lady was strongly suggesting I needed medical insurance to help with the cost, which I just do not have. I do not know... I just saved enough to pay for the blood test and what I imagine a few counseling sessions would cost.   2yrs ago at Johns Hopkins Maryland I was quoted for about $1300 total. And because of that ridiculousness I have not gone through with testing", "I know this time of year is especially difficult ....

I am the first person in my entire family to get tested without already showing symptoms.\n\nSo far everyone in my family who was \"at risk\" ended up testing positive.

Good bot I was tested and got my results just over a year ago, and for me everything got real when the blood draw happened. Before that it all seemed a bit more abstract, but once they took my blood it felt like there were actual results sitting in an envelope somewhere waiting for me.\n\nI mostly distracted myself. I made plans for what we would do on results day both before and after, good or bad. I worked out, I hung with my family, it tried not to think about it and sometimes I succeeded and sometimes I failed. Mostly I failed in the middle of the night when I should have been sleeping.\n\nOne thing I did not do was tell anyone the date of my results. Family and friends knew I was getting tested, but only my wife and MIL who was taking my son on results day knew the date. I think that was a good decision, because having a bunch of people call or text asking for updates would have been terrible.\n\nIt sounds like you are doing the right things, talking to the right people. It is hard to keep in mind that there is a 50% chance you are negative, but it is important to remember. As for how your friends can support you, I think listening is the best anyone can really do. I had a friend take me out for beer a few times and just let me drink and ramble, and that was nice.\n\nYou are not alone, it sounds like your support system is strong, and that will help get you through this. Enjoy the holidays, your results will still be there later even if you do not think about them. I played a lottttt of Breath of the Wild. Escapism is your friend. Also, confiding to compassionate listeners when and if you are ready. Good luck friend. The waiting is the hardest. Is it mostly the females in your family testing positive for HD? Well yes...the male members of my family are only related via marriage, so they arent at risk.  So every single family member so far at -risk for the gene who has gotten tested has tested positive. The only ones who havent tested are my sisters and 1 cousin in their early 20s who are waiting. My grandma had a sister, they both had girls, I only have sisters, so there just are not any men born. Thank you for that response, I appreciate it. I still havent decided what to do for results day. My provider says to plan something... but nothing sounds \"right\".  I have been considering booking a couple days at a cabin outside the city. I took the whole week from work off so I didnt have the added stress. But I also feel like I will want to be in my own home/safe space after. My best friend is doing a 10 day quarantine so she can come see me that day so at least I have that to look forward to. BOTW is a really good choice.  I have been playing Divinity II but I think I need something less-involved/tactful though so I can zone out on it a little. Thank you for the clarification. My paternal grandmother, my father and my brother all had HD. I was tested and I do not have it. I feel like I won some kind of sick genetic lottery.  I have a ton of survivor\u2019s guilt compounded by guilt for feeling guilty since it is better than the alternative. I had myself all worked up for the testing because I was told to expect lots of counseling and waiting but it ended up being my gynecologist randomly testing me and blatantly giving me the results on the next visit as a matter of factly as possible.  I hope only the best for you.  I know the pain this disease causes. Yea for some reason my family only makes girls. \nThank you for sharing. I am also worried about survivor's guilt, especially if one of my sisters ends up having it. After watching my mom the last few years, imagining my sisters going through that is really scary. Having your best friend with you is a good idea - is she coming to your results appointment too or staying with you after? A quiet cabin may be nice too, you will have to decide if you think you would prefer the comfort of home or the quiet of nature...or both.\n\nI have a child so the most we got alone was 24 hours, but we went for breakfast beforehand and had reservations for a fancy dinner that night. The results came back positive and I considered canceling dinner, but it was good to get out and do something different that night. That is a lousy hit rate for your family. Sorry. So far my family is sitting at 50/50 - I am the positive. Woot! (Sarcasm).\n\nTried not to think about it. It did not work very well. Especially since some office flubbed paperwork and I had to blood draw and wait twice. Ugh.\n\nGood luck. And make sure to do therapy even if you are negative. I lost my brother in 2015 at the age of 37.  He had a very severe case and started showing symptoms in his early 20\u2019s. We were in denial at first.  Shane did not have any kids and I had a daughter so he told me he was grateful that he had it instead of me. I found it hard to feel the same way other than the relief I felt that the disease stopped with my only sibling. I believe this is only my second or third post so I am not sure of all the rules but I was going to share that I am in Tennessee, USA. I was curious where you were from. From what I understand, the largest amount of cases are in Europe and The United States. I hope the best for you.  Most people do not understand the depths of this disease. My partner is coming with me to the results appointment, hopefully in-person but if not via video chat because of the current visitor policies at the clinic. Dinner is a good idea. Maybe a good excuse to ask my friend to make all my favorite comfort food. Im sorry for your loss. That is such an awful thing to go through. My family does not usually show noticeable symptoms until early 50s. I am in my mid-30s now which is why I decided to get tested now. How old were you when you ended up getting tested?\n\nWe are Ashkenazi (came to US because of the Holocaust) so a small ethnic subgroup living in Eastern Europe for thousands of years before immigrating. I lived in NY and now Seattle, but genetic/ancestry wise we are all 100% Ashkenazi. Ive always wondered if it would be more prevalent since we are such a small ethnic group with thousands of years of small population breeding. But Ive only seen research on Ashkenazi diseases like Tay-sachs and Bloom syndrome. Wow, going through two blood draws is just the icing on the cake. What a nightmare. Do you mind if I ask how old you were when you got tested?\n\nI am hoping the hit rate is more favorable between me and my sisters. Thirty. I do not regret it. I am doing way better emotionally, career wise, family wise... Every way, then I was under the cloud of mystery dread. I faced my worst fear and came out strong as hell from it. \n\nIt takes time of course. I almost quit college. It was my last summer, and I did not think I had it in me to finish, I was so broken. But I did finish. On schedule and with an award winning gpa. \n\nI hope whatever you get, you are better for knowing. I am currently 48 and I got tested when I was in my early 30\u2019s. It was not even really a conscientious decision to get tested, it was more building my family history with my doctor and she said she wanted to test me so it was not a grand event like I had pictured it. It sounds like you have plenty of family support. My father passed in 1988 so there was not much known about the disease at that time. He ended up institutionalized because they did not know what else to do with him. He became very angry when he figured out he was sick and he lacked good judgment. He did some awful things so that was the face of HD for me as a child. My paternal grandmother passed before I was born. Ive met some people in this are who have it so it is nice to speak to people who understand. You really cannot accurately explain HD enough to someone who has never lived it. The waiting period is the hardest part. The day I got my blood drawn I sat in my car and cried. Because it felt real. I never thought I would actually be strong enough to get tested. I am the first one out of my siblings to get tested, and I chose not to tell any family I was getting tested (just in case I were to back out). \n\nEvery day just dragged on. I had a few things planned during that waiting period to keep me distracted. I did something fun like getting a tattoo. I planned some self care like getting a massage, pedicure, etc. To take out my anger/anxiety I exercised a lot and went to the driving range to hit some balls. Therapy was a big help for me. During those 10-15 days I saw my therapist a couple times. When I would find myself panicking I would do different breathing methods that my therapist taught me. I also would turn on The Office to cheer me up. \n\nThe day of my results I scheduled a session with my therapist immediately after. I found that VERY beneficial because I was absolutely in shock. And my therapist made it clear that if I did not want to talk, we could just sit there. Whatever I needed in that moment. But I was very grateful to have that planned.\n\nFor me, I always think worst case scenario. And I convinced myself that I had it. But one thing my therapist kept telling me is that I also may test negative. And what I should start creating scenarios where I test negative. Because it is also a 50% you will test negative as well. \n\nI know the feeling of being alone in this situation. No one really knows what it is like to be in your shoes. Speaking for everyone here, we care and will always be here to talk. I am praying for you!", "An HD story with effective compensation. Just because you have it, does not mean life has to suck.

More importantly she shows in here effective methods to compensate. \n\nI am sure some computer wiz to dox her, but leave the poor lady in privacy. \n\n\nI was diagnosed with HD in 2013. I took a medical leave of absence from my job in 2015 with the long term medical insurance I had taken out and at the same time applied for Social Security Disability with the help of my HD doctor ( which really helped speed things along ), the long term medical insurance that continued until Social Security Disability was approved and the benefits kicked in.....\n\n..Most of my symptoms of HD are mild compared to what others are posting on this site and since I am now 62 almost 63 there are a few more cognitive issues than before ..\n\n.....I have implemented several things that help me as I am a widow and live alone ( although I babysit my twin 3 1/2 yr old granddaughters often).......some of these things are avoiding social events and gatherings that there are many things going on and many people talking at once......I go to church but avoid \"group\" conversation....I shake hands and greet other people one on one only and I situate myself so that when I sit I am front and center and usually a wide space between me and any other people.....and I go to sunday school but do NOT go to the group gathering before the classes divide to their individual rooms.....\n\n..I also may make a \"showing\" to bday parties and weddings/funerals ....but then leave as soon as I can to save myself from embarrassing myself or others with comments on things that I should NOT comment on ( part of HD) .\n\n.....at home....I no longer try to do more than one thing at a time....as I get distracted tooo easily.....and have burned things on the stove by forgetting I have left the burner on while I was changing out laundry or folding clothes, etc, ....\n\nI also do NOT watch/listen/read anything that is violent, scary, or immoral as those things get trapped in the HD mind and confuse what is a \"fictional scenario\" with reality and from what I have read and studied the HD mind in dreams and in reality can and does transfer fears of betrayal, distrust, anger, to the real people in their lives from situations that are only on tv, videos, books or in the words of music that we listen to....\n\n...I also try to only have one person speaking .....one on one.....and not several conversations going on within my hearing...\n\n..I have learned that I need to turn off the radio,tv, etc in order to concentrate and retain when I am reading or trying to have a conversation with someone......This presents numerous problems when visiting my kids/grandkids as they seem to always have an electronic game/ television /or other NOISE going on.......so I mostly do NOT visit them, but ask them to visit me and ask them when they do to put away their electronic devices while they are here or if they must answer their phone to go outside or out of my hearing range because it is so agitating to me..\n\n....and I am very sensitive to the volume of electronic media as well as the noise going on around me......especially if there is more than one thing going....\n\nI have found that it is very VERY emotionally upsetting for me if there is a change in plans made by someone other than myself.....meaning if I change my plans, I have had time to think things thru and adjust to what I want to change.....BUT if you change what the plans are....UNLESS you give me time to adjust my thinking ( which usually takes at least half a day sometimes longer) then it is very difficult for me to not react with frustration, and emotional out bursts\n\nRoutine and the stability of knowing (in part) what to expect by planning each day/ week/month's activities is best......even if there are changes that happen ( hopefully changes that can be told me before they come about ) this is best.\n\n.Setting up these boundaries and limitations allow me to function mostly without emotional outburst or confusion....I learned these things and many more in the book by Jeffery Gingold...Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis\" which I believe God allowed me to find....MS effects some of the same parts and functions of the brain that HD does.......\n\nAll this to say so that caregivers and others that have HD but not yet with full blown onset or may either read the book so that they may understand some of what is going on with the HD brain...and set up boundaries/ guidelines that will allow the HD person the ability to function IN SPITE OF HD......\n\nAnd now at this stage of my life....I am finding the more choices I have , such as what outfit to wear or what to fix for a meal, or where to plant a certain thing in the garden......the more choices the more frustrating......so I need \"either/ or\" \nchoices instead of a whole slew of options.........\n\nThis is just to say that others with HD may also be dealin g with these things cognitively WHICH is not near as obvious as the physical aspects of HD.....BUT is more dangerous to the relationships because of the lack of knowledge of the cause of the emotional outbursts........toward others ...", "Off Topic -

I think the scariest thing in my mind is how limited our time becomes after this. I know it varies when you will get it - 30s, 40s, even 60s. I am stil so young and there is still so much I want to do with my life. I am supposed to grow old with my husband and be my daughters mother she can come to for advice when she gets Older or just tea hug to comfort her. I keep praying God will give me more time with the ones I love before everything goes downhill. My dad was 43 when he got diagnosed and he died at 52. It is so terrifying to think about, and my friends &amp; family keep saying how strong I am but I really do not feel it. I guess I am glad they believe in me but I do not, but that could always change. Thanks again for the post, it was a nice read. Thanks for reading stephanieaj90. When you mention being there for your daughter to give her advice and support, that is my biggest concern with the whole thing. I have got two kids, 5 and 3, and when I think about not being there to watch them grow and be a dad and teach them things, it breaks my heart.  Thank you for sharing this, it is fantastic. Looking forward to more.  Thank you very much for the great compliment!  Sorry this took me so long to reply! I remember bits and pieces of my relationship with my dad. I was only 6 when he was diagnosed and he was mid-40s by then. My parents had me pretty late in life and so me being so young while my dad was already fairly old definitely impacted my relationship with him. Not sure how old you are, but I made an effort to have kids  young so I can be there as long as I can and not just be remembered only as a sick mom. I want for us all a to make memories and I want to cherish all the time I have left before I start showing symptoms. Hypothetically speaking, if I get sick the same time as my dad did, my daughter will  be early-mid teens, and I was 15 when I lost my dad, so I guess that is the thing that keeps motivated! Hi there, I am 43 years old, so I do worry that I may run out of time.  Ugh that is such a shitty situation to be in. I can understand to an extent. It was definitely hard at times when I was younger and it made me grow up a little faster than most kids, but I truly believe it made me stronger and impacted my life tremendously. I mean, I did not  really know my dad like most kids, but i always respected him and appreciated how strong he was for our family at the time. He is one of my heroes, and he will always hold a huge piece of my heart.  I am sorry  that things have be so rough for you too, but someone on here told me to take things one day at a time and I have really come to appreciate my life with my family more. Do all the things you have always wanted to do and make some more wonderful memories they will cherish for life. I will be praying for you \u2764\ufe0f", "The resentment I try not to feel Sometimes I get so angry. So angry that my wife just cannot be normal for just one day. Just one day where she is not depressed, manic or extremely irritable. One day of peace is all I want.  One day where I do not have time be the strong one. I know its not her fault. I feel guilty for getting upset and harboring resentment .... I will try to do better tomorrow. I know the feeling man... You are strong and doing what is right.   \nYou have not left like my own dad did to my mom with Huntington. Leaving me to take care of my moms depression and suicide attempts. I felt the same way about my mother. It is not your fault, neither is it your wife's. Do take some time for yourself, is there someone you trust that can take care of your wife for a few hours? Maybe go outside, get some fresh air and do something you enjoy. You do not have to feel guilty about it, it is important to do if you are going to be the primary caregiver. You need to take care of yourself as much as your wife needs you. There is no shame in stepping away for a day here and there. You cannot be an effective care-giver/husband if you do not take care of your own mental health. \n\nTake care OP. I actually do not resent my dad for being sick or passing it to me. I do resent my mom for checking the fuck out emotionally and not being there for her kids. She did the bare minimum to get us through alive and is now pushing me to get knocked up naturally and risk passing on more misery. No thanks.\n\nBut mom is still here to work this through with if I want to, so it is ok.\n\nTake care of yourself first, feel all the shitty feels so you do not start to feel guilty about not feeling shit, and work through them. Shitty feels are beyond reasonable for what you are dealing with. Same here. My wife is at early advanced stage and slowly declining. She has been repeating regularly now. She can now longer differentiate one topic from the next until she packs one topic away. 5/7 nights a week she is up and furious at me for whatever the reason. 30th anniversary in August. It are not easy so I take one day at a time. It is been a while since I lost my temper with her. \n\nI totally feel the same resentment as you. My god life should not look like this. Sorry you and your wife are going through this\n If you dont mind, could you elaborate on her not differentiating on one topic from the next? Any examples. Ok. Today she was looking at jewelry online. It was like I was not even standing right next to her asking if she wanted turkey or ham sandwich. She needed to totally remove herself physically and mentally from the computer just to answer turkey. Just in regular conversation also, one topic at a time is all she can deal with. No switching around the conversation topic. Ok. Today she was looking at jewelry online. It was like I was not even standing right next to her asking if she wanted turkey or ham sandwich.

I live in a different state, and typically make it home for the major holidays, and more minor things when I can. Every time I see her, it is progressed even farther. It is been so long and she is changed so much that now I have trouble remembering her before HD. I love her and the rest of my family to pieces, so I have to visit, but seeing the further changes in her every time I do leaves me depressed, which makes me feel guilty, and the recent realization about remembering her is not helping. I do not really know what to do about it, but I just had to say all this to someone, even if it is just internet strangers. Vent all you need. Everything you described is normal and very understandable. HD sucks. It drags the entire family down for years until the end, which is a whole new, yet shitty chapter. It will get better one day and your mom will be free of HD and at peace. Just remember the good days and think of them often to keep them fresh. Those memories will nourish your soul in times of need. You know everyone here sympathizes or empathizes. If there is any outlet that you can be free to talk about the hardship that come with HD, reddit would be the one. \n\n\nBy all means, vent. My mother passed from HD when I was 6 or 7. My uncle passed recently too. I would be happy to talk or PM or anything really if you want. I still miss them both enough to cry once in a while, but also it is a lot more peaceful now. In a way there is a sense of relief.\n\nHold your head up We lost her two years ago this past spring. She was only 66 but had been symptomatic for over a decade. She ended up choking to death in her sleep. I will never know if she even knew she was choking or if she even had the ability to communicate that she was. Towards the end, my mother lacked the ability to speak almost entirely but when she did speak, it was usually an I love you Joey. I occasionally had to step outside to get myself together as it was too painful to watch. I found myself looking forward to her no longer suffering as I knew there was no cure. When she died, there was a release because I knew she was not imprisoned in her body anymore. She was free. It still hurt and it still does. It made me question my faith and it still makes me angry that she went out like that especially knowing my two children will never get to know how wonderful she was. Everything you are feeling is perfectly normal and nothing to be ashamed of. HD sucks, plain and simple.  I would give you a hug if I could. I am in pretty much the same situation you are, feel free to reply or PM me if you want to talk. Your feelings sound so much like how I feel.\n\nMy mom's been noticeably symptomatic for 10 to 12 years the best anyone can remember, and my only clear memories of her pre-HD are from before I graduated almost 20 years ago, after that I have trouble discerning what was her and what was HD. We live in different provinces and I see her probably 3 to 5 times a year, and it is hard to make that time quality with all of the challenges that come from HD. I will see her this weekend, hopefully for a good visit. I am so so so sorry  for your pain. It is the kind of hurt that no words can provide relief for. But you are not alone, most definitely not. Some parts of life really fricken suck, that is the truth. Your pain is very valid, and I do believe your mother is so lucky to have you.

Supposedly the test takes 14-28 days (per Athena Diagnostics) so I am now in the window of time when I could receive my results.  A little background- my grandfather passed from HD, my dad is currently in late stages. I am a 30 yo F. My neurologist said there were a couple small things on exam that were concerning but they could just be normal variants (hopefully I am just quirky). Each day gets harder to wait and the fear is growing. I was so sure I wanted to be tested but as the reality gets closer I am afraid to hear my results. I want to know but I do not. I never expected waiting to be this tough. I am feeling depressed and anxious all at once. My physician actually encouraged me to take a short leave of absence this next week. Every phone call I receive makes me anxious (I actually had a full blown panic attack the other day). How did you survive the waiting? Any advice? Went through this a few summers ago.\n\n I just stuck my head down and played so many video games. I think any hobby you have would probably work. Anything to make your mind off it for a split second or two. Just keep yourself busy really.\n\nI was no saint during this time. I drank a lot leading up to the results and then again after the results, mine was positive.\n\nI know this might sound weird but i sleep a lot better now knowing I have it than when I was in that gray area of not knowing.

Until recently I was always led to believe my mother and her mom had Parkinson\u2019s or something we did not really know. Tldr every one but me knew it was HD. I have lived my whole life in that grey area being told I did not need to worry about ending up like my mom but believing I definitely could anyway. Now the main thing that has changed is that I can get a solid answer. I can give future partners facts about what my later years will be instead of grey area maybes. Maybe my view will change when waiting on that test, but I just want to know at this point. Thank you for sharing. I have definitely been sleeping a lot. Usually I am one of those annoying morning people but lately it is been a chore getting out of bed. I am trying to find some good distractions. I wish I had found this thread before, it is been helpful reading through. No I did not do it anonymously. I saw a neurologist and he ordered the test. I spent the last year obtaining life insurance, long term disability insurance, and long term care insurance in case I need it. I tried to get all my financial/insurance ducks in a row. Once I finished all that I met with my primary provider care and she referred me to a neurologist. Ahh that makes sense. I have done some digging and it seems like I cannot realistically get a decent long term care plan until I am 30. But I do not really want to have to wait 4 more years before I can get tested and find out. It makes me want to just get tested anonymously but then I think that would mean probably lying when I do apply for insurance which I am not really comfortable with. I am still flip flopping back and forth on what I want to do. Terrible bot. I get my results on June 8th. I am so stressed out about it. I dont have advice but I want you to know I am right there with you Good luck. It is a hard wait. Nothing to be done about it though. I tested positive three months ago.

It is typically a long decline for patients, stretching the last 5-15yrs of their lives. It is one of the worst diseases, due to how devastating it is for families. My Dad has it, in the mid bordering on final stages. It took over a decade for him to get diagnosed, due to the doctors mistaking it for different psych conditions and misprescribing treatments that obviously were not working. I think it can vary from person to person, though symptoms that were true in his case that are similar to other cases have been depression, some paranoia and anger issues, and gradual mental/reasoning decline. Physically he can eat/swallow ok (just super slow), and take short walks, but is only awake for 4-6 hours a day generally due to low energy. \n\nI have been in a similar spot mentally, thinking about the future and 50/50 chance if myself or siblings getting it.

Cognitive/emotional effects come first.  This is what I said: \n\n\"No. Yes late onset HD is a thing. There is something the caller was missing though.

So I tried to think of things I could do and t decided that it was time to tell my brother about what is going on. When I found out about the diagnosis my mom was very adamant that she did not want my brother to know. With the generic implications on us I felt guilty keeping it from him but I also did not want to ruin his life. So yesterday I finally told him what we should expect with our mom and also what it means for us generically. He absolutely freaked out and got so angry at me, saying \u201cI did not have a care in the world before this\u201d and he was also mad that my dad and I did not tell him sooner. I tried to explain we wanted to honour mom\u2019s wishes and I also wanted to wait until he was a bit older to tell him. I feel like I just ruined his life and I made a huge mistake. He is only 21 :( I feel like I should have waited... please any words of advice are appreciated. I hate this disease. There is nothing to be mad about, I think you did the right thing. Ignorance might be bliss but it would only lead him to live a life he would later regret due to not having enough time for everything. When my dad told me I was also mad, but I accepted that this is who I am and started preperations for genetic tests.\n\nKnow thyself and all that I found out from my High School biology teacher how it all works. I knew my mom had Huntingtons but I did not know about the genetics until then. I do not think I have ever slept the same since. There is never really a good time to find out you might have HD. \n\nI got tested 2 years ago and was positive. Luckily no physical symptoms yet(28 now)... I know he is young - but maybe it will make him think about how he wants to move forward with kids if he wants them eventually. IVF is expensive and something people should have time to plan for. Or in contrast maybe he will not want to have kids now. But knowledge is power and now he can make informed decisions. \n\nSucks, but in the long run maybe you saved him from being even more pissed off from permanent complications from not knowing. Give him some time, he will come around. You did not make a mistake--it is going to come out sooner or later. Now you all can start moving forward and working together to all support your mom and each other. You cannot do this on your own! This disease sucks but the support of your family will make all the difference. And also, he will probably value every moment he has with his mom from this point out. Or he should...time goes fast and before you know it they are not the same person anymore :( If he had kids before you told him I am sure he would be even angrier, and you would feel even more guilty. I think that alone is enough to confirm that you did the right thing. I am sorry you are having to go through this.   \n\n\nI feel for your brother and the \"loss of innocence\" as I call it and it will take him some time to wrap his head around all this. Maybe he will not be all sunshine and rainbows but plenty of people have been dealt very hard blows in their childhood (cancer, loss of parents, you name it) and came out the stronger for it. Do not worry eventually he might come around. My mom was diagnosed in her 60s and it was a shock since as far as we know no one had it, mom struggled with this. However my family tree research now has 7 people including mom who decescend from a couple Albert Ii Byers and Minnie Zimmerman with it. The first known case in family is 1952 death record of second son William Zimmerman Byer it lists he had Huntingtons chorea and was in mental hospital last 15 years of his life. My mother has felt better knowing where it came from but we think her mother had it and did not know what it was since her religion did not believe in medical treatment. Living life is difficult enough; to have that life shattered is frightening. To know exactly how your future is going to turn out (with some certainty, barring accidents) due to HD, it is terrifying.\n\nThese truths must be confronted though, if they are not then the battle has already been lost. You are asking the *right* questions in this situation though, those questions are some that leaders struggle to answer every day of their lives.\n\nTldr there were many decisions you could have made in this situation but you made the right one. He deserved to know. I am gene positive but non-syptomatic and 30. Both my kids know I have a brain disease. My oldest who is 12 knows he is at risk. I tell them so they can make informed choices. Especially around having sex- I do not want them to feel the guilt I do for passing this gene on. I also tell my older son about all the research on the horizon. \n\nHe may be upset but at least he knows what to expect risk wise. You did absolutely nothing wrong. As much as it sucks, you cannot shield people from this, they are going to find out. He is probably just still in shock. But he needed to know.", "Should I get tested? My dad was diagnosed three years ago and I have been going back and forth about getting tested myself. I (24 F) am a graduate student and I am planning on staying on my parents\u2019 health insurance until I turn 26. But I am worried that if I got tested now then once I switch over to my own health insurance I will run into issues if I test positive. Does anyone have experience dealing with health insurance? Is this not even an issue? Forgive my ignorance, but I figured this would be a safe place for me to ask! I am 22 and in Grad school also. I struggled with thinking about it too. I actually went for the genetic counseling session then saw the doctor. The Dr. talked me out of it for good reasons I had not thought of. He first asked me if I thought it would really make a difference for me in the long run, he did not ask it in a pushy way, but in a \"are you really sure about this?\" way. The biggest thing we talked about is life insurance. If you do not have a long term life insurance plan yet, it can be tricky. But ultimately this is something all of us children have to think about. Just my two cents, its not the right way or the wrong way, its just what made sense for me at that time. Always do what makes sense for you. i am (22F) and also planning on staying on my parents' health insurance until i am 26. i have a parent with HD and I, personally, want to get tested. if its any consolation, i am questioning getting tested because of health insurance reasons too. like, if I can get tested *without* charging my insurance now, do I have to disclose the results with my future health insurer? \n\nI know GINA (genetic information nondiscrimination act) says that it: \"bars the use of genetic information in health insurance and employment--it prohibits group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future\" (taken from this wiki page: ( \n\nKnowing all of that, I am not sure exactly how it all works legally. If anyone can clear up insurance questions like the one I mentioned before that would be really great. (Also, I have tried asking about getting tested anonymously, but I have not found any center of excellence who can do it.)\n\nDo not know if any of this helps, but I feel like we are kind of in a similar boat! **Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act**\n\nThe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (Pub.L. 110\u2013233, 122 Stat. 881, enacted May 21, 2008, GINA  JEE-n\u0259), is an Act of Congress in the United States designed to prohibit some types of genetic discrimination. The act bars the use of genetic information in health insurance and employment: it prohibits group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future, and it bars employers from using individuals' genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions.  Senator Ted Kennedy called it the \"first major new civil rights bill of the new century.\" The Act contains amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.In 2008, on April 24 H.R. 493 passed the Senate 95-0.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 Would you drop out of school if you got a positive result? Finishing my last year of college after testing positive over the summer was HARD. Probably the hardest thing I have ever done. It takes time to bounce back from that test result. \n\nI am a big supporter of testing. For me, knowing, eventually got me to a much better place then not knowing. But it is NOT easy to get there. If you do not have a support system in place - wait. If you are not sure you will be able to finish school with a positive - wait. If your only reason is American health insurance BS (and I did wait until California passed some law protecting me, too) then wait and vote for Bernie.\n\nThe way American health insurance generally works, is if you do not have a gap in coverage you do not have a problem. As soon as you get a gap, they can start asking what you have and charging more. Although employer groups do not generally do that, just self covering. So waiting for a stable job is also a good reason to wait. Although testing fallout could put the job (and insurance) at risk too. \n\nMake sure when you do test you have a shoulder to cry on ready, time to take off from school or work and a good therapist established. And do not change any major life plans for a few months at least. I am not sure how insurance works in the US, but in Canada you are specifically asked if either of your parents has been diagnosed with Huntington\u2019s chorea. My Mum was diagnosed, but if she was gene positive &amp; not yet diagnosed then I could answer that question honestly with a \u201cno\u201d - but I cannot withhold her diagnosis during an insurance application.\n\nIt does not necessarily mean I cannot get additional insurance, but the price is substantially higher. My gene status does not matter unless I had tested negative, one of my parents has it so I am assumed to have it unless I prove otherwise.\n\nIf it is the same in the US then knowing of your dad\u2019s diagnosis affects your insurability regardless if you get tested. \n\nHopefully someone can answer that part of the question for you. Could you say more about the life insurance issue? Thanks. I definitely have a really good support system and I love what I study so I would want to finish grad school regardless. Waiting and voting for Bernie makes a lot of sense. Not knowing is definitely taking a toll though. Damn. I know very little about health insurance so  I am not sure they would ask that here too. Thanks for your help though! That is good to know. Its been posted below but here is some information about ( but this only applies to health insurance. \n\nAs for life insurance, please take my answer with a grain of salt because this was 4 years ago......but I believe (in the US at least) GINA does not cover life insurance. ( is an article that waters it down, the gist of the conversation I had with the doctor was if you do get life insurance after being genetically tested and get a positive result, you may only be offered a plan that only covers you until 65. And most likely there will be a period of at least 2 years when you will be paying for it but can not collect benefits. But again, please do some research of your own also (I would love to be proven wrong), I am in no way an insurance expert lol. I talked to my insurance broker about life and disability insurance options, and ( on /r/insurance as well before deciding how to proceed. That might be a good place to ask and find out what the implications are for you being on your parents insurance, and knowing your Dad's diagnosis but not your own gene status.

That cost us $400. It was well worth it because we were able to get life insurance and disability insurance at a fraction of the cost that it would have been had we gone through insurance and been tested. I would get insurance sooner than later because you cannot report you have anything like Huntington\u2019s for 1-2 years after you sign up for insurance. They will kick you off if they found out you knew before you signed up. \n\nHope this helps! In some places, you can be tested anonymously, even for free. I was. One thing to remember is that even if you are positive, some people do not show symptoms until they are already quite old. Some people die of something else entirely before they are affected. I would schedule an appointment with a genetic counselor to discuss the details. For me, it got to the point where I was making very conservative life choices assuming I had it, and I figured that if I was living like I did, I should at least be under the care of doctors who could monitor me, maybe participate in clinical trials, etc. Knowing might be important for you as you consider your future family planning, too. Of course, some people choose not to test, and that is fine. I just think the responsible thing in that case is to assume you have it when making decisions that affect other people. I understand that toll so well. It is the strongest argument for testing, for sure. I can assure you, with my positive test, five years out, I am doing way way way better then I was under that toll. It is not for everyone, because you cannot un-know a positive, but for me it was the right choice. \n\nWe can make big decisions - no natural kids (IVF or adoption or non) or little decisions (buy the one story house not two) that feel like we are already fighting for our right to a better future. And we can value now in a way people expecting to live forever do not really understand. No one actually lives forever. California could fall off the world in the big one tomorrow killing everyone (that is not actually how that works).\n\nYou do not have to decide today either. Even if you decide today to wait ten years, tomorrow you can change your mind and start calling Drs. \n\nI fully expect this test and everything it means is your worst fear. I known it was mine. Facing your worst fear is a great source of strength. Whatever you do, and whatever results you get, you will be ok. &gt;Canada\n\nWhich insurance provider did you get asked about your family history with? I went wth Equitable Life and got asked, but my broker skimmed the policies from a couple other providers (ManuLife and another I cannot remember) and they all had the question. I presume all providers have sine variation of the question for both life &amp; disability insurance.\n\nThey cannot ask about gene status, only diagnosis. So if your parent is gene positive and not diagnosed then you can answer no to the Huntington\u2019s chorea question even if you are gene positive too. I am not sure about all the insurance aspects of this but I am concerned for myself too. I am going to get tested. And I am so so scared. I hope we are both lucky. I just went through testing and got my results a few months ago so I know how you are feeling. If you want to talk about it I would be happy to, and this community is great if you feel like posting. I am scared too. Good luck! Like others said, if you ever want to talk about it, you are not alone. Where are you located? If in the US, I have a couple doctors that do TESTING I can highly recommend that will talk about all aspects of the process.", "In-Between Years book now for sale! ", "How to not get mad at your parent with HD This is a long rant, please note before reading I love my parents both to death, but sometimes my dad does something small like this, and I get so mad, and I know it is only the diseases fault, but what is happening rn is just upsetting to me. Also, it is in a lot of detail, sorry if that annoys you, I just want to give you a story that is understandable with the needed background info. \n\nOkay so, my dad has Huntingtons, and the symptoms came pretty late, at age 54 or something. He still takes meds, but the symptoms are really showing when it comes to the way he acts/his personality. My mom also has an illness, sarcoidosis on her lungs. My dad tends to copy my mom, especially when she has a bad day/feels sick. The thing is, before he had his HD symptoms, he did kind of the same, and also felt sick/tired, and did not really take care of my mom apart from making dinner and getting my mom to the doctor, but that is about it. He did not realise that my mom was sometimes in the past so sick that she couldnt take care of herself, and needed some care from my dad. After getting mad at him, explaining the situation better, he would understand and apologise. Autism runs in my dads family aswell, and I am diagnosed with Autism and ADD, so I think it was purely due to the undiagnosed Autism, and him not understanding the assignment.\n\nMy mom had a succesfull surgery yesterday, and was allowed to go home after her sugery and last check-ups. Now is also a situation where she does not feel well, cannot really take care of herself/ anyone/the dogs or do something in the house. As expected, sinnce my dad picked up my mom yesterdayevening, he has been acting like he also feels sore, and is really tired etc. \n\nYesterdaymorning I agreed with my dad to walking the dogs this morning at 7 am,  and my dad would walk the dogs yesterdayevening at around 10.30 pm. My dad and I (my mom had already gone to sleep) were watching tv yesterdayevening, and I noticed my dad falling asleep at 9 pm. I asked him: \"do you want me to walk the dogs this evening, that you do it tommorow morning?\" This was all not needed. I went to bed early, and couldnt sleep,  so I heard him walking up the stairs at around 11.30 pm, which is pretty late for him. Knowing my dad was tired, I thought he would go to bed early, but I also know that my dads logic is gone, so I shrugged it off and tried to go to sleep.\n\n\nWhen I came back from walking the dogs this morning, I heard something in the kitchen, and I was surprised to see that my mom was already up. She ate her breakfast, and went to rest on the couch, while I watched the dogs (we have a 6month old puppy, we have to have a constant eye on him, otherwise he will do something bad/pee inside the house). At one point, I noticed it was 10.15 am, and my dad knows I have to leave to go to a friend today. I got pretty annoyed, because I know that he just stays in bed and does not do anything no matter the situation if he does not have a reason to get out of bed. I got especially annoyed because my mom told me that my dad was up when she woke up around 7.30am, and was just on his iPad. When I went to wake him up, he was \"asleep\" looked at me grumpy, and acted really sleepy, and talked with morning voice, that you cannot really understand. The last two things are things he has never done before his HD symptoms, and are things that happen to my mom when my mom is really tired/has a bad day, which annoys me more, because he is copying my mom. \n\nThe only good thing about the situation is that he got downstairs around 10.30 am, normally it takes him way longer, so that I have the time to write this post and to get ready. \n\nThe thing what concerns me, is that my dad now does not apologise when someone comments on the way that he acts. He just gets frustrated, and sometimes gets even mad, especially at my mom, but lately, I notice its also easier for him to get mad at me, because apperently I look like my mom (sometimes he even calls me by my moms name). My mom has atleast 2 weeks of medical recovery, which can go upto 4, and I am not home for most of this day, this weekend I will not be home from fridayevening until sundayafternoon, and next week will be busy too. My mom needs to rest, and is not allowed to pick things up, bend down, and needs to be careful with her body. Knowing the way my dad acts, and that I am busy, I am scared that my dad will not be there for my mom when she needs it, and will get mad/annoyed at her when she askes for something/comments on something. He really feels like he cannot do anything right when you do that, so you have to be carefull with the way you word things. Even when you give him a compliment, than he can take that as you being sarcastic/ talking to him like he is a toddler. \n\nThe things that need to be done are not that big, like walking the dogs/giving my mom enough space to rest and sometimes give her food/making dinner/taking dishes out of the dishwasher, so my parents and I feel like we do not need help from other parties, especially because we already get so many help offered. My dad and I can do all of these things, but now we just need to do it more often. My older brother will be home this evening, and can help out a little, and my oldest brother will be home tommorow afternoon until sundayafternoon/evening, but he is mostly working. It does give me some peace atleast someone is there for this weekend (well, if he is not working).\n\nDespite knowing this, the whole situation still does not sit well with me, because what happends if I move out in a few years? And just the way he is acting this morning, it feels like he is mocking my mom. I know he is not, it is his disease, but it is just hard not to get mad at my dad. A part of me wants to stay home today and this weekend, but my parents said before the surgery that everything will be taken care off and that everything will be fine, and that I should have my own life. \n\nI am really concerned about my moms health, I know she can take care of herself just fine, but I still worry. Seeing my dad act like this is very confronting, and makes me very mad and sad. I kind of predicted he would do something like this this morning, but I did not think I would be so mad and mosly frustrated. I thought he understood that my mom needed some care. He also knew that I had an appointment this morning. The hardest thing is, that I cannot really talk to him about it, because I know he wouldnt understand and would get mad at me, making the whole situation worse....\n\n\nHow do you deal with this? Do you have any tips for me? I do not have any advice from a place of experience. I am lucky enough that my husband has not started to present yet. But it is ok. It is ok for you to be angry, frustrated and scared. \n\nI am glad you can see this is illness and not malice. But it is one thing to cognitively know that you have very sick parents. On the other hand, it is hard to care for one adult, let alone two all on your own. It is vastly UNFAIR that you have to care for both at the same time with such different needs and if you did ever feel 'These are simple tasks. Why cannot he just do them as an adult.' That is so normal. \n\nDo your best. You can be mad. You can be hurt. But take a deep breath and try to be kind. \nHis disease just sucks. \n\nWhile the basic chores you mentioned are easy. This is a lot emotionally. If you need help, to have a break. Do it. Do not reject help offers because the chores are light. Someone else to just stay home, watch the pup, or cook dinner so you can have some normal space out of the house. \n\nBut really, it is ok to be mad. I wish I could give you every bit of strength and love I have, internet stranger. Well, I do not take care for my parents, they still can care for themselves, but at this point my mom needs a bit more help, and my dad fails to see that. My mom can still work, well atm not bc of her medical recovery but you know what I mean, and everything else, my dad can still drive the car and do his voluntary work, do the finance of my uncle etcetc.\n\nThey still are my parents, and they give me enough space to let me have my own life. I can hang out with friends, go to work, and sometimes I do not even have to do chores around the house at all! Sometimes it is even like there is nothing is wrong at all... I am (Officially) an adult too, and those tasks really are not too hard. Its also hard to accept help-offers. I am really like my mom when it comes to that. Idk why, hahaha. \n\nIts just that my dad does these small asshole-like things sometimes, which really makes me mad. Especially when it comes to actions like these to my mom. Its hard that I cannot discuss it with him either, and just have to deal with it myself. What Is also hard, is that when I tell people my situation at home, they immidiatly think the worst, but I do not take care of my parents 24/7, they are not bedbound or anything like that. When they visit, it sometimes feels like nothing is going on at all, and that makes both diseases so hard to explain. Its just a shit disease. Both of them are. I really hit the jackpot with this one :'). \n\nThank you for your kind words internet stranger, it helped a little!", "I think my parents knew I had the gene So my Mom has Huntingtons and is in the late stages at 53. Her two sisters are also postive. \n\nI recently got my genetic results and I was postive with a CAG of 43. My Dad and I have not had the best relationship due to his drug and alcohol abuse and absence after him and my Mom separated, leaving her to succumb to HD and then almost letting my brothers and I end up in foster care. Luckily his parents took us in when my Mom could not care for us anymore. \n\nI got pregnant with my oldest son when I was 17. My Paternal Grandma at the time suggested an abortion because I was young. And also mentioned I had not been tested for HD; being optimistic and naive at 17 I did not even take that into account. \n\nA few years later as my Mom was getting worse and my family and I were trying to get her into assisted living. She had some friends that were not the best one including an old friend from high school. Her and I had a conversation in my Mom's driveway about HD, her health etc. She brought up how my brothers and I \"were all postive\". At the time I was just like \"I do not know we have not been tested\". And brushed it off as my Mom feeling guilty and being delusional. \n\nWell now when I told my Dad about my status the first thing he texts me back is :\n\n\"Well we kind of knew you had it all three of you do \ud83d\ude15\"\n\nTo which I replied \"What do you mean you knew we all had it?\" \n\nHe back tracked and said \"No I mean we all know your Mom had it\"\n\nHe can be socially awkward, and honestly just plain dumb at times. So I do not know if he just made a mistake (he also uses text to talk). \n\nBut now I am wondering if my whole family knew I was positive this entire time. \n\nAnd if they did... What. The. Fuck. \n\nThey should have told me. I would not have been so naive if I knew I was for sure positive. I would have had my tubes tied. I LOVE my children, so much. And I already feel guilty enough as is. But now I find out this? My Dad brushed my question off and I was trying to stick to my postive outlook and did not want to dredge that up. \n\nBut now I just do not know. Is it a weird coincidence that my Mom thought that and my Dad made this mistake of words. Or did he just slip up? I think I should probably confront him. I am the oldest sibling and I was born in 1990, did they do prenatal screening for HD back then?  I kind of can relate with you about everyone know about your status but you. I was not told by my mother until a year after my grandmother\u2019s funeral. (both of my grand parents had hd. And I never knew how she really died) So my mom explained everything to me and she mentioned that everyone else (friends and family) knew all this time. It invoked a weird feeling of anger and embarrassment in me as one might expect. My mother also mentioned that they figured out my grandfather had hd when I was in the fifth grade so my dad immediately got tested ... my mom also said that if she knew beforehand that she still would have wanted a child. \n\nAlso on a side note you might want to ask if your dad has hd too. I am not trying to be insensitive or rude but every since I realized that my grandparents both had it (not due to inbreeding), I am not surprised at anything against all odds. That is how I know I have hd without even needing to take a test.\n\nWhatever happens in your life regardless of anything else, I would like to wish you and your child good luck/health. Hi there, hope I can help.\n\nThe HD gene was not discovered until 1993, so it would not have been possible for them to undergo prenatal screening in 1990.\n\nFrom my understanding, doctors will not test a child for HD unless they are suspecting juvenile onset, so it is probably unlikely that they knew.\n\nWith that said, it sounds like you should have a talk with your dad anyway. It sounds like you need some closure there about subs things.\n\nTake care.\n\n\\- Steve. I do not know where you live, but in the western world, most doctors/organizations will refuse to test children for the gene unless they are symptomatic for ethical reasons.

Feeling a lot better now. ", "I did a very informative 3 hour podcast with a comedienne who was going through the possibility of having Huntington's Disease. ", "Former Reporter Kathy Walsh Battling HD ", "I think my boyfriend and father of our child has HD. His dad has it and his grandmother died from it. When I first met his dad obviously I could see how shaky he is, he can barely walk. talk or eat. I did not know anything about HD except it was \u2018similar\u2019 to Parkinsons. His dad was diagnosed at 35 and now at 45 he seems worse every time we see him. \n\nWhen I fell pregnant I had no idea that my partner could potentially have it and pass it onto our child too. After I realised it can be passed down I asked my bf if he would ever get tested. He said only if he started making mistakes or symptoms started showing. It took FIVE car accidents for his dad to get tested, I would rather that not happen to my partner. I am worried about our child having it and we plan to have more kids so I would really prefer to know beforehand. But I have no right to push him for testing, right? Anyway he is 25 and I have been noticing his head is constantly shaking/twitching. It looks like he is always slighting shaking his head \u2018no\u2019. I do not know if it is HD related but it is freaking me out. Does it always start with the cognitive stuff?.. because he seems fine otherwise. No shifts in mood or confusion or anything. Just this head twitch which is driving me insane. Can it be a first symptom? My wife has tested positive for HD. We tried IVF with genetic testing of our embryos to ensure our children do not inherit HD. I know there is a way you can use IVF without you boyfriend being tested. They do the same procedure and test the embryos and implant healthy embryos without disclosing if any of them have HD or not. That makes sure your children are safe without your boyfriend being tested. Being tested is difficult. There is hardly a day goes by that my wife does not think about it. Some days are worse than others, some days she really wishes she did not know. But ultimately she felt the responsibility to protect potential children. If your boyfriend does not want to get tested, and I do not really blame him, I would strongly look into the option I described earlier. I hope for the best for your young family. Hey, movements like you describe can be early symptoms.  Although, it also might not be. You should talk to him about it and see if he has noticed any differences. Getting tested is difficult but if he is becoming symptomatic then he might consider it. \n\nLike someone else said IVF is an option if you want to have more children and it will ensure they are HD free, you can speak to your doctor about it.\n\nIf your boyfriend or child do have it, it is not the end of the world. Treatments are making good progress and although there are no guarantees, HD certainly does not feel like a certain death sentence like it used to. Get involved with trials! The sooner the better. I just went through a very similar situation. I sent you a private message if you would like to talk more. Best of luck! \\&gt;  I have no right to push him for testing, right? \n\nCorrect. But you DO have the right to refuse to have a child with him unless he either gets tested, or you do IVF pre implantation diagnosis. I agree. If he will not get tested and you do not do prenatal testing for the baby, then you have to accept the not knowing. You also have to discuss when/if you bring it up to your child and what you will do for any future children. My offer to chat still stands if you like. A genetic counselor is also a great resource. Your ob/gyn should be able to recommend one.", "Woman sues Doctors for failing to disclose her genetic risk for Huntington's Disease ", "Guy with CP at risk for Huntington, looking for advice. So I am 21 years old and I have Cerebral Palsy, and my father had Huntington's disease, On the one hand I really do not want to know, as my life is already very hard, but on the other hand I do not worry about it for the next 14 years.  \n\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Get tested. If you are positive, you are positive. You cannot change that.\n\nThere is literally no downside to getting tested. Unless there is a health insurance question. That is different. Yeah except I know me, my mental health will suffer... probably more than just being anxious whether I get it without knowing in advance. Well that is something you are going to have to factor in your own personal decision. Apparently because my mom was pretty old when she was pregnant carrying me, she had genetic checks on me and she said everything came back fine at the time.\n\nI think I can live with that, as that sure lowers my worry by a lot. Sounds fairly good. Huntington's must be on the list for routine prenatal genetic testing. Still worth it to get tested. There is nothing stopping you getting the test later in your life if you believe you start to show symptoms, then you can be supported appropriately when/if it is needed Thanks, I probably will not because now I am not as worried,  so if I actually somehow have the gene, I do not really want to know. I probably will not. see my reply to anon for explanation. Totally, but if you are contemplating it you might be happy to settle on the thought that the choice is there if you change your mind. &gt;I probably will not because now I am not as worried\n\nYou should not take my word as gospel. I am not a medical professional. More importantly, I am not *your* medical professional. I am just a shitposter on the internet. You should do independent research on the validity of my previous statements and ascertain if Huntington's is routinely tested for prenatally.\n\n&gt;if I actually somehow have the gene, I do not really want to know\n\nThat is a choice that you personally have the right to make. Just know that inheritance rates are typically 50%. You might be surprised. I am five years post positive test and doing way better than I ever was before. I mean at first I could not get off the couch for days, but now I know my worst fear is my future... But i can deal with it because I know it. I do not have hope for the long term but I have today and today has a right to be good.\n\nPlus there is always the chance you do not have it. It is not. We had to do special tests to know our twins due in June are free of Huntington's. There is a ton of downside to confirming you are terminally ill. Sometimes it is better to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Ignorance can be bliss. \n\nTo say there is \u2018literally no downside to getting tested\u2019 is crazy. That is terrible. It should be routine. Congratulations on your twins! That is something a person will have to decide for themselves. It is alright I know it is a possibility, I will probably push it back to the back of my mind until it is time to worry about it again. Thanks!\n\nAlso, my sister in law tried to get her baby tested for Huntington's while pregnant and was told they would not do the test unless she said she would abort with a positive. Which is insane. I told her say yes and then\"change your mind\" and no one can hold you to it. They ended up not testing the baby. My brother has not been tested either and may not have it to pass on.\n\nFor whatever reason it is treated a lot different than more common child or baby onset genetic diseases/mutations (and I know, sometimes it can so it does not make sense).", "I (31M) have recently tested positive and my life is falling apart. I recently tested positive with 42 repeats. I wanted to get tested to be armed with knowledge, but it feels like everything I touch since this diagnosis has exploded and in a way I regret getting tested now. I know I am doing very unwell, but everyone around me has had such a visceral reaction. I feel like my life is imploding and everyone else just keeps moving. It is like I am trying to stand in the middle of a rushing river and at any point I am about to be swept under and drown.\n\nThere was the obligatory period of people reaching out\n\n\"What can we do to help\"\n\n\"Let us know if you guys need anything\"\n\n\"I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Please let me know if we can do anything for you.\"\n\nIt all feels so hollow and weightless.\n\nWhen anyone asks me if I am okay or something and I tell the truth. \"No, I am not okay\" or \"This is devastating and the worst/lowest point of my life\" it is like people just shut off and deflect communication. It is heartbreaking. I totally get it now why suicide is such a viable way out of this. This (possibly) initial deep low is so intense. How could you possibly feel like there is a way out? It is reasonable to not expect people to know how to react and not know what to do, but if you do not really know what to do or say then leave me alone.\n\nHas anyone else experienced/experiencing this?", "CAG repeats number per generation When the HD gene is passed on from generation to generation does the number of CAG repeats continuously increase/decrease? Does it normally stay the same? Or does it just depend?\n\nAlso does not the CAG repeats affect people differently at different ages? Like for example if 2 people have a CAG of 44 that does not mean they will show signs/symptoms around the same time frame, correct?\n\nIf a parent started to have significant symptoms of HD around the age of 50, should the children expect the same if they test positive? The number of CAG repeat transmitted from a generation to another will depend of the numbers of CAG repeat in the sperm/egg from parents. What has been observed is that when sperms are produced by a male carrying the HD mutation, some spems are going to have less CAG repeat, some the same number, and some will have more repeats. It is more likely to stay the same or expand. I remember reading that there is generally less risk of expansion of the CAG repeat when the mutation is carried by the mother, but I need to check the reference. The simplified explanation is that quick production of millions of sperms by the father can lead to more errors when these cells are produced. \n\nTwo individuals with same number of CAG repeats can indeed developed the disease at different age. This is due likely to some environmental factors, but also to additional genetic factors (independent of the HD mutation). We know that modification in specific gene that are able to repair DNA damage will have a huge influence on age of onset. To state it differently, if some of the proteins that are supposed to protect your cells are not as efficient, due to some variation, the disease can start earlier. It has also been shown that some part of the huntingtin protein can present genetic variation that will make it more or less toxic. So, a lot of factors are involved, and this is why is it difficult to predict disease onset until all these factors are identified.\n\nWe can assume that if a parent and a child have the same number of CAG repeats, same forms of the proteins that repair DNA and same lifestyle, disease onset could occur around the same age. \n\nI hope this helps! CAG repeats per generation will typically stay the same or expand, with expansion generally being more likely. There is some differences depending on whether it is the mother or father passing down the gene. I do not think I have ever heard of the expansion shortening, unless it was a rare mutation.\n\nGenerally, no two people are alike, but the lower number of repeats, the more variability there is in time of onset and severity. Meaning, those with a CAG of 40 may have onset of HD a decade apart. Those with a CAG of 55 for example are much more likely to have onset much earlier, and therefore at a much more similar time (within 5 years for example). Both my sister and I inherited an expanded CAG from our father. We were advised not to give much importance to the number as there is no way to know whether you will follow the same paths. The genetic councillor was very careful when I asked the same question given my dads late onset. One persons 42 is someone else\u2019s 47. There is sadly no way of banking on a similar path. I am sorry. My grandma died at 80 years old, we all had thought she escaped the HD Curse until my uncle got sick. My grandma\u2019s mother died at 45 from HD so we feel like her cag must have been lower than her mothers.  My mom has HD and is living with us she will be 80 with a cag 42. I decided to test and unfortunately I am gene positive with cag 42, no symptoms yet at 52. Not knowing is bliss\ud83d\ude2a I meant my mom will be 80 not 89", "Getting angry at my HD spouse I messed up really bad last night. My wife, who has HD, went to her sisters house over an hour away to spend the week. After 1 day there she wanted to come home. I could not get off work till 5 PM and traffic was horrible it would take an hour and a half both ways to go get her. Our son goes to bed at 7 since he has to be up super early for day care driving to go get my wife would put him hours past his bedtime. I expressed to my wife that I was frustrated with her changing plans but started the drive anyways. During the 1.5 hour drive my wife sent me over 40 texts that were hateful, angry and spiteful. When I got to my sister in laws house she was not even excited to see our son who she would been away from for several days. She had also broken her phone in a fit of rage. I did not get mad or upset and apologized immediately for my being frustrated earlier with her. I was trying to defuse the situation and ge us back home. My wife was furious with me. \n\nWe did not talk for half the way home when she out of no where brought up an old argument I thought we had ended weeks ago. Traffic was worse than expected, I had worked 12 hours that day, the baby was cranky as it was past his bedtime and I snapped. I did not tell but I let my wife know all the resentment that is been building up for the last few years. Everything I said was true but at her advanced stage of HD she does not mean to do, say and act the way she does. I told her how she was ruining our lives and makes everything so difficult. How me constantly putting out the fires she makes are wearing down on me. How being a single parent to our son and taking care if her is killing me on the inside. Needles to say she was very upset and started crying. She cried the rest of the hour it took us to get home.\n\nWe got home and I immediately put our son to bed. I then discover that my wife had not showered the 3 days she would been gone and smelled really bad. She did not want to bathe. I drew a bath for her and washed her and carried her to bed. I apologized for my horried behavior and asked for her forgiveness. I gave her her meds and we both went to sleep. \n\nNote: My wife was diagnosed with HD at 18 years old and had a CAG repeat of 66. She was given ten years to live. She is 23 now. She has not been able to work for several years due to her declining mental health. Our year and a half old son goes to fulltime daycare as she cannot take care of him alone at home. My whole life revolves around her and her appointments. I am trying my best I really do. I feel terrible for last night's events. Hopefully in her good moments she can see all the things I do for her every day. \n\nThanks for reading this whoever you are.  :/\nI am 21 and my Mum was diagnosed a few week back, I am sorry for how life has turned out for your family, I want you to know we all lose patience and make mistakes we are human. I am sure you are doing an amazing job from what I have read. I struggle keeping patient (more often than not I snap which I should not but I do) so you are not alone! I am so sorry you are in it bad right now. \n\nMy dad was around about like that when I was in high school. It sounds like you are way better at handling the situation so far then my mom was. Good for you.\n\nIt is ok to get angry. Any normal human would get angry and frustrated at what we have to deal with. I think you showed amazing strength with how you handled it. \n\nRemember to take care of yourself. You cannot save a sinking ship if you have already drowned. Do not beat yourself up about it you are human. My wife's CAG is lower, she is 31 years old and we have two young boys. Over the years I have seen her slowly decline mentally, I know how you feel working full time then having to come home and run the whole household by yourself. It is mentally and physically exhausting. I try to make time for myself when I can. Best of luck to you moving forward. You sound like a great guy that is been going through a tuff stretch. It is not right to vent the way you did and clearly you know you can do better so please do not let it define you. You are a loving husband and a loving father.  \n\nMaybe it would be better if the SIL came to your place next time? Or maybe a weekend rather than the week?

They are too important for everyone involved.", "I have a 45yo friend with HD who has pushed everyone away (including me) with volatile and violent, intimidating behaviour. He is alone and feels abandoned but has no capacity to observe anything from a point of view other than his own. He is disconnected from everyone but any communication with him (with me for example) is simply an opportunity for a rant and assumption of agreement if there is no argument, which could in turn become justification for action in his mind.   \n\n\nI do not have HD but I can only imagine that I would be furious and frustrated if I did, and it seems that my friend's rage is looking for anywhere to focus.\n\nI have been his friend for 25 years but it has become dangerous to my children.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has no social media connections or reddit. He does not have a regular routine that brings him in contact with people. I do not know how to help him or at least make him less lonely.

This is not uncommon, especially amongst men. Many of us with HD have plans for suicide in the future. He may be coming near his time.

I am sorry, I know this is not what you want to hear. Is there any way to get in touch with his neurologist? Does he have a neurologist? \n\nHe needs to have his meds adjusted.

Its kind of scary tbh", "What to expect? Hello all. So this has been going on the past year. Unfortunately my father was diagnosed with Huntington\u2019s disease. We did not catch it in time and he was always horrible with his health upkeep. He is in an advanced stage (bed ridden, long term care nursing home, lack of communication etc). Recently his weight dropped a dramatic amount (from 115lbs to 90lbs). I would like to know what to expect from the families that have lived through this. Thanks in advance all. Hey\nI went through this with my nan and now currently my Mother.\nMy mum is, I would say in the middle stage. She is using a walker to get around, her speech is alot of stutter and mumbles but still says some stuff fine at times. She is got swallowing issues and sometimes choke on what she eats. She is definitely getting worse as each day goes by, so I am appreciating little things like her still being able to text me or hold some conversations with me.\nShe struggles with solid food so is always on pasta related food, soft sweets (she still has her sweet tooth lol), etc \nMy nan, the last 5+ years of her life she was in a nursing home as my pop (her husband) could not continue being her carer as he was getting older and was not able to pick her up or move her around.\nMy nan only said 3 words. \"No\" \"David\" and \"Bullsh*t\". David is my pop's name so it was warming knowing she still knew who he was, despite forgetting everyone else. Bullsh*t was her favourite word, even pre HD lol \nIt is extremely tough watching someone you love deteriorate slowly over time. I remember when my nan was full of life and loved baking with me when I was little. I still tear up when I go down memory lane.\nMy mum also used to look after my nan til we moved out and my pop then took over her care. \nNow my mum needs care but I am unable to do that as I have many health problems.\nMy brother said he was going to get tested but I do not know if he actually went through with it.\nI am unsure if I will get the test myself, it is very daunting for me. I have made myself paranoid thinking I am showing signs already and I am only 24. Lol\n\nSorry for the jamble up stuff, I have only just woken up but yeah, what to expect? Alot of patience is needed, alot of changes will happen, over time it will get quieter.. all you can do is keep seeing them, let them know you love them and try and keep their mind active while they still have the control. My thoughts and prayers are with you all a way from Australia. I think everyone probably progresses with HD differently, but I can tell you what happened with us.   \n\n\nMy dad stayed in the late stages of the disease for probably 3-4 years. He would have some days where he seemed to be 'better' and some days where he would suddenly get dramatically worse. So I think we all got used to the \"this might be the end\" call we would get from our mom.  \n\n\nHe was in and out of the hospital with pneumonia a lot. \n\nAt the very end, he lost so much weight that he was basically a skeleton. Reminded me of pictures of the holocaust I would seen as a kid. \n\nThe last two weeks he would sometimes try to talk and he seemed to be conscious and aware of us being there with him. My sister and I camped out in his room and read to him, kept on top of med cycles, requested pain meds when he seemed to be in a lot of pain, helped the nurses wipe him down since he could not bathe anymore, and monitored his oxygen levels. You kind of lose track of time when you are in there, but I think it was about three weeks that we slept there. \n\nHis body eventually started rejecting food even from the feeding tube, and at that point a social worker(?) came to us and explained the situation, and we (along with my dad's brother's family) collectively made a decision to remove the feeding tube. \n\nThat is when his oxygen levels began to tank and his breathing became very erratic, which continued for maybe a day or two at most.   \n\n\nWe stayed with him until he stopped breathing, and I do not remember much past not wanting to let go of his hand because it was still warm.   \n\n\nChoking and falls were the biggest scares before he lost mobility and the capacity to eat, so I guess it depends on where you are in the care cycle. We were also extremely lucky to have 24 hour monitoring and care for our dad, which is the only reason I was able to continue my college classes. (Otherwise I would have been at home care giving full time, I think.)   \n\n\nI am sorry you are in this situation, and I hope this was not too depressing or dark. \n\nWhat is your situation like? Are you the primary caregiver? Do you have any other help? The doctor recently recommended a feeding tube. Do you mind if I ask how long your father was on one. And he has gotten extremely skinny at 90lbs. It is definitely going towards skeletal. \n\nHe is in long term care facility. So he has care. For many years he refused to see a doctor so we unfortunately got it situated late in the game and it is deteriorated him so rapidly due to that I believe. \n\nAnd it is not depressing or dark. Just the unfortunate reality. For us, the feeding tube was used as a last resort, so he was only on it for maybe a week or two at most. I cannot remember exactly how long it was. But yeah, it is a hard choice to make. Did your dad leave any advance directives for you?   \n\n\nOurs did not want to be on a feeding tube, but when we actually got there he looked like he changed his mind. That was really stressful. I am so glad I did not have to make that choice alone, and even so it still haunted me for a long time afterward.   \n\n\nAnd if it is any consolation, my dad did everything 'right' - saw neurologists, psychiatrists, took a cocktail of pills and supplements, exercised religiously - and he still deteriorated quickly at the end. His heart was in amazing condition, but the HD still caught up to him. Someone else in his support group with the same CAG count who got symptoms around the same time as him is still mobile and traveling with her husband. I wish I knew why some people get it quickly and others experience a slow decline.   \n\n\nBut it did probably help that he had an established care routine before the late stages. I am glad your dad was able to get into a care facility, at least. Sometimes it is hard to find one that knows anything about HD. Your username says NYC, is he by any chance at the big huntington's center up there? Dramatic weight loss is very common. The constant chorea burns up an epic number of calories. In our local support group we joke about the HD Diet: Chocolate cookies and ice cream!\n\nThe solution to the weight loss is more calories, plain and simple. For better nutrition, the shakes that body builders drink tend to be in high calories.\n\nFor my wife, the biggest problem has been emotional, with sudden bursts of irrational anger. He dad had the same issue: for 30 years everybody who knew him just assumed that he was an asshole -- turns out he was sick.\n\nMeds can help that, if they will take them. If they will not, hide the meds in food and drink. Some are even available as colorless, tasteless liquids.\n\nOther than that, you might want to check out my blog. It is about the 12 year journey my wife and I have been taking on the HD Train...\n\n Thank you and I definitely will. My father is currently in a nursing home full time, he is advanced stage. And since we got to this late, it is all so sudden. He is iffy with his doeta, good days and bad. I just spoke with the nurses to get the timeline of weight and he essentially lost it over a month. I am more curious as what the next steps are and what to expect, besides the obvious. The doctors recently brought up a feeding tube, but I wonder if that is just prolonging his suffering. Yeah, feeding tubes are a complex issue, but the point is that it is his body and his future. Personally, I do not agree with feeding tubes and would never have one myself. But the fact is it is not up to me to decide for him. As his caregiver, you need to be thinking about what it is that he would want. Did you ever have any conversations where this topic came up? Did you ever have any conversations where you could reasonably extrapolate what his beliefs are relative to this matter? \nIf the answer to the both of those questions is no, then you are pretty much on your own to figure it out. To help yourself with that decision, the main thing you need is education. You need to find out what the implications are of getting the feeding tube, and the implications of not getting the feeding tube. And if you decide to get a feeding tube, you need to figure out under what circumstances you would want to have it taken back out.\nThe main thing I would say, is that whatever decision you make, make it and stick with it, do not second guess yourself, and do not give yourself grief over it. We all we can do is walk in the light that we have right now. In my opinion, finding it earlier would not have made a difference. The medical field is at a standstill concerning how to help HD patients. There is no cure and honestly there is not much in the form of treatment options. We knew my dad had it for twenty years so it was twenty long sad years of watching him very slowly wither away. You said your dad never went to the doctor, the Huntington's might have played a part in that.  It is a horrible illness and it broke my heart to see my dad suffer like he did. There were times when we thought we might be losing him but then he would be a bit better, even twitching less, talking to us, laughing and making dad jokes etc (one time it was just us two in the room and I had his hand in mine and he was coherent he told me, \"sheche, you make my world go around. You always will.\") Your dad could live for a few more years or a few more days, it just depends on the severity of it. I was so heartbroken that I stayed drunk and was always taking anxiety pills just so that I could have some sort of semblance of a handle on it. I would walk into the hospital room or wherever he was at the time and see his poor condition and be so upset that I would just break down and bawl and escape as soon as I could. I avoided going to see him sometimes. Now I wish I had had the strength to stay with him. Make sure you say what you want to say to your dad even if he does not seem like he is quite there. I know that seeing your father like this is so hard. Make the most of the time you have with him regardless of how bad of shape he is in. My dad had it, if you want to talk about it with me, let me know. I know others said this, but just to join the chorus: it is very unlikely things would have been different if anyone caught it earlier. It could have been worse with all of you knowing what was coming.", "Deciding to get tested Hi guys,\n\nI am currently looking at getting tested, previously I was not going to bother. But I feel like I need to face it. I would like to know how people decided to get tested? Part of me right now wants to get it over and done with, but another part of me is absolutely petrified. \n\nThanks guys The people I know (including myself) have ultimately made the decision based on which of two evils they can better handle: uncertainty, or looming bad news. There is a lot more that goes into it of course, like age, whether kids are potentially in the future, wanting to get involved in clinical trials, etc. But that is how I saw it- picking which bad thing I personally was better equipped to live with. For me, the uncertainty was unbearable. For others, they just get their plans in place (long term care, finances, legal papers, etc) and then just live their lives. \n\nIf you live in the US, you might want to reach out to your local HDSA chapter. Getting tested is not a one and done thing; you talk to a lot of people who really walk you through your reasoning to get tested, and you typically have multiple appointments over weeks or months, even if you are 100% sure you want to know. It might be worth meeting with the social worker or case manager there just to walk through your particular situation and options. ", "The Lion's Mouth Opens Hello, /r/Huntingtons.

Hey I would be down to send one and I am sure my girlfriend would love to as well!", "\"Fifty Fifty\" is my story about my past with Huntington's. Check it out if you are interested.  I would welcome any feedback on the article. I think I actually felt my blood pressure sky rocket at your therapist's response to you. My biggest fear during my evaluation was that they would tell me I was not allowed to know my results. \n\nI am so sorry for what you experienced with your father. Congratulations on your marriage and the birth of your child.\n\nWell written. I wound up waiting six months for the results. I know that fear. Thank you for the feedback! I cannot even imagine. I can certainly appreciate why they make us jump through those hoops, but I wonder sometimes if those good intentions are not still unethical. Regardless, it sounds like you were able to take something valuable away from the process so good on you. Wow, my experience with my dad was so similar in a lot of ways... This was very well written and it was interesting for me to see what a normal testing experience would be like. (My test was done in about 2 weeks, no counseling before or after, and I got the results over the phone). \n\nI think having that insight (that you should live your life the same way whether or not you have a positive result) would have been really helpful for me back when I got tested. It took me close to 6 or 7 years to start really understanding that concept (and I still struggle with it tbh.)\n\nI think I might have missed the part with your actual diagnosis, though. Was it positive in the end? \n\nCongrats on starting your family btw!  Yeah came back negative. No HD.  It still took me a long time to really grasp the lesson. And thank you! Ahh okay, that is great news! It must be a huge relief to know you will not have to worry about HD in your family's future.  I have an appointment on Monday to start the process of getting tested myself. I grew up with my Grandad having it (my Mum is now showing symptoms). Similar to you, she did not want to be tested. Knowing that there was no cure, there was no real point in knowing. If she had it, she had it... We would find out eventually. \n\nFor me, while not something I want, it is not something I fear necessarily, either. \n\nYour post is well written. I live in Scotland and I am so thankful for the NHS and the fact that I do not have to worry about pre-existing conditions.  Very well written! It is a tough decision, for sure. I think in the end, for me, knowing trumped not knowing. But it took me a long time to get there. \n\nIt is good you have come to a decision that feels right for you. And good that you feel ready to know. I have met many who did, and many who did not feel that way. \n\nAnd yeah, people with HD in the US have to be very careful about the risks of losing insurance. Pre-existing conditions are protected by the ACA now, but there is always talk of repeal.  I am sorry to hear about your Mum, I wish you both all the best in the times ahead. It is always better, I am told, when you have got family that understands you around. ", "Mom just told me my Dad has HD I have known for a long time that it was possible for my Dad to have HD but he is 57 and has not really shown symptoms. I always figured that we were lucky and I was not at risk. He had to my knowledge never been tested. Things have been changing the last 3 or so years in regards to his mind and his emotions and I have suspected that he probably has it but he never really hit all of the checkboxes in regards to symptoms especially the physical ones. Kind of just passed it off as him being an ass. My mom just told me today without my Dads permission that he was tested a year ago. His number was 42 repeats. \n\nHe has not been a good husband to my mother and she has also informed me that she is soon staring divorce proceedings. \n\nI am 25 and I feel like this news is hitting me like a ton of bricks. \n\nI have two sisters. My mom told one sister but we have not told my youngest sister since she is going to be a senior in college. IMO I do not want her to know until after graduation. \n\nI do not know what to do next. I do not know what to tell my girlfriend I love her but we recently started dating, I do not want to put her through this. I do not know what to tell my friends. I really just feel like I am going to lose it at any moment. First off...your not alone! I was first year University when my Dad told us, which was almost 10 years ago. My siblings and I got tested. He is also a 42 CAG.\n\nLuckily for you, there is a community of young people in your country, but also international called HDYO. \n\nIf you want to chat about it send me a message :) Hey there. I am sorry you do not feel like you can talk to your friends or your girlfriend quite yet, that can be really lonely and alienating (I know coming from my own experience). \n\nMy father is also about 57 years old, and was tested positive. I am in a similar situation where I do not know what to do or how to move forward. If you need someone to talk to, you can send me a message. \n\nKnow that there are people who want to support you, and you can search up if there are support groups near you. I am starting therapy in a few days, and I am hopeful, optimistic, and open to professional help through all this. \u201cDo not want her to know...\u201d She is making plans that effect the rest of her life. She needs to know this to plan accordingly. It is not your place to with hold that vital information. Hey your not alone, my dad was showing weird behaviours but he would also had a serious accident when I was 18 so it covered up the symptoms for a while but as soon as he was diagnosed my mum put him in a care home and never saw him again, he passed 4 years ago. I was his only child and it is been very tough like I wanted him living with me but I had 2 small children one whom is autistic so it really was not going to be, I did not resent my alcoholic mother until recently I just felt she was kind of selfish even though there marriage was not great he had always been there for her \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nAnd I think the stress of everything brought on my symptoms which I have had for 2 years officially but I think it is longer (I missed 3 years of appointments for some reason) \nMy advice would be do not let it stress you laugh even when you feel like crying and remember that there is great progress in the medicine world! Good luck sorry if it is long winded \ud83d\ude02 Your youngest sister deserves to know. She may need to make plans for graduate school, starting a family, etc and needs to take the time she wants to make those decisions with all information she can have. I know other's have commented this but- you are not alone. HD can mess with your head like nothing else. My advice is to enjoy the moments when you have both feet on the ground and just let the emotions surface when they need to. I am right there with you in the pile of bricks feel free to message if you need to. My parents waited to tell me until after I graduated despite knowing that my dad was positive. It is good to have those memories of carefree fun with my friends,  I look back on them a lot, had I known at the time those same memories would have taken on a totally different tone. I am glad they waited and let me have that last non-HD affiliated milestone. similar boat as you and u/baewashere. my dad knew and withheld. he is older (80) and I recently was helping him find his doctor from his last appointment, where HD was listed as his condition. i thought he was just an asshole and that he had parkinsons. no idea what his CAG is and he legit will not talk about it and does not think he has it, which is a symptom. i am 26, my sister is 30 and does not know. i was set up to get tested at a huntington's research center at MCV, but i ghosted the appointment because i am scared. i have told a few close friends who are the people i sleep with. i think you should tell your gf, OP. if you are like me, you will obsess about this for the next few weeks and read every post on this sub and feel a ton of anguish, and then you will go through a period of denial. i am a graduate student and was going to apply to doctoral programs after i finish my mfa next year, and now i am probably not, but am looking for fellowships instead. it can change her plans but not necessarily ruin them. if i were to get another terminal degree, it would mean i would have spent ten years in graduate school and this aint no life. \\&gt; I do not want her to know until after graduation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour younger sister is an adult and has the right to know this information, which could affect what she wishes to do immediately after graduation, meaning that hiding it from her right now is costing her valuable time in which to make her post graduation plans. Respect her rights and capablities as an adult and tell her.", "Video featuring useful online resources for Huntington's Disease community. ", "Cannot test limbo Just wanted to talk things out, hope you guys do not mind?  \nMy grandmother has huntingtons. She was diagnosed unusually late but if we are honest with ourselves the symptoms had been there for a long time. Her brothers had both died from huntingtons many years earlier .  \nMy father is her son. Then there is me, and my sister.  From what I know, age at onset is similar when inherited from mother to child, therefore it is likely my father would start showing symptoms  late like her.  However there is anticipation when inherited from a father, therefore if my sister or I have it, our onset would be younger.  \nI have known about the huntingtons for a long time. My father has never had any interest in getting tested, I think he is horribly afraid and he is a very timid man. I am not about to push him into something he does not want to do.  I personally believe for a few years now he has been showing symptoms.  \nHowever, this means that I cannot get tested. Even if I would be allowed by the health service, if I came up positive I would also know my dad's diagnosis before he did, and when he did not want to know. That is a weight I do not want to carry on my shoulders.  \nHowever, I think I am ruining my life based on the possibility I have HD. If I test + I am not having children biological, adopted, whatever. I do not wish to die in their childhoods.\nBut because I cannot test, I am acting like I do have it. E.g. even though I LOVE children, I will not date a man who wants kids because of that 25% chance, which obviously sabotages my ability to have kids even if negative. I am struggling to plan for my future, my life feels so short etc etc. But there is a 75% chance this does not apply to me and I am maybe making decisions I will regret.\n\n\n\nI do not know, just needed to vent.\nTo top it off, I have not talked to my family since February. My mother spread private medical information of mine around the family after I had confided in her, and instructed her that she was not to tell anyone, very clearly. She then told absolutely everyone and made a reference to it at a dinner which everyone clearly understood, cousins, aunts etc. When later confronted she did not apologise and felt that she was allowed to tell anyone she wanted. She then used huntingtons as a weapon and asked \"Are not you glad I told you about grandma's huntingtons?\" So did she spread that too? It is not even her side of the family. She used it again as a weapon in a later conversation and I cannot forgive her and have not talked to her since. She does not seem to \"get it\". It is just another time she is treated me like crap. I understand being afraid to test, but I think living your life a certain way in fear is not going to do much for you and may hurt you in the long run. I think you should have a conversation with your dad about the fact that you would like to get tested, or think it may help your future to do so. I am sure your dad only wants what is best for you and would not want you to ignore opportunities because of possibly hurting him. This. There is a point where you have to decide for yourself, irrespective of anyone else's desires. It is your life. It might be different if you said \"I am not going to get tested and I am ok with that. It does not bother me.\" That does not seem to be where you are. I strongly encourage you to seek out genetic counselling. I am sure they have seen this many times before and will be able to help you work things through.\n\nFwiw, HD took my mom, her dad, and several of his siblings. I have not been tested (56yo) because I am fine not knowing. If however my kids really want me to (22 and 18 yo) I will. I will also get tested if they are seriously talking about having children, which they may do in a few years. I see your point, but it is been suggested to him several times and all he can ever say is that his hands do not shake. But they do, and he is getting clumsy with a marked change in personality. Now that I have somewhat distanced myself from my family it puts me in a bind. I know I am sitting here as someone who is not sure what the right answer is, but have you talked to your children about if they *want* children, and whether that is affected by having HD or not? I have ended relationships with guys I really, really liked because they 100% wanted kids and I could not offer that certainty. It is not even about the time I am due to have kids, it is an issue at the point of getting into a serious relationship. If I came up negative I am sure I would be having kids late thirties, but knowing now so I could make informed choices would be worthwhile.\n\nHowever I also have longstanding issues with mental health so I think I need some serious counselling with this. Neither one is seriously interested in children at this point and it is not clear if they will. Adoption has come up as an option too. If they were to present things to me as you just did then I would most certainly get tested to remove that potential barrier for them.\n\nA bit more background that may or may not be helpful. My mom was delayed onset, diagnosed in her late 60s. Tests were not developed until well after my siblings and I (four of us) got married and started having children. Two of us have been tested. Sister is negative. Brother is positive. His son, my nephew, is also positive. My nephew was tested before getting married so that everyone would know what was going on. They still got married and are very happy. They have decided they will not have bio children.\n\nIt sounds to me like you are healthfully aware of your unhealth and I find that very encouraging. Have you sought out counselling before? It was life changing for me. If you are serious about counselling with an HD twist, check out hdsa.org, they have a lot of good resources and contacts across the US. They probably have worldwide info too, if you are not in the US. Hi, just here to say anticipation is more likely to happen when inherited from the father rather than the mother but it is not guaranteed. You should not assume your onset would be sooner than your fathers. \n\nAlso your mothers behavior sounds super toxic and I would be pissed as hell if my mother ever betrayed me like that. My mom is my rock. I am sorry that happened. \n\nI think you should get tested if you want to do so. You have a right to know. Also here to say that I know many people who have and raise children knowing they are gene positive. Makes things a bit trickier but do not deny yourself a family if you want one. You may have decades left of healthy years and a disease modifying drug could be coming out soon that could extend your life. \n\nI think the worst trap you can get into is assuming that you know what the future holds for you with knowing your gene status. I have met healthy people in their 80\u2019s who tested positive decades ago. You just do not know. HD is different in every single person in a family. Knowing your gene status is important but it absolutely cannot predict the future with 100% accuracy. You have to also live your life. I think if you think you can live your life knowing the results then you are ready to do it. I felt the same way, living my life as if I already had it. It was a ruinous way to live, like I was on death row. Did the same thing with avoiding relationships.\n\nI cannot tell you what it is like to receive a positive diagnosis. Mine was negative and as a result, a tremendous load was lifted off my shoulders.\n\nSo I see you have three outcomes;\nContinue living in doubt, tormented by uncertainty\nGet tested and receive a negative diagnosis, gaining that new lease on life\nGet tested a receive a positive diagnosis, now living with certainty about your future\n\nEither way, I think certainty is preferable to uncertainty. If you are already living as if you had it, what should change with a positive diagnosis? Maybe it will even get better because now you will not have doubt and second guessing wracking your brain. Oh man, that HD guilt. Nothing quite like it. The late nights trapped in a \u201cwhat if I\u201d or \u201cwhat if they\u201d thought loop. Its enough to tear a person apart.\nYou sound like a strong, caring and supportive person. And even more importantly, you can see your own potential. Your Dad should be damn proud. Do not let guilt limit that, it is much too important. \n\nI saw a post i really liked in another sub a few days ago about making a deal with your future self as if it was another person. And you agree to do things now to treat that person with respect, like you would anyone close to you. My meaning here is, you do not need to be last in line for your love and consideration.\n\nAlso, it sounds like maybe your mum might have a lot of fear built up with no real way to express it. The threat of loosing your partner to HD is a whole lot of reality to face. Do not be afraid to approach a conversation with her outside of the parent/kid role. Talk to her like a friend and maybe she will respond in a more understanding way. \n\nRemember though, this is a complete shot in the dark. I do not know you or your mum. And maybe she is just a bit of a cow that will always try to take cheap shots at you regardless.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the ramble. \nStay strong!!! You cannot allow another person to dictate what you feel is right for you and your future. \n\n\\&gt; I 100% wanted to get tested \n\nThen you should get tested. You cannot allow your concern for someone else eclipse not only your own well being and health care, but your ability to plan for your future. \n\n\\&gt; My mother spread private medical information of mine around the family  after I had confided in her, and instructed her that she was not to tell  anyone, very clearly. She then told absolutely everyone and made a  reference to it at a dinner which everyone clearly understood, cousins,  aunts etc. When later confronted she did not apologise and felt that she  was allowed to tell anyone she wanted. She then used huntingtons as a  weapon and asked \"Are not you glad I told you about grandma's  huntingtons? - that was medical information\" So did she spread that too?  It is not even her side of the family. She used it again as a weapon in a  later conversation and I cannot forgive her and have not talked to her  since. She does not seem to \"get it\". It is just another time she is  treated me like crap. \n\nShe DOES \"get it.\" She is abusive. This is not a person whom I would keep in my life at all. She deliberately does things to hurt you on purpose. This is what abusers do--they cut their victims down to make themselves feel stronger and more in control. Forgiving her is great if you can find it in you to do so at some point--but that does not mean you allow her to continue to abuse you by staying in contact with her. You can love someone and also know that they are toxic and therefore not able to be in your life.", "Keep having small body tremors Im 26 years old and my dad and brother have huntingtons disease. I have to get tested but it is been put off for now. I keep feeling my whole body(from hips up) slightly tremor. Its happened twice so far this week(that ive noticed). I dont live near my brother or dad, has anyone or know someone who has had this as an early sympt . I know it could be anything, I just want to see if anyone else has felt this. I have also had tremors here and there. Im 35 so at a common age for onset. Try not to worry about it so much. It is too easy to become overwhelmed with fear and paranoia about symptoms. There is other reason you could be feeling tremors. Sometimes our bodies will just do wierd things. Just try to live life to your fullest. Get tested if you feel that knowing would give you a better quality of life. Good luck friend. Your not alone and we all have these fears I used to look at any little finger movement or twitch my husband did and thought it was onset. Then I stated paying attention and realized I do a lot of involuntary movements, and that people specially when talking do so as well. It is easy to think any movement or anything is onset. I know where you are coming from and easier said and done but relax. It could be a million different things. I feel the same thing and it is freaking me out. But if it helps, I did not know what Huntington\u2019s was nor that I was at risk until this January. Since January I have noticed that I make small involuntarily little jerks essentially every day, all over my body. Sometimes in my feet, my legs, my arms, my eyes. Thing is I only noticied these things once I started looking for them in January and convinced myself I have early onset at 19. Maybe we do maybe we do not, but we sure as hell are capable of convincing ourselves the worst", "Cops treat HD man as a child abuser. Would a medical bracelet have helped? Do cops look at those in the heat of the moment? ", "Symptom Manifestation Hey I have been posting a lot, I know, but I also feel like all these things have been bottled in my head for so long! \n\nBut my question for today is how did your family manifest symptoms? Were they different for different family members? \n\nHow are you managing your symptoms if you have any? \n\nIs anyone taking \"preventative measures\" (exercise, blueberry extract, antidepressants ... Any others out there?) \n\nMy Mom got sick very quickly. And it made her mentally like a teenager. I have a hunch that the break up with my Dad triggered her to get ill early (he was addicted to drugs, abusive to my brothers and I and also cheated on her). She began to date a lot of bad men and started smoking a lot of pot. And then she started leaving for days at a time leaving me to care for my brothers (I was 12 they were 8 and 6). Eventually CAS was called and we were to be put in foster care but my paternal grandparents took us in. After that she continued to \"party\" and was taken advantage of by many people. She kept denying she needed help, and pushed a lot of people away. Eventually my Grandpa got power of attorney over her and put her into assisted living. She declined quickly over three years then was put into a nursing home. She then got pnumonia and MRSA and ended up on a feeding tube and is now immobile as well. I have not been able to regularly visit her anymore since then. It hurts me too much and makes me feel horrible. She was an amazing caring mother, and although she made bad decisions for herself I know she loved us. \n\nMy Grandma was different she progressed slower and was put into a home about eleven years ago. She can still eat, but does not really talk, and is in a wheelchair. She was mentally childlike but she lived with my Aunt and Uncle for some years which kept her out of trouble. And even before that I do not think she got up to much else. I do not think she even presented as ill (personality changes) until I was a few years old. (27 now)\n\nI think the thing that worries me the most is losing myself. I can deal with the physical changes ; I mean look at Stephen Hawking and all the amazing things he did! But I am so scared of changing into someone that my family grows to resent or hate. Or misteating the people I love. That is what scares me more than anything. \n\nMy Aunts are postive and they are going slower than my Mom. My one Aunt seems to have it more physical than mental. And the other seems to be slipping mentally a bit.  From what I know, both my mother and aunt had a big problem with HD Chorea and speaking problems when it first started out. Towards the end of my mother's life, she was basically mute and was not able to communicate in anyway. My Aunt also has problems with Chorea and speaking, but she is doing better as she is younger and is doing drug trials that seem to be helping! ", "She has trouble with balance, severe chorea and has lost a lot of mass, but my mother just completed a mile uphill hike with only the assistance of hiking poles and was the first to the top in her group. 5 years HD positive and I could not be more proud.

I agree. :)\n\nI am sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but I am glad this can serve as motivation. Keep your head up and do not stop moving. It is always encouraging to see people with HD out there conquering things like this. Thank you so much for sharing - it is very encouraging! Big up your mum.

Hi everyone,\n\nI have 3 people within my family who have HD, one of my parents has been tested positive and symptoms began 9 years ago. \n\nI have two siblings who have tested negative but I myself have not had the test, I did go to my GP to discuss this but they were not helpful and in their own words \u201cdid not know enough about the disease to help\u201d.\n\nI do not know anywhere I can go for help but I am hoping someone on here can help me by explaining some of the implications of getting the test, I have heard some stories but not sure if they are true. \n\nI have heard that testing positive can cause difficultly in securing a mortgage and higher premiums for private health insurance. Would I need to declare this to the DVLA and have a marker on my driving license? It should mostly just affect things like long term disability insurance and life insurance.  But in my experience, those insurance companies will already ask if your parents have HD and charge you out the nose, so it does not matter if you are tested out not.\n\nNothing else is affected, neither mortgages or anything like marks on your driver's licence Where are you located? In the US, should go to the closest HDSA Center of Excellence. They can provide very complete genetic counselling and arrange for the testing.\n\nThat was a mistake Janet and I made. You can take the test anonymously and pay out of pocket. This will keep the information private so companies will not know. This is what we did for my husband. We paid $400 for it. \n\nBecause of this we were able to get health insurance and long term care insurance at a normal rate. I would 100% have these things covered before you get tested. \n\nI have never hear about the mortgage issue. Seems like that could be illegal due to discrimination? What is the legality of this? The genetic counselor I spoke with in CA said it was fraud, but others in my family work with testing place in DC that recommends it. I am afraid to push the issue with my a genetic counselor. Also where did you go where it was only $400? I got charged over $500 just to talk to the doctor, did not even get the test. We live in the Midwest so rules might be different here. The genetic counselor was all on board. He has a bunch of numbers in place of a name and he just needs to know his number. There is no digital file. Only paper files. \n\nI am sorry I am not much more help. It was a hospital in the Midwest in a major city. I agree that I was surprised by how affordable it was. That is helpful. Thank you! The UC Davis Neurology clinic offers very affordable anonymous testing. I chose to travel there and make a weekend out of it. You do have to do two visits... Counseling and blood draw and then also results a few weeks later.", "I just need to rant On top of having Huntington's (non-symtomatic) I also have/am:\n\nCeliac\nFemale pattern baldness \nGetting fat (just shittiness from stress and lack of motivation)\nMigraines\nLow blood pressure \nAnemia \n\nI am just so sick and tired of being sick and tired. And I still have to bust my butt at work, pay my bills and act like a regular happy go lucky ready to participate member of society 9-5:30 every day at my job. \n\nI feel like I am working to die. I will never retire. I will get sick and need to stop working. Then I will get more and more sick and hopefully if my government listened to the MAiD surveys then maybe I will get to die before I am 50 in 20 years. \n\nToday I just feel like total shit. It is a bad day. I am sick of people telling me to enjoy every day that I have! As if I am not already trying to do that. \nI am sick of people telling me to be positive when  I actually break my boundaries and confide in them. \n\nI am tired of people just not understanding and getting uncomfortable and telling me some shitty new age bullshit equivalent to 'Eat, Pray, Love'. I have bills to pay, mouths to feed and a job to go to. There is no Daddy Warbucks coming to feel sorry for me and paying for some 5 star vacation to take this heavy load off of my mind. \n\nFuck this disease and screw people who do not know or want to understand  that it is to know your future is shit. Added note- I was a bit tipsy when ai wrote this. I feel A LOT better. I think I just needed to purge all the negativity and have a bit of a pity party. Which I think is totally healthy (maybe not so much the added drinks but I find it hard to cry about these sorts of things without motivation)\n\nFeeling much better this morning and back to my regular hopeful but realistic baseline. Ready to accept my future and continuing to just enjoy life day to day. \n\nI honestly think sometimes  we just need to cry. This disease sucks, you do not always have to put on a brave face. Damn. That is a lot to be dealing with. Lets be friends. You sound awesome. HD sucks. Sometimes we need to do that. I get how you feel though. I am pre-symptom positive with chronic migraines, foot problems that make it hard to walk long distances or stand a long time, so also fat, and hypoglycemic. Totally never going to retire. Just going to get sicker and have to stop worrying.\n\nSo I do not plan my life around retirement. I do not have that as a goal. I have a retirement account, but I think of it as a when I get sick account. Or an after I die for my kids and husband's account. And I do not really prioritize it like some people do.\n\nI find happiness in my good days, from within (major therapy help) and from my husband. I make a point of taking trips of a lifetime now instead of padding my retirement account. And sometimes I have days where I vent and cry and rage at the world because none of this is fucking fair. But those are less off then they were before I tested positive, so I do not regret knowing the future.\n\nBesides, HD or not, we could die in a car accident tomorrow and never get to retire anyways. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone. \n\nAnd we have the advantage of knowing we do not get tomorrow. So we can take better advantage of today then anyone counting on retirement.\n\nAlso, I am pretty sure retirement is boring as hell. I had a four month summer vacation from college a few years back. Did not get a job (oh yeah, 3 sleep disorders too) because I was trying to focus on health, getting tonsils out etc. I almost lost my mind from boredom. \ud83d\ude02 I cannot imagine doing that endlessly for a decade or more. \n\nIf you do not have a good therapist I highly recommend finding one. If you want to reach out to someone who gets it you can always dm or post here. Glad you are feeling better today. Try not to add guilt to any of the things you are feeling. HD is horrendous and evil and my best friend has it and is symptomatic so I totally am not talking about that here, ok?\n\nBut... aside from that. Look into the MTHFR mutation. Taking a vitamin with methylated folate may help you as much as it helped me with my migraines/fat/hair loss.

You deserve for your symptom-free years to be as happy and pain-free as possible. I am sorry you are struggling, and I sincerely hope this helps. Hey, I am symptomatic and positive.  I find it super helpful and interesting when HD+ ppl post the other things that are going on in their health.  I have several other things going on that were dismissed as unrelated to HD, but after a lot of research I have found are entirely related.  Insulin resistance, for instance.\n\nAnd totally relate to both the venting (necessary) and the hopeful but realistic baseline :-)    \nAgreed, you do not have to put on a brave face or be the 'perfect' (aka uncomplaining) patient.

I have been tremoring a bit more, but nothing has really changed for the past year. Meds? Normal progression? My doctor just tells me I am doing fine. Anyone else go through that? Anxiety seems a pretty normal feature.  A lot of the literature says that maintaining consistency in your schedule/daily life helps to mitigate some of the anxiety that is common.  You can get something to cut the anxiety down as well, and your doctor can give you the best advice on that.      \n\nBut, tell me that when you told your doctor that you are having major panic attacks, he did not respond with \"nah, you are doing fine.\"    \n\nThat would be terrible. My doctor tells me that there is nothing *else* wrong with me and suggested the anxiety is more environment based. Thing is, everything is fine otherwise and the panic attacks seem random and for no reason, from my perspective.

That is what I wrote in the article. HD stimulates raw emotion, I get that. I am not sure what pissed you off about the first paragraph? It is not my intention. Maybe the headline gave the impression it was going to be assuming we should not be living normal lives as long as we can? So I went in it crabby? I do not know. Safe to say emotional response to hd and associated stuff is wildly unpredictable. Maybe I will give it another chance. Maybe thinking about *whispered* (then) still scares the pants off me.

I appreciate that the author has found a way to feel good about going to work every day, but that does not mean the same logic must apply to the rest of us. \nI think it is a bit of a shame that we all feel pressured to work and then have to find a way to justify it to ourselves so we do not feel the utter despair of the fact that we spend so much time working. Reconciling with this reality is bad enough for a normal person, let alone someone with a stunted life timeline \u2014 the HD patient.\n\n My mom, who has HD, is showing a lot of symptoms; she lost her job last month and will thankfully qualify for disability and therefore have a small income. Although it is been a traumatic path to this point, and although she is been forced out of a job, this shitty road has lead her to finally \u201cretire,\u201d and do so earlier than she would ever dreamed before she got the diagnosis. Now that she finally started taking some mood stabilizers, she is actually acting like herself again, and finds small joys in each day. If only she had not felt so pressured to work herself to death while she still felt symptom-free. Her house would have been smaller, her lifestyle different, but her stress-level lower, her time with friends and family and her own hobbies and pursuits greater. \nWe all have a choice about work. Everyone is in their own circumstance and should choose a lifestyle which makes the most sense for them and brings them the most quality of life possible.

That was the main reason I got tested because I did not want her to do IVF If she did not have to.\n\nBut I also did not want to take someone else\u2019s spot in case I tested negative.

Joe\u2019s mom is Huntingtons positive and he is currently living at risk. He said he would get tested before he he has kids. \n\nWhat HELPCUREHD does is remove the financial burden that IVF has on families that are at risk and do not want to potentially pass the gene down to their kids.

This grant will cover, for the selected couple(s), the cost of pre-cycle screening fees, fertility medication, IVF procedure costs, and genetic testing of the embryos.\nSelected applicants will receive funding for one round of PGD-IVF.

Thanks for reading! ", "Huntington's and COVID Vaccine Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone had advice about how I can get my mom on board with the COVID vaccine. I can hit her with all the science and anecdotes (I am in medical school) but she claims she had an \"allergic reaction\" to the H1N1 vaccine (which I do not remember happening) and that is why she does not want this one. I would feel much more comfortable if she got it and have told her as such. As well, our province has introduced a vaccine mandate for dining in public. She does not leave the house much anymore due to her poor mobility but going out for supper is something we do enjoy. As I am sure some of you know sometimes HD can make our loved ones hard to reason with. Does anyone have any advice? TIA! &lt;3 I am neither a medical practitioner nor a therapist but I will toss in my 2c. \n\nIt sounds like you think the mostly likely path to her agreeing to vaccination is talking about the things she will be able to do if she does. I tend to agree. If the science does not persuade her then maybe a list of non scientific benefits might. Maybe talk about good times you all have had dining out. \"Remember that time..?\" Or \"remember that great meal?\"\n\nOf course there is always the chance that there is something deeper going in. Something even your mother may not be aware of. Schedule the shot for her a couple weeks out. Let her get angry then get over it. She may still cancel on the day but you have a chance. What about having an allergic reaction to covid? Maybe helping point out the differences between how the types of vaccines interact with the body will help?\n\nSay if the H1N1 shot had been structured more like a traditional flu shot (I am not certain if it has, but as a med student I am betting you can easily find out the info, or you mag already know). The COVID vaccine, specifically the mRNA ones, is a completely different type of vaccine, and this does not interact with the body in the same way as the flu shot.\n\nPerhaps understanding the differences between the two types may help assuage her fears of a reaction?", "elderly father\u2019s medical chart says \u201cakinetic variant rigid Huntington disease (HCC)\u201d but he is never said anything to me about it Hi everyone, I am (26F) in a weird position right now and could use advice. My biological dad is 80 and has been having health issues for a long time\u2014 he is had two heart attacks and he has some senility. He is still up and about though. A few months ago, he went to the ER for persistent diarrhea, and tests were done and he was given medication.\n\nI went on his online medical chart to see when his next appointment was and under the diagnosis section, it says Akinetic-rigid variant of Huntington disease (HCC) and suggests occupational therapy. He is never said anything about this to me, and he is never mentioned the occupational therapy.\n\nAt first, I wondered if this was a mistake. Nobody in his family that I am aware of has Huntington\u2019s, and he is 80 and is still mobile and talking. I wonder if this is something that shows up as a possibility in some blood diagnosis but does not mean he has it?\n\nOf course, my other concern is kind of selfish; if he has it, that means I could have it. He could be hiding it from me? Or he forgot what the doctor told him? Or it is a mistake? It is a dna thing so you would have a 50/50 If you have it, would it present at the same age as the parent who gave you the gene?  It generally does if the parent is female, it generally presents in a younger age if the parent is male. Usually it works out that way, there are all kinds of theories about it. From what I understand if your mom gives it to you you are likely the same \u201cnumber\u201d of repeats as your mom, if your dads given it you there is a higher chance of a higher number. If he is got to 80 that is pretty solid. \n\nHonestly there is a really good chance there will be a treatment for you if you do carry it.\n\nI would suggest you see a neurologist for a consultation Thanks for your help \u2014 this is a small but good sub! Do you need to talk about it? I think I am still in denial. I think my father is, too. He found out in November but did not tell anyone. He laughed it off when I asked him about it today and called me neurotic and \u201cpsychic\u201d (he meant psychotic). Then he said he did not remember. I called the nurse and she said that it is unlikely that the chart is wrong, but that he needs to come in so a doctor can interpret the results. I scheduled an appointment for him. I do not have insurance, and so getting myself tested is going to require a lot of legwork. I have two other older sisters, but I am the one living with him. They have no idea and I do not know how to tell them. I know I need to know because I am not going to spend the next 6 years in grad school if that is the case. It is hard to stop researching this long enough to prepare for class tonight. Checkout hdbuzz.net Not always the case...my number is the same as my dad's", "Not sure of where to begin Sorry in advance for the long post.\n\nI am looking for some help and really unsure of how to proceed. I recently read about Huntingdon's and am concerned that my boyfriend should seek out a neurologist.  Last July (2019), he was going through some depression and anxiety and quit his job.  He was having an increasingly difficult time getting along with other people and had a lot of apathy towards work and life in general. It was causing him stress and major depression. We met in October of that year via a mutual friend. At that time my friend who has know him for years, mentioned that he can be frequently moody, which I have experienced myself over the course of the year. A year ago, I noticed that he was developing a tic. it was just a eye blink at the time. Which we chalked up to all the stress/anxiety. He was having trouble going out in public, even things like the grocery store were difficult and unmanageable for him. Over the course of the year the tic has progressed, from just a eye blink, to a shoulder shrug, to some small arm and torso movement, and also now a vocal sneeze or tsk like sound that is present as well. The tics have gotten worse and been present for over a year now, and he is starting to get frustrated by them. He has no history of tics or anything similar in his childhood. He is 35, so they first showed up last year.\n\nOne of the factors that caused him to leave his career as software developer was that he having trouble keeping up with learning new things and changes. Although he reports that he has never done well with change. Shortly after leaving a friend offered him some temp work on a project, but he had a anxiety/panic attack because he could not face learning something new and downloading the various things he would need. A couple of months ago he got a job, working for a small company that was using older technology, that he felt we knew really well and therefore would not have to learn anything new. But he had to quit a few days ago because we was frustrated and anxious at not being able to solve the coding problems, something he previously excelled at. It came very easily to him before.\n\nUnfortunately his personality has become little abrasive and  as a result he has lost touch with all most all his friends this year. He personality has changed quite a bit, and he generally has apathy towards  most things, and became very conspiracy minded. He used to be quite social. He is not currently speaking to his parents.\n\nI have being getting increasingly concerned about the tics, and in researching them realized tics in adulthood are rarer. Which is when I came across Huntingdon's. He does not have any obvious family history that we know, but he also does not know a whole lot about his extended family. His dad has restless leg syndrome and some other things that I think are depression or something that he takes medication for. I do not know specifically what for. But  I do know that something was going on with his dad at the same age. When he was in his mid 30's, he had some kind of \"mental breakdown\" that led to him being hospitalized and he has seen a counselor/psychiatrist and medicated ever since.  His dad's personality completely changed and as a result he his very reluctant to see anyone or doctors that might medicate him, as he does not want to be like his dad.\n\nI am working on figuring out how to get  him to see a doctor as he has no insurance or income and has not been to a doctor in about 10 years or more. He is also pretty paranoid and resistant to wearing a mask.\n\nI know only seeing neurologist can give specific answers. But I am wondering if any of this lines up with other peoples experience of Huntingdon's? Sometimes when seeking answers for things it is easy to just see symptoms or circumstances that could fit everywhere. I know it could be many things. But since I am essentially the only person in his life this feels very overwhelming. Huntington's can spontaneously occur, but it is extremely rare. If dad has had it for 20+ years, it would be pretty apparent by now, but it does not sound like that is the case. What is the status of mom? His mom does not have anything in her health history that would come close. I know that essentially we cannot know anything without  having him seen by a neurologist. It just unusual because the other possibilities are equally statistically unlikely /rare, such as adult onset of Tourette's. Yeah, it does not sound like Huntington's, given his family history, but it is definitely time to see a neurologist to get this sorted out.", "My gf tested positive and i have few questions I do not know  if this detail matter but both me and my gf are 21 year old and both are girls my gf did not wanted to get tested  but her mom had it and died at the age of 40 something happened and gf had to go to hospital and the doctor made her get tested and she is positive\n\nBefore dating my girl now i dated and was in love with someone else she got killed at the age of 23 and we dated for 2 years\n\nSo the thought of my now SO dying soon scares me is she going to die young ? Or there is any way to extend her life and not having her be in pain  ? If her mom died at 40 does this mean my gf will die at the same age ?\n\nGf refuse to eat a meal most times and that make me sad  and she hardly get any sleep is this going to impact her ? \n\nId love to talk more about her illness to understand  how to help more and what could i do but she dont like talking about so I would appreciate any advice from here\n\n\nPs:sorry formatting bad iam not english speaker bear with me Lots of these questions are answered in the sub. Read through past posts to gather information. I tried tho thanks Let me start by saying I am not a doctor and nothing I say is a substitute for you or your girlfriend consulting with one. That said, here is what I know from my research and experience of a father and brother who both had it.\n\n1. Is she going to die young? \nHard to say with certainty, but Huntington\u2019s tends to express itself more strongly in successive generations meaning the child of a parent with Huntington\u2019s will have an earlier onset of symptoms and they are likely to be more severe. My father lived surprisingly long to age 71, but my brother passed just last year at the age of 51. Again, she needs to consult a doctor to get advice specific to her.\n\n2. Is there a way to extend her life and not have her be in pain? \nCurrently, no. There is medical research going on with lots of treatments being explored, but you can only use medications to manage and partially mitigate the symptoms. You cannot stop the progression of the disease.\n\n3. GF hardly eats or sleeps, will this be a problem? \nHaving a regular schedule of meals and sleep is preferred for people with Huntington\u2019s. Once the disease becomes active it affects the body by having a protein build up in the brain which starves it for oxygen and kills portions of it slowly. Having irregular sleep is not likely to help this process. Additionally one of the struggles for late stage Huntington\u2019s patients is they tend to both burn more calories from irregular movements (Huntington\u2019s Chorea) as well as increasing difficulties eating and drinking due to loss of motor skills and difficulties swallowing. Having a regular diet and healthy weight prior to disease onset is helpful, and once HD becomes active patients are usually encouraged to increase their calorie intake significantly.\n\nI wish I could give you better advice, but the truth is it is an awful disease and I can understand why your girlfriend may not be ready to face it. As far as helping, the best you can do is support her in figuring out what she wants her life to be and make sure she knows what sources of help (medical, therapy, spiritual) she can turn to and support her in seeking them out. She will need a lot of patience and support, but also be aware that this will be tough for you too - do not be afraid to seek help for yourself. If you have other questions I will do my best to answer them as I can, currently at work. To help you get started in your research, I can provide you a bit of info..\n\n1st and foremost, do a search for Huntingtons (HD) in your language to get you a bunch of info rather quickly. \n\nHD patients usually have a slow progression over several years.  The rate of progression varies depending on the CAG count (search Google for more info).  HD patients will progressively get worse and, as of now, there is no way to slow it down (yet!).  \n\nThere is promising research going on that will hopefully be our savior or at least slow it down (I are not ready to die).  It is hard (sooo very hard) not to get excited over some of the trials going on but I thought that 10 years ago too.  Take that for what is worth.\n\nBefore having children, please consult a DR.  Until then please do not have unprotected sex or without some form of birth control.  This is the only way to to eliminate HD for good.  Full disclosure, l have 2 children and we did not know about HD then.  They have not been tested.  Hopefully I did not pass it along and sentence them to an early death. I have a brother and sister who refuse to get tested.\n\nI have HD.  I am alive and well.  Eventually it will catch up with me but, until then, it is time to live life to the fullest. \n\nTo the HD community,  if I misspoke, please feel free to correct me.  I only have info from the HDSA conferences I attended and my family's struggles with HD over the last 10+ years.\n\nLook... we are all going to go.  HD is a shitty way to go but so is a lot of other ways to die.  For those facing HD:\n\n-Live your life.  \n\n-Take precautions to not pass it on to the next generation. \n\n-Stay informed. \n\n-Get involved in the HD community. \n\n-Find a support group (locally or online).\n\n-Not every twitch is the beginning of the end.  Do not overthink this.\n\nStay safe.  Wear a mask.  Hope this helps. You said this much better than I! Great advice!\n\nSupport is key. You gave great specific advice with stuff they can use to educate themselves, do not sell yourself short. I dunno, I think both of you gave great advice and helpful direction. I would be glad to have had both of you respond if I had asked these questions. I disagree with item 2. Physical therapy can extend both life and quality. Starting early with sprirometer training helps with swallowing, the most common natural form of death. A diet with good healthy food and plenty of rest will also help with nerve death. Stress reduction as well. \n\nRest is spot on. \n\nThe new drugs are amazing and showing signs of working. They really can be a game changer in time for your girl. I would be absolutely delighted to be wrong about that. My dad did not have much in the way of PT resources. My brother did and actually had the good fortune to be in a facility with a unit specifically tailored to the management of HD, but unfortunately he was not willing to cooperate with almost all of the PT/OT they offered and barely cooperated with basic daily hygiene due to some paranoid delusions he suffered from an unrelated metabolic disorder. I agree that good diet and exercise can help slow the progression, but it will not stop it. I will defer to you on the knowledge of drugs that help, glad to hear there have been good developments. Compliance is very very hard. I should try harder with my lady. Part of a less stressful life is not pushing on stuff like that. I am also blessed with a low CAG mutation value and a sweet disposition to start with. \n\nSomething else I did not mention was ketogenic diet, it can increase the type of energy that can cross the blood brain barrier. Again, compliance is hard. Aww thank you so much we had a talk and she opened up a little bit more so this was helpful as well ill read more and try to find a book if possible about kids we are lesbians lol Thanks so much that was helpful  i hope i can get her to eat proper meals and get her to sleep hard cause she have ptsd  have a nice day", "anybody have an idea hey everyone hope you are having a great day, my mums suffered from HD for the past seven years and due to the coronavirus my family cannot see her (she lives in a home for people suffering from HD) we have been able to talk to her over face time but at this point, she only says loud mumbles of words so it is gotten to the point of guessing what she is saying so just wondering if anybody uses some sort of app to find out what their family members are saying because it would help my mum out a lot \n\nthanks for listening to me ramble on This is so hard. It is difficult enough to work out what someone is saying when you are physically with them. I can only imagine the frustration of trying to do it over video. I am sorry you are having to deal with this. \n\nHD took my Mom in 2017. We did not have any luck finding what you are looking for.\n\nI just found voiceitt.com which looks promising but probably not ready for your mum yet. Have you checked with any HD organizations? Browsing through hdsa.org reminded me that speech therapists know a lot about this type of thing. They may not know HD but may have ideas on how to make this work a little better for you all.", "huntington tutoring  Gooroo is a subscription-based educational technology company that provides exceptional on-demand courses and personalized tutor matching.\n\nPhone Number:\n(646) 791-3081 This post sounds like spam. How is that website related to HD? I agree, they have not explained how this relates at all. It is clearly spam. It is very bad and  insensitive doing spam on a group like this. I reported it. i hope bees sting you in your eyeballs", "I am new and just got tested positive for Huntingtons. Hey everyone. My husband is a long time redditor and recommended me this sub-reddit to find people to talk to. \n\nThe disease is on my dad's side, and has essentially wiped everyone out in their family. My great grandma, grandma, 2 uncles, and my dad all had it (and who knows how much further back it goes). My dad was diagnosed when I was 6, and most of my memories of him are of my \"sick dad\". Never really got to know my REAL dad, the man he was before he got sick. I thought Huntington's was a somewhat normal disease when I was younger because so many people in my life suffered from it.\n\nI had always been afraid of being diagnosed with it the moment I found out it was genetic. I feared it my entire life, and I was so sure that I had it, but never had the balls to get tested. I just wanted my life to be mine, and not knowing was better than knowing for a long time.\n\nI met my husband in undergrad school, and we had a daughter, (who is almost 3! D;) and got married and finally settled down in a house. My husband has always known about this disease being in my family. He did his internship in hospice care, and worked with 1-2 Huntington's patients, and he really grew to know the disease.  That is actually one of the reasons I married him because I knew if I did test positive, he would take good care of me and would have an idea of what to do (though he is never actually lived with it).\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I started experiencing some severe brain fog, short term memory problems, and trouble concentrating. I figured it was probably due to an anti-depressant I had been on for awhile so I decided to see a therapist &amp; psychiatrist. Nothing seemed to change, so my husband and I thought for sure I had ADD. But there was just that prominent sign poking out in front of my face every day that said HUNTINGTONS. I was in a much more secure place than I was when I used to want to get tested at 19 (good fucking thing I did not). So I talked to my husband about how I wanted to get tested just to rule things out so I did not have to keep suffering with not knowing. All of this crap going on right now was more worrisome than getting tested, so I got my blood drawn about a month ago.\n\nMy results appointment was for the 15th, and on the 8th, I found out I was pregnant, which was completely unexpected! I really wanted to believe it was something else that was wrong with me. Like, what horrible God/entity/etc. would make a sick woman pregnant, right? The minute I heard the counselor say, \"unfortunately\" I lost it. I had the exact same results as my dad too.\n\nI have been a mess ever since. Not only am I pregnant, but now I have to hope that things will not progress any further than they already are now. This mental crap has been the worst thing to ever happen to me, and now it will only get worse from here? Made some calls/texts to friends who were anxiously waiting for my results. A lot of people who did not know what to say (obviously, and I do not blame them).  My husband has been extremely supportive and has been my rock these last few days. I have a lot of crying spells, as I am sure a lot of you out there probably experienced. Right now, I am just so mad. I am mad at God and the world. I really wanted to put an end to this after all the beautiful souls that were taken away far too early. And I am mad because I was not even 26 when I first had symptoms. How fucked up is that?!  Usually you do not start showing symptoms until your 30s or 40s (and I realize 26 is CLOSE to 30, but I am still in my 20s- I am young). \n\nI was sort of spiraling last night and sobbing as I texted my husband when he was at work. My mom was completely against me getting tested because she knew it had ruined people when the results came back positive. And I tried to stay optimistic, like \"oh I have got a lot of support and at least getting a positive result at my age can get me into a lot of trials\". And I was so mad at myself last night. I wished so badly I could undo what I did. My world was mine and I was happy and it was just me living with symptoms with no known cause. A pregnant happy mom and wife. This completely broke me, and my poor husband has been picking up the pieces. I just feel like I am going to be a terrible mom this time around because my cognitive skills suck. What if I have to do something really important for the baby and I am stuck on auto-pilot? What if I miss something and the baby gets hurt/sick? And my 2 year old adores babies, so I think she will be really into helping and whatnot, but there is only so much she can do.\n\nToday was a good day though. Like I said, back and forth emotions. Yesterday I cried A LOT and today I was fine. Have my daughter here to hang out with, my mom is staying the night. I am not crying myself to sleep and hyperventilating. Currently, I am excited about this baby. I am just so scared to see when and how soon more symptoms will arise. I think I was given my daughter when I was 24 so I can see her grow up and spend more time with her than my father did. I was so hopeful for that, but she is not even 3 and I am already having issues /:\n\nI am so sorry for the long post. I even tried to make it short, but I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it.\n\nGoing to look into support groups around here too, but I thought joining an online community so to speak would be helpful too. Any tips, information, or whatever you want to throw my way is appreciated. \n\nHope to get to know some of you! I am so sorry.  My husband is 40 and has been diagnosed for 6 years, but has obviously had it longer.  It is a very tough road.  If I can offer support, please let me know. I do not wish this disease on anyone.  I wish you all the very best and hope your symptoms hold off for as long as possible, it sounds like you have a very loving and supportive partner which is awesome. \n\nI went in to get my referral to a genetic clinic last week and as a mid 20's guy the idea of a diagnosis is both scary and reassuring. \n\nIf I know I am going to develop then I have time to plan for my future and enjoy myself, I think to not know and just have this massive cloud of doubt is more worry than a definitive answer but I understand everyone deals with things differently. \n\n\n\n Positive here too. LIVE. Spend time with those you love. Laugh, cry and enjoy it all. \nTake part in every research program that you can. Work towards prevention of this 'thing'. Do it for your kids.\nMy heart goes out to you and your family. My heart goes out to you. I am 27F and pregnant and they refuse to test me until after the baby. I am finally in the mind set that I want to know but waiting is the worst.\n\nLive your life. Document everything. Start a blog for your child with memories and pictures. \n\nMy brother\u2019s symptoms started showing at age 20 and he has 4 kids. I started a blog just for them so I could document everything with them and their dad.  I am so, so sorry. My heart goes out to you and your family. \n\nI was wondering- have your doctors or care team been helpful? Did you have neuropsych and neurological testing done to assess the extent of your symptoms, and did they refer you to resources in your area like counseling, diet / exercise, or occupational therapy? None of these things are going to fix you, of course, but they can all improve quality of life. So can staying mentally active, like doing new things, crossword puzzles, write letters to your children, etc. Practicing cognitive skills certainly does not hurt them.   I am at risk and wanting to get tested too, when it is financially feasible to me. But I am also hoping to get into Huntington's and neurological research and there really are some promising treatments on the horizon and our knowledge and understanding of the disease increases every year.  Same here! I cannot afford to get tested just yet and it sucks  Just to preface I am 28, also pre-huntingtons I have known since I was 18 and I think we are both in a similar place symptoms wise right now.\n\n___________\n\n&gt;I just feel like I am going to be a terrible mom this time around because my cognitive skills suck.\n\n\n\nIt was my mother that had it, and she was in her late 20s when she had my sister and I. I totally relate with the whole \"sick\" parent feeling and yeah it is definitely going to be hard for your kids no matter what you do.\n\nBut you have to realize by now that you being at this stage will not at all prevent you from being an awesome mother. Mine holds a very fond place in my memories and made us both better people for everything she did, we definitely will not forget.\n\n A good parent with Huntingtons is **far** better than the huge portion of negligent parents without it.\n\n________________\n\nFor me it took a couple years to start accepting having huntingtons but I am sure it varies for everyone. I have been finding a lot of comfort in philosophy (audio books are great when driving since I have a hard time focusing on books now.) \n\nI think it is important to be able to evaluate yourself objectively, be especially alert for any self destructive behavior.\n\nI do not know if this is helpful at all and sorry for being long winded. Remember you are still the same person you were before you got tested, so do not let this control you, there are still good days ahead! If you are ever in Central Ohio, I will give you the biggest hug I can. (I am a very large man so that is saying something). I lost my mom to late onset HD last spring. Sounds like you have a loving family around you. You will need them. I have never met you but my heart is breaking for you. The best thing you have going for you is time. You are young and I am always reading about new treatments. Best of luck. Do not forget about the hug.  My wife tested positive about twenty years ago. At first, there were tears and anger. As time went on, we did many of the things we knew we would not be able to do when the symptoms became severe. We traveled a lot. We also put our finances in good order so that would not be a future concern. For us, knowing she was positive, changed our lives in a way of living each day more fully.\n\nIn the time since her diagnosis, medical science is making tremendous advances in treating both symptoms and looking for a cure. We have participated in research and trials. We have raised funds for HD. We, she, is not going to be easily beaten. Above all we hold onto hope that a cure will soon be found. \n\nI am wishing for you the best and I will be holding on to hope for you and all of us in this journey.  Yes, I do have a wonderful support system. I am extremely lucky! I know what you mean though, about the cloud of doubt. So many things would happen to me and I would just feel so stuck. Too afraid to get tested, but too anxious to not know (if that makes sense). Just reached a point where I was finally okay with knowing.\n\nI hope everything works out in your favor&lt;3 I agree, this is the worst disease I have ever seen. It just ruins so much of a person in every way. It is terrifying for me to know I will end up like my dad. He was so depressed when he reached a certain point though. We had to put him in a nursing home and he only lasted like a year before he passed away.\n\nAnd thank you, I will definitely reach out if I need anything :) That is what I would love to do. Since it is still fairly new, I will probably be back and forth for awhile. Fine one day, a mess the next. I think right now I am just angry at whoever's upstairs, you know? It will dissolve in time once I am able to fully accept it. I think I will be able to see my kids grow up for awhile, which will be wonderful. Assuming I do not start getting worse anytime soon. But I noticed a pattern in my dad's family where they all get the shitty symptoms in their 40s, so fingers crossed I will at least have a healthy-ish decade! Wow! 20 is so young, I am so sorry :( There was a part of me that insisted I was showing symptoms that young too, but I never got tested until now, so who knows? Cannot get that fear out of your head if you have lived with it. Not knowing is hard. There was such an ungodly amount of fear and anxiety thinking about it all. \n\nMy doctor asked me if I wanted to test the baby for Huntington's but I said hell no! This baby is here for a reason, nothing would ever make me give it up. Also, since I do want this baby and did find out they had the gene, I would feel so guilty living my life with this knowledge. That is for them to want to figure out on their own.\n\nPraying for you too. Hope your pregnancy goes well and I hope you will have a clear head soon.  Not just yet. Once I got my results, the counselors said they put in a referral for me to see a neurologist but they said it could take a few months until I hear from them. My husband and I are going to start exercising soon, and I am in therapy now so I have got a lot of things covered for now. Just do not feel like losing any more precious time waiting! I want to start trials as soon as possible.  Yeah, it is an expensive test! I got really lucky that my insurance covered it or else I would have never gotten it done. I love seeing articles about the new and awesome things they are doing. Gives me some hope. I super doubt it will happen during my time, but maybe when my daughter is older? At least she will not have to dread it so much growing up if there is a cure or at least a way to prolong the disease or it is symptoms. We are so god damn close!! You are absolutely right. I would choose my dad 100x over a negligent parent. He taught me so much without even realizing it. I hate that I cannot read like I used to though. I was such a bookworm and was always reading 2-3 books at a time. It is definitely started to take away some of my favorite parts of me. \n\nDefinitely have to remind myself that fairly often already and it is only been a few days, that I am still the same person with the same life and the same family and friends. Trying to put the Huntington's in the back of my mind so I do not cry and dwell too much. My husband is the one who is really been keeping me together. which is awesome. I love going to work too cause it keeps my mind occupied! Lol. Thanks for your sweet words and great advice, I appreciate it&lt;3 Thanks, haha, That is very sweet of you! Sorry to hear about your mom though. It sucks big time to lose a parent. It is an awful kind of pain no one will ever understand, especially if they had Huntington's. It is kind of a bittersweet release. They get to be in peace now, but you are still stuck down here without them. The first year is the hardest though, so I hope you have got some family and friends to support you too! Same here! The day after we found out I had it, my husband who is super strict and paranoid about money 24/7 said he would take me to a concert I had been wanting to go to, but we were a little tight for cash. There is even talks of visiting my family in Florida soon, which would be awesome to have all that added support and to just get away. And your right, medical science has come a long way in just a span of 20 years. I appreciate all you guys have done to support the HD community, I aspire to be like you two!  I am guessing the \u201crules\u201d differ by state. They would not allow me to test the baby for HD...even though I would not want to. \n\nThe anxiety of not knowing is unreal. Every time I drop something, forget words or peoples name, etc I am like \u201care these symptoms?\u201d It drives me insane thinking and researching.  What is your CAG ? Right, I never wanted to get my first tested when I told my doctor about my family history. I get why they suggest the genetic testing. I guess it is more for those thinking they might not want a baby with HD but a baby is such a gift! I would never bother getting it tested, that is completely up to them when the time comes.\n\nI have thought that way about Huntington's for years too. I am an especially clumsy girl, but I could not help think with every stumble, this is it. It just sucks that this is something we know inside and out because we have lived it, so we know what symptoms to expect.   On allele 1, it was 21. 2 was 49. I got the exact same test results my father got, which I thought was pretty crazy. I am not sure how often that happens. Just be proactive. Dont let it own you. Prepare. Find out all of the services that are available to you and at what stage you can access them. Where i go, just helped me through a rather nasty bout of depression. Its not just the physical stuff. Its mental as well. Investigate all things. Use what you need. Prepare for what is coming. You have kids, but there is NO POINT stressing over if they will have it or not. By doing the best for you and your family you will model for them as to what to do. Talk heaps with youe husband. You are in this together. You may go though it but he will be suffering too. Most importantly. Live. Enjoy what you have. Good luck. I really want to be. I was going to call the counseling center to see if they can get the ball rolling on my neurologist referral, but I was not able to this afternoon cause I left my keys in my car, and I had to wait over an hour for help. But I definitely want to start as soon as possible! I do not even know where to begin. What kinds of things are you doing? I have an immense knowledge of Huntington's, but I am horrible at finding out what I should do next. I did not quite prepare for this as well as I had hoped, so I am kind of just put zing around. I have been having a lot of good days again, which is nice. Work is an amazing filler, it keeps my head occupied for 7 hours or so, which is awesome. Second the neuropsych exam, it can lead your team to use the proper treatments. Since all HD progresses differently you need that. It is expensive and insurance will give you a problem.\n That is so interesting. In my area they will not test unless you have already gone through neurological and neuropsych testing. You are not in the US?\n\nThat is great that you are going to start exercising and that you are in therapy! You are not losing time if you are exercising, eating right, and staying mentally active. That is really the best that you can do at this point. Trials are definitely promising but are often ways to give to others more than yourself, since there is no guarantee that they will work, or that you will be in the study group. But you will get there too!  I am in my 20s and also have Huntington's. It sucks but at least we have enough time for a cure to come out. Science and technology are moving at a fast pace, compared to a decade ago.  Hey I am an at risk Mom of 2, I am 27. Here to talk if you need it.  Thanks \u2764\ufe0f Hey just wanted to check in for an update. Similar to my family. Everyone has started showing symptoms between 25-30. My dad was the only one not to . He died at 35 from cancer.

Does it matter where i am? I think you should be careful here. These are real people going through the hardest thing possible. I do not want to see an article where you criticize these people for their choice.\n\nSome folks might feel like science is catching up to the illness, that having children is a joyous experience they want to have before they get ill, some may make a poor decision because they are already ill. In no way will this article be about criticizing people for their choice. The intent is for it to be an empathetic piece exploring the challenging position certain people are in. \n Thank you so much. I will check with my editor on the location and get back to you.  It is very tough. My step mother called me selfish for wanting kids when I have a gene positive status. She even went as far to ask my dad if he would have had me if he knew....thankfully his answer was yes! \n\nShe is highly religious and thinks that I would pass it on. Unlike her I understand the science available to ensure that I do not pass it on.

I am sure everyone here can understand what a hard year it is been, but in many ways we have been very lucky. She did not even start showing symptoms until she was 53, and even now she her symptoms are on the mild to moderate side. However, after many years as a independent civilian technology consultant for the nearby Air Force base and part time junior high middle school teacher, her symptoms have progressed enough that she can no longer work. \n\nOne of the most painful things to deal with has been to watch my mom, who has alway been vivacious, commanding and constantly bustling around in control of everything, turn into someone who spends hours and hours every day sitting on the couch staring into space. I know she is bored and feels useless, but she simply does not have the capacity to do the things she used to do. \n\nI wish I could help her think of a hobby or service project that she could do from home while we are all at work during the day. We have suggested things like volunteering at the local library, but unfortunately she can no longer drive. She lives in a small and mostly isolated farming community. Plus, the Huntington\u2019s-induced personality changes have manifested in her as crippling anxiety. I would shell out for a personal driver or car service in a heartbeat, but the thought of leaving the house without my dad or one of her kids sends her into a panic.\n\nThis post is already far longer than I had intended, I am sorry. This is hard for me to talk about. \n\nTL;DR: any suggestions for in home activities/service projects to keep my mom with HD occupied and happy?  Maybe a small breed companion dog could keep her engaged. Audio books perhaps. I would not want to get her get too involved in hobbies or activities that would have to be given up as the disease progresses as that would be frustrating for her. Tough situation to be in. New things are pretty much out, new learning will be hard. List the things she liked to do, go back to her 20s. \n\nMy lady gardens, paints and listens to stories. None have a time limit, nor deal with people. \n\nUse callender  reminders for breaking up the day.  While I agree here I would be careful with a dog, unless there is someone else who can assist with caring for it.  Remembering food/water and walking the dog might become too much of a challenge for someone with HD. \n\nAlso to add to audio books, if she has a type of music she enjoys I have found that can really help with mood.", "Is it true that doctors will not test you if you do not have symptoms?

Thank you for your feedback, I really appreciate it. I signed up at UCLA to be contacted if they are filling any trials. Most of the time they are looking for symptomatic people though, and I am not (yet). How symptomatic are you talking? My mom is beginning to have neurological issues (her mind seems to be going, along with muscle weakness). It depends on the study and what stage the study is in. There may not be anything right now looking. \n\nI suggest reaching out and volunteering to be put on their study subject list. If you are anywhere UCLA I can look up the contact. I am in Enroll-HD open to all HD+ and at risk folks. Probably one of the bigger studies. \n\n ( My wife is signed up for the Roche/Genentech one with the drug injected through her spine. She has a pretty high CAG and was started to show symptoms. I legit think it working, but there is a chance we have the placebo and I am just seeing things. Regardless I think the study might be full across the U.S. right now. It is the most promising one, in Phase 3, but I know there are two others in Phase I that might also be promising. I know they prefer candidates who are closer to showing symptoms though, or those with a CAG &gt;44. I am in ENROL-HD but I am also currently non-symptomatic and my CAG is 43. \n\nI have also signed up to donate my brain to research when I die as well. As a member of the next generation that has a chance to have HD... Thank you very much.

But my CAG is also low so I know for sure one of the most recent trials I do not qualify for.

He is very much a \"I want all the information\" kind of guy. He tested positive. One sister got tested shortly after and is negative. My other sister and I have not been tested. Our general mindset is that there is not much value in knowing if we are positive since there are currently no ways to stop or cure HD. That seems like it may be changing in the foreseeable future, which is amazing.\n\nThere are lots of layers to this of course. Early diagnosis may mean earlier treatment which may reduce severity for a time. Being available for research. I have decided that I willfor sure get tested if either of my children starts talking about having children. My results could simplify their decision making.\n\nIf you are truly unsure about getting tested, get thee to a counselor. A genetic counselor might be optimal since they would likely be more familiar with this type of question. Thanks a lot for the information Up to you. My best friend decided not to test before she had children. Personal decision for every HD. She has now. And is positive. And has done every drug  trial possible including brain surgery. But she has two wonderful daughters. And even if all this testing does not keep  her with us, it seems really close,  and maybe her daughters will be.....\n\nIt is not enough. But it is more than when we had when we watched her dad suffer 25 years ago. It was painful waiting for the results for my girlfriend but now we know. We can actually make SMART and educated goals for life now. It is hard waiting but that may be because we are coming to terms with reality.\n\nYou will know if you are positive or not one day. You have some control over the terms in which you find out. Stay strong. Yes the austedo drug is a blessing it has helped my mom!", "Thinking of getting tested.. please help me with some questions! My mom had HD, and so do 2 of my 3 sisters. Im the last one in my family to get tested. \nFor the moment im 27 and im getting closer to get children, wich me and my girlfriend really wants. But before that i need to get tested and i think om getting ready now.\n\nBut its really hard, as you probobly know. I feel very scared and nervous!\nI hate when i tell people about this (wich is rare) \nAnd they tell me \u201dwhy Do not you just do it? I cannot be that difficult!\u201d. Its really not easy, its faaaaar from easy! And that is why i Do not tell people about it. \n\nI have made a pros and cons list and so far the pros got the most points but on the cons side it still have the heaviest point with \u201dmight have HD\u201d.\n\nAnyway, i have some questions and i hope you guys could help me. \n\nHave you got tested? \n\nIf yes, what happend and how did it feel?\n\nWhat do you think about the future, thinking of the research. Medicin is on the way, but when do you think it Will Come? \n\nAre you positive about the future? I got tested when i was 24. A few months after my dad got his test. Idk how he felt when he did his, but when i got tested i kind of went into it with a plan for the worst hope for the best mentality. I think it helped me cope when i did get a positive result cause i knew what if anything i was going to change. The process itself was \"easy\" they did a pre test counseling session and when they thought i was ready they ordered the test. It was a blood draw that they sent to get tested and when the results came back they went over it and discussed the next steps. The big next step was seeing a neurologist. I see them about twice a year now just to monitor my status and keep an eye on any changes. \n\nThere are alott of different trials going on even now so there is hope in the future. As far as changes ive made, I have started trying to learn a new language and doing brain exercises to keep it strong (no idea if there is evidence to support that they do but cannot hurt). In reality i think we all have a short time in this world and living it the best we can is all we can do. I hope this helps at all. I got tested 4 years ago. It was by far one of the hardest things I have ever done. The test is easy, but first I had to face my worst fear and keep moving! \n\nI have to say, now, I am way better mentally then before testing - and I have Huntington's. I do not regret it at all. I was in a similar place regarding having kids (just had IVF twins two months ago, genetic screen before implant so HD free for sure). Feel free to pm if you have questions or need support. I am not sure if genetic councelling is offered where you are as part of the testing, but if that is available I think that is a good place to start. \n\nI had my first appointment yesterday in the process of getting tested and it was with a genetic councellor. I found it very helpful. I was very nervous going into it, but I found it very reassuring that I am ready. They go over with you all the possible outcomes and discuss with you how you might feel about them, and in terms of planning for a family they can help you work through that as well because even if you are positive there can be options available.\n\nYou also depending on where you are and what the process is can have the option to stop or pause the process if you decide you are not ready after all. I got my first referral for genetic testing 6 years ago, filled out the family history paperwork and decided at that point I was not ready. Did not even go to the first appointment. But I have decided now at 29 that I do what to go through with it.\n\nI am reasonability optimistic with the ongoing research and trials going on. This is a great resource if you are looking for more information on that (\n\nI also participate in the Enroll HD research study, which is an observational study monitoring how the disease appears and changes over time. It is open to anyone with Huntington's or anyone who is at risk due to family history. \n\nBut yeah, really recommend looking into genetic councelling if you are thinking of getting tested. They are able to help you work through the process and give you all the information and tools you will need to make a decision. I tested positive anonymously recently with 40 repeats. My grandfather passed away at 90 with it.  His symptoms definitely affected his quality of life, but he was never completely debilitated as some are, so I am optimistic I will have a similar quality of life. I am in my late 30s. At least one of my siblings has also received a positive result. \n\nMy situation is a little different than most in that I am also HIV positive, which at the time of my diagnosis of that, felt way heavier than the HD news.  Maybe I got through the diagnosis trauma there. In any case, that was very much a grieving process. The HD was kind of like a second death...way less traumatic than the first. They both have made long-term dating feel too daunting to me. I am lonely. I have a great job, but feel unfulfilled. Suicide regularly enters my mind\n\nThe drug trials are promising. You can test embryos for CAG repeats. In my opinion... knowing v. not knowing... I would probably be better off never knowing I was at risk...but knowing I was at risk, I was living my life as if I was gene positive and so at least knowing for sure gave me some kind of starting point for dealing with it. Assuming you are in the US, you need to contact the nearest Center of Excellence for the HDSA for counseling. There is a lot more to it than just you personally -- those issue are certainly important, there is a lot more in play. I got tested 10 years ago shortly after my mother got tested positive. It was a no brainier for me, because I decided I did not want to live with the uncertainty of having it or not. I mean I knew there was a 50/50 chance that I got it, and that would not change, if I did not get tested.  \nFor me, it was important to know how to live my life. Do I have to plan for old age or do I blow my savings seeing the world and crossing of my bucket list? Do I want to have a child? Stuff like this.   \nBut that was my decision, and I will not look down on someone who is philosophy is \"ignorance is bliss\". In the end it is your life, and you have to live it. But I myself think, I would not have been able to forget the fear. I preferred certainty.", "1st Genetic Testing Appointment I am nervous for my first appointment. I will have to explain my reasoning for getting tested with a 25% risk as my parent does not want to get tested. I have the ability to get anonymous testing, but I want to get the results without my at-risk parent (parent is 50% risk) ever knowing. Will they be okay with this? I believe it is still my right to know regardless. The best advice I think I can give you my friend is that this is your life. Everyone deals with the threat of this disease differently. If it serves you best to know... Then know you must! Your family will understand because only you know how to best handle this threat, for you. I wish you all the very best and I will keep everything crossed for you. Please try not to worry about others as this is about you! Are you under 18?\n\nIf not, who cares. This is your life and your choice. Your parent has no say in this. I am in my 20s Yes, you can still get tested even if you do not know definitely that a parent has it or not (I think that is what you are asking). A couple of things, though that I would like to point out. It is completely unsolicited and you are welcome to ignore it. This is about YOU and nobody else, so do what you want. :) \n\n1st and foremost, this is your life and you have a right to know. The majority of people at risk, to my understanding, choose not too. And that is their choice. Just as it is your choice to find out. Now, you may need to accept the fact that if you are positive it is going to be VERY hard to keep that from them. Even the process of getting the results is emotionally taxing, and unless you are a helluva an actor they are going to know you are going through something. That does not mean you do not have a right to know nor does it mean you should try to hide it. Just be realistic that your parent is probably going to pick up on what is going on.\n\n2nd) I highly recommend doing the test anonymously. You have every right to know, but you do not want the insurance companies too. Not trying to scare you but long term care insurance and life insurance companies can exempt you from coverage if you are positive (at least last I heard).  \n\nGoing through this process is it is own kind of hell. And it is going to take some time. If you need someone to talk too please feel free to message me. I am happy to answer any questions I can and point you in the right direction if I cannot. All the best. Idk about your group of doctors but mine would not test me without my parent getting tested. They said \u201cdiagnosis by proxy is unethical.\u201d It is a tough decision I wish you the best and if your test comes out negative then no worries. But if not it will something you think about every day! As for long term insurance what most do not realize it has a cap which is about 5 years and they still ask you if you have any hereditary diseases in your family which can disqualify you. It is a shame that we have to worry about all the insurance issues I hope one day we do not. Good luck and take care of your self! It is absolutely your right. I would 100% do the anonymous testing. This will allow you to get affordable health insurance, life insurance, and even long term care insurance. There is also the issue of people finding out at work. People with HD can experience discrimination. They are less likely to get promoted and things like that. So my advice would be to keep it off your medical record for as long as possible if you can. \n\nBest of luck! Do you live with them? One of my family members\u2019 results was sent to her parents\u2019 house and the at risk parent opened her mail and inadvertently received my family member\u2019s diagnosis and their own. Be careful how you receive the results. Withholding medical testing from a consenting adult because a different adult will not consent to it is highly unethical. I would find another doctor or use a clinic. I live away from home  Hi there!! The only way your parent would know is if you told them. No one has access to your medical records except you. Your parent finding out without your consent is a direct violation of HIPPA laws. \n\nHOWEVER! The insurance companies have access to your entire life and soul so definitely do the test anonymously. My husband was at risk and took the test off of his insurance and was still denied life insurance pending a negative result. Ruthless and heartless companies. I went to the one in Wichita it is not he hdsa", "Thinking about kids Me and my fianc\u00e9 are thinking about kids. I am about to get tested soon and I am a bit nervous. \nBut my fianc\u00e9 wants to have it naturally. \n\nSo my question is, can u have it the natural way without risking it? \nHow did you guys do?? There is no way to reduce the risk with doing it naturally, unfortunately. The child will always have a 50% chance of getting it. \n\nThis is a very serious topic that I would encourage you to discuss with your genetic counselor. \n\nMy husband and I had one child naturally before we knew his mother had it. We just completed a round of IVF to reduce any chance of our second child having it. It was a hard decision to make but we want to try to eradicate this horrible disease. I realize that this is a luxury many cannot have though. \n\nBest of luck to you guys as you begin this challenging journey. If you test positive and still decide to have a child it would be the biggest dick move. To your own kid\n\nWhy cannot you just adopt? Yeah but its able to clean the sperms. Im not going to make a dick move. Thanks for the tips! I hope it all goes well for you Thanks and same to you. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. If you do decide that PGT-IVF is the way to go, Help Cure HD is a US-based charity that will pay for the medical costs if you are able to travel to a participating clinic located in one of a few cities (Houston and Cleveland I think). Applications are currently suspended due to covid, but should resume this year.\n\n For clarification, there is no \u201ccleaning the sperm\u201d. You would have to do IVF and test the embryos. I wish it was as simple as testing the sperm though! It certainly would make things easier. I thought ive heard that before, buy you heat a lot of things these days. Well however its possible to get kids even if i would have huntington, and that makes me happy. I wish it was a easier way. Thank you for you answer. Cheers mate, but i live in Sweden and i got Good support from here! \ud83e\udd1f That Is really sweet of you, thank you! Please talk to your genetic counselor about this as it is a very serious choice and you need to take into account how this can affect all of you. If you choose to have a child with no forms of intervention, then there is a 50/50 chance they will have the gene. I do not think this is fair to that child to have them and risk their health. If you are going to have a child you should do everything in your power to ensure that they will be HD free. It is a very hard life to grow up knowing what you could have and having to wait to test, I was told as early as I could understand that my dad had HD and that I could have it too. My parents did not know my dad had HD until after I was born, but they immediately decided to not have more children. If you bring a child into this world and they have the possibility of having the gene you must be prepared for the psychological pain that child will experience. Okey first of all, no I am not going to risk it for my future children to have the gene. All I am asking is what alternatives do we have. I know there is one way possible where you take out the egg and put sperms and then put it back again. \nI am sorry if my question seems dumb but I do not know how it works with getting a baby while having Huntington.. \n\nIt is the same for me, my parents did not know that my mom had it and they got me and my 3 sisters. And 2 of them have Huntington and it is just me left to get tested. So I understand how you feel. I would never put a baby in to this world with this horrible decease. \u201cJust\u201d adopt is a pretty simplistic way to look at it. There is no such thing and a lot of people would feel an immense sense of grief if they cannot have a child on their own.\n\nOn topic though; I know there are embryonic selection programs they tried when my parents were doing IVF. For us it was unsuccessfull, but that was 18 years ago. &gt; lot of people would feel an immense sense of grief if they cannot have a child on their own\n\nAre their genes somehow superior to others or what? That...does not even come close to what I said. Do you have HD? 50/50, not tested yet. The idea that some ppl would risk their unborn child's health or well-being in any way rather than adopt an already existing kid who needs family just makes me sick That is not what I said either. There are options to avoid your biological child to have HD. I was just commenting on your \u201cjust adopt\u201d comment, that is an oversimplification of a very complicated issue. I am not tested either, getting tested in February. Wish you the best of luck:) Same to you my man. I am going to get tested in a year or two, but I do not want to rush it till I am sure i have the right mental state to face the result You can do IVF, that would probably be your best bet. I do not think there is really a way to have an HD free baby without intervention so this is something you will have to bring up with your fianc\u00e9. Good luck! Thank you and meet christmas! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Good luck on the test, im getting tested myself in a month or two. Spoke to an dockor today about it and they are going to send me to a team soon You can have kids the natural way, but it also comes with stress and sadness. You can do genetic testing on the fetus, and terminate the pregnancy if it is positive (abortion). \n\nYou would want to get yourself tested first. You would not want to confirm you are positive at the same time you learn you need to terminate the pregnancy. These are two separate sad events, handle them at separate times.\n\nMake sure there is a genetic counselor near you that could do genetic test on the fetus.\n\nMake sure there is a clinic near you that would perform the termination. Thanks for the tip. It sounds like a looong way to go with kids and this disease. But it is doable and I need to be grateful about that. \n\nI am going to get tested soon actually, I am waiting to speak with a doctor about it.", "My name is Sam, and I am at Risk. ", "vent I just need to vent I guess. I have so many complex emotions when people try to help me by offering advice about my mom with HD and her decline. I tell whoever that I am worried about her all the time and I am 2.5hrs away. SHes living with my dad but he still works. She does not leave the house or attempt to cook anymore but I am always worried she is going to fall or choke on something. These are real fears. The advice I usually get, from my friends and the HD community is usually that I need to increase supports for her to keep her safe . I know this and it makes me feel so shitty to hear this. I feel like I am neglecting her by not doing this but she would fucking hate having someone come in to help her right now. She is still way too with it to accept help I would not be able to fool her with \"oh this is just a friend to come a few times per week\".  She is so stubborn and independent. I guess my point with all this is that its very hard to balance what is \"best\" in the eyes of others and what your loved one would want / potentially taking the risk of a fall or something in order to appease them.", "Anonymous testing? Does anyone know where someone could get tested for HD anonymously, for example using a pseudonym?  Has anyone had any experience with this? I know someone that did this. They did it at IU Hospital in Indianapolis. It was about $400. UCSD has anonymous testing as well. It still grieves me that there are valid reasons to ask this question. For insurance? Health insurance and employment in the US should not be an issue due to GINA (thanks GW!). Long term care insurance and life insurance are concerns. \n\nHousing? I do not know. The list is shorter than it used to be and for that I am thankful. I was probably mostly thinking about how much HD sucks and I suppose anonymity does not affect that. I was tested anonymously through HD Reach in NC. It costed about $1200, but a donor contributed a few hundred bucks (Thank you) I got tested at University of Utah. It was anonymous. It cost $300. Thinking life insurance in particular Do you see a neurologist? I got tested anonymously 10 years ago through a company my dad's neurologist found for me. The testing basically does not match your name to your results, so no one except you and your neurologist will know them unless you want to share them. You do have to pay out of pocket for it, though, iirc. Mine was something like $3 - 400. \n\nOne thing to note is that I have been told by my current neurologist that I will need to get re-tested if I ever want to put the results on my record (for any future medical things I might need re: HD). So I figure I will get re-tested once I start actually showing symptoms and need to use the medical system to manage them.\n\nEdit: I think the company I used was called Athena? They sent a nurse to the house to collect my blood and then I got the results through my neurologist over the phone about 2 weeks later. It was all pretty quick.\n\nIf you \\*do\\* go this route, I would still recommend doing genetic counseling before / after at the very least! Something I did not do back then and I wish I had. In order to get an anonymous test, I have heard that you have to pay out of pocket. Aetna possibly? Late to this thread, but I got anonymously tested at the University of MD for about $500 out of pocket. UC Davis. They are amazing. It was very affordable.", "Generations of Huntington's Hi, I am posting out of curiosity if anyone knows about Huntington's going far back in the family. Often I hear of others who knew their grandparent had it and maybe a great-grandparent who had it but never further back. On my mom's side everyone died really young so it is hard to know. Thanks Yes this is typical. My wife\u2019s grandfather migrated from Italy in the early 1900 so any ancestry is in Europe. My grandmother was adopted and when they found her parents they discovered her father had it. Not sure about generations before that though. Increased life expectancy has definitely made this disease a lot more visible. I do not know who had it beyond my grandfather, because he committed suicide rather than deal with it long before I was born. No one talks about him or his ancestry. But I do know he was not the first in the family.  This disease has a long history, even if our own family is in denial. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we were blindsided by my fathers diagnosis as his dad (my grandfather) was misdiagnosed with early Parkinson\u2019s but he died of lung cancer before any fulminant symptoms arose. Nobody knew of anything further back in the family tree. My husband\u2019s mother, aunt, grandmother, and great aunt all passed away from it. I do not know if he knows anything passed that. The challenge is that the people who would know this information are no longer with us. 1 in 17 people are in the 27-35 range which is a grey area where the alleles can expand in later generations to be Huntington's. \n\nI do not know why more people are not worried about it. Having HD in my family is part of what got me into genealogy. I traced it all the way back to my great, great, great grandmother on my father's side. A lot of them died younger but my great great great grandmother died of \"paralysis agitans\" (old timey way of saying \"parkinson's disease\") in 1878 and my great great grandmother (her daughter) \"choked on her dentures\" and died in 1910. But since she had kids that ultimately developed HD, it is suffice to say she had it.\n\nI even managed to get medical records for some of my great grand aunts and uncles from their time in state hospitals. All HD. Lots of interesting medical history too. The problem is going back several generations you might have had a misattributed cause of death. With the increased knowledge of Huntington\u2019s today now we can look back in hindsight and think, \u201coh that is probably what happened.\u201d My father never really talked about his mother's family. My grandmother passed away when I was 2. My family is also from Italy. I am third generation American. 44 years old. My grandfather on my father's side, and his brother both had HD. His brother died before he did and we never told him. Grandfather died in his 70s. It was the most horrible thing I have ever seen. My dad's cousin had it and died in a nursing home. She suffered some horrible things there. My dad died at 60, and he always said that he would been tested. I was always worried that I had it. He said that he was tested for it, and that if he was clear then so was I. After he died of a three year bout with colon cancer, my mom and I were sitting around talking and she told me that my dad said that he would never get tested because he did not want to know. I have been terrified ever since but I have never had the guts to be tested. I feel like he was so angry and erratic, and we all were just looking for the more extreme scenarios, like I saw in my grandfather. It is really shaped my life, and my relationships, because I just think that I could at some point become a horrible burden to someone. So, I never get too close, and I rob myself of experience. It is always in the back of my mind, and I feel like it is a part of my self destructive behavior. I do not know why I chose to post here. I have just been thinking about this a lot.", "Testing How do I go about testing? I am 18 now and really, really want to know whether or not I have HD. How do I go about doing this? Who do I talk to? How do I bring this up with my family? \n\nLiterally anything will help me here as I have been kept in the dark about my family's history of HD almost my entire life so far.  What state do you live in? Ohio Same, and my mom died from it Thursday. That is awful. I am sorry for your loss Thank you  Might be different due to state/age/health status but I had to go to a neurologist for a evaluation and counseling session. They want to see if you are mentally prepared enough to be tested and go over what to expect and any questions you have. Be honest with them, let them know why you want to be tested and any questions or concerns you have. Then they order a blood test (they came to my house to take my blood sample) and you have to wait a few weeks 3+ for the results. The neurologist will most likely call you in for the results, good or bad. Mine was positive and he went over my CAG count and where I fell on the spectrum. Be aware some doctors may require counseling if you are positive. \nPlease keep in mind that the whole experience cost me about $1200 with insurance. My blood test was $800 (you may get this reduced due to income factors) and the neurologist appointments were around $400 (again may differ due to insurance). Just be prepared that you will probably have some bills. \nAs for telling your family, that is completely up to you. Since you are 18 it is your decision to make and everyone is different. I chose to get tested to see if I could start a family and my brother chose not to. I personally have not told my family due to my mother\u2019s declining health but you may want their support. \nIt is your life and you have every right to make your own decision, tested or not. My only advice would be to just make sure you are absolutely ready to hear the results first. HayeBail \\- I help run a youth organization specifically to help young people impacted by HD, called Huntington's disease youth organization.  We have a professional youth worker on staff that talks to young adults in your shoes, everyday.  They can provide some guidance and connect you with the right professionals and/or peers to provide the best advice.  Here is a link to find out more about how to connect with her.  Her name is Chandler (  Hope this helps!", "Supplements for Huntingtons (and other stuff) **My Background**    \n    \nMy mother is 41 and is in very late stages of HD, and my grandmother died apparently in her 45/50s. My mother did nothing but destroy her heath, even before she was diagnosed, drank and smoked heavily, was abusive to me, cheated on my father (an incredibly hectic breakup, and more stressful for me than them).     \n    \nI am 23, I moved out when I was 15 as I could not deal with the stress of mum being abusive and needing constant care, whilst I was also working full time. I am at high risk of HD, but instead of living a life like my parents, I have gone and achieved a degree to improve my financial situation, and work hard to continuously improved my health.   \n    \nI am sorting out at test for HD very soon (im moving at the moment) although im 75% certain Il have it anyway.    \nAfter seeing how many different meds my mother is taking (most of them are just to counteract the effects of another medication) and how debilitating it is, I am avoiding the pharma rout as much as I can. I still take amitriptyline for my depression, however, studies are emerging that paroxetine is a better SSRI for HD.      \nAlot of my diet research originates from this page (one of many though):    \n    \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The diet**    \n    \nTo ensure that I am getting a high nutrient diet, I drink Huel atleast once a day, sometimes twice. Id highly reccomend it, its good value too. Have a look if youve never heard of it:    \n    \n    \nStudy clarifies tie between cysteine deficiency and Huntington's disease:    \n    \nSo, im adding pure N Acetyl L Cysteine to my morning Huel milkshake:\n    \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Creatine Kinase/Creatine Connection to Alzheimer's Disease: CK Inactivation, APP-CK Complexes, and Focal Creatine Deposits - Generally meaning, nerve damage etc. caused by AL and similar diseases such as HD:    \n    \nSo I am taking this also:    \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGenerally alot of other research is to do with getting alot of antioxidents. Heres some recommendations:    \n    \n    \nHeres an all-in-one, although it doesnt contain enough cysteine. I may buy some of these soon though.    \n    \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDoes anyone else take supplements for HD? Anything anyone would recommend? As it seems like even though the research is there, doctors seem to have no idea. Its better that I start now. Supplementation can help with alot of things, not just HD. My doctor(s) have always stood by supplements in general being a waste of money. Unless you have a genuine deficiency of some kind, there is no point.\n\nNow I take a daily vitamin along with my meds, eat healthy and exercise, concentrating on cardio and balance. That is all that is been recommended to me so far in that fight.  But there are literally peer-reviewed science journals stating that they do work. Heres related to cysteine deficiency:     \nI have 700mg of cysteine daily. \"Disturbances in amino acid metabolism, which have been observed in\nHuntington\u2019s disease (HD), may account for the profound inanition of\nHD patients. HD is triggered by an expansion of polyglutamine repeats\nin the protein huntingtin (Htt), impacting diverse cellular processes,\nranging from transcriptional regulation to cognitive and motor functions.\nWe show here that the master regulator of amino acid homeostasis,\nactivating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), **is dysfunctional in HD\nbecause of oxidative stress contributed by aberrant cysteine biosynthesis\nand transport.\"** Not a supplement but you should read up on heat shock proteins and sauna use as a preventive for neurodegeneration. I have started on a 4 days a week for 20 min routine that I first heard about on a Tim Ferris podcast with Dr. Rhonda Patrick. It is worth some research.  Thanks, Will have a look! I remember my dad took a lot of fish oil, cranberry, and creatine supplements, alongside exercising over an hour each day. His heart and physical health were in great condition, but none of that seemed to help much with his HD symptoms. Weirdly, iirc, cholesterol medicine alleviated some of his symptoms but I think that surprised the neurologist as much as us, so I am not sure why that was the case.    \n\nHave you been talking to any nutritionists? If you have not already checked, your local support group might know of some in the area who could delve more into the research side of things.  \n\nFor what it is worth, I understand not wanting to take meds (been trying to avoid antidepressants, myself). I feel like it is only a matter of time until it becomes necessary, but I would like to stay functional for as long as I can without them if possible.   Have not spoken to any nutritionists yet, no. I have not been tested yet, although I will be soon (Im moving to a different city soon). Iv been keeping track of alot of research, and cysteine supplementation is showing alot of promise. Heres a one of the science journals from that: \n  \n     \nBut yeah, same as me, Id prefur to stay off of them for as long as possible. I am on antidepressants, but I am unsure if it is because of daily stress (I have had a hectic life up until recently), or if its definitely HD. Are you taking any supplements to see if they help? That is understandable -- fwiw, I also used Wellbutrin and Zoloft in my early 20's and they helped me. A lot of factors can cause stress (esp. when you have HD in the family), so depression is a hard symptom to pin to the illness itself.   \n\nI remember hearing about cysteine a while back on HdBuzz:  It is pretty compelling, but it is also hard to say since the trials so far have been in mice. Do you know if they have started doing any human trials at this point?  \n\nI do not take any supplements currently, but I used to take a lot with my dad when I was in high school. I forgot to mention there was also CoQ10 and trehalose, but I think the trials on the former unfortunately ended recently.   \n\nDo you think you would still take supplements if you found you did not have the gene?     This is a long reply, sorry, I promise its not bollox tho;    \nFor cysteine, I cant seem to find any human trials as of yet. I wonder what the hold up is though, since its having good results in mice? Cysteine supplementation has no negative side effects (so far as I know), so I do not see why they do not atleast try?    \nAnyway, im not willing to wait for them, so I do take cysteine, and other things (will show you a list of what I take at the bottom).    \nIn terms of the theory of supplementation, have a look into people like Ray Kurzweil's diet. Hes is a futurist working for Google. He has type-2 diabetes, and has long outlived his fathers age, who also had type-2. His intention is to live for as long as possible, and he didnt start supplementation until his 30s. Anyway, theres fucking loads I could write about it. Supplementation; ignore the fucking tabloid bullshit, it works, fact.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI take supplements and maintain a high nutrient diet regardless of whether I have the defective gene or not. My mother was someone who mistreated her body, even before she fell ill. So whilst being ill, she has had to deal with skin cancer, depression, and an unusually fast degradation due to her poor initial health. I have learnt from her mistakes. Life is short for everyone, it does not matter how long you are here for, its what you do while you are here that matters. Life is precious, you are precious, your body is precious, treat it as so.    \nIf I am here for a short time, I want to my last thoughts to be that of pride in myself, that I became the best version of myself, despite my situation.    \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, stuff I take, and why:    \n(I am a man of science, so anything I take is due to scientific knowledge and understanding):    \n**Huel** Two full meals of it a day. Check it out if you have not. Contains literally **ALL** the nutrition a human needs for good health. Makes it easy to ensure that you alleviate any dietary problems, and makes depression way easier to deal with, as alot of the symptoms can just be from inadequate nutrition. I mix mine with hazelnut milk, tastes great, and its cheap too.\n**Amitriptyline - 20ug** daily, an hour before bed. Ensures that I have stable serotonin levels, banishing what little depression is left.    \n**L-Cysteine - 500mg** daily, preferably before bed. Your brain will use these antioxidants and stock up the reserves while you are sleeping (due to those experiments on mice etc.).\n**N-Acetyl-Cysteine - 700mg** daily, this is in powder form to be added to the Huel milkshakes, swapped with the L-Cysteine pills. swapping them keeps a varied diet. I will increase this if I have the faulty gene.\n**Co-Enzyme Q10 - 100mg** daily. Optimises cell health, and so on, you know, its good shit.\n**1P-LSD** or regular LSD, 20ug every now and then, 100ug once every two or more months. This is a bit controversial, I know, but, there is a long list of benefits that I wont list here. I do not know if it will help you, but, it has helped me alot. The physical effects it has on your brain related to HD are entirely hypothetical. The psychological effects however I can say have helped. I believe it to have given me focus on what I want to achieve in life, come to terms with my hectic situation, and instead of waiting for someone else to do the science and loose my precious time, I am doing the experiments on myself.\n**CBD Oil** I plan to take this when I get old, or when tremor symptoms start to show. If you have not, look at its effect on patients with Parkinson. You will be fucking gobsmacked that they do not give this stuff to patients. Literally there is videos of people using it. I am not willing to wait for politicians to update old stupid laws while my clock is ticking.    \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, I am documenting all of this, so that If I am diagnosed with the faulty gene, I can continue this, but hopefully as a guide if it works. Perhaps il do some videos as I/if I become ill. Regardless, If I am not going to have HD, I hope that hopefully someone else will try it, because THE SCIENCE IS THERE, do not wait around for politicians to change laws, and inadequately funded scientists to wait around for human trials. There is no harm in supplementation, only benefits, regardless of the situation. Oh yeah, also, diet wise I avoid as much unnatural sugar as I can. So, no sweets, cake, generally no junk food at all. NO DAIRY, none, no cheese, none of that shit, its bad for you. All good healthy food. I also ensure that I am kept hydrated. Also 4/5 cups of green tea daily. Worth considering - Sauna 4-7x/wk is showing good results in AZ, blood donation (iron/metals are being implicated in AZ/PK), intermittent fasting (skipping breakfast or dinner once in a while to drive \"autophagy,\" or the body's self-cleaning/recycling to higher levels), and avoiding/eliminating processed foods containing carbohydrate. There is an emerging gut-bacteria/brain-health link being learned from AZ/PK work. Berberine and Oregano Oil act on the gut in a good way, and probiotics might help too. For exercise, high-intensity-training is where it is at. Your body will respond much differently to a 30min jog relative to 2min max push-ups, 1 min rest, 2min max squats, 1min rest, 2min max sit ups. You have to push to the edge, get the heart rate up, and this activates SIRT pathways and some other brain factor.\n\nI am not physically affected by HD, but a relative in my wife's family is.    Thankyou so much for the info! Will be adding all of this to my daily routine! For what it is worth, the people who were certain they had it, in my world, were all negative. \n I was only tested last year and I am pushing 50 now.  I pretty much quit sport-drinking and other than that I have always eaten pretty well, with spells of super clean.  I am not an athlete but have been able to do a variety of sports over the years and some martial arts stuff even now.  The onset is later for my family so we did not even know HD was a thing for us until the last few years. I am asking the younger ppl in my family to get closer to what you are doing and treating themselves (mind+body) early on (they are also untested).  \nJust found a facebook group of HD+ folks doing a Cysteine experiment:  \nLooks like I may have to get a facebook page again, sigh. And found some reasonably priced 400mg CoQ10 in capsules that I dump in my morning 'dosing' prep liquid, (I put in drinks throughout the day to distribute as 4 doses).  \nI just started with my next experiment, creatine.  And I did just buy some Cysteine, though I will be delaying it until after the creatine experiment is well underway.\nWhatever else I eat is added to this daily checklist:  greens (like spinach and collard), yellow (sweet potato or pumpkin or carrot), salad greens, 1oz walnuts, a half a cup or more blueberries, only olive or coconut oil, chia/flax seeds.  I do the tea daily, too, I put a couple of liters of water in the sun with a chamomile, a couple of green or white tea bags, a licorice, and whatever else suits me :-)  That is what I add to the concentrate I make in the morning.\nI am super interested in the Huel, and I think it is great that you are documenting everything here, too.  I am 23, so thankyou, I will get tested soon. Even still, my fear for it has fuelled my desire to be super healthy, so even If I do not have it, I hope that I will continue being healthy in thanks for not having it. Thanks for the facebook group, I have requested to join :) Sounds great! Id recommend sticking to vegan proteins, e.g. brown rice protein. Its far healthier &amp; cleaner as it does not have lactose/milk in it. Heres what I use, it tastes great. But make sure you get enough exersize to use it properly, or youll have farts like a space rocket:    \n    \nAbsolutely recommending Huel to everyone, whether you have it or not. I wish I could give out discount vouchers or something to get everyone some, I will contact them and see if theyd be up for that, Il let people know on this thread.    \nThanks :) I hope it helps     I got you all a referral code, \u00a35 off :)    \n\n test\n Hi, I have been searching for you.

I do not think I can take it any more, I try so hard to do everything, be a good parent, a good husband, house cleaning, cooking, work full time, manage our family finances and calendar.

I know it is hard to come to terms with even the idea of having HD, but recognizing that it is not something you can change is good. I know that sounds crappy, but learning to not blame yourself for something out of your control is so important. I am in the same boat right now, it is so hard to know when the right time to test is. Wishing you good luck! Think about it this way - as you are doing your part.  If everyone got tested, and did not pass it on to children one way or another, we would have eradicated the disease in one generation. Hey I know families with HD always say it is dominant and it really does feel that way! But you got to remember that eventually someone will test negative and end it for the whole blood line.

I am just a random guy who has no direct experience with Huntington's Disease. However, I met a woman last year named Kathy Gibson, and she is an artist who had become a full-time caregiver for her sister, who has since passed away from Huntington's Disease. She also had a brother who died from Huntington's Disease.\n\nThere was not anything in the sidebar to indicate whether this subreddit is strictly a resource for people with Huntington's Disease, or whether it is intended for all people touched by Huntington's, so I am taking a chance with this post. I just wanted to share this woman's art, because I found it very touching, yet very haunting.\n\nAs someone who has had no direct experience with Huntington's Disease, not only has her art made an impression on me about the toll this disease takes on those who are diagnosed with it, but it also struck a chord with me as someone who partook in the caregiving experience with my mother, who died from breast cancer.\n\nSome of the photos of the artwork do not do the pictured piece any justice, but others are positively striking. I do sincerely hope that my sharing of this is not inappropriate or offensive to anyone in this community. If it is, I will happily delete the post or accept any downvotes I earn. Without further ado:\n\n(\n\n**Full disclosure**: *She does sell prints, some proceeds of which benefit the ( but my post is not about that. I do not have any stake in the artist's success, nor do I have a personal relationship with the artist. I was thinking of her and did a search for her artwork and just felt compelled to share with a community that might appreciate it.*\n\n*I am not being compensated in any way for this post or the results thereof. Nothing of value will be given to me, including gratitude from the artist, as she does not have a clue what Reddit is, let alone that someone is posting about her there.

I am terrified and lost, he will not talk to me about it my step mother had to tell me. What should I do/know? To be fair he just turned 50 and still shows no signs aside from occasionally misplacing his keys but who does not do that? His number was also very low I cannot remember it though. If his number is low, yours might be as well. Generally the lower the repeat size, the later in life you get the disease. So worst case scenario, even if you have it(hopefully not), chances are that you will be able to live comfortably till 50. Take it my friend. In my family, HD symptoms start appearing in our late 20s.\n As for what to do with your family, give your dad time. I am sure he is processing everything and a new reality and planning for the end of his life etc. It is important to let him know that you are there for him no matter what if you have a good relationship. People do not want to die alone and I am sure he is going over it in his head/coming to terms with the situation. Just be supportive , pretty much all you can do. Try to do things you have always wanted to do with him while you still can. Tell him you care about him before his personality changes due to the disease and he is no longer the same. The reason I say this is because a treatment is still probably about 4 5 years away in the best case scenario. There is a new clinical trial starting in 2021 so be on the lookout for that to see if he is eligible. Beyond that if you ever need someone to talk to, just reach out. I was 18 when my mom died of HD and 8 when her symptoms started. No one told me what HD was till I was 16 and I resented my mother growing up for not being like other moms because I did not know what was going on. I know what it is like to feel alone and that no one understands what you are experiencing. Stay strong. A few years back we learned my grandfather had been misdiagnosed for 30 or so years. It was hd. My dad got tested and a few months later I followed. I got tested because for me not knowing would have haunted me. Id rather have known and planned accordingly than wondered everyday. To this day im glad I got to be close with my grandfather, and that my dad is still not showing. Having said that, even if you do have it, you can still live. I kind of thought my life was over when I first got my results. Since then I have actually gotten married and am doing what I can to live with no regrets. I have been keeping an eye on trials in my area (really far from most trails). Not only are there trials working to slow and ultimately stop HD, but there are studies being done to use HD to kill cancer ( ). For me doing what I can, and trying to use my situation to possibly help someone else is how I live. At the end of the day you have to decide how you want to live. Knowing or not, and how you live with either set of information. It is ok to be scared. If you want to talk im down, and I am sure most people in this subreddit feel the same. hi, i am 19 and have always known i am at risk cuz of my mom. i am pretty sure her number is moderately high, she started showing symptoms in her mid 30\u2019s. if he is 50 and still barely shows symptoms i think it is safe to say his number is pretty low. but i have barely done any research and do not know much so i could be wrong. \n\ni have chosen not to be tested at this point because i know i would not be able to handle a positive result after seeing what it did to my mom, but if i were in your situation i might have chosen different. i think it would be great to not have to worry all the time and just know, but i just know that i would lose it if i were positive. \n\ni do not really have any advice as i am still trying to navigate this myself lol, but sometimes things can get hard and it feels like i have nobody who can even come close to relating to my situation, so things get rly lonely. just know that i am here and we are in a similar situation, if you ever got to talk or just want to vent or talk to someone who has an idea of what you are going through, i am always here! Hi there, I am 21 and at risk.\n\nInformation about HD can be overwhelming at first. I know I found it confusing and difficult to wrap my head around. It will take time, so be patient, with yourself and with your family as you all process the diagnosis.\n\nIf you do need information, the Huntington's Society of Canada has some great fact sheets about all aspects of HD:  \n\nAs others have said, your dad seems to have a low CAG repeat count, which is good news. It means he is developing the disease later in life, and if you or your family members have it, it will likely be similar.

It has a huge effect on the decision to have kids or not as well as financial planning. If you want to build a life with her you have the right to want to know what that life might be.

And it is going to be about a month before I hear back from the doctor.\n\nAny advise on how to deal with this or prepare for the results? Others in this subreddit/previous posts will have good advice about testing anxiety in general, but there is one thing I wanted to mention for your specific situation:\n\nHave you discussed your plan with your father, or considered how it would affect your relationship with him if you learn that you are positive for HD? If you carry the mutation, you will know that your father also does. Since he does not want to know his own result, would you hide your result from him or would you plan to tell him? \n\nYou absolutely have the right to get yourself tested even if your father does not want to know his own status, but I would recommend having a plan for how you would handle things if you learn through your testing that he is gene positive. Discussing this with a genetic counsellor may be a good idea here if you have not already. I understand his decision of not wanting to know, and if I were to have it, I am going to keep it to myself. Not even going to tell my mom. \n\nI also have a sister, and I am going to share everything with her.\n\nMy question is, my dad is already 67. If he was going to develop the HD, would not he be showing symptoms already?  Can you carry the gene without ever developing the desease? I am glad you have thought about how you will handle things with your family.\n\nGenerally, people show symptoms earlier than 67, but it is quite variable, and it is possible to have later onset with shorter repeat expansions.\n\n In some cases, people also carry \u201creduced penetrance\u201d versions of the HD mutation, which are shorter repeats and do not always cause HD within a person\u2019s lifetime, and if they do develop HD, it tends to be later in life. \n\nDo you know what your grandfather\u2019s repeat count was, or at what age he was diagnosed? I never met him, and my dad never talked about this this with me. I do know he was not older than 70 when he passed away. My Mom was diagnosed at 67 iirc, and died about 12 years later. At diagnosis her only symptoms were cognitive. Delayed onset is definitely a thing. We thought we were all clear due to her age. We were not. I am sorry for your loss.

Although I only live with her every other week it kills me seeing her getting worse and worse and since she is not able to care for herself at all with poor communication abilities it makes me think about my own future as well (which also causes huge anxiety). The main reason I want to get tested is because I simply do not want to be in the unknown of something this big, as I am constantly thinking about my future life. Although I am not sure getting tested would be the best idea, due to the fact that I am not sure how I would be able to handle a test that turns out to be positive and I have read some people regret testing at a younger age etc.\nIf any of you are either trying to decide on whether or not to get tested or are/are not tested I would really appreciate hearing your stories and what thoughts you had on it.\nThanks Getting tested is no small thing. Only you can decide if you are mentally prepared to hear the possible bad news. I ignored it for the longest time in the hopes that it would work itself out.

On the other hand, not knowing MAY dictate how you live your life. You are the only one who can answer that question.\n\nThere is a good support network here, and many face-to-face networks out there. Good or bad news, you will not be alone.  OP do not think that people cannot be bothered to reply but when a post like this is made which covers it 100% there is not much else to say. \n\nThe last 4 words are the most important imo. \n\nYou will not be alone. \n\nGood reply u/JamesTheMannequin\n\n\n\n Thank you for this. \nI really appreciate you taking the time to answer and I will be considering your advice. Again thank you, this comment made me feel better in some way as I have been thinking about this stuff constantly for 2 days. I wish you all the best Thank you! If you are the plan-ahead type of person, it might suit your personality better to know if this is something you will have to adjust your life for or not. Having kids, for example, creates a complication - if you have HD, do you want to risk passing it on to them and thus making them have the same worries you have now, or do you want to try and protect them from it?\n\nMy wife is the plan-ahead type of person, and she chose to get tested.  Mostly because of the concern I pointed out above, but also because you know you will not be able to escape dealing with HD as you pointed out you are watching your mom go through it now. Caring for an aging parent with the symptoms will shift the worries from \"will this happen to me?\" to \"How can I mitigate the effects of this better in my life?\" if you know and are positive; or have the comfort that this is not something your family will have to deal with if you are negative. \n\nGetting tested and finding you are positive is an absolutely crushing experience. I will not even try to sugarcoat that. But in a way it is like getting a super-super early cancer diagnosis. It means that you are unfortunately going to have a tougher road ahead than most, but it is also not exactly an imminent death sentence. Treatment of symptoms or a cure may be developed by the time it starts to happen to you, so if you know you are positive, you would be able to keep on top of the developments and maybe get into one of the pilot programs of the drugs being developed. Or you would be able to choose your lifestyle in a way to minimize the effects of your future symptoms. For example, choosing a bungalow house to avoid dealing with stairs in the future, or choosing to be in an area with good public transit so you are not bound to your house if you lose your ability to drive. Same with choosing a life partner - perhaps your partner could prepare themselves better knowing that this is something they will have to deal with if you two are going to stay together for life, as opposed to having the risk of them bailing on you once it is in full swing because it is something they find out they cannot deal with.  I have felt the exact way my entire life. I actually started talking to a therapist when i was 19 or 20 wanting to get tested. But then I just decided one day that I was not ready. There was a lot of anxiety coming my way of not knowing, but it seemed like a better fit for me since I was so young and I knew I could not handle a positive result, just like you. The decision is yours to make, but I just suggest living your life as fullY as you can. Of course the thought of testing positive will always be in the back of your mind, which is understandable, but keep yourself occupied. I hung out with my friends a lot and did a lot of fun stuff people do in their 20s. Have fun! Just wait till till you finally feel secure. I never thought I would ever get tested until I met my husband, who still married me knowing I had huntingtons in my background. Your thing might be love, it might not. But wait until you have a strong support system. I texted some friends and family each time I went to my appointment, and when l was going to find results, I texted them asking them to come over to either party or comfort me. It sucked finding out I was positive, but my friends and family will always be there, even when shit gets bad. Hope this helped!! Hey,\n\nIt is really awful to watch our parents go through this and wonder whether it will be us one day. I got tested when I was 18. I felt like most people I know fall into one of two categories: the people for whom the uncertainty is worse than bad news, and the people for whom bad news is worse than uncertainty. \n\nI definitely fell into the first group. I felt like I was better able to handle bad news than I was able to handle uncertainty. I got lucky and did not inherit the gene, so it is easy for me to say that I would go back and do it again. Still, I would do it again, even for bad news. It is just so much easier to plan, if you know, and planning is important to me. I think one thing I did not appreciate at the time was how important my support network was. If you do decide to get tested, definitely have a game plan in place: therapy, friends, family, support groups, whatever works for you. Also, if you are in the US, you can contact an HD Center of Excellence and just chat with them about getting tested. They are very good. \n\nLastly, I read a study that said people who receive life-changing news like this usually revert back to their baseline state in about 2 years, regardless of whether it is good or bad news. I cannot find the study and it was anyway just one study, but it is important to remember that for most people, eventually, life as usual will take over.

I am lucky enough to join a grant funded research project so my test does not cost that much. I may be putting the cart before the horse but if I have it, should I tell my brothers? What made you guys decide to get tested? Hey Owasnew\n\nI think the reasons for people getting tested will vary massively. Part of my reasoning was that getting the test did not change the outcome, it could only empower me to know for sure and be able to  make more informed decisions.\n\nIt is not easy knowing a positive diagnosis, but personally i think it would have been harder to not know. \n\nAs for telling your brothers, assuming they share the same parents and you are not identical twins/triplets, your status and theirs are independent so your confirmation either way does not affect their chances (straight 50:50 for a single infected parent). That being said, it is hard to know that a loved one has a condition like this, would you tell them if it were something else? Have you talked to them about your decision to get tested?\n &gt;it could only empower me to know for sure and be able to make more informed decisions.\n\nI 1000x agree with this and got tested for pretty much the same reason. I think it is the responsible thing to do, you will eventually become someone else's burden... is it fair to *them* to ignore that possibility?\n\n\nI will say be careful who you tell sometimes. I was very emotional after my diagnosis, and my employer at the time found out and immediately looked up Huntington's and of course the first thing he sees is like 'schizophrenic',  'bi-polar', 'psychosis' and just *assumes* i am going crazy like... tomorrow. Fortunately he asked me about before he did anything ha.\n\n \n\n\n\n &gt;you will eventually become someone else's burden... is it fair to *them* to ignore that possibility?\n\nThere is an element of this, but if you remained 'at risk' then you would always make the preparations for the worst.. I think you owe it to yourself, allow you to deal with something that is hard to know about. \n\nIt is really hard at first, but you do carry on with life and it gets easier with time and support. \n\n&gt;I will say be careful who you tell sometimes\n\nDefinitely, it is a hard thing to talk about and its something people generally do not have a lot of information on. \n\nIn terms of an employer, I found it was better to have a proactive discussion with them rather than have them find out some other way. \n\nI did not do this right away, but when my job was permanent and I thought it would become a career place. It is not general knowledge, but its recorded and it means I can take the time when I do have appointments. \n\\n\nIn the UK we have the equalities act which acts as a protection against discrimination over a lot of things, including disability. We also have a the DPA which prohibits the information being known by anyone but those who need it. My employer is shit hot in these respects and I have had very positive support. ", "Decision to Get Tested - Regrets? I am currently in the process of getting counseling before getting test and was wondering if anyone regretted their decision and why? I do not regret knowing. I tested positive 4.5 years ago, and am in a way better mental health place without the dark cloud hanging over my shoulder. Yes I will get sick one day, but I still have lots of days. And I can make the best of them, and make plans to make later easier. \n\nI hope you get a neg. :) But if you do not, it does not have to be the center of your existence. I tested positive late last year, and I do not regret going through the process. It sucks for sure, but I was thinking a lot about being positive before my results anyway so that did not change much once I found out.\n\nIt is given me more clarity around my family planning questions, and hopefully given me a kick to live more in the moment. On the flip side, if I would tested negative it would have been like I would won the lottery - there is even odds that you will be celebrating your results.\n\nThat said, it is a personal choice and there is no right or wrong decisions. No one can know if you can handle knowing except you. Good luck with this decision, it is a big one. I do not regret testing (I tested negative). I was an emotional wreck during the testing process in my early/mid-twenties. I wanted to know before starting a family. \n\nMy brother tested a few years later and tested positive. I do not think he regrets testing and has planned his life accordingly (traveling now as opposed to waiting until he is older, moved to a new city, and not planning on passing on this disease). Plus, he is been more involved with research.\n\nWe are the only two in our extended family that have been tested (that we are aware). It is a personal decision for everyone. I hope you have a support system in place regardless of your result. Good luck! I tested positive at 18, which was 10 years ago. No regrets :) Eh...I am 36 and have been in some long-term relationships.  I got tested anonymously; 40 repeats.  The diagnosis has given me a lot of pause about dating or committing t things that ripen over a lifetime: career, marriage, etc.  Ultimately, I feel more socially isolated (especially in these Covid times).  It has kind of hollowed out my sense of purpose.  It is peaks and valleys.\n\nIf you do get tested, my advice would be to ensure that you have a good and supportive social structure in place (not just a safety net) that can hold you up. I tested positive a few years ago. I have sad days but I feel like a weight is lifted off of my shoulders. I do not have to live with blind hope. It is tough to adjust to and cope with, especially at first. But it gets better. I appreciate the time and life that I have. Also, I am able to plan financially, etc. I have chosen not to marry or have children but I live with my boyfriend of 8 years.

Things were starting to get serious and I decided it was time for this person to meet my family.  \n\n\nUpon bringing this up with my family (who obviously knew more about this than I did), they were immediately outraged - a mixture of protective anger, sadness and concern. They explained to me that it was very likely (50%) that they will develop the same disease and suggested it was best to break up with this person before I got attached further.\n\nI am so torn. Been barely sleeping for a week pondering about these big questions.  \n\\-Do I want to risk a 50-50 chance for a long life with my partner?  \n\\-Will some form of gene treatment be publicly availably by the time this person starts getting symptoms?  \n\\-Is it a good reason to break up with someone?

Can I even survive the emotional trauma that goes with it?  \n\\-How insensitive is it to request a HT test? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not know what to do. Please help me. Ask them to get tested. It is absurd to bring someone into your life and start a family with not knowing your status. All this anxiety may be for naught. Here is my opinion as someone currently undergoing testing, looking to start a family.\n\n1. This is important. Talk to them about your concerns. It is ok. It is a big thing and you need to be aligned on your future\n\n2. It is ultimately their decision whether or not to get tested. Either decision is ok. I have chosen to find out so I can plan my life accordingly with my partners experience in mind, and family planning. \n\n3. Speak to a genetic councillor. They go through family planning as well as what to expect of the disease. You both may decide having a family without disclosing your partners status may be the way to go. This is an option. \n\n4. I have given my partner the choice to leave. He says he loved me long before we got together. He would rather a short time together than none at all. He will stay with me regardless. \nI have read of some people leaving their partners. That is also ok. I would never hold that against anyone making that decision. I would suggest again seeing a genetic councillor to help navigate all the realities of this. Your decision should be informed. \n\n5. It is not your families business. Do not let their opinion sway yours. Do what you feel is right with the information you have.\n\n6. Back to 1. Talk to your partner. Again and again. Make it normal. Revisit the same things. Go round in circles. Make sure you both understand what the outcomes could be, and what you both expect of each other. It is very hard and incredibly sad. I was in pretty much exactly the same situation and ended up leaving. I knew there was a chance she had it because I knew her briefly before we started dating, but I did not know what Huntington\u2019s disease really was. When I found out what it was, I also started seeing symptoms. Very early symptoms, but symptoms I have not seen in anyone else I have ever met. Pretty certain she had it and I was very worried. I tried to carry on to see if my initial reaction of worry would go away but it did not, it probably got worse. The worst thing is, it is not like cancer. If it was cancer I would tell her I thought she had it, and we could get help. I could not tell her because 1. I do not know for sure, and 2. Even if I did, it is her choice to not find out until she really has to. This made it feel like I was lying through my teeth, like something was always on my mind but I could not tell her what it was. There is definite hope for a treatment that slows or stops progression before it even starts. There is one called \u2018tominersen,\u2019 and I think we will find out if it is successful in early 2022, but there is lots more in the works. A gene silencing drug that works in the same way called \u2018Patisiran\u2019 for a disease called \u2018amyloidosis\u2019 has been successful, and Amyloidosis is another disease that you have a 50/50 chance of inheriting from an affected parent. It is a similar disease in that it is caused by a buildup of toxic protein, drugs works in the same way, and it has been successful. Having said that, it is still hard to not feeling anxious in the relationship when you are relying on that hope. I literally cried every day for the entire relationship, but hid it from her, and I almost never cry. I thought \u2018this is not how I should feel in the early stages a relationship\u2019 and left. We were never \u2018official\u2019 but it was going that way. I did however have doubts about the relationship, a worry that I would stay out of pity, and a feeling that she had HD, so it is slightly different to your you. But I am not sure, finding out about this so early on alters your judgment of a potential partner. If I did not like her at all I would not have been so depressed, it is very confusing. If I was financially stable/had my shit together I might have made a different decision. I am trying to get my shit together, and maybe if I do we will reconnect, but just before I met her my head was not in the right place, I have my own struggles, and I cannot help anyone until I can look after myself. I also want her to have the opportunity to meet someone else. Here is an answer someone on Quora written about a similar situation(rias answer specifically): \n\nIt is hard, and the carers tend to be forgotten about because so much time is spent worrying about the person with the disease. There have actually been studies that show that the boyfriends/girlfriends/husbands/wives of those affected with the disease experience more anxiety after a positive diagnosis than the people with the disease themselves. It is a lot of responsibility. I just wish relationships were not so black and white. I wish I could date her without the worry of committing(typical male brain I guess!), I wish I could be a partner and help, but to not feel like all the responsibility will eventually fall onto me. I wish I could be a boyfriend when she is mentally stable, and a friend when cognitive abilities decline, so that I could get my own girlfriend to help with what I would have to go through, because who is going to be there for me? I wish there was more support for those affected and their carers. You are not a bad person. I have thought about contacting her several times, but never have. Like I said before, I need to get my own shit together before I can take that on otherwise I will struggle to keep my own head above water. But I am doing just that. I used to do drugs and drink a lot, and even more so when I was in the situation you find yourself in now. I drank on nye, but have not done drugs in a long time and I am improving drastically. I could go on and on, because like you I have thought about every possible scenario for better or worse. No one other than yourself can make this decision, unfortunately. You probably want some advice on what to do, but no one can tell you what to do. It is one of those decisions that you are truly alone on when making. You probably want to talk to her about it too, but it is a hard subject to approach. If you need to message me feel free to do so. All the best. I love my husband with all my heart. Looking back, I would absolutely choose him again and not do anything differently. Love is love. I would rather have him for a few decades than not at all.\n\nThe age of onset depends on their CAG repeat number, IF they have it. Some people will not get it until they are in their late 50s like my mother in law. She is 60 and still lives on her own. People with HD can still live long and happy lives. \n\nMy husband and I did IVF to have a child that we knew was going to be HD free. We had one before we knew he had it. Our genetic counselor said there would absolutely be a cure by the time our daughter showed symptoms. \n\nOur genetic counselor said that by the time my husband could show symptoms there would most likely be something for him as well. There are several very promising meds in trial at the moment. That gives me hope.\n\nAnd your comment about someone dying at any moment in a car crash is very true! This is something we remind each other in moments of uncertainty. Every day is a risk. While that also sounds scary, it takes some of the pressure off. \n\nIn my opinion, if you love them then be with them. If you are not at that point yet you might be able to save yourself some pain down the road by walking away. I am not going to lie and say it is easy to be married to someone with HD. But I am also not going to encourage you to leave someone over something they can control if you have a connection with that person. \n\nI am sorry you are having to ask yourself these questions. You make a good point about #5. It is not their choice. I bet my parents would have also not recommended marrying someone with HD either. However, they LOVE my husband. Sometimes more than they love me. They would not trade him now for the world. I completely disagree. It is a life changing decision to get tested and it is very personal. Someone needs to come to this decision themselves and not be goaded into it. If you do not want to take the risk do not date them. Do not make them get tested and leave them l high and dry when they get the results. As an FYI they are not high risk, they are just at risk. Huntington's disease if you are parent had it you are always 50% at risk. \n\nThere is lots of positive research happening right now but you can never day anything for sure. Additionally, who knows of your partner is positive when they will start getting symptoms.  For more info recommend hdbuzz. \n\nThis is a very personal decision which you need to make yourself. I would completely respect your decision not to get involved for this reason because it is serious. However you could be ending something good which is actually fine. I really think communication with the person involved is the main thing. -Do I want to risk a 50-50 chance for a long life with my partner? - Worked for me so far. Lots of good times. \n\n\n-Will some form of gene treatment be publicly availably by the time this person starts getting symptoms? -  Very Very likely. The methods in development have gone through some real trials that gave great results. This is on several fronts. \n\n\n- Something they did not tell you is that your love is likely to go through a period of heightened mental acuity for a while before it declines. So you get a smart one before, less smart. A lot of how the disease progresses also happens from lifestyle and deep memories. If you got a good one, keep it mellow and healthy. There ARE very promising clinical trials, but please do not promise your daughter a cure. I work in HD and am very optimistic, but I am shocked that a genetic counselor would say that. All of the treatments being studied now in trials are not cures, but rather more likely just delay the onset of symptoms (possibly for decades, which would be awesome, but we do not know much of anything yet because these trials have not read out too much). My genetic councillor was very clear about not going into this testing process with hopes of a cure. Sadly. She said a lot of people at risk have come forward for testing off the back of recent news, but she has to advise if it is the only reason you want to be tested, she would be prepared to turn you away. We did not get tested in hopes for a cure but more to learn about how to have a family. \n\nShe encouraged us that should our child have it, there is a strong chance there will be something to resolve any issues, this would be 20-30 years down the road. \n\nBut as far as my husband goes, we are trying to not get our hopes up. But I have to stay positive because otherwise I become a non-functioning person. Hope is the only thing keeping us from drowning. I have read recently that some medicines in trial could absolve HD related issues. I believe they are called \u201cgene silencers\u201d? I guess I interpret that as a cure? Can I ask what the difference is since you work in the field?\n\nOne is Tominersen and is in phase 3. This at least slows down the gene by decades like you said.\n\nThere is also AMT-130 that has been fast tracked and is said to be a one time procedure that would work indefinitely. \n\nAnother drug called \u201cBranaplam\u201d received drug status in October. It lowers the protein to a normal range. This drug has already been successful in treating SMA and is taken by mouth. \n\nMaybe I should not use the word \u201ccure\u201d but in my eyes these options are better than I ever expected. If my daughter has it, she will not show symptoms for 20-30 years (she is one) so there is a chance that there will be a cure by then! It is a hard balance is not it between hope, being realistic, and worst case. I do not know about you but it catches me out frequently and I feel like I have been winded. I think part of my hope of getting tested if it is clear is that I can park it. If not, I am prepared to accept I have made that choice to know.", "CAG Repeats Is it possible for CAG repeats to decrease over the course of a generation, or can it only increase/stay relatively the same? It is possible for CAG counts to decrease (contract) between generations, and I believe its most likely to happen when the gene is passed down from the mother to a daughter. It is most likely the number of repeats will be the same or similar, but contraction is definitely possible. So it is not likely to decrease if it is passed down from father to daughter? No, not as far as I know. \n\nMy understanding is that an expansion is more likely when the gene is passed down from the father and a contraction more likely when the gene is passed down from the mother. The higher the parent\u2019s CAG count is the more unstable the gene is and the more likely an expansion becomes.\n\nThis article touches on it a bit:  When passed down from a father the repeats are more likely to increase but not a definite.  When passed from a mother the repeats tend to stay around the same.  So if it does decrease it will not be by much.

It is a step in the right direction. Currently the most likely candidate for a cure is using CRISPR-Cas9 to remove the extra abnormal triplet repeat expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine in the Huntingtin gene. There was recently a trial 1 on Familial Transthyretic Amyloidosis with promising results. While not related to Huntingtons it shows the possibility of gene editing to cure certain brain disorders. The study was just published 1 month ago but when I read it just now I immediately thought of the potential for Huntingtons. I read more articles and saw it has already been studied, with success, in mouse and pig models. Very promising. It is not about reducing symptoms anymore its a possibility of a cure. It will not necessarily cure already damaged neurons but it has the potential to stop the progression, and if diagnosed early completely prevent it. I am sorry, I thought this was a light academic subreddit. What I was saying is there are promising results from a human trial on another disease which could be used for huntingtons as well. That trial only looked at side effects and safety of the treatment.

I have always just thought it is something I need to push through, even though I have been sucking at trying to push through for a while.\n\nI am also afraid that I will not test positive and then I am just feeling sorry for myself and comparing myself to people who are truly suffering from one of the worst things ever.   Of course I do not want to test positive, but it would answer a lot of things about my life.\n\nIt is so unusual to have a random mutation I feel it is very very unlikely that I will be positive.  But my neurologist did not give any other probabilities.  Currently I am waiting for them to negotiate the cost of the test with my insurance (US), so I have not even had blood drawn yet.\n\nBecause of COVID19 I had to go to my neurology appointment alone, and I will have to go get this test alone too.  My friends and family are not super helpful despite their good intentions anyways, they are all too busy saying \"you do not have this!\"\n\nI do not know how this is going to impact my life.. I currently live alone, have a small business, am the treasurer for a volunteer organization, and have been completely independent since I can remember. I can tell that my organization and memory has gone downhill over the past decade.  I am almost 40.  I have had trouble with all relationships and I would say that my emotions feel as jerky as my movement.  I show too much affection and then do not follow through.  I have done a lot of work to resolve resentments and to forgive.. but I still struggle with relationships.\n\nBesides the movement, I look extremely healthy.  Exercise has been a big escape and therapy for me.  I ride my bike sometimes hours a day.  I practice hours of yoga everyday to soften my stiffness and it helps a lot.  I am stronger and more fit than I have been for most of my life.  I have been pushing myself so hard.  I have been maintaining strict diets and tried extreme elimination diets looking for allergies or sensitivities..  I look super fit but I still feel like shit.\n\nI do not know how to wrap this up.  I do not have a final conclusion.  Thanks for reading, I know that I am not alone. Stay strong friend, it will all be ok Not as ok as ur momma\n***\n^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Downvote ^to ^remove. ^( ^me ^if ^there is ^anything ^for ^me ^to ^know! Take solace in the fact that it is incredibly rare to have a spontaneous mutation, even by Huntington's standards.\n\nRegardless of whether you have it or not, I would go see someone to talk to and help you work through this.", "Early Onset HD runs in my family Which means my sister and I have at best 20-25 years left to be functioning people (I am 20F, shes younger). My mother, in her mid 40s is showing more symptoms as time goes on, as is her brother. My maternal grandmother is currently in her 60s and I have seen her go from walking and talking to bed ridden and delirious over the course of my life. \n\nTo top this off, my mother is living with her parents to be a caretaker for her mother and has no preparations for herself in the future. I am terrified of having to do the same.\n\nFor whatever reason we die slow and suffer for 20+ years before an infection or something similar takes us. We have got family records going back 3 generations further than my grandmother than support this.\n\nI am currently getting my bachelors but it feels so futile to get a degree only to turn around and become a vegetable 16 years after getting it. I will just spend that time working and dreading the inevitable time where I die alone.\n\nI am not suicidal, but sometimes I really do wish I would never been born because of this awful disease. Look into the PET imaging, nural activity increase a huge amount for a period of time before cognitive decline. Do not delay go do something amazing before you decline. Look at Woody Guthrie.  I try to be hopeful in that in 10 years from now, there could possibly be some very real advancements in HD research. \nMy brother tested positive last Monday and he is 20. I have a feeling that he is feeling a lot of the same emotions that you are right now. He had plans to go to college next year, and I hope he still does. I do not know how he will be in 20 years, but I hope he lives fully everyday. No regrets. \nI wish you all the luck with everything, I feel your pain.\nMy dad is at about the mid to late stages, but really not bad enough for a nursing home yet. We (my siblings and I) are trying to figure out arrangements for him right now and he is being difficult. I know a lot of it is the disease and a lot of wanting to retain as much freedom as he can. I have read somewhere that people with HD do not realize how bad they are. Well, that is my dad. It is so stressful, to deal with a parent with it and to also deal with your own mortality at such a young age. \nI am here if you need to vent.", "Human trials for Uniqure's AMT-130 are recruiting at research sites in the US. AMT-130 is a different method/technology than Roche's gene-lowering ASO. ", "HD Less than 36? Recently my father was tested and the results came back at 32 CAG. He has no symptoms and is healthy but had a family history of it. Based on online research quickly I deduced I am at risk of HD as he can pass this on. Is this middle zone of HD common? Assuming I have a 50/50 risk of getting his HD gene and then what are the chances the CAG increases? So sorry to hear this, and you are correct it puts you at the same risk and unfortunately is passed down by the male that is when it tends to expand more. But one things for sure this disease follows no rules!! It does increase in successive generations. My dad had a CAG of 40 and my brother had a CAG of 42. There could be value in getting tested both for yourself and for family planning if you every hope to have children. It CAN expand, it is not necessarily the case. Important distinction, thank you. Your father does technically not have HD. Intermediate zone is 36-39, under 36 you do not have HD. However, CAG count *can* increase in children so it could be that you do have HD. I would recommend getting yourself tested if you want to be sure.", "What can be done to delay symptoms? Anything that can be done to delay symptoms, and has anyone witnessed a miracle with Huntington\u2019s? \n\nThank you so much in advance. My grandfather had Huntington\u2019s and did not show symptoms until early 70\u2019s. His symptoms were pretty mild until around 75. He lived until he was almost 80 years old. HD did not actually kill him though, he had multiple heart attacks which eventually caused him to pass. He was not \u201cthere\u201d totally &amp; towards the end he needed a lot of help but he lived a long full life. My grandfather\u2019s sister had it and lived until late 70\u2019s. My dad &amp; twin uncles have it and they are showing a lot of symptoms. They are 50 &amp; 53. My dad &amp; uncles are pretty heavy drinkers and we have come to the conclusion (not sure if this is scientifically proven) that heavy alcohol use seems to be the cause of early symptoms. At least in my family. My grandfather &amp; his sister never drank and did not show symptoms until later in life. I do not think anything can be done to \"delay\" symptoms so to speak but there is lots of things which can decrease symptoms. E.g. my dad cycled untill he went into a care home. This really helped his balance and coordination, I think it was the reason he was never in a wheelchair. Exercise generally is always good. There are also calerie type things (similar to heul but prescribed by a doctor) for the weight loss. Also doing mind games like memory tests can help keep your brain active. There is a lot of research around antioxidants to slow things down, a good in depth review here -  There are good posts on  about his journey and efforts to delay symptoms.  I am not a doctor and none of what I am about to list below is guaranteed to \u201cdelay onset\u201d but it is what I try to do in my own life from my reading on the topic and the suggestions in the literature that some of these things may have a positive influence on HD outcome:\n\n- intermittent fasting\n- antioxidant-rich and anti-inflammatory foods\n- good sleep hygiene\n- drinking lots of water \n- not overindulging in sugar or caffeine\n- regular exercise \n- not smoking\n\nBasically the same healthy tips you would expect for anyone apply particularly to people with HD. My mother in law never drank and is completely gone at 55", "Help me out here ya\u2019ll Hey guys I am new to this community and I recently made a friend with someone whose mom suffers from Huntington\u2019s disease. My friend is super sweet &amp; caring and dedicates a ton of her time to helping her mom out with daily activities, but she is currently struggling a bit with trying to come up with some things for her and her mom to do. She does not want her mom to just be stuck sitting around watching tv all day, but she is a little bit limited because her mom gets tired very easily, has a hard time walking, and her movements prevent her from doing too much with her hands. I am trying to brainstorm and think of things they can do, but any and all help would be greatly appreciated! Any kinds of mental or physical exercises, or just creative things that they can do together that will not be too taxing on her physically. all suggestions are welcome, thanks in advance you guys, I really hope this gets some feedback because I know how badly my friend wants to improve her mom\u2019s quality of life, and I want to help her, but I need a little help helping her if you follow me. Thanks guys! Depending on her current mobility, car rides can be fun. My mother in law used to take my FIL on rides and they would enjoy the music and scenery, and stop for ice cream, etc. It was one of the few activities he was able to do right till the end (with extra assistance getting in/out of the car toward the end). It got him out of the house and added some semblance of normality to his life. I really appreciate the response, seriously thank you. I will definitely suggest this to her. Abstract / finger painting  ? Since no one is allowed to travel right now, it could be fun to do it \"virtually\". They could pick from a few different countries from a hat or have her mom close her eyes and point on a map. They could try to learn some new phrases in that country's language, cook a dish or order food from a local restaurant, watch the most famous movie, listen to the most popular song, etc! There are also many travelers who post videos on YouTube that are really interesting to watch. \n\nGood luck! You sound like a great friend. this is super creative and perfect. also, she is a good cook so I think she will really dig this idea. thanks so much for real, truly appreciated. love it, thank you.", "My fianc\u00e9 might get tested I do not have HD in my family, however in 4 weeks I will marry the love of my life who does have HD in his family. His paternal grandmother passed in her late 70s, undiagnosed. His father passed 6 years ago at the young age of 58, diagnosed with HD in his late 30s. We have been together for 10 years, and I have always known it was a real possibility we could face this disease some day.\n\nI always said I would never ever pressure him one way or the other to get tested. I do not live with this struggle day to day. I do not know what it is like. No matter what, I will be there and will support his decision. It is a difficult subject to bring up because I do not feel it is my place. In addition, we have always talked about children - but knowing he has the possibility of having HD has not changed how he has talked to me about our future. He gets very excited, and frequently says \u201cour kids one day will.....\u201d or \u201cwhen we are parents we....\u201d\n\nI think this type of talk has made me very comfortable thinking of having children, and has allowed both of us to kind of sweep reality under the rug. The other day however, I asked point blank if he honestly wanted to have children and for the first time I was told no. \u201cYes I would love to have kids and I know we would be great parents but I do not know if I would ever actually have them\u201d\n\nThat brought us right back to reality. I am happy to hear him finally address it rather than pretend it does not exist - because I know it is on his mind much more frequently than he lets on. For not the first time, I have suggested genetic counseling and starting to find a doctor we mesh well with and who we can trust. I have suggested looking into life insurance and long term care. I really do not want it to feel like I am pushing him, but rather I am trying to support. If I do not make these suggestions I know he will not actually make any moves to get tested. \n\nAm I over stepping?\nHow can I be supportive / encouraging while letting him move at his own pace?\nAny other advice? You can still have children that will with certainty not have HD if you do in vitro fertilization. Even if he does has HD, he should know there are options for having children safely that with certainty will not develop HD. You can also go this route and decide to have children via IVF, and make it so the doctor does not reveal whether your husband has HD or not, if he truly does not ever want to know. Thank you, yes we have discussed this option of doing IVF PGD. It is on the table,  but there is the scenario of paying all that money only to find he is HD negative to consider. Not to say money is more important, but it is the reality &amp; can certainly be a barrier. There are definitely pros and cons to any decision. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding! I am also getting married in 4 weeks and I personally needed to hash this out before getting married. We are looking into life insurance policies before we continue on with any genetic testing. I will also be getting life insurance. We have met with a reproductive endocrinologist and a geneticist and have decided that linkage method prenatal exclusion testing/ivf is going to be the best option for us. Unfortunately with this, there will be a lot of out of pocket expenses for us. \n\nI do not think it is over stepping at all. It is perfectly reasonable to just flat out ask if getting tested is going to ever be a possibility for him. You deserve to be able to plan you life as well, but I totally understand why you are feeling this way. \nSending you a virtual hug! \n\nLJ", "What exactly does genetic testing entail? I am 24, almost 25, and my mom and her sister have Huntington\u2019s and her dad and brother (both dead) had it. I keep going back and forth on getting tested. My mom never got tested because by the time she found out (from her siblings) that her deceased dad had HD, she was already at a point where it would not make a big difference for her to know for sure one way or the other. We know for sure that she has HD but my parents have managed to keep it off her official medical records (they have had great doctors and specialists who understand what this sort of diagnosis can do to insurance). I am just curious what sort of things the genetic counselor talks about and if talking to the genetic counselor helped anyone to make a decision on whether to get tested or not. I cannot say much about a genetic counselor other than they can walk you through your probability of getting it but the inheritance is so straight forward that most people understand it.  \n\nWe opted out of a genetic counselor because I have a degree in genetics so we felt like it would be a waste of time and instead went with therapy for emotional support and did not encourage our kids to test until the counselor felt like they could handle it.  \n\nThe test itself involves a simple blood draw and it is shipped to one of a few labs in the country to do the actual testing.  In our case, the lab sent us a kit to take with us to our local hospital lab.  (We live in a pretty small town). The lab counts the repeats and reports back to the neurologist who orders the test.  Then when they get the report they contact you and of positive you have a discussion about what the number of repeats likely mean for you and start planning a course of action and regular check-ins to assess progress. This is true for my experience too. I did not bother with a genetic counselor. I do not have a degree in genetics but I have done a lot of self education around the subject and everything the neurologist who ordered the test said only confirmed what I already knew. \n\nI did not actually line up a therapist before hand, but wish I had. I ended up having to leave incoherent sobbing voicemails for a couple of them. My husband researched and found them, but I guess standard operating procedure is to hear from the new patient directly? Anyway, the one I ended up seeing was fantastic. I stayed with her... 5 or 6 years now. But it is usually not the case that first therapist is the right therapist.\n\nI am supposed to be therapist shopping right now actually because we moved a seven hour drive from her, so I have only been doing telemedicine since November. I have not actually tried.", "venting/looking for advice writing this because i feel like i need to get it off my chest. \n\nmy mom has HD, she is about to turn 40 this month. i (19) have not been tested and do not plan to until i feel like i am mentally stable enough to handle a positive result. \n\nmy mom has gotten a lot worse over the last 4/5 years. it started with her having some behavioural issues, then she stopped taking care of herself and her apartment and she developed an alcohol problem, from there it just continued to get worse. she is at the point where she cannot manage her finances or live independently, and she has terrible decision making skills. it feels like i have completely lost the woman who raised me, someone who i used to idolize and who was my entire world (my dad was not really around). i have been grieving because i lost that version of her, and i am not able to appreciate that she is still alive and here, i am not able to love her or think of her in the same way i used to. and that upsets me because i know i will regret it one day when she really is not here. i have no siblings, and no cousins from my moms side, sometimes i just feel so alone. \n\ni have mostly come to terms with my moms situation, but something that has been bothering me more and more is the thought of what my future might look like. my mom said she thinks (so this might not be totally accurate) she has 48 or 49 repeats. i just keep thinking that if i am positive for HD i will only live to be like 45 (if i am lucky), meaning i have basically lived half my life already, when it feels like i have not even started my life out yet (i graduated HS late, currently failing my first year of uni). this is such a scary thought. humans already have such a small time to spend alive, and to think that i could have even less is so sad. another thing is that i think as if i already have been diagnosed positive, i do not even like to consider the possibility of being negative because i do not like getting my hopes up. i am going to get tested eventually because i would rather know for sure than just live like i already have it. \n\nalso, does anyone have any advice on how to stop feeling like the world owes me something? i feel so unlucky and \u201ccursed\u201d that i always downplay other people\u2019s struggles because i feel like i am going through more, i always have this outlook that i deserve everything to go my way because of my misfortune. i know this is not how the world works and i hate that i think this way. \n\ncurrently dealing with mental health issues and other stressors from my crappy life, i have never felt this low. any positive insight or words of advice would be greatly appreciated. As a person who is dealing with the exact same thing you are I try to always keep positive. My dad has been rapidly declining over the past few years. I have not got tested either but I will one day when my mind is in the right place. \n\nI know you may feel alone but you are not, there is a huge community for Huntington\u2019s support, just have to look in the right places. I recently started volunteering for Huntington\u2019s society of Canada and started fundraising to hopefully one day find a cure. There is very promising clinical trials out right now and technology advances daily. \n\nMy advice is to you is I know you may be young but you are the only one your mother has right now and you have to be the adult now. There comes a time in everyone is life where they have to look after their parents and for you it is now. You will be much happier knowing you are helping and doing good. Help by getting her finances in check and plan a will it will save you a lot of headaches when she is no longer able to do so. This may be tough to hear and I am so deeply sorry but I am just trying to get you prepared. \n\nI know for myself I will get tested sooner than later as I would love to help with research and testing. If there is any chance of me prolonging this horrible disease I am willing to try anything. \n\nIf you need someone to talk to we are always hear for people like you. I am so sorry to hear your story I also have HD and am no longer able to look after my children, your mum probably feels like she has failed you and you would be better off without her, I went through 5 years of drinking and I made some bad choices. Try to remember that although you feel robbed imagine how your mum feels no parents would wish for the HD to be here but it is and that is something that she cannot control, maybe chat with someone who knows and understands HD, I get that your pissed off but you stand a much better chance of receiving treatment if needed in the future, I have a friend who is currently participating in the Roche trials and the feed back is awesome, this is being called the biggest medical breakthrough in 50 years \u2764\ufe0f First of all well done on reaching out, the huntingtons disease community is small and it is extremely difficult to find people that understand our perspectives. I was a carer for my mother with HD from at least 11 and have HD myself so your message really resonated with me. I am 23 years old and got tested at 19, and have not regretted getting tested. I completely hear what you are saying about HD being a scary diagnosis but this is what has always reassured me (I hope it may help you); like yourself, my mum has HD. I cannot exist without HD, before I could talk or walk, before I was born, or even conceived, the egg that became me had the HD mutation. For myself and for you if you have this illness, you cannot exist without it. Testing positive does not change when you will die, it changes how you can prepare for it though. No one is guaranteed a long life but I have an opportunity now to enjoy every day and prepare for my future. \n\nBecause of my mums illness quite literally every exam period I have had, my mum has been drastically ill (in hospital for sometimes months, including having to arrange for her to go into a care home) and I have had to ask for countless extensions, requested a year out of uni to move my mum from a care home that was neglecting her into a safer environment as well as sort out her horrific debt that she has accumulated. I should have finished uni a year ago but i realise that I need to take things at a different pace to most. But most people our age do not have to figure these things out. Most people our age have their parents support through uni, not the other way around. So know that you have not let yourself down by taking longer to go through HS or that uni has been shit because you have been dealing with bigger things. \n\nIn terms of having the mentality that you already have HD I do not think this is a bad thing. Everyone I knew that I told about me getting tested told me that \u2018I probably would not have it\u2019. I have had symptoms of HD my whole life - which is not a well understood because most symptoms are misunderstood (I was blamed and punished for having my symptoms as though I was a difficult child but really I was just ill and was not being treated for my illness).  Particular symptoms for myself my entire life have been lack of balance, memory loss, fainting, inability to regulate my body temperature and more.    People that told me I would not have HD were only saying that because they were scared and could not face the facts, which did not help me at all. And actually having a diagnosis meant that I could justify what was happening to me instead of being so confused. \n\nIn terms of feeling like the world owes you something, again, you are allowed to feel like that! We do not live in a society that offers understanding, instead we are critiqued for doing the best we can by people who have no idea how difficult it is to be a carer for someone with HD. A lot of people will not know what you are going through and you will not know their story either so maybe that is the lens to look at other peoples lives from? \n\nHD is rare and your experience and your ability to have taken care of your mum through the absolute worst times makes you a rare and precious person. \n\nI know none of this will take your issues away but I offer you my support if you need some help, I have found doctors and health care professionals to be some of the biggest idiots going and sometimes you need the support of people who actually get it. Please message me if you need to talk. Sending you lots of hugs sweetie. I am so sorry to hear about your mom. I so understand and feel for you. Have you tried Zoloft that helps a lot with anxiety and behavior issues that we had with my mom now she is doing much better. Also Austedo has been incredible great. They have grants and very easy to apply! You will be surprised with the difference you see when the right meds are taken. Does she see a center for excellence for HD?", "Is it worth following your dreams? I am at risk for HD (one of my parents passed away from it, I knew they were diagnosed when I was 9 years old but did not know it could be passed on to me). I also have not been tested since I do not have a stable job that offers life insurance, plus I am only a junior in college and I know that test results can impact my job and what type of insurance companies can accept me.\n\nGrowing up I did not really know what I wanted to do with my life in terms of my career; just that I wanted to make an influence on people's lives and help someone in some way. I also enjoyed science growing up compared to other subjects so for a while I wanted to become a physician which is the perfect combination of my career goals. It incorporates science (a lot of it) plus I have to ability to care and treat patients to hopefully improve their life or to lead someone on the right track to get better/healthier. After finding out from all my biology classes that HD has a 50% chance of passing onto offspring, I was terrified and devastated. The journey to becoming a doctor is long. 4 years of college. 4 years of medical school. 3-4 years of residency. 2-7 years optional fellowship. This adds up, and as someone that is at risk, I would hate to have spent my youth studying medicine to not even be able to practice it. My parent passing away from HD has driven me even more to pursue medicine- I am fairly optimistic but I want to treat patients with HD (as well as other neurodegenerative diseases) and want to work with researchers/scientists to find more treatments and possibly the cure to HD. In a perfect world when I am not at risk, I do not mind spending the rest of my life doing that in my career since I love learning and teaching people.\n\n \\-- I will try making my story/concerns as short as possible because I know people on this forum have much much bigger issues to worry about than their careers such as family and marriage but should I just give up and pick a shorter route that may be less fulfilling? Is it worth following your dreams if you have HD? You should follow your dreams. Live with no regrets. Even if you have HD you never know when itll start to effect you. Do what makes you happy. Welcome to the club! It is absolutely worth following your dreams. Like many others from HD families, we want to help others with HD. Medicine is just one way to pursue working on HD. You can impact so many families with HD in a lot of different ways. I am hopefullyyy  going to start my PhD working on Huntingtons disease in Toronto but it is been a long journey. Like you I also had a parent with HD and since I was 16/17 wanted to devote the majority of my life helping people with HD. It is been a long haul with a lot of lessons and setbacks but what I have learned is this, 1) that it is not our burden to carry completely and 2) to not give up. Just because one of our parents had HD does not mean that we are responsible for curing HD. We can lead fulfilling lives in the time that is given to us and just try to live life to the fullest.  As for pursuing a career in medicine, it is a long and expensive road indeed, one that I did not take but it is up to you. Here is a question, what would you do if HD was not a factor? Would you still pursue medicine? If so, then you have your answer. I would also recommend looking up the stories of Dr Jeff Carroll and Dr Lauren Byrne, both non doctors who currently work on HD research. Let me know if I can help in any other way :) Good luck and please no that you are not alone :) Hi! I am a second year med student and my mom has HD. I also have not been tested and I do not want to yet. If you could imagine just for a second that your life was not affected by HD, what would your heart decide? I went through the same pattern of thinking when I decided I wanted to apply to med school. I want to achieve great things with my life even if it ends up being shortened by HD. This horrible disease isnt going to take anything else away from me so I decided to follow my dream. And I have not once regretted my decision. Good luck and if you ever want to talk send me a PM. Great post, I respect that you put your true feelings out there. Always follow your dreams!   There are so many unknowns: you do not know if you have it, you do not know that IF you have it when the onset starts, you do not know if there will be a cure or gene silencing therapy in the next 5\u201310 years, etc. \n  Continue to live your life the way you do now. I have found with living at risk my appreciation for everything was better. Did not sweat the small stuff. Goodluck", "I am 19 years old. My mother died from HD a few years back, and was diagnosed 16 years ago at age 35. I have not been tested yet, because i have a question. My question is this: Is current research promising enough that I could expect, with a reasonable degree of certainty, to have effective treatment options available 10 to 15 years from now that would allow me to live a long enough time(say, at the very least hit senior citizen age) without a huge blow to quality of life?\n\nIn other words, if I got tested tomorrow and I came back with just a few too many CAG repeats, would I just be screwed, or would there be a legitimate possibility(as in far more likely than not) for me to live an average lifespan, with no or minimal loss to motor control and/or cognitive ability? First, I am sorry for the loss of your mother.  My wife has been diagnosed with HD and has a CAG repeat of 44, the same repeat as her father who passed at 47. My wife was diagnosed at 23 and she is 30 now and is participating in 3 research study groups to help find treatments and/or cures. They are close, there are wonderful things happening.  One of the major motivators for my wife to get tested was because we wanted a family but refused to pass HD on to our children. So she got tested so we could plan how to have a family wether we needed to do IVF or if we could safely conceive naturally. I guess kind of my point in bringing that up is, we find hope.  For us it was hope of a healthy family.  My wife and I are confident they will have something to prolong the onset of symptoms in the next 10-15 years.  Getting those test results is not easy.  I am truly sorry you face this challenge.  I wish you the absolute best.   I think so. With the development of crispr we are  at the beginning of a new era in medicine. Technology is rapidly advancing. And luckily for us HD is ahead of the curve in taking advantage of new developments as they occur. There will be some conditions to receiving the help though. And I know the biggest one right now is how close you are to a research facility. If you cannot get to the location where the trial\nis being held you may not be accepted.  But there is a ton of support out there. So do not give up on things. There are a lot of really smart people pushing this research along.  Without speaking to your question specifically, I can try to speak to what I think you are also asking. \n\nWhen I discussed a possible positive diagnosis with my therapist a few years back, my biggest fear is that I would not have the drive to do anything with my life because I might not live long enough to put my education to work like I wanted to. She asked me to consider what a life without goals would look and feel like, and that the journey can be just as rewarding as the destination. It really put things into perspective for me. If my life is shortened, it is even more important to pack as much meaning into as possible for me. I am hopeful that I will live a normal lifespan, but knowing I may not, I make every moment count. No staying in miserable relationships. No jobs I absolutely hate. No \"friends\" who really are not. Just a ton of hope and appreciation for the people I love and the things I have.  Like you, I do not want to get tested without believing it would not be a death sentence, because that is how I have felt- that finding out I am positive would end my desire to continue to live. I have been seeing therapists, gotten on antidepressants and I have support in my personal life and I still do not know if I could make it through a positive diagnosis. I think the thing that gives me the most comfort is knowing that even if I do not know my status, it is already determined. Getting tested or not getting tested would not change anything other than the information I have at hand. So knowing that, how would getting tested change the way you feel about life, knowing there are no easy answers but there is a lot of hope for treatment in the future? Is hope enough to sustain you? Go to college, learn about bio chem. Have fun while you are there. Then graduate, make a cure. Boom, problem solved. And hopefully if fast enough you can save me with that cure too.  Testing is personal. I do not think that there will be a cure in my lifetime that has a long enough study to be labelled as safe. I got tested 10 years ago at 18 for my own mental health. I wanted to know for future family planning so I can ensure that I do not pass it along to my kids.\n\nThere are no guarantees for when the progression starts. All you can do is live the best you can :) There probably will not be any guarantee in these comments for you. But as you are surely aware, there is a lot of hope in the HD community. Follow HD buzz and read their reports from the recent CHDI conference on their website. There are many different approaches to huntingtin protein lowering in development right now. We are still waiting to learn for sure if huntingtin protein lowering will mean improvement for patients. \n\nTest or no test, positive or negative, just get involved and be an advocate for the community. Advocacy spreads hope and that hope is infectious. \n\nI agree with a previous commenters statement. If you have this, you have always had it and were always going to get it. The only thing that will change is the knowledge. Would you allow that knowledge to destroy you or would it fuel you to advocate more, experience more, be a better person, not allow things to bother you as much, etc.  \n\nA positive is not a death sentence anymore like it used to be. I genuinely believe that. I tested positive and my life is not over. That said, nothing is guaranteed and every day you are given is beautiful and should be cherished. ", "Transition into care? Hi again, I am sorry I feel like I am constantly posting on this thread I hope I am not annoying everyone. I just feel so alone and feel like I have a million questions always. \n\nFor those of you that have been there already and can offer advice, how did you decide WHEN was the right time to increase care? My mom is still fairy independent but me and my dad\u2019s current plan is to introduce in-home nursing care a few times a week to be increased as needed before transitioning to a long term care facility\u2026 but it is hard to know when these things need to happen. Any advice about HOW to have that conversation with your loved one is also greatly appreciated. \n\nIt is so hard because there are so many areas in which she is independent and she is still young (59) so I do not want to do it too early.  She is so stubborn and I know she is going to hate me and dad for increasing her care\u2026. She values her independence too much. \n\nAnother thing I would appreciate advice about\u2026 those of you that decided not to be your loved ones full time caregiver, how did you make that decision / did you feel any guilt and how did you deal with it? I am in medical school and my dad has said he does not want to be a caregiver (which is totally fine in my opinion but I know there is some stigma there) and I already feel a lot of guilt about it. \n\nSorry that was long and if you read to the end thank you, I appreciate any and all advice about increasing care :) sending love to everyone in this community This post is definitely not too long. Please keep posting and asking questions.\n\nResponses to these types of questions usually include something along the lines of \"get thee to a (family) therapist.\" That may well be the most helpful thing. Lots of people are like your Mom though and are unlikely to participate. That makes it a lot harder of course. You and your Dad may benefit though, especially if you are feeling guilty about not volunteering for what may the most emotionally difficult job of your life.\n\nMy two cents is mostly a cautionary tale. My dad was the primary caregiver with the closest of my siblings being six hours away. Dad waited too long. He found her stuck under the back of the car in the garage after she fell when trying to get outside and \"find a cure for HD.\" We had been trying to persuade him for months that Mom needed in home or nursing care. He said he could manage. He finally woke up after this incident and Mom was in nursing care within a week or so.\n\nIt sounds like your Dad is in a much better place, which is invaluable. I really appreciate the honest advice about the therapist. You are exactly right my mom hates seeing doctors and health care professionals (I think because they force her to think about her disease, which she would rather not). I am so sorry to hear about your mom, and your dad. My dad is doing okay and he has set some firm boundaries about what he is not willing to do regarding care which I appreciate. I am seeing a therapist to work through my anxiety and guilt. \n\nI feel a lot of guilt about not quitting school and moving back home to care for her. I have brought it up with them before multiple times and they have both said they would hate it if I gave up medical school, they are so proud of me. \n\nI think it will be similar to your situation I think it will almost have to be \u201ctoo late\u201d when it will actually happen, otherwise we will not be able to get her to consent to it \n\nAny other advice you have is greatly appreciated, thank you so much for your comment. First of all, i am so sorry you are going through this! It is so hard seeing one of your parents worsen every day. The only advise I can give you is that the amount of care really depends on the family and how much they can take. I get that your mom is still fairly independent, but if you or your dad are no longer able (or do not want - totally understandable) to take care of her, I think it is in everyone is best interest to increase care. Ultimately, you and your dad are the ones that take care of her, so it is really your decision. I get that it is a really difficult decision and you should definitely talk to your mom about it as well, but there is no shame in no longer wanting or being able to take care of someone. \n\nPersonally, we increased care for my 54 year old dad when we noticed that all of us just could not live with him anymore. It was too emotionally draining to take care of him all day. He did not like it and was very stubborn about the idea of receiving care somewhere else, but ultimately he realised it was the best option for all of us and he is very happy! \n\nYou are allowed to have a life of your own. I know that sounds tough, but you should realise that increasing care is probably in her best interest too. Talk with your mom and dad about this stuff, and I hope you come to the right decision. Sending lots of love! I do not really have advice, mostly just have regret. Granted I was too young back then, but my mom started showing symptoms in her early 40s not long after the divorce. I was her care taker until I broke down at 17 and moved in with my dad. She had a major accident shortly afterwards which she barely survived but her condition progressed rapidly as a result. She ended up in an assisted living place by 50 and lasted there about 3 more years. \n\nI regret that I was not strong enough to be able to visit more. That I could hardly look at the shell of my mom or stand the smell of nursing home. \n\nMy only advice is that if someone is being a care take they need a strong and flexible support network. Otherwise that person will eventually become overwhelmed and grow to resent the person they love. \n\nSide note: I think my mom got like meals on wheels but she just hoarded them in the freezer and did not eat enough, so an in house assistance is likely better than just having stuff dropped of. Something that helped ease things a bit was the idea of continuous care. My parents bought into a duplex that was part of a continuous care facility. It really helped them choose to move because they would be moving into a place they could call home and do whatever they wanted to do. They could imagine that nursing care was somewhere on the distant horizon, so it focused more on being prepared instead of \"aaarrrghhh I have HD!\" I am so, so sorry. This disease is absolutely awful. You have nothing but compassion from me, and I would like to think your mom would not want you to feel guilty about not visiting more. It was so so hard for you. And she knows that, wherever she is now. I hope you find peace you have nothing but compassion and understanding from me \u2665\ufe0f Thank you so much for your comment. I am glad the transition to increased care worked out for your dad and your family. I think you are right in that in will depend on what my dad can take. He is fine doing things for her like making sure she eats and drinks enough and spending time in the evening with her but he has said he does not want to be a caregiver (feeding, bathing, dressing etc). So when that time comes I guess that is when we make the choice. I am currently sitting with mom on the couch watching baking shows and enjoying every second of time I have with her. \nAlso thank you for being supportive and non judgemental about this. I do not want anyone to think we are neglecting mom we are really just trying to make the right choices but it is so hard sometime. The thing that helped me the most processing things after the fact (I was pretty numb in years leading up and after) was a lesson from my favorite meditation/Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Han. \n\nThe teaching essentially states that the past does not exist. The entire \u201cpast\u201d of everything lives in the present moment. It is not that things that happened live in this imaginary place called the \u201cpast\u201d. That past is infinitely intertwined with this present moment. As such my mother and all the time I spent, all the love she shared, became a part of me. When I smile and love now, I am sharing not only my love but hers. She is part of the core of who I am and that will never change, so I carry her with me. It does not magically cure the pain of loss, but it helped me tremendously with reconnecting to my memories and emotions of her. \n\nI kind of started rambling, but ultimately what I wanted to say is your not alone. I have nothing but compassion for you and your situation as well.", "Safety concern Me (42) I found a pair of my underwear in the dresser that is ripped up. My boyfriend (41) lives with me.

Should I be concerned for my safety?", "Confused \ud83e\udd37 Anonymous testing? HD is something that is in my family and never discussed. My fathers mother had it, but my father never brought it up to me. I did not know my grandma due to her sickness. My mother brought it up to me once when I was 18. \n\nMy dad is now 60 and appears to be symptomless, while his sibling appears to be showing a lot of symptoms. Neither will go get tested.\n\nWith all this and my mind racing I have found myself \u201cSymptom hunting.\u201d I have been driving myself crazy being critical of every twitch, mental lapse or stumble. My toe and leg muscles twitch ever so slightly 24/7. \n\nDue to these things I have determined that I am going to go through with anonymous testing. I assume if I do this then I will still be able to register for life insurance, long term care, and disability insurance without it being on my record.\n\nIf positive not sure what I will do, but I want to be able to prepare myself as much as possible. I do not have any advice but I am wishing you the best! This is exactly when we did. My husband got anonymous testing and was able to sign up for life insurance. I would absolutely recommend doing this. \n\nYou are doing the right things. Just make sure nowhere in your medical documents it says you got this test and what the result was. That means do not tell your doctor or anyone until you absolutely have to. \n\nSorry you are going through this. Best of luck. There are some HDSA centers of excellence that do it and others that do not, so you will want to check out your options that way. Off-hand, I know on the east coast that Vanderbilt, UVA, and MGH all offer it UC San Diego did mine, they were great. Had to fly out for results though Hi, new to this group. Glad to have found it. I tested anonymously at a HDSA Center for Excellence Hospital. We have known about it in our family for about the last 20 years, so I was able to get my ducks in a row before getting tested and starting a family. \n\nI went through all the same things you mentioned, wondering about every single thing your body is doing. For me, there is a weird calmness in knowing the answer.\n\nI would highly recommend getting tested anonymously. Be sure to have Long Term Care Insurance, Long Term Disability and Life Insurance set up before you get tested. They ask you in the insurance questionnaires if you have been diagnosed with anything, and it is easier to go in \"not knowing\" than to have a lie on record. The health insurance system stores all the information you give it, to prevent people from shopping around and changing their answers. I found it was much easier to go in \"not knowing\", as opposed to lying. You are only asked for concrete things, nothing hypothetically / undiagnosed. They did not ask if our parents specifically had Huntington's, just other things like Alzheimer's maybe. Our new Fiduciary Financial Advisor told us that we would gone about it perfectly because no test is recorded in a system.\n\nIf it helps, I went through Policy Genius to find different plans. I got a Long Term Care (LTC) policy and Long Term Disability. My husband and I are self-employed and have investments, so we opted out of Life Insurance (since it is for after you are gone). I do not advise that for everyone, but for us, the HD expenses seem to add up when you are alive (very symptomatic, medications, or nursing home or assisted living). My theory was that if I could decrease the cost of care by having LTC, then the Life Insurance would not be as necessary. Our LTC Policy has this -- Elimination Period: 90 Days (if diagnosed, you will not need it asap), Policy Limit: $175,000, Max Monthly Benefit: $5,000. Happy to give you more info if you need it.\n\nAnother option is to speak to an Estate Planning Lawyer. We found this really helpful because they are not in the medical field (will not record anything insurance will find) and there is client confidentiality. They can help you prepare for the future from a different perspective. \n\nI hope that helps, please let me know if you have any questions.

", "My husband could be at risk but we want to start a family Apologies in advance - this will be a long post!\n\n3 weeks ago, during my sister-in-law's wedding, my husband's auntie became concerned about her sister (his mother's) behavior and mentioned to my husband that she thought she could be showing signs of HD (great timing on the auntie's part to mention it during a wedding!). Apparently, my husband's grandfather had HD and passed away at age 94. When he died (4 years ago) the family mentioned he would had some sort of disease but they never openly discussed it with my husband or his twin sister, so we never realised the gravity of this diagnosis. \n\nMy husband's auntie (68) tested negative, but my mother-in-law (64) is undecided whether to take the test, so we do not know if she has it or not. I do not know when my husband's grandfather started displaying symptoms.\n\nMy mother-in-law has suffered from depression for a long time (is on anti-depressants) and, in social situations, drinks a lot. Other than depression I cannot say we have noticed any other symptoms of HD - and to be fair depression can obviously be caused by a huge range of things. Although during the wedding day she was acting a bit odd, we put this down to her drinking too much (and mixing with anti-depressants). It was also a stressful situation for her as her ex (my husband's father) was there. A couple of months ago she slipped on a wet floor and broke her ankle so was in a boot and was in pain with that during the day too.\n\nIt is so hard because whilst I am aware that my mother-in-law has a 50% chance of having HD and her behavior \\*could\\* be caused by this, I also feel like how she was behaving at the wedding could all be unrelated to HD. I guess I am trying to look for answers/a positive when we will never know until we know her diagnosis, which at the moment she is reluctant to find out.\n\nThis brings me on to my husband. For context, I am 30 and he is 31. We started TTC last year (before being aware of the HD in his family) and we had a miscarriage in May. This hit us very hard and just as we were finally feeling like we were up for TTC again, we have been hit with this news about HD and it is like we have run head-first into a brick wall. \n\nWe have been looking into all our options and think that non-disclosure PGD IVF will likely be our route forward so my husband does not have to find out if he has HD. We have taken the steps to speak to our GPs and have been referred to genetics services (no date for a consultation yet) - we are doing everything we can to move forwards. I just feel so gutted that we came so close to starting our family and now we not only have to put that on hold, we also have to get our heads around the potential of my husband possibly having HD.\n\nI am so angry that HD was not spoken about more openly within his family and that my husband, or his sister, was never made aware of what this means for them, or the potential impact it could have on trying to start a family. My sister-in-law is 31 (husband and she are twins) and she is desperate to start a family too. Knowing that it could be at least 12-18 months before we are even in a position to be getting pregnant feels heartbreaking right now. I wish we knew for sure if my husband's mother has HD as I feel this would help give us more clarity on a way forwards - as part of me still wants to try and conceive naturally.\n\nI am not really looking for advice (although it is welcome if you have any!) I just needed a place to write down my thoughts. In the last 3 weeks, our world has been turned upside down. I love my husband so much and whilst initially, we were more concerned about the impact of this news on us starting a family, it is really starting to hit me about what this means for him and us if he does have HD. I am so sorry you are going through this. HD has been a mystery in so many families since it is relatively new. I know your husband's family is not the only one who did not and does not talk enough about it. Is genetic testing for your husband completely off the table? I identify with this so much... My husband and I are a similar age to you and we were just getting ready to start TTC, when about 8 weeks ago I found out my great uncle has been diagnosed with HD. It was unknown in the family before now. My great-great grandfather died young of heart disease so was likely the carrier, but died before he developed the disease.\n\nMy grandmother (78) has some symptoms like cognitive decline and unsteadiness on her feet that, up until now, we thought were related to the many other health problems and medications she has. But perhaps they are HD - it is so hard to speculate. My father (57) shows no signs as of yet. Both are willing to get tested, but the process is a long one with considerable wait lists in my area.\n\nI have decided to go ahead and get tested myself, paying out of pocket for anonymous testing that can be done more quickly in another state. But I 100% understand why your husband would not want to get tested himself. If I were the type of person who could live in the positive half of the 50/50, I absolutely would do non-disclosure IVF, but I am too much of a pessimist and will assume I have it whether I do or not! So we will get my results and do PGD IVF if needed.\n\nI have no answers or advice for you, except to say you are not alone - having your family planning kicked a year or more down the road when you were just committing to that new chapter is heartbreaking. I hope you and your husband have a good support system and I do recommend therapy for talking through the things you might be scared to say to each other. Thank you. No he is open to finding out his status and I will support him whatever he ultimately decides. It is all just very new for us at the moment - I guess that is why they offer generic counselling! 1st thought is, holy fucking hell how did they not talk about it!   \n\n\n2nd is your hubby absolutely, 100% HAS to get tested. I think it is great you are looking into resources and taking time to process everything. Genetic counselors are wonder people, and they can put you in touch with Social Workers to walk you through options and support groups to talk to people going through the same thing.\n\u2764\ufe0f Best of luck Any update?!?! Hi - I am sorry I did not reply to you sooner. Thank you for taking the time to comment. I am sorry you are in a similar predicament. Have you had the results back from your test yet?\n\nMy husband has decided to go ahead and get tested, we reached out to our GP and have been referred to the genetics services but have been told we might have to wait 14 weeks before we can even have an initial appointment! Then it will be waiting times for the counselling appointments etc. which I appreciated are very important to go through but it is so frustrating waiting for an answer. Hi! Sorry it took me a bit to come back to this. In discussions with the clinic we chose, we learned that my dad might be able to get tested quicker than we thought. He is been happy to get tested all along, but has cancer and a chronic illness, so traveling is a challenge. But we got some suggestions for getting him tested in state - because of his condition, some doctors may be willing to test him outside the usual process. We will know if that is going to work in a few days so please cross your fingers \ud83e\udd1eHoping he gets a negative result and we can avoid testing altogether. Fingers firmly crossed for you!! Hoping you hear soon.", "Huntington's Disease Machine Learning Prediction Model Hello, my name is Zayden and I have Huntington's Disease with a CAG of 43. My mom's side of the family passed the gene down to me and I have lost pretty much all of that side of my family including my mom to the disease. I am a junior python programmer that has an interest in Machine Learning and am taking classes on AI Engineering and ML and Deep Learning. I want to build a linear regression model that could possibly predict onset of symptoms or even approximate age of mortality for people like me in order to hopefully help people like me have some closure or at least some answers to this monster of a disease. Please note that there is no such thing as a 100% accurate model but I aim to try and get the highest accuracy I can get with my model. My friends and I will be working on the program but are in need of a dataset which we could run through our model to train it for prediction. What we are looking at needing right now is completely 100% superficial information from volunteers of 3 simple fields: Age, Age of Onset, and CAG count. No names have to be disclosed and we can simply refer to each subject as subject \"A B C D\" etc etc and send each person their approximate result via those code identifiers. It is completely voluntary and can be anonymous if that makes people feel safer but we are desperately in need of data. Also what we need to train it with would be family history, such as just like... say a person has a family member who passed, all we would need is CAG (if possible), Age of Onset, age of passing. No names once again, but we could \"theoretically\" train our model with that information to make the prediction with the volunteers personal superficial information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe implications of this project could be a huge breakthrough in HD as you know not much is known especially about mortality and we are given almost no answers when we are diagnosed and pretty much just left to wonder and be terrified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease I sincerely want to assure everyone, I am not trying to get any \"personal\" private sensitive information from anyone, all we are hoping for is those three fields mentioned above. This is a nonprofit private project, no data is shared with anyone. It is strictly for testing purposes. My team sincerely hopes that we can get volunteers, as this is a very important project. We plan to study Machine Learning intensively even as we are doing our studies in order to achieve the highest possible accuracy we can and plan to do live broadcasts when we are programming our models in order to educate people and the world about Huntington's Disease.   \n\n\nIf interested, please feel free to comment or DM. No private info is needed, heck not even your name if you do not want to share. But it would greatly help us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much, we hope that this project will help the HD community, as it is a cause that is very personal for me since this is also my own personal battle. Have you looked into the Enroll-HD datasets? Assuming you could get access you would have the exact data you are looking for from the most comprehensive source anywhere. Age: 49\nAge at onset: roughly 33-35\nRepeats: 42  Do me for contact info for an HD researcher If you would like, you can DM me on here I would love to chat with you! I do not know how i would get ahold of that but I would love to try, do you have a suggestion how I could participate in that? If you would like to talk I can DM you? I will note this down, do you have any \"info\" like that on any of your family members who had HD too? IF that is possible, no names are needed at all! \n\nThat is the link for researchers to access data. If you check the site there will also be links to participate in the study. I needed a referral from my genetic counsellor to book my first appointment, but there may be other ways to sign up. I found the contact request form, oh my gosh thank you so much! I appreciate this SO much. I hope I will be able to help those like us get a better understanding of this disease through Machine Learning. I am so sorry you are going through this disease too. Hey! Cool concept and one that I have often thought about. I work mostly on the biological side of things and am doing a PhD over in Toronto. I have a family history of the disease myself too. Enroll is definitely a good idea but they are less likely to give access to researchers not affiliated with an institute. I can help out in that regard if needed. \n\nThe other thing is, I think ML models to predict age of onset are out there already or have been tried using just pure CAG count. The caveat is that even with the same CAG count people have different age of onset due to differing sets of genetic modifiers and variants in certain DNA repair proteins. Another modifier is the presence of a CAA interruption at the end of your CAG repeat tract, these people have much later age of onsets! I believe you should expand your training dataset to include these aspects for a more accurate model. DM me if you are interested and we will figure out how to get a dataset that includes that info Hey! Thanks so much for your information, yes I would love to work with you. Can you give me more information about the biological side? I imagine there are different models like that too. I want to build something unique and I know each person has different genetic modifiers that could influence the onset as my own tests showed up specific genetic flags that they said research into how that affects HD patients, I also heard CAG is also not the only factor like you said. If you would like to work together, I would love to hear your ideas and any information you could provide or contribute. I think this is an awesome project idea and that it could change lives if implemented in the correct manner. I will DM you with my inquiries and ideas and maybe we can sit down and pick each other's brains. Once again thank you SO much. Any information is amazing and could really help us. I can explain the model and process of making and training a model. I myself am still learning Machine Learning and AI and am going for the IBM Certificate for Machine Learning and AI Engineering. I have a team of 3 counting myself that are working on this project, I would love to share our story with you. Once again thank you SO much!!! No problem, and thanks. I am sorry you are going through this too, it is a shit sandwich but it is great you are looking for ways to help and give back. I see someone more familiar with the research replied below so hopefully that pans out for you both. Yes, someone is very familiar and can probably give us a lot of valuable information as well as help educate myself and my team on the disease and maybe would give us a chance to provide valuable research to that person's research as well! This would be an amazing opportunity but thank you so much for getting the ball rolling with this, you do not know how awesome you are and please if you ever want to discuss anything, I am always looking for friends! Thank you so so so much again!

And a single survey for untested children of HD+ parents to collect info about their PTSD or lack thereof.  I have seen no other research.\n\nThe PTSD originated from long term childhood physical, emotional, and sexual abuse (incest).  \n\nIn some ways it is a double hit, both dx negatively impacting the amygdala.  In others, it may interfere with therapy (abnormal saccades from HD making EMDR less efficient?  or apathy making other trauma processing unavailable?)\n\nI will see as I get further into recovery.  \n\nAnyone else with both HD and PTSD? Have you been tested for HD and know that you 100% have it? Thanks to a genetic test, a family history, the chorea, and a couple of neurologists, pretty close to 100%.  Unless you have got a better theory. I ask because we have a lot of people that \u201cthink\u201d they have it and come here in a panic. Their answer is usually \u201cno\u201d they have not taken the genetic test, which is why I asked. Not trying to offend. Just trying to protect the community here from posts like that. \n\nTo answer your question, I have a relative with both HD and PTSD. She is on antidepressants and antipsychotics. She does not open up or talk about her issues really so it is hard to know what she is thinking. She is in denial about everything going on. In denial about the HD or the PTSD? Or both? And I am trying not to take it personally.  But of course I did.  I have a lot of PTSD issues around medical gaslighting.  A lot of that has to do with having HD symptoms for 5 years pre dx and being told I had conversion disorder or was imagining it, depressed, or just stressed.\nSo making my first post on reddit in an HD support group, then having the first comment prompt me to defend myself, is admittedly triggering. \nHaving to say on some level hey, I DO ACTUALLY have a right to be in this group makes me just want to run away and stop doing this reaching out for help thing. And while I am here, and it is my thread, lol, I will get the rest off my chest. \nIt is really fucking hard for me to ask for help.  \nI am completely alone.  My mom with HD allowed my dad to abuse me.  My sib tested negative and spent her adult life with a narcissist and is only willing to help me when it creates the right image for her.  My bf left 6 months after the HD+ test.  We were in couples therapy, a 'safe space' for him to say he just was not up to dealing with it.  He would seen his mother through cancer for years - not an excuse, just a rationale.\nI have only in the last 3 months had health insurance adequate to get a therapist and start resolving some of this trauma before HD makes me incapable of it.  \nI am already cognitively different than I was 6 months ago. It is hard to balance finances or do taxes (something that I used to do for other people).  I do not enjoy my hobbies or anything much anymore.  Chorea keeps me up on and off most nights (so much for that bullshit about it going away completely during sleep).  My memory is shot, and I string my days together with workarounds, apps, calendars, post it notes.  I cannot remember what the fuck I am doing at least a dozen times during the day.  I had to quit working 3 years ago.  I am moving more, forgetting words, irritated when I mistype and spill things and fall down.\nI spend most of every day just doing the normal shit with the focus and coordination of a headless chicken, wiped out easily, trying all day to bump my energy level to do the 45 minutes of physiotherapy I know will help.\nBecause of the abuse, I cannot trust anyone to take care of me.  And there is really no one who will.  And like a lot of HD patients, I do not have a ton of money to pay someone to do it.  So there is that.\nI am asking whether there is someone else out there who has had both.  Not even asking directly for support or help, because of course I did not.  It is not my style.  Or my comfort level.  Fuckity fuck.\nThis may well be the same shouting into the void I can do alone in the house without a reddit url. I attended a support group for HD for a little while.  A support group for a disease that causes depression and suicidal ideation and even suicide... run by someone who treated very real comments about despair as pathological.   \nI did not belong.  The caregivers were given more support than the patients who showed up.    \nI get it, it is easier to counsel people who actually have a future outside of HD. Whenever it got too heavy with someone who actually had HD, Karen would change the subject.  Or worse yet try to 'fix' people by telling them to look on the bright side.    \nWhich you may have guessed is not my forte.  It is not all bad, but do not tell me it is going to get better.  It is HD, and I have had a lifetime of bullshit.  I even run a blog about going down swinging, doing everything I can to maximize the potential I still have.    \nSo being questioned here feels equally bad.  And lonely.\n\nDamn, that was so much more than I expected.  And it is probably the irritability plus the lack of inhibition that will be a hallmark of my communication style from here on out.  Joy.  \nWhew.    \nOk, if you made it here, thanks for reading. Yuck to the leader. I do not have any advice. I am hd+ but still asymptomatic. You belong here. you deserve support even without much of a future. Honestly, both. She is getting ready to go into assisted living but denies she has any symptoms. And regarding her PTSD she is a vault. She will not open up to us. We only know because her therapist talks to us sometimes. Turns out she was abused as a child and has a lot of issues from that but will not tell us about it. She is great at compartmentalization. Thank you for opening up. This is certainly the place to do that. I know it takes a lot to be that vulnerable, especially when you have been burned before. \n\nJust know you are not alone. Many here are going through very similar things. My husband and I stopped attending our support group for the very reasons you stopped. \n\nI wish I had answers or advice for you. My best suggestion is to see a therapist and take the meds the doctor recommends. Also, look into the meds in trail for HD. There are some promising things coming our way. Thanks, very much appreciate your understanding. I am sorry that commenter questioned you like that. In your post you say you are 5 years into being symptomatic so my first assumption would not be that you have not gotten tested, and I am not sure why they would come at you like that. Just commenting to say you are valid in getting offended at their comment.", "Building a Team Reaching Out in Love \u2013 Chapter 31, Sometimes caregivers feel like they are on their own. Sometimes caregivers think that is the way it is supposed to be. The truth, however, is more complex. If the person being cared for lives long enough, there will come a time when they cannot be managed at home. When that time comes, it is not a failure on the part of the caregiver. It is time to expand your support team.\n\n", "Guys make your own research - stop panic Hey guys , \n\nmy family is also \"influenced\" by HD. \n\nI did some research and imo what can help:\n\n1.  Regular fasting \n\nBy fasting i mean doing atleast 72h fasts but 7 days will be better (or more) - this proccess is known for CLEARING all useless proteins in our bodies (so also mutated huntingtin aggregates inside brain)\n\n2. Regular intense Exercisse  - again autophagy\n\n3. Maybe keto diet?\n\n4. Suplements like bacoma brahmi , vitamin d3 or serrapeptase (destroying bad proteins also in brain)\n\n5. No stress / sleep etc. \n\n\nImo HD is like aizhaimers and Parkinsons and i am sure parkinsons or aizhaimers are metabolic diseases (fully able to reverse) so should be the same situation with HD. \n\nI am not doctor but tbh i dont believe doctors so :) \n\nIts easy -&gt; people with HD gene are more likelly to aggregate bad proteins (here mutated huntingtin) do we have to do all to ensure it is cleared from our brains and we are able with the power of AUTOPHAGY clear it :) \n\nWhat do you think guys? \n\nRemember preventing is much better than reversing . \n\nGood luck and dont fear guys we will all end in heaven ^^ Well this is the dumbest thing I have read today.\n\nScience does not give a shit about your opinions Why ? Ok sorry i ofended you there :/ Btw. I state all my opinions based on science . No. Take your anti science thinking and fuck off. So much toxic but okay its your choice. GL anyway Please take your misinformation and ignorance elsewhere, HD is not a metabolic disorder, Alzheimer's and parkinson's are not either and none of these are reversible\nVitamins and supplements do nothing to help the disease. Fasting for 7 days is insane and will not clear your brain of proteins but will def cause it to undergo stress and worsen any symptoms. \nThere is no scientific basis for your arguments. You are free to believe what you want but do not spread your dumb logic on people who have experienced the disease themselves. I hope your family members impacted by HD get the help they need instead of you peddling vitamins and pseudoscience Saying these kinds of things can be very harmful to families suffering with HD, Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s. Science does not care that you believe that these diseases are purely metabolic and able to be prevented/ managed / cured. This is absolutely simply not true. Is there anything wrong with encouraging people to live healthy lifestyles? Absolutely not! But there are people who live the absolute healthiest lifestyle that still end up getting Alzheimer\u2019s, people who get lung cancer that never smoked. Nutrition and lifestyle is important but it is by no means everything, and thinking this way is harmful. \n\nAlso - I am going through medical school currently.  We are taught extensively how to conduct appropriate, evidence based, peer reviewed research. Searching the MEDLINE database for absolutely any studies backing up these claims did not show anything. \n\nContinue to be curious, research things of course. But trust in medical professionals. Trust in science.", "New Potential Research Target : The Enzyme PDH Researchers in Portugal were able to improve the functioning of the enzyme PDH (by blocking another enzyme group) in the brains of lab mice.  PDH enables dysfunctional cellular motor function to recover.  In HD there is loss of motor function in cells. \n\n  \nThe researcher explained that the components used in the trial for activating PDH enzyme might potentially be able to clinically delay the progression of HD.  \n\n", "What was your outlook on life when you were told that you were hd positive? Hey people. I am a 29 year old male at risk of hd. I am planning on getting tested. I was just wondering what what kind of outlook on life people had when being told they were hd positive. My husband tries to live more in the moment and enjoy every day. It makes him appreciate little things like a bite of cake or how a piece of pizza might taste. Saying \u201cI love you\u201d means more. He also reminds himself that he could die in a car crash unexpectedly so it is best to not assume he will even life long enough experience symptoms. It is dark but helps you realize that you have no control. \n\nAlso, a word of advice, get life insurance before you get tested. If you are positive, it will be nearly impossible depending on where you live after the fact. You can also get tested anonymously by paying without insurance. Not everywhere offers it I do not think so you will want to reach out to your closest Enroll HD location. I would recommend this if possible because it will help you keep things affordable insurance wise. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this. Best of luck. Ask yourself.\n What am I going to do with this information?\nIf your answer is positive....assist in research,  plan for making my later years more comfortable, live in the now. Then get the test.\nIf your answer is negative....fuck this I am going to kill myself, not have a family, not fall in love, worry every day. \nThen maybe wait a bit longer.\nYou already have it or do not have it.\nIt is the information that can help or hinder you from living a good life.\n\u2665\ufe0f Not good I (29 F) just tested positive 2 weeks ago. My whole world has changed in that short period of time. I am obviously very sad, tearful, and at times hopeless. However, I also kind of feel like I have the cheat code in a video game. HD is no longer a question, it is a fact. Now I know what I need to do to take care of myself, my future family, and I feel encouraged to live more fully.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I are are not waiting any longer to buy that condo in the city we have been saving up for and have met with a realtor already. I started therapy for the first time ever. I am working on intermittent fasting and have a heck of a lot more motivation behind exercising diligently. \n\nBut - I do wish I would have started therapy BEFORE I got tested. I had NO idea how quickly and meaningfully this positive result would change my world ... and again it is only been 2 weeks.\n\nOne thing I kept/keep asking myself after I got the positive result was, \u201cWHY did I do this?! WHY did I need to know this information when it is so painful?\u201d And my answer was -  for future kids. I do not want to pass the HD gene down. And being able to answer myself makes me feel better, or more noble.. or not self-sabotaging maybe.\n\nEveryone is different. Get life insurance. Get more than just the basic genetic counseling if you can. And maybe have an answer for yourself when you come back and ask \u201cthis sucks, why did I need to know this.\u201d I am sorry to hear your test was not negative instead. HD runs in my so is family, can you expand on what therapy you wish you started before getting tested? Did you mean like mental health therapy with a therapist or is there a physical therapy out there as well for people with potential HD? Thank you and I wish you the best Yes! I mean mental health therapy with a therapist. It is a heavy diagnosis to comprehend and sit with - I am sure you already know. I do not know that anyone can ever be FULLY prepared and \u201ccompetent\u201d - but looking back I wish I would have done my due diligence and at least attempted to better prepare myself for the mental realties of a positive result. If I could take back getting tested I would at least you can live some parts of your day with the hopeful possibility of not having it! Counseling for sure and even that does not keep me from thinking about it every day. Sounds like you have a good family support! Shit. You are so goddamn STRONG. You have inspired me. I am in the \u2018waiting for genetic results\u2019 stage and I desperately want to lose some weight. But I keep thinking \u2018what is the point if I am going to have HD\u2019 or \u2018it will be easier once I get the results I will feel more empowered\u2019 but CHRIST you have just lit the proverbial firework under my arse! All the best to you. Gosh thank you! I am so glad I could be helpful. Also - I hope your results are negative! Sending all the goodness your way! New here.  What is the purpose of genetic counseling?  Thank you for your comment re: therapy\u2764\ufe0f Hi! Welcome! Genetic counseling is ideal for helping someone understand exactly who is at risk for inheritance as well as the process of genetic testing. But I would recommend seeing MORE than a genetic counselor- social workers are incredible, and some general therapy is super important before knowing your diagnosis", "Survivor's guilt? By miracle of chance, I was spared. Huntington's runs in my mom's family all the way back to my great-great grandmother (if not farther). My grandmother, mom and all of her siblings have died from it. All of my cousins that have been tested have tested positive. But here I am, just fine. Well within the normal repeat leves. I should be absolutely elated, and on some level I am! But I am also thinking about seeing everyone at Christmas, and I feel guilty. I have no reason to feel guilty-- I couldnt pick my genes, but I just do.\n\nI dont think there was a point to this, really. I just needed to get it off my chest. My youngest daughter and I have had several very frank discussions about survivor\u2019s guilt.  Her biological mother has already passed away from it and her sister tested positive.  She will be tested in a couple of weeks and I am making sure she stays in counseling whatever the result. My mother and sister passed away in the last 4 years from it, I have another sister in the middle stages. My dad passed away this year from alcoholism. I got tested and I do not have it. I will be the last one left in my family soon. I went through some crazy months after I found out. Everyone says I have so much to be thankful for, and I do, by God's name I do. But the guilt is real because after years of praying for a cure, and hoping you do not have it because there is no amount of money that can erase this horrible disease, you feel like you won the lottery while the people you love get to physically deteriorate to shells of their former self. It is heavy and you have every right to feel it. Just take the news slow and live a humble life. Keep spreading the message for so others affected can have growing support. Yep! My mother just passed on the 5th Dec, pneumonia complication at 53 years old. She was diagnosed with HD in 2012.  I went through hell to get tested but my wife and I had a plan, my results came through and they were within the normal levels! I was over the moon. I called my younger brother and told him the news and suggested he get it done, fast forward 3 years after his positive result and he is now divorced due to a drug problem and now sofa surfing.  I feel really bad for giving him the push to be honest. Everyone in my mom\u2019s generation had it, and the only one in mine who has been tested is positive.  Personally, if I was one of your cousins, I would be happy that it did not get all of us.  Maybe also jealous deep down in an irrational sort of way, but definitely happy for you. \n\nCongratulations.  I am really happy for you.  I am sorry you are struggling with that guilt though.  It must be extremely conflicting. Just be happy. I hope my brothers and cousins all test negative..this disease is awful. I have the gene and I hate myself every day for putting my children at risk.", "Father with no insight wants to take my HD affected mum on a interstate and overseas holiday Hi everyone! Has anyone taken their HD affected family member on a holiday that would require a long drive or short or long plane ride whilst in the mid stages... mobility issues, swallowing, speech, emotional and behaviour issues and incontinence? Just wondering where you went and how you managed it and if any places cater for shower chairs or low beds or with rails or anything? My father keeps making me out to be a bad daughter because I do not think it is safe or manageble. We cared for her at home but a year ago had to put her into care because she would lock the carers outside and assault them whilst we went to work. Then when we were home she would refuse to eat, sleep and shower. She would bang on doors at night all night wanting to come upstairs but she cant use the stairs cos of falls and the one day my dad did leave the door open to upstairs and turned his back, she fell and broke 4 ribs and was in icu with a chest drain for a month so yeah. I am 22 years old. Chosen not to get tested yet. Mother is 46 years old. Dad is a year older than her. I believe he is wanting this more to soothe his own guilt as he would always say for them to travel when the loan is paid off but they both decided to ignore the families history of HD and it is now too late I guess even though money is no longer an issue. We are from Australia.  I am really sorry to hear about your trouble. My wife (46) is in mid stages, and long road trips, or air travel are very stressful.\n\nBut maybe they just want to travel while they can? We have travelled when she was well. Went to a few different states and even the US once. They went to fiji once too. The issue is she needs puree food and thickened fluids now and she refuses to eat and drink those when she is not in her care facility. And her tantrums she throws when she cannot get what she wants are a bit severe. I cannot imagine it would be a great situation if it were to happen on a plane. It has happened on a car trip once and she was trying to open the car doors on a motorway. Also, she will fall out of a normal bed and he has little experience actually caring for her. As in showering her and feeding her and cleaning her and dressing her because I was the one who would do all that when she lived at home. He also still tries to give her food and fluids that are not safe for her to have because her chewing is not safe. I am a Registered Nurse also so I guess I view things differently and safety always comes first for me but i would hate for something to happen to my mum just because he will not see common sense.\n\nWould you take your wife to Tokyo (for example) for a week in her condition? How do you manage the trips you have been on? Are the hotels providing equipment like lower beds and pureed meals?\n I agree with you that this trip seems very ill advised. I might take her to Tokyo, but it would be very hard, and if she was non compliant it would be impossible. I would speak to her neurologist and maybe at least bring Xanax or something to calm her down. We traveled to Italy (from Los Angeles) about 8 years ago, and that trip was exhausting. We had a few melt downs and she was still relatively independent. \n\nHaving said all that, I am seriously considering a trip to EU from US next year, which will not be easy. Also perhaps ill advised but I want to show her whatever I can of the world. \n\nMy wife does not yet require pur\u00e9e food but she does require supervision at meals. We are still in a normal bed. I have to bathe her but she retains some independence. I work from home but have to check on her periodically. We have no family close by.  My sister is also a nurse, and she is trying to move closer. \n\nI am sorry that you have to deal with all this. \n\n\n\n &gt;I believe he is wanting this more to soothe his own guilt as he would always say for them to travel when the loan is paid off but they both decided to ignore the families history of HD and it is now too late I guess even though money is no longer an issue.\n\nYeah, this is probably going to be difficult but it is probably important to your father. I know it is what I would want to do if I was in his situation. Thanks for your replies. I have begun trying to accept a short interstate trip to start off with. Which is still terrifying considering her behaviour on just the weekends we have her at home. She just cries and screams things we cannot make out all day. Sigh.  update: I gave in. We took my mum on a cruise and it was an awful experience tbh. The first two nights were ok. The next two were way too difficult + she ended up with aspiration pneumonia. Thank god the medical centre on board was equipped with amazingly competent staff. It was too much stimulus for her too, I think. She seemed happy the first day though which was nice. I wish it could have lasted. It makes me so upset that life will not even allow her a nice holiday. Like fucking seriously???

What does it mean?  \"researchers have found evidence that the unwanted mutations brought on by CRISPR in living animals could be a more widespread than we thought.\"  (From SCIENCEALERT)\n\n\"In a recently published study in the journal Nature Methods, titled \u201cUnexpected mutations after CRISPR\u2013Cas9 editing in vivo\u201d scientists used whole-genome sequencing to study the mutations that had occurred in the DNA of mice that had undergone CRISPR gene editing.\"  (From BIG THINK)\n\n\"Ga\u00e9tan Burgio, whose laboratory at the Australian National University is working to understand the role that cellular context plays on CRISPR efficiency, believes the paper\u2019s central claim that CRISPR caused such an alarming number of off-target mutations is \u201cnot substantiated.\u201d\n\nBurgio says there could be a range of reasons for seeing so many unexpected changes in the mice, including problems with accurately detecting DNA variation, the extremely small number of mice used, random events happening after Cas9 acted, or, he concedes, problems with CRISPR itself.\n\nBurgio has been editing the DNA of mice using CRISPR since 2014 and has never seen a comparable level of off-target mutation. He says he is confident that additional research will refute these recent findings.\" (From FAST COMPANY)\n\n\"When asked how  was responding to the criticisms from the scientific community, he laughed and said, 'Can you read some to me? I have heard there is some nasty stuff out there.'\n\nThe amplifications (and denigrations) of those interpretations around Science Twitter may not have been as knee-jerk as all the \u201cCrispr Is Terrible and Broken Forever\u201d headlines. But still, they were an overreaction\u2014because after all, this was just a single paper. No one should presume a standalone study can predict the future of an entire technique. At most, it indicates that Crispr is entering its inevitable adolescence, when shiny silver bullet technologies get banged up and battle worn by new data. \"(from WIRED)\n\nMore Reading: \n\n\n\n\n What is your precise question? I am not particularly up to date on the CRISPR controversy, but as a scientist I think the last paragraph of the WIRED article sums it up well. \n\n&gt; That does not mean it is not the real deal. Just that it should be looked at real hard every step of the way.\n\n100% dead on. That would be my take away from this. The more issues we find in animal models, the better the final product that goes into humans will be. This is, for better or worse, a big part of the reason why basic science discoveries take so long to translate into patients; we all want to know as much as reasonably possible about the upsides and the downsides and go through cycles of improvements before using them in patients.  Several articles (and a podcast) that ran around that time were in a mourning tone, like \"oh, I guess CRISPR is not going to be a thing now.\"  \n\nBut despite the alarm being sounded about the unexpected and numerous mutations in those mice, scientists are not saying this is too dangerous.  Some scientists say they do not even think the validity of the data will be disproved.  Some scientist are saying that this is a bump on the road and that is all.  \n\nWe have more information.  We need more information.  That is all.  Crispr research continues, and there is nothing to panic about for now. Scientists do not believe anything until it is been proved over and over and over again. We know that there are so many variables that can play into experiments that the only way to 'know' anything is to do multiple rigorous studies in multiple labs. \n\nSo, exactly, we have some new information, but we need more information. CRISPR has revolutionized the way many labs conduct research so it is not going away. Labs will continue to use CRISPR for their research and will continue to investigate its therapeutic potential.

A couple of years ago my gf (26) got tested for HD as her mother's side has it and it came back positive. These past few days I have seen her fingers twitch, like an up down motion with 1 or 2 fingers. Can also feel it twitch when I hold her hand. Also when shes trying to fall asleep her shoulders make movements but it usually goes away once shes fallen asleep.\n\nIs this the beginning of it starting to affect her? I am still a bit unsure about all of this. Does it mean that from now on she will progressively get worse? Or how long it takes until she will get worse. \n\nIt is a scary feeling I am having and I dont want to say anything to her yet as she sometimes crys when she thinks about it (her mother is in advanced stages and it is hard to see her like that).\n\nThanks for reading this. Breath. Relax. It could be any number of other things. Like stress or restlessness. It might be nothing. What you are experiencing is totally normal. You are looking for it. And as a rule, you will find movements if you look for it. It is hard, but you will need to remember not every twitch is the beginning. I dont know enough about the specific diagnosis but if you google it and have details about CAG and parent CAG, you may be able to get an average age where the symptoms are more likely to begin. Call or email your local HD society too. Good luck I am in a very similar situation with my parter (and his mother being in later stages etc). I have noted twiches etc in his sleep, but having spoken to friends with un-affected partners - it is not unusual for people to flail around a bit sometimes when going to sleep. Especially if they are stressed etc. I know it is very hard to convince yourself of it sometimes, and I entirely understand how it is hard to raise these things with your partner. If raising these things is just going to cause upset (and it wont actually change anything else), perhaps some things are best left un-said? Thanks for that. I am mainly concerned because it is not a fast finger twitch but a somewhat slower one that raises up half an inch or more.", "A glitch art piece I made. Anybody else make weird art about HD?  this is beautiful! This is beautiful. Seriously If you get tested, you will be free of this anxiety. I promise. My brother has written some songs. His latest is about his restless leg syndrome which is aggravated by HD. That one might be considered weird. I do not have a recording. \n\nHere is a link to his first HD song. It has a more humorous/advocacy vibe.\n\n I/lilyaegs I would love to hear your comments on this piece. It clearly comes from a deep place. Could you provide some insight into your motivation? Specific elements that are especially important to you? I absolutely love that! Actually made me laugh out loud. I love to see when people are able to use humor for things as serious as HD. Thanks for sharing! I appreciate your interest! I honestly made it in about 20 minutes using apps on my phone but I have made a few other things similar to this. I guess for me it is about the kind of neverending awareness of your genes that comes with being at risk. There is multiple layers of genetic code, some more visible and some in the background, which is generally how my awareness and anxiety around HD changes. Sometimes it is all I can think about, other times it is just part of the background of my life. I put the CAG front and center just because of the CAG repeats in the Huntingtin gene that manifest as HD. \n\nI am actually not sure who did the original painting because I actually stole a photo of it from a collector I know who collects things from the garbage. I really liked the expression, and reminded me of something out of the Twilight Zone or Star Trek, or some weird combination of the two. Kind of adds another layer of mystery I suppose.\n\nThanks for asking! Thank you! \ud83d\udc99 Thanks!! \ud83d\udc99 matches my username :o I saved this to my phone. I adore it", "I do not know what to do (26) Sorry on mobile. \n\nAbout 2 years ago, I  was confirmed with a count of 40. This was after my dad got his confirmation, and spending the last decade watching my grandfather go through the last stages. \n\nSince then i have been going through the emotional roller coaster of seeing my neurologist every six months. The weeks leading up are full of anxiety, worrying that this is the one i go from pre symptomatic to stage one. \n\nBefore we found out about it i was diagnosed with bipolar 2. Lately ive been loosing words either mid sentence or mid word. Ive been apparently more volatile (according to my wife and of course nothing beyond snapping here and there). And my memory is garbage in general. And of my course my brain likes to try to point out other things like hey it is getting harder to think and etc.\n\nSo at the end of the day im stuck in this pattern of wondering. I do not regret know it is coming, it is now just the when. I still try to live life the best i can but this pattern is just a bit torturous to handle and i dont have anyone i can ask. My dad is still pre symptomatic and friends family and even general therapists style to understand.\n\nSo any advice would be greatly welcomed. Thanks Unprofessional opinion but after experience of a close friend: While you are okay, learn to trust the judgement of people close to who do not have issues. My friend considered himself the authoritative judge of everything (from your age) and was unable to consider alternative points of view. As he grew older, this pushed his friends away and I do not know where the personality stopped and the symptoms began. But I have no idea if this is possible with this condition and I wish you and your family the best of luck and the happiest of moments. Which brings me to one other point. Do not kill your chances for happy moments while you are young by dreading the future. Thank you. I admittedly do tend to over analyze and over think everything which.... does cloud my ability to be receptive. I do try to live, i got married to an amazing woman i met after i was diagnosed, but it is been a struggle to not let it get in the way. I do think trusting them a bit more is something i can actively work on. Thank you again it means alott My husband got diagnosed a couple months ago. He does not regret knowing either. Since then we have both started seeing therapists. I think that is something that might help you out. What you are going through is really hard and a professional helping you could really go a long way. \n\nBest of luck, friend. This really hits home with me. I am 26. My dad got his diagnosis 2 years ago. I have not been tested yet though. I have horrible memory that only seems to be getting worse. I have really started to notice that I am not remembering words. I know what I am trying to say but am struggling to get the words out. I feel like my hands are always shaking or twitching. \n\nMaybe it is all the pot I smoke but the other part of me thinks it is HD starting to affect me. A count of 40? Then you have like 30 years maybe more before you are symptomatic. There is like 5 clinical trials out today. Relax you will probably not have anything to worry about, at least not with HD. Every person is different, of course, but just in case it helps, my mother has a count of 40, and she did not start showing symptoms until she was in her mid 70s Exactly, this just emphasizes this person has nothing HD-related to worry about for a very long time, and probably not even then. If they think they have cloudy memory or whatever, that may be true, but it not due to HD if they are only 26 year old. I would go see a psychotherapist for anxiety. The odds that you are symptomatic at your age are incredibly low. I have a cag of 38. Major depressive illness for 20 yrs. I have known about HD as far back as 6yr old due to watching my nana. Now my dad is nearing the end and I am always looking and wondering. My words and memory are doing the same as yours. \nSo our situations are similar. \nKnow this. Really let this sink in. \nWithout HD our bodies and mind decay. Maybe that is what happening to you and me. It could just be aging. Not HD. See your neurologist, see a counselor. Talk with your friends and family. Be open about your fears. And know that you are not alone. There is at least two of us.\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d I am sorry you are going through this. I wonder if there is a youth support group or services in your area associated with the closest Huntington\u2019s society chapter? In Canada we have the Young People Affected by Huntington\u2019s Disease programs for those aged 14-35. Looks like there is a National Youth Alliance in the USA as well, depending on where you live.  Maybe it would help to connect with others in your age group in a similar situation? ( Having the knowledge and experience of watching a family member can help the way that you could with the short hand your been dealt immensely. You know, some folks never knew want they had, and did not recognize that their elevated responses etc were anything but normal.  Until they were, say, arrested Woodie Guthrie style \n\n\nThis is what I mean: \n* If you had a loved one that struggled with specific things (ex: not able to get all the way through a sentence, becoming angry out of proportion) you KNOW what it is and can acknowledge what it is. And make a plan to cope with a challenge that other folks do not have to deal with.\n\n\n* Some folks actually cannot mentally recognize their own symptoms. Even with significant chorea, they think they are not showing at all. They think no one can tell, or that maybe they do not have this thing at all.  \n\n\n* If you can recognize when your anger has disproportionately tripped, or have a loved one help you recognize when your reactions are big, you can work together to react beneficially.  You can find triggers that set you off and avoid them. You can reduce known stressors. Aphasia, and losing the thread of sentences is part of the process.  It is tough.  \ud83d\ude14. I wish I had some good coping advice on this in particular. I was tested pos. For hd 4 years ago i also smoked pot for 10 years and i had bad memory and problems with words i quit smoking my short term memory is a lot better", "Do I need to get my own health insurance before I get tested? I am 21 still under my parents health insurance but not for a whole lot longer. Would I still be able to get health insurance if I tested positive? Short answer: yes you would. Courtesy of the (\n\nI do not know if a positive diagnosis would affect premiums though. Others in this sub might. For health insurance, depending on which country you are in (?), you have protection from discrimination on the basis of any pre-existing condition.

But if you are already insured with them, they cannot take it away. I am sure it does not feel like top priority at 21 when you may not have a family of your own or assets to protect, but your future self will thank you! Any genetic counselor will tell you the same :) Get life insurance first if you want it. Planning on it! Do not mention anything about HD TO MD.  Keep your medical record clean. Get life insurance with care riders (do not need long term care insurance then), and test ANONYMOUSLY through a Center of Excellence if in the US.", "JCI Article : CRISPR and Chinese Mouse Study A few article titles jump out at people googling about HD research this morning.  The original research article sited was published in ( which is peer-reviewed.  It is good news, but celebration would be premature.  When something works in primates I will get excited.  For now it shows what CRISPR might be capable for people some day.    \n\nFrom the [**Genetic Engineering &amp;\nBiotechnology News Article**]\n(    \n\n\"Emory researchers previously showed that mice older than four months do not need the huntingtin gene to stay healthy, suggesting that treatment strategies that aim to shut off both copies of the gene in adult humans could be safe.    \n\nThe main challenge... came from trying to target the gene-editing system to the appropriate area of the brain. ... The scientists injected viral vectors carrying CRISPR/Cas9 into the striatum region of the brains of Huntington's disease model mice at the age of 9 months. The striatum is a region of the brain that controls body movement and motor function.  This led to a dramatic decrease in aggregated mHTT in the striatum three weeks later. The study revealed the capacity of brain cells to heal themselves if the genetic source of the toxic proteins is removed.    \n\nMoreover, in comparison with control Huntington's mice, CRISPR/Cas9-injected mice showed significant improvements on tests of motor control, balance, and grip strength, although they did not recover to the point where they performed as well as control mice.\"     \n\n\n(", "I just got my results back..    It was my senior year of high school,2007; my mom and I knew something was not right with my dad. Long story short he got diagnosed with Huntington's disease. Digging deeper into the family tree, we think it started with his dad, who then passed it along to my dad, my uncle, and both my aunts. It was at that point in my life at 18 that I knew I would get tested...I just did not know when.\n\nFast forward 12 years and the time has come. I recently got married and I would not risk giving this destructive disease to any of my unborn children. So let us do this. I got prepared. I sharpened my mind, I read books, I convinced myself everything was fine. I told myself if I had it, then it would be at least 10-15 years before the symptoms manifest and science/medication would progress. I read the subreddits, researched early and late clinical trials, lived on HDBUZZ. I took the blood test on August 6th, 2019.  They told me to come back in 3 weeks to to get the results. Can you guys just tell me over the phone?! The drive is over an hour! \"No.\" \n\nMy Honeymoon was August 10th. Four days after giving my blood I was on a plane to Jamaica, Negril. I tried not to think about anything. I tried to enjoy myself. Negril was amazing; the 7 Mile Beach was incredible! We did cliff diving, snorkeling, cave swimming, ziplining! It was an unreal vacation from start to finish and we really enjoyed ourselves. The dark cloud I had over my life for the past 12 years were gone for that week. It was too beautiful and sunny in Jamaica to be worried about \"dark clouds.\" One night we got hit with their quick tropical storms. It did not rain for that long, but that rain brought with it those dark clouds I seemed to have forgotten. Almost.\n\nBack home, August 17th; back to reality. Worked the week as usual and got ready for my fantasy football drafts. I am in three leagues, and I look forward to them every year. They are fun and they make games you normally would not want to watch enjoyable, you know? For the next week straight I thought more about Huntington's than I did in my entire life. Probably because of how I do not like seeing my dad like that, a shell of himself. Probably because no one should have to go through all the bullshit my mom goes through. Probably because I have a younger brother who thinks these same thoughts yet  we have never talked to each other about them other than grazing the subject. I hate this disease. Everyone in this thread knows what it does to families so I will skip that but from the little comfort I could take...it was in knowing that if I had this disease it would die with me and our kids would be in the clear. \n\nResults are in. I actually slept like a baby the night before. The days leading up were bad nights of sleep but last night was a good one. Worked in the morning, picked the wife up from work and headed over to the Huntington center to see the results. Car ride was on the silent side, little quick topics here and there. There was a ton of traffic, or maybe it was regular traffic and I was just annoyed; the radio was off and it was the longest fucking car ride ever. I made a promise to myself to be strong in front of my wife. \n\nIn the waiting room, I had to piss like a race horse. So did my wife. As soon as I sat down after using the bathroom, I was called into the room. Our geneticist is amazing. She is sweet and bubbly and on August 6th on my initial visit I was making them laugh and cracking jokes and it was a great time considering the circumstances. There is a little history with us since they know my dad who goes there and my mom who always brings them food. That is the Lebanese in her. Today was not like that. She was stone faced. \"Hopefully you did not think about this too much on your honeymoon.\" \"Tried not to,\" I said, even though I did. She was serious, and I was nervous. Breathe. \n\nShe got right to the point. I sat on the chair. Before I could even process what was going on, she was screaming. \"You are SO negative! You could have babies! We are so happy for you guys!!\" \n\n   Flooded with emotions. Flooded....like FLOODED! I thank God in my results. I took it hard. I was so convinced I had it, that I never prepared for not having it. It is so crazy to even try to explain or put in words. We were overwhelmed. Shocked. \n\nI would like anyone that is going back and forth with getting tested, to get tested! Trust me, knowing is better than not either way. If you know, you can prepare. They have amazing clinical trials and Huntington's Disease is receiving some of the biggest breakthroughs in research in the last 50 years. I am fully convinced within the next 3-5 years we will be able to completely treat it. If it is not a burden on your life and you are living at risk, then I would say continue doing what makes you happy. But if you were like me, and it haunted you day in and day out for over a decade, just get tested. My brother wants to wait, it does not bother him like it did me; and that is fine. My dad did not have the luxury of knowing. For the last 12 years Huntingtons lived with me. And today, it died with me. God is good. I hope nothing but the best for everyone in this thread. Stay hopeful, amazing things are happening. Congrats dude! Similar story here. My fianc\u00e9 talked me into getting tested after we got engaged so we could plan our lives and decide about kids. I also was convinced I had it and did not really care to be tested aside from when the time came to think about kids. \n\nMan the news was super weird to hear. Still is to think about actually since I have known about HD since I was 7/8 so I went about 21 years convinced I had it. I am about 10 months post test and it is still hard to grasp. \n\nI agree it is great to do but I would not push anyone to take the test knowing the emotional rollercoaster that comes with it. \n\nRegardless, I think awareness is key to eradicating HD and think everyone should be tested or take the proper measures to ensure it does not get passed on. \n\nEnjoy your new life knowing you have clear skies ahead! Thank you very much! Glad everything worked out for you as well, and I could not agree more with the hard to grasp concept, so wild. God bless you and your family and I am just as happy if not more that we are both looking at those blue skies baby!!! This makes me happy for you. I am glad you can have the life you want and that you are not carrying around that weight anymore. That is amazing! Congratulations! \n\nIt must be such a relief for you and your wife, both the negative test and being able to finally move on from the stuck feeling of not knowing. Great timing too, a new marriage and a new reality for you two. That is amazing, congratulations! I read your post with such dread and was so pleasantly surprised.  Hopefully I will have a similar story soon - good luck with the fantasy football! Thank you! Let me know either way, I am here for you. Thanks on the fantasy, I am  in three leagues one has pan out! Yes, the relief was overwhelming. It is crazy when you expect one outcome your whole life and in a matter of seconds its the exact opposite. I was emotional all day, and I NEVER cry. Waterfalls lol. Thanks for the support hope all is well on your end. Could not be more appreciative of you. When I was down in the dumps feeling sorry for myself these subreddits kept me going. Amazing how just reading about others in the same situation as yours kind of makes you feel normal again. Figured with this illness the stories are usually awful, wanted to shed light on the positive side and give hope to others that the outcome is not always gloomy. Thank you ! Even testing negative can be a big adjustment. My sister tested negative in the spring and she says she still gets sucked back into the negative/purgatory headspace of it at times.\n\nI am doing alright so far - going through the testing process right now and hope to know my status before Christmas. Good for you! Congratulations!", "Got the test... And I am pretty terrified.\n\nI am 36 years old and my mother is now 60 and in a home with HD, she showed symptoms by memory around 40.\n\nI got my blood drawn this week and now it is 4-6 weeks until my results with a few meetings in between with the geneticist.\n\nI have made a decision to draw up a \u201c4 year plan\u201d which will have goals and what needs to be done between now and my 40s, separate plans for a positive and a negative result, it is the only way I can take some control back.\n\nI never wanted kids anyway, so that is fine, and my partner and I have been together 5 years and she is supportive.\n\nSo... I dunno, never posted or done anything like this before, unsure if I am asking for advice, or just getting it off my chest.\n\nThanks. Good luck. When I got the test I just did my best to not think about it until I got the results back. Easier said than done. It woke me up some nights. Take someone with you when you get the results. \n\nInternet hugs. Waiting for the results is much harder than even getting a result you did not want. Be super forgiving and compassionate with yourself during this very stressful time. Write down your feelings so you can reflect on them later. Do something to take your mind off, like video games. \n\nJust remember - whatever the result is, it has always always been. You are just becoming wiser is the only difference. Take a weekend trip if possible to provide some space to process it all. Hoping your results are negative!! Keep us posted and good luck! Whether positive or negative, I am such it will be a huge relief to know for sure (but obviously hope it is negative!)

I cannot be tested until I am 18 but I get anxious over little muscle spasms that I get from anxiety. I also rock in my seat, move my foot in circles and rock back and forth while I am laying in bed occasionally. Is this normal? I have done this for years Weirdly that fear went away after I actually tested positive. it is a super common fear. I also have been diagnosed with the sleep disorder where you kick and shake your legs all the time, so I have lots of twitches that were scaring me.\n\nHugs to you. It is a lot to learn about and process. Yes.Very common reaction in my experience.  Disclaimer: I do not have nor am I at risk of having Huntington\u2019s, but my husband just tested positive about 3 weeks ago. What we assumed was a tic caused by Tourette\u2019s or something turned out to be the symptoms of HD.\n\nTo address your query: I have read that this type of concern is VERY common. Many people who have HD in their family become hyper focused on twitches, tics, spasms, etc. My advice is to try your best not to obsess over it! Frankly, there is no point in overthinking every little move your body makes (especially as young as you are), and it can be very detrimental to your mental health to constantly worry about it. Also, keep in mind that in the vast majority of cases, HD symptoms do not show up until your 30s or 40s. \n\nEveryone experiences involuntary movements from time to time, especially as they get older, and very often in people dealing with high levels of stress and anxiety. Heck, ever since we learned my husband\u2019s diagnosis, I have been experiencing random muscle twitches myself that sometimes cause half of my body to jerk. They always seem to occur at night when I am trying to go to sleep. The timing of it makes me think it is caused by stress and anxiety due to constantly worrying about my husband lately. This is just one example. I am sure you could find many people who experience similar sensations on a regular basis.\n\nWhat you are describing in yourself does not sound like the typical movements associated with chorea. As I mentioned, my husband\u2018a chorea has already begun, and it is pretty easy to tell which of his movements are because of that, and which are most likely unrelated. His twitches are very distinct and occur in certain places\u2014specifically his jaw, neck, and his right arm. \n\nPerhaps consider seeing a therapist to help you cope with this anxiety, and with your mom\u2019s illness. This is not something a 14-year-old should be trying to deal with on his/her own. My heart goes out to you and your family during this difficult time.\n\nPS: I wrote a long reply to one of your other posts here the other day, but had to stop before I could finish it and submit it.

Some of you may remember my post about a year ago. At my first OB/GYN appointment the questionnaire asked if either parent had a history of HD. My SO said yes.

We had not known each other long before I got pregnant so this was a whirlwind for me. Got the results that baby was negative and I thought we would live happily ever after.

I learned very quickly that he was a terrible person, but I never thought he could do that. I am so sorry. He was INCREDIBLY selfish for that. At least he is out of your life now. I am so happy your baby is negative. So sorry for your experience. I am so sorry you had to go through this, but very happy your child does not have HD. You should file for sole custody based on the emotional distress he caused. I am so sorry. I am in no way to excusing his behaviour but it is a fact that people with HD make questionable choices. I hope you find a path of healing and comfort. People with HD can have other mental illnesses before and after their HD manifests. \n\nI am HD postive and I find using HD as the excuse for his behaviour to be offensive.

I would honestly hate if anyone I knew started to treat me and my choices differently just because I am gene postive. \n\nThis dude obviously was really wrong in what he did but unless he is symptomatic you cannot blame it on HD. \n\nAlso judgments like this could very well have contributed to his mental health issues that caused him to lie and hide such a major part of his life/health that any partner should have full disclosure of. That is deeply troibling, but I am happy your baby is negative. \n\nI hope he has support elsewhere in his life so he can better accept his diagnosis. I assumed he was symptomatic. Sorry to offend you. Was not my intention. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd I have no symptoms yet. Just because you have the gene does not automatically mean you are going to start manifesting symptoms. \n\nI am not ruling things out but saying that there can be other issues other than HD before having symptoms and after having symptoms.", "Issues with HD wife (41 years old) I am looking for any advice to help my wife.  I am currently living with my wife who has HD.  she recently lost her job after disclosing her diagnosis to her employer last week.  Since then, she is holed up in one of our spare bedrooms and has done nothing but drink.  She only comes out to smoke cigarettes and eat.  She is not taking her medication and has been completely illogical since last week.  Today she began booking a cruise to 'get away' from me and anytime I leave she gets an uber to get more alcohol and cigarettes.  I came home from work early and attempted to have her mom and sister call her (both of them live out of state), but we are all 'against her' so it seems to only makes things worse.  \n\nThe situation is only going to continue without some sort of intervention on my part since I am the only person here to provide any care.  She receives treatment at a neurological center here, but they did not return my calls from 1pm today and are now closed (they said they would urgently page a doctor or nurse and have them call me but I never heard back).  \n\nMy question is what, if any, are my options of putting her in a temporary mental health facility to sober her up (alcohol makes the HD much worse in her case) and not have her released on her own reconiscense since she will definitely do so at the first opportunity.  Can a doctor authorize a certain period of time she must stay?  I can wait until the morning to call again if so.  I know I can call 911 and possibly have a temporary mental health hold put on her, but if she does not get better in that time, I am afraid it will get worse when she is released.\n\nAny advise is welcome.\n\nThanks. Hey there, I do not have advice for you, I just was very moved by what you wrote and I hope you can find a situation that is healthy for her and for you, too. She sounds a bit like my mom before she was diagnosed. Alcohol amplified the behavioral and cognitive HD symptoms terribly. It was horrible at times, she just turned into a completely different person, very self-destructive and nasty at times. I think I can say I understand, a little, your situation, and I just hope she can get some of the help she needs, and I hope you can continue to find your strength. Good luck to you. She has just lost her job, of course she is not taking this well! This step in the decline is often the biggest hurdle because it is usually the first. At least she is not driving! She is only being self destructive, I say leave her to it. She could be doing way worse. And a week is not very long to grieve the loss of a job. If she died, would you be over it in a week? Yes, these things are on the same level. For a lot of people, their job is their entire identity. What do you ask someone when you first meet? \u201cSo what do you do?\u201d She is grieving being less independent. The reality of symptoms is hitting her. She is acting completely normal in this situation. Just leave her to it. It took me a month to get over my mother\u2019s death. I literally was just sleeping. And I did not even like my mother. Let her grieve. Let her go on a cruise. Do not act like her father, that makes it worse. If her behavior changes and she starts doing things where she could hurt others, then you step in. Turns out she was driving.  I took her keys and his them out of an abundance of caution and she flipped out on me that I was controlling her.  Yesterday I found her attempting to open a wine bottle with a steak knife and tried to stop her and she threatened me with it.  A cruise for 2 weeks is several thousand dollars which we now dont have because she doesnt have a job.  She is ordering around $100 a day in uber eats deliveries despite having a full pantry and refrigerator.  We cannot sustain this for very long without going bankrupt. Open a bank account only you have access to, and transfer your savings and any other money you need to cover your bills to that, ASAP. Good thoughts, thanks.  Already have separate accounts though.  I am worried she will run up massive credit card debts on her own though. I am 58 I have HD and I used too drink: too much. \n\nShe is displaying classic alcoholic behavior.  You and she are not alone.  Call Alcoholics Anonymous they have been around for 80+ years. \n\nYour options for putting her in a facility depend on where you are.  Try calling your local detox facility. \n\nTry talking to her about this first thing in the morning when she is still hung over and feeling the worst. She needs to go to a 28 day inpatient treatment center. \n\nShe needs to apply for Social Security Disability benefits.  The neurological center may have social workers to help you. Again, it depends on where you are. Thanks, this is very valuable advice.  I was able to get her to her neurologist this evening and we now have a plan a and plan b if she refuses plan a.  I spoke with the social worker as well who walked me through a bunch of disability and other items.  I truely appreciate your insight on this and good luck.", "Grima et al. (Johns Hopkins) describe a new fundamental defect in nucleocytoplasmic transport in Huntington\u2019s disease using multiple model systems and independent lines of evidence. This defect can be mitigated with agents that alter nuclear pore complex O-GlcNAcylation and/or transport functions.  Can we get an ELI5? I am sure someone can ELI5 it a bit better, since I only briefly scanned the paper a few days ago (it is free on Neuron - go check it out!)...\n\nIt is long been known that nuclear accumulation of mutant huntingtin is a problem. The \"Why?\" to that has remained an area of research interest for many labs. This group showed that mutant huntingtin is gumming up the works for certain types of transport out of the nucleus, which, as you can imagine, is not a good thing. The paper demonstrates that there are these traffic jams that occur in brain cells of people with neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, the most common inherited neurodegenerative disorder. The paper demonstrates that traffic jams are occurring in these diseased brain cells because the bridges that connect the command center of the brain cell (nucleus) to the surrounding area (cytoplasm) is severely disrupted in the disease condition. This leads to severe traffic jams of important information flow between the nucleus and cytoplasm which may contribute to the disease process. The paper also shows that you can use certain small molecules to reverse these deficits in cell models. \n", "\"Early problems in subthalamic nucleus contribute to HD symptoms and likely impair the processing capacity and health of other brain structures, more traditionally associated with the disease,\" ", "Huntington new mutation Hi i am afraid about new mutation it is possible and how much old age People is with hd after 55 ", "The In-Between Years - Part 11: When do I tell people about my HD?  Another great read thank you.  Thank you! This is something I am struggling with a lot right now. I just ended a 3 month relationship with this amazing guy because he did not think he could handle me having HD in the future.   \n\nIt is hard for me to come to terms with it (especially considering that a treatment seems so close on the horizon), but I feel like I made the right decision telling him upfront and I think he ultimately made the right choice for himself after a lot of careful deliberation.   \n\nBut it does make me wonder if maybe I am letting HD define who I am a little too much... Maybe I am letting it overshadow my personality and life? But how do you avoid that when it is such a huge part of who you are?     Thanks for reading the article,\n\nI think it is hard not to let it overshadow your life, there is no doubt about that. \n\nThere is so many other things that are huge parts of what you are too and when the right guy for you comes alone, he will see *all* of that. I know it is easier for me to say that than it is for you to feel that though. \n\nI think maybe when the HD comes up, focusing on all the positive things going on right now in HD research and expressing optimism about the future is great. \n\nI am pretty hopeful that in a decade or so science will be there with some early treatments to start slowly delaying the onset of the disease. In another decade after that, my feeling is that it will be pushed back years more and we can all die of old age like everyone else. \n\nHow old are you?\n\nMy sister is 46 and she is HD positive and single. She is pretty much given up on finding a partner because she feels like what is the point given her age and how HD works. Breaks my heart. \n\n-\tSteve. \n\n This is interesting... No female I have told about my huntington's has decided to leave me because of it... The idea of that really scares me though........ It was a first for me, too, but then I have only had a handful of relationships since testing positive.    \n\nWhen do you usually mention HD in a new relationship?     \n\nI always feel like I need to tell people as soon as I start talking to them, but it puts a pretty heavy burden of choice on the other person at an early part of the relationship.    \n\nI have been lucky that the last two guys I dated / told about HD both took it seriously *and* did research into it on their own, but part of me always still worries that other people do not really get the full extent of what it is.     Hi Steve,   \n\nSorry for the super late reply! I have been in the middle of moving and did not have access to my computer until recently.       \n\nI am sorry to hear about your sister's situation... It is so terrible how HD can drain hope of a normal life away like that. I can relate to feeling like there is no chance of having a relationship with anyone because of a positive diagnosis.    \n\nDoes she have any symptoms yet?      \n\nI am in my late 20\u2019s (with a CAG of 45) and still pre-symptomatic. The optimist in me wants to believe there is hope for a treatment within the next 10 years. But I am also trying to stay realistic about how long it will take to get access to those treatments. I worry a lot about getting involved with someone because I am overly optimistic and then end up hurting them later down the line.         The neurologist has not told my sister she is symptomatic, but I have definitely noticed some changes in her mental health in recent years. She is quite anxious. Refuses to drive her car longer distances. Very over protective of her son. \n\nI am still hoping for an effective treatment as well, but you are right, it is important be realistic about the situation. \n\nI hope your move went well! Take care. \n\nSteve. ", "Hospitalization of JHD patients? Hello, I am making a writing over the livelihood of people with HD, currently focusing on Juvenile HD. I understand how JHD patients have a shorter life expectancy than those who were diagnosed after the age of 20-25. Since the stages go by faster and are likely to be more extreme for youth (from my understanding, please correct me if I am wrong), at what point are JHD patients admitted for 24 hour care? And before that, how often are JHD patients actually in the hospital and for what reason? Most of what I have read/seen, I see patients at home with their families, but I am having a hard time finding much information of people with JHD and I am not as educated as I would like to be on how stark the difference between the two are.\n\nAlso, when HD patients reach final stages, life expectancy less than 6 months, from what I have researched it seems like they are able to choose if they would like to stay under intensive care or in the comfort of their own home for their last moments. To me this does not seem to make much sense because most HD patients are unable to eat, walk, or move much in general. \n\nI am also sorry if any of this comes off as insensitive! I want this to be as realistic as possible and I apologize if this post upsets anyone here. The point of admission is going to be different for each individual based on the family\u2019s ability and desire to provide care with ADL\u2019s. In this way it is no different than adult onset. Every patient is variable in their onset and progression, and every family is different. JHD has a higher repeat count, which is why symptoms are more severe.\n\nRegarding final stages - you are referring to hospice and it is not unique to Huntington\u2019s. This is standard end of life care. \n\nYou are not being insensitive, you are being lazy. All of the questions you have can be reasonably answered with probably an hour of googling and reading. You are \"making a writing\" about Juvenile HD but research is based on anonymous Redditors. Users on Reddit are not going to be an acceptable citation for your paper, and please do not get medical or scientific information from Reddit. Just read the actual research papers/articles, yes you may have to buy them.  \n\n( Thank you, I have been having difficulty finding many sources and white a majority of them are vague. I appreciate it :) I am sorry, it is something that I have taken interest in, but I really do not know what sources would be best. The websites I have been using the most are ( ( and ( as well as others, and more for the separate common symptoms that arise. I have seen a few presentations on it and they all seemed to either leave JHD out of the discussion or talked about it like it was something completely different. If anything I should have asked what were some more reliable sources and I apologize for my ignorance.", "This is how I want to remember my mother. Smiling and full of love and life. Huntington's took her a couple weeks ago. I am relieved that she is free but that relief is fleeting. She would have loved her grandchildren. Love you Mom.

", "CRISPR topic discussion in the ELI5 subreddit ", "Dad (63) was diagnosed with HD with no known family history Hi all,\n\nMy dad was recently diagnosed with HD with CAG repeats of 43. He was already diagnosed with vascular dementia in June \u201819 and the HD diagnosis came as a shock. I had no idea what HD was when they told us about it in his appointment and firstly assumed it was a type of dementia. My dads father died in his 50\u2019s from cancer and my dads mother lived until she was 83 so I think it was his father that had it. My dads grandmother committed suicide so the reason it has gone undetected in our family is probably because of a lack of awareness. \n\nAlthough my dad got tested at 63, looking back on it I believe he is been displaying symptoms for a good 10-15 years. He is always had huge problems with getting into debts, he would get a \u00a340 parking fine and then ignore it and it would turn into a CCJ of \u00a33,000. There were always bailiffs turning up. His driving was also horrendous and he would always run out of petrol 30 miles from home and have to rescued on the motorway. He once forgot which car park he would parked his car so had to go round all the car parks to find it. I was only in my late teens during all this and my dad was very good at brushing everything under the carpet because he was always so cheerful about his mishaps and would joke about them. I feel really horribly guilty that I did not pick up on it all these years but we had no idea of a family history of HD. His symptoms were never (and still are not) physical - ie no shaking, no speech problems etc. It seems it was all more cognitive. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to post this here as I know this is a great community of people who are in the same boat as myself. I am getting tested as soon as I have sorted my life insurance and my brother has already tested negative. My fathers two siblings are also getting tested but as they are in their 60s now with no symptoms I am thinking they should be ok.\n\n\nETA: My dads also currently in the hospital where he is been diagnosed with heart failure due to the HD. Wow this could not resemble my family\u2019s story with HD anymore. My dad also got tested when he was 63 and was also a horrible driver, always getting into small accidents in parking lots and whatnot. \n\nI am glad you reached out to tell your story, this is a very positive community and we are all here for each other and for anyone who needs more info and guidance. \n\nI am glad you are willing to get tested, the more people that get tested the better the research gets. There is lots of positive human trials going on for gene canceling right now and it is looking promising. My family had no knowledge either, when my dad was diagnosed. His source parent also committed suicide. I understand depression and suicide are super common in HD positive families.\n\nAbout twenty years later I got my own HD positive test. Its a difficult road we walk. Knowledge is the power to make the road smoother. I wish you strength and peace in your journey ahead.\n\nIf you ever need someone to talk to, you can pm me. I highly recommend finding a good therapist if you have not already. I am very sorry for what you are going through, I know how hard it is. \n\nMy Mum was diagnosed about a year and a half ago with no family history either, and it took is all by complete surprise despite in hindsight realizing she was symptomatic for 10-15 years. One of my siblings has since tested negative and I have tested positive.\n\nA couple of things have been quite helpful to me in dealing with this. Meeting and interacting with others in the HD community, attending Huntington\u2019s Society events before the pandemic was helpful. Having no exposure to anyone else with HD before, it really helped to see how others were affected and managing. And really just normalizing the disease and symptoms a bit more.\n\nAttending a support group for at-risk &amp;amp; pre-symptomatic people was also really helpful, being able to talk openly about everything I am thinking about and going through.\n\nI am happy to listen or talk if you want, PM me or just reply here. That is crazy how similar our experiences are. My dad would do the same, he crashed into a parked ambulance once. \n\nEver since I found out about being 50/50 for HD there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to get tested. I am more of a realist (perhaps leaning towards pessimist) so I am just telling myself that I have got it anyway so anything other than that result is a bonus. I have tried to speak to some of my family members about my feelings but they just say things like \u201cyou will not have it because you do not look like your dad\u201d or \u201cyour brother tested negative so you will too\u201d. I have to resist the urge to sit them down on the sofa for an urgent biology lesson \ud83d\ude02. Yes, I have read that suicide is unfortunately more common so that is what made me realise my great-grandmother probably had it. I never knew her obviously but I felt a sadness for what hell she must have been going through. Thank you so much for your kind offer. I am sorry but I completely agree that knowledge is power. I want to do my bit to spread awareness of this little known condition that tears families apart. Yes my dad was the same way, I remember about 8 years ago we pulled up into a parking lot and nosed up to far and bumped into the car in front of us. There was a lady sitting in the passenger seat and all my dad did was get out and walk into the store..... I had to go apologize to her and check her car over to make sure it was ok. There were so many little embarrassing thing that happened like that but as time went on I realized that it was all do to this disease. \n\nI am in the same boat as you, I would like to think I would get tested one day but I just keep telling me self that I have it either. My sister that is 2 years older than me tested positive for it and so I am sure I will have it. Just taking measures right now to try and slow things down and get my self ready for the test. I have also volunteered my self within the community to do fundraisers and to spread the word about Huntington\u2019s. \n\nI am sure you know that if you are your father\u2019s kid than \u201cnot looking like him or your brother does not have it so you do not have it\u201d does not really matter.

I (23F) just recently discovered this sub after learning about the existence of HD in my family. From the limited information I recently learned from my mom, my paternal great-grandmother had HD and passed away from it, her daughter/my paternal grandfather\u2019s sister had it and  passed away from it, and my father\u2019s cousins both have it and one has already passed away from it. My paternal grandfather is in his early 70s, has had some varying health issues over the years, and, as far as I know, he has not had any testing done. However, he is also the type to not let anyone know if anything is wrong and is also the type who has not been to the doctor in 20 years. For the past few years, his life has been pretty consumed with taking care of my grandmother who is older than him and has been declining in health (recently diagnosed with dementia). \n\nWhere I am concerned is the fact that my father passed away when I was five years old. My father was 32 when he passed from a brain hemorrhage and organ failure stemming from complications with the Type 1 Diabetes he had since he was 13 y/o. Thus, there is no way of knowing if he had HD and if I am at risk, other than by looking at my grandfather. My father was my grandfather\u2019s only biological child.\n\nAlthough my grandfather is seemingly fine, I have read about it appearing late in life, as well as the \u201cindeterminate range\u201d. I do not want to ask him about any of it due to everything going on right now with my grandmother. Should I even be remotely concerned about having the gene? Should I consider testing since my father is deceased and so much is unknown? \n\nI apologize for the lengthy post, and I am truly so sorry for what each of you are going through. From my limited knowledge of the disease and it is effects on my family members, I see how horrible it is. Sending love and light to you all. Hey there, I am in a somewhat different but fairly similar boat. I just found out that what claimed my mother\u2019s life, while not confirmed, was understood to be HD. \n\nFor me I cannot help but choose to assume the worst, maybe it is intuition or maybe it trauma regardless I believe that I will get it. With that mind set of wanting to be prepared for the worst case scenario this is plan I came up with my dad. \n\nBEFORE any testing or the term Huntington\u2019s ever leaves your lips apply and secure long term insurance. It will not be easy but it is important and the younger you lock it in generally the better it will be. \n\nAfter securing long term insurance, then I will pay out of pocket (roughly $1000) to get anonymously tested. \n\nTo me I need an answer, not necessarily for me but so that I can truthfully inform future partners. If I do have HD then I want any romantic partners to understand what that would mean for me and us in the long run. \n\nI hope my personal perspective helped a little.\n\nEdit: Huntington\u2019s is autosomal dominant meaning all it takes is a single gene in just one parent for it to be able to pass down. That being said it cannot \u201cskip\u201d a generation, so at the very least there is a possibility if your maternal grandfather does not have it (not showing signs is a positive indicator but I noticed the range of symptoms can start like 10-80ish as well).\n\nTLDR: if your grandfather does not have it, then your father would not and you Should be fine. That being said it is up to you if a maybe is enough peace of mind to plan your future on. I got tested months ago. It cost about 250 at a HDSA center for excellence. Now here is the thing if you have HD the news is going to fuck your shit up. I think at your age you might want to live a little. I understand you want to make plans. I have been in a depression since I got an appointment to start the testing process. Getting results was awful. Agreed. It does get better but I would advise put it off for as long as is tolerable. I waited about 10 years between finding out I was at risk and testing and I am so thankful I did (positive here) Deciding to test really depends on whether you can live normally while not knowing or if it is going to nag at the back of your mind forever. For me personally, I just assumed I had the gene and lived that way until I was pregnant with my first child. Then my husband and I agreed that we had to know.\n\nIt killed my grandfather and my mother does not want to know if she has it or not, so she will not test for it. Fortunately for me and my children, I was lucky enough to not inherit the gene. I had my mind prepared for the worst though and I cannot describe the relief I felt when I got those test results back. Ask yourself. \"what will I do with the information?\". You answer will guide you as to whether you should get tested or not. You may decide to wait a bit.", "Could hypomania / bi-polar disorder be the first symptoms? I am currently in lockdown with my gf, she is 32 and her mother, 55, has HD, with very noticeable chorea, but she can still talk (hard to understand as I am a non native English speaker), eat and insists on living by herself, which means she can take care of herself for now. I have met her a couple times only, so I do not know much.\n\nThe thing is, my gf started showing symptoms of some sort of hypomania, there are days in which she wants to do nothing, then all of a sudden she starts doing lots of stuff, gets bored and leaves them half done. She fluctuates between easily irritated to lethargic to euphoric, these variations are from day to day or take a couple days to change. Talking to my therapist about how it affects me has led him to think she may be experiencing something similar to hypomania (I never mentioned HD to him so far).\n\nOther than that, she has restless legs, which makes it difficult to sleep together, as I have very light sleep and the way she moves her legs is basically up and down, banging on the mattress every minute or so.\n\nFor the rest she shows no twitching or any muscle related issues. She started the process to get tested years ago and ultimately decided not to do it, but it is clear there is this \u201cdark cloud\u201d constantly hovering above her head.\n\nI am mentioning all of this because it is greatly affecting me. It is been very difficult to manage the day to day, I am sleeping very badly, eating badly and it is started affecting my work (she is not working atm and I am wfh). We have fights every 2-4 days. We have been together for 6 months, give or take and living together  for 2 months now.\n\nI am doing therapy for a while now, started because I wanted to be able to handle these conversations with her better. The easy irritation and fights have been there since the beginning with her, and initially I thought this was a problem with me, maybe cultural differences or improper way of expressing myself. Living together all of this greatly intensified and I have tried different approaches, but things keep escalating.\n\nI am wondering if this is something completely unrelated, or if this hypomania, mood instability is an early symptom of HD? I have only recently recently started reading about the disease and it is all very scary, I really do not know what to do and it is taking a toll on my mental and physical health.\n\nTL;DR my gf is showing symptoms of hypomania or bi polar disorder or mood swings. Is this an early symptom? Could this appear before other, more noticeable / related to HD ones? I have not heard of hypomania being a symptom of HD, but considering how different presentation of symptoms can be for each person I would not be surprised if it is.   \n\n\nI know that HD messes with the ability to regulate emotions, so maybe that is why she is having more obvious mood swings? The starting things and stopping them in the middle sounds like executive dysfunction, which could align with early HD but could also be due to a lot of other things like ADHD. And these things could be exacerbated by quarantine.   \n\n\nDoes she see a psychiatrist? Maybe they could put both of your minds at ease by managing her moods with some mood stabilizers.   \n\n\nI know it is scary and overwhelming, but from experience I have learned that symptom searching will drive you nuts! But also, I know that is just a natural instinct in the beginning, so it is very normal to freak out a bit at first. I am trying to convince her to see a therapist, she told me she managed to get an online consultation scheduled for Sunday. However I really do not know as at the time we have been fighting and I caught she lying to me a couple times.\n\nIt is been very difficult, in the last fight she threw things at me, one pot was smashed in the wall and I am nearing my limit.\n\nShe gets defensive and irritated if I try to talk about this subject (mental health, etc) and I fear a big fight will break if I try to talk about HD specifically, which I did not so far.\n\nThe symptoms she displays other than starting things, getting bored and leaving them halfway through are euphoria, talking a lot non-stop and seemingly not paying attention to what I say. Impossible to hold a conversation with her when she is like this, and she acts very positive when she is like this, usually when she drinks. She is been drinking a lot, one, two bottles of wine a day, even more, for consecutive days. When I tried talking about how I think this is too much she started hiding it from me.\n\nShe is been having some insomnia / disrupted sleep patterns (not being able to sleep at night and taking naps during the day), and when we do sleep together she has the restless leg problem, which is usually a lot stronger if she was drinking. The movement itself is not twitchy, more like a long controlled upwards and downwards bang on the mattress, she does it even before she falls asleep. This makes it almost impossible for us to sleep together, which is affecting our relationship a lot as well. Somehow she blames me for it, and gets upset if I try to suggest trying something to see if this gets better (lashed out at me for suggesting buying a magnesium spray that is supposed to help).\n\nI think she may be in some sort of denial, and this is making our life together hell, and every time I manage to convince her to try controlling her behaviour, getting help, etc, it lasts a few days and then everything gets back to the way it was.\n\nI got desperate recently after she threw stuff at me and rented a small studio flat, in hopes that staying at a different place for some of the time may allow me to work (if I lose my job I have to leave the country, I cannot stop performing / working) and having some peace, while allowing us to stay together. She reacted by saying I am abandoning her, that I do not care and if I leave for the other flat I should not come back.\n\nI love her, but it is so difficult to manage all this, I do not know what else to do. I am currently at the house with her, trying to think on the next steps, my therapist said I should keep the flat, talk to her and propose trying again before giving up, but that she has to understand and really try to have some stable behaviour for it to work. However he does not know she may have HD (at this point I am thinking she does, even without the test).\n\nApologies for the long, messy text. I guess I need to vent and maybe hear what others with HD experience would do in this case? I do not want to leave her, but I am struggling with anxiety, insomnia and it is affecting me a lot. This last week I could barely work between managing these fights and overall stress of the situation. Thanks. Does your girlfriend have any history of depression? Is there any family history of bipolar disorder I or II? Do you know if she has experienced such hypomanic symptoms prior to this timeframe (e.g., in her 20\u2019s)? It is possible that this could be unrelated to HD and instead a mental health disorder independent of that, but family history and a major depressive disorder history would make that more likely. If her behavior is becoming impulsive or causing such interpersonal issues, it is definitely worth getting assessed sooner rather than later as any episodes is hypomania increase the likelihood of full manic episodes later. Also, proper assessment is key (including having your perspective for collateral information) because she may not have insight into her behavior changes or their impacts. Good luck with getting more answers. And good on you for reaching out for your own support through all of this. That requires courage and self-awareness on your part. The insomnia on her part concerns me as that is a good predictor is a manic or hypomanic state. Her anger and violent behavior would also be a strong indicator. \n\nThere is some evidence that standard antidepressants, such as Sertraline, may in fact worsen symptoms of someone with undiagnosed mania. She would more likely require a mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic to recover from this manic state. She started taking Sertraline during a previous relationship, from what she tells me the ex was abusive and she got depressed during it. The relationship lasted 3 years and a half, and according to her, it was after taking Sertraline that she got the courage to end it. Also, and strangely she tells me that she started feeling the effects of alcohol when drinking only after starting Sertraline. She gets euphoric when she drinks more than a couple glasses of wine, I think she mistakes this state with being drunk, but that is just my observation.\n\nI do not know about depression or history of mental issues in her family though. I know she has no contact with her brother and father, from the little she told the father was abusive, hit the mother and had anger issues. I do not know much about the brother, but it seems he treated her just like the father treated her mum.\n\nI tried talking to her about getting assessed, checking if her medication is working fine, and that there is definitely something abnormal going on. When I breach the subject of hypomania or bipolar she gets angry and either yells at me or walks out, which ends the conversation. My suspicion is the ex mentioned she could be bipolar at some point and it angers her a lot.\n\nI am not sure if she is aware of her behaviour or if she is in denial. I am trying to go slowly and convince her to understand the need to talk to a specialist, not about the HD, but about this specific hypomania. That it is something for her own personal gain and maybe that a simple change in medication or even dosage could change a lot for the best. \n\nBut it is very difficult now, she does not want to talk, the fact I got desperate when she threw the things and got the flat made her very upset. I am trying to let things call down and approach her carefully for now. That is my current guess, and what I am trying to convince her to do: a consultation with a doctor to tell about what is happening. I am not sure what the results would be though, as it seems she ignores the symptoms, she does not seem to be aware, of at least be willing to acknowledge the mood swings and abnormal behaviours. Everything seems to be my fault, all I say is offensive and she does not take any criticism.\n\nOne example of the way she distorts what I say: well before the lockdown, we did not live together then and I can to spend the night at her place. The next morning I woke up, happy to be with her and said \u201cI am going to make a good breakfast for Olive\u201d (her dog). She immediately got angry at me, because to her saying \u201cgood breakfast\u201d could only mean I was implying she makes terrible breakfasts and meals for Olive. In the same way, sometimes she decides on a plan with 5 steps and wants me to agree with all five steps and do the sequence of things she wants: let us go to the park, take a walk by the left side, then go around a different area, stop by that bench, make our way back through the woods then get back to the entrance. If I say anything else than agree she gets upset and tells me I am being negative. If I try to defend myself, yelling starts and a fight ensues. When this happened she left me in the park with the dog and walked home by herself. Even though anger can be a symptom of HD and getting tested is a very scary subject to think about, if she is not willing to see a psychiatrist and therapist to work on this issue with you, then it is still an unhealthy situation for you. \n\nI am around the same age as you two and positive for HD and I currently see a neurologist, psychiatrist, and therapist on a regular basis. I am also very aware of how my emotions might get out of control, and I have been managing my depression with bupropion for the past few years. Mental health can be an explanation, but I do not think it is ever a good excuse to hurt others. \n\nIf your girlfriend wants to ever talk to someone about the testing process, I am here anytime. I know it is very scary and not something to take lightly, so I understand your concern about not prodding that too much. \n\nAlso, the fact that she is drinking so heavily is pretty worrying. I do not think that is a symptom of HD, but again I could be wrong there. I try to avoid drinking because I know it can make my symptoms worse in the long run. But maybe she is using it to numb her emotions right now. \n\nUltimately, as hard as it is to face, you cannot force someone else to get help. They have to want to change on their own. All you can do is keep checking in and suggesting that she take care of herself. But please do not feel like you have to be there to the detriment of your own mental health. It is possible to still be friends with her if you worry about her without being so intimately in her life. And as trite as it sounds, you really cannot help anyone else if you are not taking care of yourself first. \n\nre:meds -- I take a low dose of sertraline to help with anxiety attacks, but I have had better luck with bupropion for moods up til now. I wonder if maybe she could try a different type of medication? It sounds like her current dose is not addressing her emotional swings for the moment. Finding the right dose of meds can take a while, so it could take a few tries to adjust it correctly. \n\nAnyway, sorry to hear you are going through this right now. This sub is always open if you need to vent. I hope you can get yourself to a better place soon. Poor insight, especially during mania, is very common. You are not likely to make much traction with getting her assessed during this period, but I might suggest making some notes on her behavior so that it can be revisited when the episode ends. As with the other post, it is important you take care of yourself and just try to minimize the damage that her moods can cause right now. Thank you for your reply. I tried talking to her today, trying to justify my decision to get a flat (to which I have not gone yet) so I can keep working and well while we deal with this. She says I am running away like a boy.\n\nI also tried to explain her behaviour during the last week but it again ended in her saying It is nothin to worry and I am the one who is complaining over nothing. The conversation ended with her yelling and leaving the room.\n\nShe does not seem to be going through an episode right now, but the anger is very easy to come by as well as not taking any kind of criticism well. It is very difficult to have a conversation like that. She does not seem to care when I tell this is all hurting me and I need some peace to keep things going.\n\nI am concerned because the work week starts tomorrow and I need to be able to focus, there are people depending on me to be able to work themselves and I feel it will be very difficult staying here and work during this \u201cCold War\u201d period.\n\nHowever I am also concerned in going to the flat and then being very difficult to come back to check on her, to try and make peace. Of course, I am also concerned on how she will behave if I leave now.\n\nI am unsure if I try writing to her father about this, I do not want to sound as if I am complaining about her and I am sure she will put it all on me. I do feel like a coward right now and even questioning if I am the one who is distorting reality to fit in my narrative. Thank you so much for your reply, and reassurance. \n\nAs I replied in another part of this post, it is all being very difficult and I keep second guessing everything. She is still angry and blames it on me, which I kind of agree with her, maybe getting the flat at this point was too rushed.\n\nAnd yes, the drinking would be a major issue by itself, but I think in her case it is even worse, as it appears to trigger or intensify these episodes. And from taking to her in the past it seems she enjoys when she is in these highs, so it can become a vicious circle: she feels well and then drinks more to feel it which can create more episodes and this would keep going to unbearable levels.\n\nI fear moving out (just with a feel things to stay temporarily at the flat) may prevent me from coming back. I worry about what may happen to her mood and behaviour if I move out also. At the same time, there is work, responsibilities and my own life and health to care about. Her throwing things at you is physical abuse. Her outbursts are also abusive behaviour. Regardless of your concerns for your girlfriend's well being, you need to be taking care of yourself first--because nobody else will. From what you describe, your living situation with her has become untenable. I would separate your living space from hers--as in move elsewhere, or make her move elsewhere--so you can at least get the rest and peace you need to conduct your life and be healthy. And you should tell her that getting her symptoms under control is a MUST if you plan to continue the relationship. Thank you for your reply. \n\nYeah, it is abuse, but I do not think she does it on purpose / with malice. I believe it is more of a difficulty controlling emotions and how to deal with them.\n\nIf I did not love this woman as much as I do it would be easy to just not care and assume the worst. It is is difficult because she is a loved one that I do not want to abandon or leave to deal with her issues alone.\n\nIt is a very delicate situation right now, I am in the flat but I miss her a lot, and worry about how she is. We talked yet again before I left and she accepted the need to treat the symptoms and to get therapy (her first session was yesterday). She also accepted my need to get out for a while - she felt sad nonetheless, and I still feel guilty and alone by my own right now. But at least I am able to focus on work and pick up the slack of the last few weeks.\n\nI am still hopeful that all of this will end in the best way for us, I still hope that she decides to get tested one day and it comes negative, that all this is non related and we can have a good and long life together. But even if that is not the case, I am not ready to give up on her. As long as I am able I will stand by her side. At the end of the day, it does not matter \\*why\\* she is abusing you. What matters is whether or not she acknowledges that that is what it is--abuse--and whether or not she is willing to get the treatment that she needs in order to stop mistreating you. It is of course up to you to decide whether you want to stick with her regardless, but there is only so much good you can do for yourself, her, or the world if you are living in an abusive environment. It is toxic and over time it destroys. And you only get one life.\n\nBest of luck to you whatever you choose. Thanks for your comment. Yeah, I understand what you are saying. I am doubting myself and having a hard time discerning what is right or wrong currently. I still wonder if this is not something that I need to change in myself, either being more resilient, or more understanding, and also how much of this situation is also my fault somehow. \n\nIt is difficult and I definitely need outside perspectives on what to do. Last weekend I tried coming back to her place and we spent a good Friday and Saturday. On Sunday she got upset because she decided we needed to go for a walk in the morning, even though we agreed on going during the afternoon. I was at my computer reading some articles and when I asked if she could wait for me to finish before going she stormed out of the room. I quickly stopped what I was doing, changed and went to get her to go. My mistake was mentioning what we had agreed on, she got very upset, started yelling and told me off, sending me away to the flat.\n\nI left, and the next day I messaged to check on her. She acted as if nothing had happened, which makes things even weirder. I will try to make sense of it tomorrow talking to my therapist.", "Improvement in HD? Hello everyone! I am a caregiver/child of someone who has huntington's and I was wondering if anyone else has ever seen major improvements in their family member or someone with HD. \n\nI thought my parent who has HD was entering into the late stages of HD as they needed assistance when eating, could barely walk anymore, and I thought they were not capable of speaking very much at that point in time, and just slowly entering a vegetive state. But as of a week ago, they can somewhat walk on their own, no longer needs assistance eating, never stops talking etc. We did not change any of the medication and doses. Has anyone else seen this happen? Is this normal? Because I was not expecting any kind of improvement (I am not saying I do not like that they are improving, it just came as a shock). ", "New heartbeat abortion bill I am looking for the general consensus of couples where one person has Huntington\u2019s. If you or your partner got pregnant and the child would be at risk would you have an abortion. \n\nWith these new heartbeat bills passing I am becoming increasingly scared I will not have the option to abort when for so long I assumed I would have an abortion because my partner has HD. Also I do not think you can genetically test at 6 weeks so there is no way of knowing if they have the gene or not. \n\nI am just really frustrated and want to know how most people feel about this I am a 28 yr old woman who has tested positive for the gene. Thankfully l am considered  asymptomatic. My husband and I, have decided that if my birth control fails causing me to get pregnant, then my next step would be to get an abortion. \n\nI learned about HD during my teen years and one of the things I learned was that there was testing available and I instantly knew that I needed to find out whether I was positive or not. I cannot imagine knowing about the disease and risking passing it on. After contemplating for a few years, by the age of 18, I had already decided that if I test positive then I will do everything in my power to not have kids. (I would ultimately like to get tubes tied). I am grateful that my birth control has worked thus far. \n\nI do not know why it had not  occurred to me that these stupid abortion laws could affect me and others in the HD community. I live in a state where things could go backward really fast. It is an extremely frustrating and scary time we are living in. \n\nI know that one of the options is to test the fetus for the gene but i think you are correct that the test is not available before 6wks, but it is required to sign a page saying abortion is required if the fetus tests positive. I wonder if they would take away the option to test until the fetus grows up to be able to consent for themselves. I sure hope not! My SO has the gene... She is pregnant right now. Due to fucked up laws we can not get the embryo tested here.  \n\nYou are right, the procedure can be done the soonest at 10 weeks. We will get it done in the netherlands. Ironically once we have the diagnosis we can get an abortion until 14 weeks without questions asked. Good to know. I am having a lot of anxiety cause my SO is tested positive and I have an iud that is causing my a lot of problems and want it out but it is risky cause I live in Ga now and do not want to risk getting pregnant You can be positive for the gene and still be asymptomatic? Is it because your CAG number was very low? My CAG count is 44, so no it is not because of CAG count. I found a place that does genetic testing and because my dad had already tested positive I was able to get tested. The requirement was to prove that one of my parents positive gene and to go through the genetic counseling before receiving results. To be fair, it is definitely possible that I have symptoms that drs have not found. I gone to the several neurologists who have all stated that I am showing no symptoms but I do worry that the drs are missing symptoms because not enough people are familiar with this disease. I also have undiagnosed chronic pain and sometimes I think the positive Huntington\u2019s gene is getting in the way of finding answers but I cannot be sure. I accidentally replied in a new comment. Let me know if i did not explain it properly or if you have any other questions. Ok sorry I was under the impression that you had meant you had a special form of Huntingtons that was asymtopmatic for life. I did not realize you meant that you were only currently asymptomatic but that symptoms could still manifest later in life, correct? At 28 it should be too soon for any major symptoms to appear especially with such a CAG count as low as yours is what I have read. I am also a 28 year old asymptomatic gene positive woman.

My spouse is in the early stages of disease onset and is struggling with anxiety that seems to have gotten worse in the last couple years. When something goes wrong it snowballs quickly and I am struggling to handle it. Eventually they calm down, but in the moment I tend towards being defensive and reactionary and I am struggling so hard to overcome it. I often try to just not say anything until it is diffused, but I do not want to feel like I am ignoring them. I realize I should probably find a therapist...for the time being, does anyone have advice or reading recommendations perhaps? Following. \nMy wife is just now starting the whole anxiety thing. Wont let me go anywhere without her cause she is worried I will die and she does not know anyone here. This has led to a forthcoming move back to our hometown. I shoulda known better than to move away in the first place. The HDSA puts out a caregivers guidebook. It is really helpful and gives insight into these sorts of questions. The personality changes are very difficult and I am sorry you are going through this. \n\n This, in my opinion, is arguably one of the worst parts of this disease. I thought I had a thick skin when my mother came to live with us several years ago, but it is a whole new ballgame when the person that gave birth to you and cared for you in the early years of your life starts yelling \"F\\*\\*\\* YOU!\" over and over, in your face, at the top of their lungs because you did not bring them a breakfast burrito from Sonic. Oddly specific, I know, but it is a little thing to us and any little thing can set off the fury. I had to recognize that it was not personal. It was not controllable. Much of the time, she was still loving and caring, but it only took a small thing to trigger the rage. From there it was a combination of distraction from whatever had riled her up, bartering, or just waiting it out. Huntingtons Disease diminishes the capacity to react proportionate to the stressor.  The filter which regulated the angry chemical signals had got holes poked in it. For example.\n\n\nConsider that it is a hell of a lot easier to prevent stress then it is to contain that snowball reaction of anger or anxiety that comes of it.  For THEM, and therefore for YOU.  \n\n\nDo not change plans suddenly, give a chance to adapt.  The shift of expectation to change can sometimes be hugely stressful for them.  \n\n\nShift anxieties if you can. Example: Begin to offer limited options \"tacos or spaghetti for dinner?\" vs asking for responses to open-ended questions -- which intermittently and suddenly become really difficult to respond to.  That difficulty, inability to create an answer or to verbalize it, comes and goes for some and it is disturbing for them.  \n\n\nThose are some easy things that I can think of. Fixation** is really tough.  It is like a dog with a toy, you know what I mean. But that people with HD are dogs with toys.\n\n **Leave it** the person can say, with their conscious mind, but their brain will not put it down. They know it is not logical but their brain is warning them of a danger and will not leave off.  \u2639\ufe0f It is intense and disturbing to them. And their loved ones too of course.

I am so scared of upsetting my mom or getting yelled at or berated that I try to have only surface level interactions with her \n\nFor example she now has the irrational fear that her dog will get run over so she will not let it outside and she does not have the mental capacity to potty train the dog so it just pees everywhere.

Background - grandmother passed from HD, my mother is nearly 60 and has not been tested nor outwardly presented with symptoms (although I have noticed a few things when i visit that make me think about it - cognitive effects etc but that could also be down to recreational cannabis use).\n\nI have always had nerve twitching, muscle spasms due to ongoing back issues and take medical cannabis to help me sleep. Last few months I have noticed twitching is getting worse - I can feel a muscle  in my arm which makes my middle finger twitch involuntarily. This preswnts numerous times per day and can last for up to half an hour or so. \n\nQuestion is should i look at getting tested? Assuming my mother doesnt have HD, is there any chance i could still have it? Or is it more likely caused by back/nerve impingement? As I am typong i have a muscle twitching in my calf and foot.... Knowing Huntington's is a possibility can make you very paranoid about these things. Whenever I twitch or stumble I think about it as well.\n\nHowever in my experience watching 4 different people go through the disease, if it is a Huntington's twitch the person is often completely unaware of it until someone else points out that they are twitching or jerking.\n\nGoing solely off of your post here I think you are still in the clear for now, but talking to a doctor or therapist may be a good idea if you are really nervous about it. The mental health aspect of having this cloud hanging over your life, just waiting for the storm to break, can have a heavy toll. If your mother does not have it, you cannot have it. It is a genetic disease and only can be passed if that person is positive. As another person commented, you may now only notice the twitches more because you know now that is a symptom of HD. Making the decision to get tested is a really personal thing and there is not a right answer. Personally for me, I would rather know than keep wondering. I also know I do not want kids so that did not factor into it at all, but just look at all the factors and figure out if it would be worth getting tested and if you could handle the results. Hoping all the best for you and your family! Thanks for your reply. I definitely notice muscle twitches and nerves pinging. So that is positive I guess. You are right that it is a dark cloud. I am in the middle of starting a new family and house hunting after leaving my ex 3yrs ago. Looking back I wonder if any of my depression/moods were early signs or if the toxic relationship contributed to that. I just do not know. But it has got me down, why start all this? Why bring another child (I already have 2) into the world if there is a risk? \n\nMy grandmother had a late diagnosis and a very sharp decline around age 80 so that is another positive if it follows the same path for my mum and if i happen to get it. Its difficult as my grandmother had 10 kids and i have a heap (Well over 50)  of cousins and second cousins. It sucks that a lot of them could develop HD. \n\nI have a doc appt tomorrow so I will ask their opinion and investigate. Thanks for the reply. Yes, i understand the genetics of hd but I do not know if my mum has it. Her mum had it but did not preswnt until later in life. Is that pattern continued or can subsequent generations preswnt earlier? Oh sorry I misinterpreted the question! They can be present earlier, the age where symptoms start to show is dependent on the number of CAG repeats in the gene which can vary in each person and is not dependent on who they got the gene from Thanks, that makes sense. For what it is worth as far as children go I know opinions are often split on the matter, but my mother decided to have me while she knew she was at risk. I have not been tested yet, but I am still happy being alive even knowing how it might turn out in the end, ya know? And with medical advances these days it is completely possible to have a child with zero risk of passing on the disease. Just my experience, may mean nothing:\nMy husbands mother also had not been tested when she was in her 60s and claimed to be symptom free. That turned out not to be the case exactly, she just did not realize what she was experiencing was not normal aging. It was VERY MILD for her age but still there. When my husband and I decided to get married she got tested so he would know (positive). \n\nMy husband on the other hand has always known his uncle had it but insisted his mom did not. He was very twitchy all the time since I would known him. After his mom tested positive it got worse and he was convinced he had it because he would always been twitchy and had gone through a period of severe depression in his 20s. He got tested: gene negative! His twitchy took some time to subside but has gone down a lot in the years since. He is just a normal depressed, twitchy guy. \n\nDoes not mean you do not have it, just that your symptoms do not necessarily mean that you do.", "HD Buzz Article : Cellular Border Patrol  This is neat, but what could be the implications for treatment?", "What is Next for My Story? I would like to share my story, and I am also seeking guidance.\n\nIn the last year I decided to get anonymously tested and found out I have HD, CAG repeat 40.\n\nI am 30, and have been aware of this possibility for about 2 decades now. I remember it hurt me more to find out my mom had the disease than me having the possibility. It is still hard to talk about even now. \n\nRegarding testing, I was never opposed, but also not particularly motivated. I did not want to get tested publicly as I worried about the possibility of discrimination. When there is an alternative, low probability is unnecessary risk in my mind. My family is late onset so I figured knowing at a young age did not really matter. My mindset was that I would get tested if I ever got into a serious relationship.\n\nWhen I was 18 I joined the military and went off on my own, pretty much forgetting about HD for a decade. I had a few different mood disorders to learn how to understand and manage, so my mind was elsewhere. I did not have any serious relationships during this time, so getting tested was not a priority.\n\nIn my late 20\u2019s I decided it was best to know if I have HD so that I could adequately prepare for the future. There were a couple decisions to make which would change based on my diagnosis. I also came to understand that in a relationship, letting a person know my diagnosis long before it gets serious is better for everyone. So I set the money aside and found a place where I could be tested anonymously. \n\nI think it is worth mentioning my mindset going into testing. Early on in my life I decided to assume that I have HD, so that it would be easier to cope with if it turned out to be true. This helped me, I think by both lessening the initial blow and shortening the amount of time I needed to process. \n\nI got tested, and as I learned I had HD, I felt nothing. I thought this was because I had already come to terms with my situation. The following weeks on into months showed me otherwise. Waves of fear and sadness hit me, but mostly fear. A confusing amount of fear. I think this must be why some commit suicide after learning their diagnosis, to escape the fear. Fortunately I have experience with suicidal thoughts so I understood how to manage and not give weight to mine. \n\nSome of the worst of it was the visceral feelings I got from imagining, and trying to come to terms with, what HD will ultimately do to me physically and mentally. Having seen firsthand what it did to my grandfather on a week by week basis for years, I was paralyzed by fear of this death. I would wake up at night panicked and in a cold sweat. It reminded me of how I felt when my depression and anxiety were at their worst. The kind of angst that pushes past pain and into numbness, making you feel like you are not real because your mind does not want to deal with it. I have gotten used to this fear now so it does not bother me as much, but I do not expect it will ever really go away. This is simply the reality of the situation, fear of death is universal. \n\nBut there is strength and dignity. I do not believe in hope for a cure, this feels to me like an attempt to escape. If a cure comes I will be happy, but I certainly will not let my feelings be contingent on this. This is outside my control and would feel irresponsible for me to rely on. I would rather let go of my attachment to thinking I will get to live a full and normal life, or that I can avoid more suffering than what I initially expected from my life. I could die in a car accident tomorrow anyway. I plan to progress through my disease in a way I feel is dignified. \n\nThese are my feelings, I hope they do not come off as anything more. I respect your feelings and think they are valid, even if they are different than mine.\n\nNow to the point of my post, what is next? This question is meant for those with personal experience. What do I do next to best prepare for HD at my age? What did you do? What do you wish you did earlier? \n\nIf you made it all the way through this, thank you. \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out. You can find help at a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\n\nUSA: 18002738255\nUS Crisis textline: 741741 text HOME\n\nUnited Kingdom: 116 123\n\nTrans Lifeline (877-565-8860)\n\nOthers: \n\n My wife is HD +. After the initial shock of getting the test results she decided to be an active participant in research and clinical trials. While it may not help my wife directly, the hope is to help others as the science evolves. This has been a great way for my wife to remain positive. We are a couple of decades into the HD journey and I am absolutely impressed with how the science in both symptom control and gene silencing has progressed. \n\nAs to preparing for the future, my advise would be to just live your best life day to day. Stay on top of the research and work with your nearest HD Center of Excellence. If you are so inclined, get involved as a research participant which can be therapeutic in knowing you may be helping people in the future. Do you and your wife believe that some sort of cure or treatment will be out within the next decade? Sorry for the question, but my mom is 41 and positive. She has mild chorea but other than that she does not really have any symptoms. Though probably unrealistic, I am hoping and praying that some treatment or cure will be out before she ends up like my grandmother. I am not too worried about myself and my siblings since we are all very young and science is evolving exponentially, but I am worried for her. I have heard a lot of people say something will be out within the next 5 years but people have been told they are only 5 years away from a cure for 20 years so I am a bit pessimistic. Please give me the most honest answer you have and please do not sugarcoat it if you have an answer. A cure is coming but I cannot say when. 5 years could be realistic. The blood-brain barrier has been the main obstacle to finding a therapy that will work but that has now been largely solved. There are several gene silencing clinical trials right now and several are showing good results so far. My wife was being evaluated for the Unicure trial but was eliminated for being slightly outside the control parameters. I would recommend visiting  and searching Huntingtons to see what all is going on. There may be trials or studies that your mom can enroll in too. Hi there, my mom has HD, and I read obsessively about trials and studies. Like you, I am sceptical of this magical 5-year period that always gets bandied about, simply because the brain is such an incredibly complex thing. My personal opinion is that we may not find a cure for HD right away, but that we may learn how to work with the modifying genes that bolster the body and can help delay the onset and progression of symptoms. \n\nSomething along these lines is pridopidine, which is just going into Phase III trials. If all goes well, they are expecting topline results by Q1 of 2023. If the trials go well, the drug would not be a slam-dunk cure, but it would slow progression, and I will take that option any day of the week. \n\nI also wanted to note that I have not been tested yet, but I really related to the way you have imagined your future with HD. What must it feel like from the inside, especially to lose command of one\u2019s cognitive abilities? I love to read and study languages, and to lose that fluency is the most terrifying aspect of the disease, to me personally. \n\nIn the meantime, I am throwing everything I can at HD in case I have it: exercise, supplements, diet, stress reduction, sleep, meditation. My body has done an amazing job bringing me to this point in my life. It deserves all the support I can give it. Yeah, I am more optimistic about a drug that slows symptoms than I am about a cure. Hopefully if we get one that slows symptoms, it will pave the way for actual cures and can buy my mom some time until we get one? \n\nI am not worried about myself and my siblings whenever it comes to a cure, I am a teenager and they are still kids and since scientific research has increased exponentially over the past 20 years, by the time it hits us I do not think we will have much to worry about. My mom's a stay at home mom so I think the stress her old job would have put on her makes things a bit better for her, but she is not interested in going on certain diets so I am not going to force her. I have some vitamins that I think might be good for her that I will recommend, but she is pretty fit and does not eat a large amount so I am not going to try and voluntell her to go on a diet. Her and my dad's philosophy over this is to try and live worry free and however the hell you want so you can make the best out of the years you have, so I am not going to force her to go out of her comfort zone. I am pretty into fitness and naturally like healthier options (I am not a health nut or anything like that though) so whenever I cook I want to start to try and incorporate some healthier things in there for her. I go on 2 mile walks every day and she and my grandmother (dad's side) are all going to start walking with me. My mom's always talked about going on walks with me but never got around to it so hopefully this is the push she needs. The weather's super nice where I live, and I think she will like the peace and quiet away from the little ones. How did you find an anonymous testing center if you do not mind my asking? I keep looking around and I have yet to find anything. \n\nI feel you on the fear of the cognitive and physical decline. As a martial artist the idea I will not be able to continue my art is terrifying. I figure if I have it ill just do what I love for as long as I can. I contacted a genetic counselor at UCLA for my testing. I recommend going to hdsa.org and using the locate resources function. You can email your local HDSA center of excellence(found with the locate resource function) with a query about anonymous testing and they will send you in the right direction. If you need any more support let me know, I am happy to help. Thanks for the thoughtful response. I really like the idea of participating in clinical trials. I will definitely look into it \u263a\ufe0f", "Hallucinations and HD Hey, I got to question for you folks...\n\nI do not know much about hallucinations in HD patients other than a few statistics I googled and was wondering if anyone knows more.\n\nMy mom has HD (40 CAG, age 68) and has started hallucinating that there are bugs on her and biting her.  She can SEE them all around her and will even point to where she is being bitten at that moment (no bug is there).  We have done stuff like change out her soap, bought different sheets, gave her a spray bottle of aloe, bought new clothes / pajamas, benadryl,  etc.  It is in her head and nothing we do seems to help (mentally or physically). She says they are in her clothes and can see them clearly on the bed.  She was caught trying to set the bed on fire due to the bugs..  No one else is itching or sees bugs.  There are no bug bites on her.  There WAS a small knat (fruit fly) issue in the kitchen due to a forgotten potato but it was not an issue for long. I feel like that was the trigger but there was a minor change in medication @ the same time (same generic med but the color changed and shape changed - dont know why).  The lady that cleans the house does not see bugs.  \n\nYall do not know how much I truly wish there are bugs in the house and not my mom losing her mind.  I wish we had the biggest bug problem the world has ever seen. I want to put bugs in the house just to make it true.\n\n\"The bugs\" is all she talks about and it is breaking my heart. I have explained that this is in her head too many times to count.  She understands what I am saying but cannot reconcile that with the fact that she can see them and feel their bite.\n\nShe has expressed the desire to end her life due to the stress and anxiety so I hid the knives and dad hid the gun. She is not very mobile but has tried to go outside unsupervised. She sees her HD DR in Memphis regularly and a DR local to her in Tupelo.  She is on several meds and we trust the DR to make the correct pharmaceutical decisions. I suggested he increase the frequency of the Klonopin for anxiety. She begs us for it @ 4 PM when she knows she cannot take it until 7PM. We have to tell her \"no\" for 3 hours but it is a break from talking about the bugs.  Dr added something for the hallucinations an blaming it on HD.  The med has not helped (yet)..  \n\nI am going to continue to do my piece and think up ways to things she can do to \"fight the bite\" (spray bottle, lotion, ice pack, cortisone, etc).  I hope that I am not encouraging bad behavior.  We never pretend tbe bugs are real but also never minimize her situation or that she can feel them bitingher.  Anything driving a person to suicide must be taken seriously. \n\nIs this normal?  What am I missing?  Has anyone had to deal with it?  Is it a phase? Will it get worse? Will I lose hope?  What tricks can I try?  What are some good distractions for hallucinations? Should I play along with the hallucinations?  Will she ever \"get it\" that this is in her head?  If I could fix the bug bite problem, we could go back to a semi-normal life.  Life would be good.\n\nI need help.  I need ideas. My aunt also had hallucinations and they were also of bugs. Is she on anti-psychotics? I do not know that it can ever \u201cget better\u201d so to say as HD is progressive, But my aunt did move on from the bug hallucinations at some point, I think after she was on more regulated medications and not giving them to herself. I find it is best to just be as honest as possible, while not accusing or being rude. So saying that no there are no bugs but understanding that she is afraid is probably a good way to go. \nEdit: Also anti depressants are very helpful, and when you find the right combination of medicines at all the right times life can be pretty good. It take trial and error but I promise it will be okay, my dad is late stage and very happy and outside of HD very healthy. My aunt hallucinated hair on everything. It compounded on the difficulty she already had swallowing, because every piece of food had \"hair\" on it. She also had OCD, so this really was a clusterf*ck. My uncle, bless him, was the most patient man I have ever seen, taking time to feed her and blow off the \"hair\", but eventually it got to the point where she just could not eat and was on a feeding tube until the end of her life. \n\nMy mom hallucinated snakes and fire everywhere. I believe she was given an anti-psychotic and her caretaker also stopped letting her watch TV shows dealing with the occult (Charmed (her favorite!), Supernatural,  Buffy/Angel, etc.). I cannot really say which helped more (probably the meds) but the hallucinations were definitely eased. My mom thought everything was wet; walls, blankets, the floor everything. I took my mom to a neurologist. The doc is said hallucinations and delusions are par for the course. They added some things to her meds and it slowed down a lot. my mother has started to have auditory hallucinations, i heard that its fairly normal Yes it is normal. Totally normal part of HD. Antipsychotics can help. My HD husband takes 15 mg per day of generic abilify -- it can be very expensive but is reasonable at costco. Also, contrary to what one might expect, CBD did nothing for him, but high THC edibles have been very helpful in staying calm -- over 100mg of THC per day (but start smaller!).\n\nIt probably really does not matter what you do -- agree, disagree, whatever. But agreeing with a person undergoing psychosis is generally considered the most humane approach and the best way to keep communication open. I would just ask about the bugs, acknowledge the bugs, but do not make a big deal out of the bugs. Yep, bugs, got it. Sorry they are bothering you. What is for lunch? Want to watch TV?\n\nHope this helps -- sounds very trying.", "16 weeks pregnant and waiting for amniocentesis results My amniocentesis is scheduled. Partner is CAG 40. I cannot face the reality that I may have to terminate this pregnancy. I am already in love with my son. He cannot be positive, he just cannot. I made the mistake of buying one little outfit for him. It is hanging on the door. I suppose I am just torturing myself. I know my partner does not want to get him tested. I feel so alone in my decision. Any other couples out there who have been in this position? Words of comfort or advice are much appreciated. We have been pregnant twice now with the intention of having an amnio done at 11 weeks. Unfortunately for us we lost both babies before we could even do the test. I think it is important to remember that no matter what the outcome is, you and your partner have each other. You might lose this baby and your heart will absolutely break, but you can try again. And your heart will heal.\n\nWe live with this disease always waiting for test results, always waiting to be sick, it is hard to believe in anything but the terrible sorrow that is to come. I am glad you have decided to have a family and to make the hard decision to not pass on HD to the next generation. It is very brave and I hope the absolute best for your family. You cannot be faulted for falling in love with your child and keeping it if you choose to. There is no law that you have to terminate for a positive result.\n\nThe future is bright with research for HD + people. \n\nSincerely, CAG 42. I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing with me. This is really helpful to hear and gives me a lot of hope. \n\nThis disease is new to me, and I am sure being pregnant is making it more difficult for me to navigate through my emotions. I suppose I will get better at coping after some time. You are right. Thank you for your kind words. It is much appreciated. Hang in there, we had the procedure done 2 months ago.. everything was fine.\n\nThe hard part is, not letting the process get to you. That is awesome. I am so glad your baby is okay. I hope that same for my little dude. As an HD + person, please believe me when I say, it is ok to hope and to love just like anyone else. Most of our lives it is just the distant future (or a family member). We still get to live and be happy if we want to. It is not always easy, but we deserve to just as much as anybody else.\n\nThat said it is also perfectly ok to curl up in fear some days. Or not have an HD+ baby to spare them pain. It is what you think is right and no one can fault you either way. For what it is worth you do not have to terminate but I understand and support the decision.  Generations of my family had children knowing the risks.  I have a daughter and we are unsure.  It is why I exist and possibly your partner too. I am 38 years old and untested.  I would not wish I was never born. I love my life. I have a dark cloud hanging but ultimately life is a beautiful gift to me.  Eventually science will fix this.  I am in it for the long haul.  I want a family that at some generation gets to tell this disease to fuck right off.  Weather it be mine or one years from now. Not to sound insensitive, but why would not you do IVF to be sure? That is what I did. We certainly will in the future. This baby was a surprise. Got it, I wish you luck my friend, will be thinking of you. This would be super expensive, for me at least. Worth it to prevent it It is extremely expensive. I am still waiting for the results of the prenatal testing. If negative, the test will have cost about $1K. If positive, terminating will cost another $3K (so I have been told). The emotional toll is something else. I believe one round of IVF is $12K. For future babies, I do not know what I will do. It is negative! Baby boy is totally fine! The waiting nearly ruined me, but we made it. He is okay \u2764", "How to get tested? How do I go about getting tested?\n\nSorry for asking such a general question but the healthcare system is confusing to me, and I do not even know where to start. Do I just call a center of excellence and ask? I think I would prefer to be tested anonymously and pay for it out of pocket. I live in NC, USA, if that makes a difference. ANY information would be helpful.\n\nThanks guys. My husband just asked his normal doctor about it and he hooked him up with the right people. \n\nYou could also try looking up if there are any support groups in your area. That way you can talk to other people and ask them who they saw for testing. \n\nHope that helps! I got tested last year - I went through a center of excellence, and they gave us (my sister got tested as well) the option to be tested anonymously. That said, it is likely a bit more pricey out of pocket because they require genetic counseling, etc., before they will allow you to get tested.  BUT, FWIW, I think the genetic counseling was pretty valuable for both me and my husband. I would recommend you get someone to go with you and support you through the process!\n\nLooks like Duke is an option for you! Good luck! Hey there hope you are ok,  I agree with other responses and you should have a close friend or relative with you and definitely participate in pre post test counselling. HERE IS  A  lINK OR  two tnat will have info on where to go and lots of medical info.  Good luck to you! I called my HDSA chapter and asked to do it anonymously. They allow it, but you have to pay for the blood test and a little bit of counseling. I think it depends on how your first session goes.  ", "Is it possible to get a HD test before November? Hello,\n\nI had an appointment at a local university scheduled but had to cancel it due to the doctor saying it was not possible to get my results before November. \n\nI would like to get my results before then because I have a deployment with the Navy coming up and do not want this disease hanging over my head for 6 months while I am out there. Does anybody have any advice? I am in San Diego. Just wait 6 months. I had a super long wait and it was the worst 3-4 month of my life. I got the results when I was 27. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are close to 18 there is no point in knowing right now. Get a good foothold on a career or life first. I am 27 too and I would prefer not to waste 6 good months of my life sweeping on a ship away from my wife if I do have the disease you know what I mean. True but the army/navy has medical care(VA) that could be very useful later in life. I am not an expert on the VA but you might want to check on the lifetime benefits. Then why waste six months whether you have it or not? If you do have it you never know when it will kick in. If you do not have it you could get hit by a bus tomorrow. Just because you have it does not mean time is wasted but just because you do not does not mean time is not wasted. \n\nAlso if you get tested positive in November will it be too late to get out of your deployment? \n\nCompletely your choice but just wanted to flag.", "Testing For HD During Pregnancy Question\u2026.\n\nI know you can test for HD during pregnancy. My question is what happens if the test is positive and you want to continue the pregnancy. \n\nWill the fact that your child has HD permanently on their health records?", "Blood draw last week. Results in a week. I am getting my results in the next week.

Wow, cannot believe being asked to keep something like that from your parent. \nHope you have a lot of support from others!\n\nGood thing it is a late onset, gives a lot of time for life. We have been keeping my sibling\u2019s positive result from my affected parent for over five years. It sucks, but it is doable. My mother is in late stages and we just do not want to upset her (not like your situation where they choose not to test).  Virtual hugs \u2764\ufe0f Good luck!! I tested positive last week, I did not try to guess at which way it would go because as I am sure you are aware, it is 50/50, or 25 in your case I think if your parent is untested. \nI cannot imagine going through this and not telling my family. \nIf you want to talk during this limbo, please feel free to message. You will be running on adrenaline right now. \nIf it is not good news, there is no telling how you will deal with it. I am only a week in. I feel flat, disappointed, highly strung and sometimes nauseous but I have not cried, whilst everyone around me are throwing condolences etc. It is humbling but really a sign of the gravity of what we are going to have to deal with. Results day will be a whirlwind no matter what the result is. You will deal with things how you few with things. Just know you are not alone in good or in bad. If you need anything at all, even a great big virtual hug, I am here for you.", "I am worried about legal ramifications of testing for HD. Would not a services like 23andMe be more anonymous? I do not mean that 23andMe are more anonymous out of the goodness of their heart. But afaik that test can be done anonymously.\n\nHowever if I do the test through a national health service as I do not think it is possible to hide the information that I took the test. Is that right?\n\nSo would a service like 23andMe actually be better? And if I do not trust the accuracy of that test I could do two tests with difference companies each.\n\n**I do not necessarily need perfectly informed advice. Just any information whatsoever would be greatly appreciated!** : ) Thank you. No, absolutely not. With a doctor you have a myriad of legal protections, such as hippa for starters, that I do not think that you would receive with using 23&amp;me for testing. Additionally I would be surprised if 23&amp;me even did do HD testing as it is usually beyond the scope of most blood test, pretty specific iirc. It is HIPAA! 23andme does not offer an HD test    Oh, I was not expecting a reply that fast. I am from somewhere in the EU, but I might find something similar to it, thanks to that, thanks for mentioning it.\n\nThere is legal protections, but the appointments are under your name correct? I think doctors can access your medical history to see that at least you had that appointment right?\n\nI do not think it is usually done with a pseudonym right? (under hdreach it is apparently)\n\nOf course it is country dependent, but if your answer is US dependent or wherever dependent it would still give some perspective!\n\nMaybe there is no alternative though, that would be a bummer. There is hdreach but it is $450 (+$750?). That is too bad. Throwing in that Ancestry DNA does not offer a HD test either. I do not believe any similar heritage tests do. They mostly provide feedback for common potential risks such as susceptibility to diabetes, certain cancers, anemia and the like - but they never actually diagnose anything. It just shows whether you are more likely to have/develop these conditions. Any clue if these costs are ever partially covered by insurance anywhere? Yeah my experience is mostly US based. I cannot really say for the EU but in USA there is some laws against genetic discrimination, such as  If the USA has such laws I would be surprised that the EU does not as well.\n\nI would first start talking to your primary care doctor. What goes on there has confidentiality; I think you are being overly paranoid. I'ts not good enough that I as a citizen have the right to not be discriminated. If  for example I want to immigrate then I am not a citizen. So I still want to worry and figure out what information my medical record will have.\n\nBut I will have to begin with what you suggested. Thank you for the help. I am not a US citizen and I have yet to be discriminated against for HD. No problem. Anonymously? No. It would not be anonymous if they ran it through your insurance. Ah! Good point. Thank you. Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.\n\nI have checked 187,554,669 comments, and only 45,234 of them were in alphabetical order. UK Based.\nI looked into this myself, after having spoken with a genetic counsellor, assigned to me through the NHS.\nThe consellour told me that there would be little benefit in getting tested, because if a positive result was found, it would make things like mortgage applications / life insurance policies / things requiring medical background checks almost impossible to get.\nI have not found a company thus far willing to test and share results anonymously, which makes sense really, given the ramifications of a positive result (support requirements). Insurance coverage is based on each insurance plan.  If testing anonymous they will not cover.  Many times they are more likely to cover test if it is for a diagnosis confirmation (doctor thinks symptoms are HD) versus less coverage for pre-symptomatic testing as they do not \"see\" this as a necessary test.  I do think over time with new medicine advances, insurance will support pre-symptomatic testing as medicines will hopefully be given to stop symptoms before they start.", "New to this, glad to find this subreddit. Hi, so, I am not the one at risk of HD, but the rest of my new family is. It is really hard to deal with right now, as I have a one year old. Partner sort of had a rough upbringing, moved around a lot, all that jazz. Will not go into too much detail here. His father has pretty much been in prison his whole life. They do not really have a relationship, but he called my partner recently and revealed that he has Huntington\u2019s. Spiraled out that night, and have been learning as much as I can lately without burdening my partner with information overload. He is estranged from family, so it would be hard to get anyone\u2019s information or records. I did some sleuthing and found out his grandfather died of it at 70, and at least another uncle did at 87. His dad is in his mid-50s and says he does not feel any different... but who knows how long he has had it anyway. Partner is 29. Now we are in a catch-22 with all of this and testing... he feels fine, so why go and test and then be burdened with that knowledge. But with a child, the unknown can be a bad thing. Baby was a (happy) accident, as I had been told ai could not have children. Now I feel so guilty about something that I suppose was out of my control. I do not know what I am looking for in this post, just want to thank everyone who contributes to it. And I admire everyone is strength and bravery. I will be sticking around here for a while. Any advice from anyone who has been in a similar-ish situation is appreciated. Thank you. Hi there, first of all, take a deep breath. Being hit with this information out of the blue is a lot, and you should allow yourself and your partner all the space you need to feel the feels and take it all in. I was in a very similar situation where my sibling was diagnosed and was the first person in our family to ever have it. Learning of your at risk status as an adult is a huge shock, and then thinking of the risk for your child(ren) is incredibly overwhelming. Be sure to take time to really process what you have learned. The choice to be tested is an incredibly personal one, and there is no right or wrong answer, it really is what is best for you and your family. You can never \"unknow\" the result, so you want to be sure to make that decision considering fully how it will impact all aspects of your/your partner's life, not just knowing whether or not your child is also at risk. Unfortunately, this new reality is not going anywhere, but that also means you should not feel rushed to make such an important decision. \n\nIf testing is indeed what you decide is best, I encourage you to pursue life insurance/disability insurance/etc. before being tested to make sure your family is as protected as it can be. I also highly recommend anonymous testing so you can keep it out of your medical record for as long as possible. Some HDSA centers of excellence (US) offer anonymous testing, and depending on where you live there may be one in your area. ( also has a ton of resources and support groups to help. Best of luck to you - just know you are never alone in this no matter how isolating it feels at times. I fully agree with this, good luck OP \ud83d\udc99", "My great aunt passed today My great aunt passed today\n\nIt is been a long painful journey for her. She has been in a home since august \n\nI am really fearful of the future my grandma is going to have. She was diagnosed in 2010. I remember when she told me about it. We were driving to my OB appt to check on my oldest and she just calmly said \u201cdo not have anymore kids after this one, you all have a chance of getting it\u201d\n\nShe shows so much symptoms now. The movements, forgetfulness, falling all the time. Her medication is so expensive she has to get grants to pay them off. It is just a lot and I feel so bad for her. \n\nShe now only has 2 siblings out of 8. I am really sorry for your loss\ud83e\udde1 I know how you feel. My wife has it, which means my kids may have it, and so might my grandson. That terrifies me to think about. I am sorry \ud83d\ude10 \nI do not even want to get tested Thank you It is a tough choice. I am not sure what I would do. So sorry for your loss. Remember that she is in a better place now. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f Keep in mind your kids are only at risk if you are a carrier. I am sorry to here that. Shes got to be in a better place now. I am currently working on putting my mom into hospice this week. She fell and broke her neck about 5 years ago, It took them a year to realize it and she had already been fully paralyzed by it at that point. Her doctor kept on blaming her symptoms on Huntington's disease. All of her plumbing in and out come/goes into bags. She cant do anything for herself. My dad and mother inlaw have taken care of her this far. Now my dad is going threw chemo and cant do anything. It is a hard process.\n\nThe Huntington's medicine is criminally expensive. I give her cbd/thc for the movement and it works wonders. She normally has a balled spot on the back of her head from rubbing it on the pillow 24/7 but since she has taken cannabis she has started growing some of that hair back. Also it helps with some of her depression. I will actually see her laugh at a show she is watching now instead of staring off into oblivion with the \"I want to die\" look on her face 24/7. Thank you Oh okay my grandma said that if my mom had it I have a 50% chance and my kids have 25% but this was when she first got diagnosed Jesus I am so fucking sorry. It sucks but I know what you are going through. She asked her dr about smoking but he shut that down quick saying it will make her symptoms worse so she will not touch anything That doctor does not know anything and is wrong on so many levels. It sucks she got cut off from a potential respite from this horrible disease. Do you think you could convince her that her doctor is wrong and get her to try CBD at least. I told her it was untrue. My bf has his card and he talks to the budtenders and they where telling him which ones work best for Huntingtons. I told her that and she was still not willing to try. Her sister was even smoking home grown stuff her husband grew and was doing great with her movements and mood. My grandma has pretty much given up at this point and it is sad. She will not try CBD either That is really sucks and I totally understand her giving up. This is such a horrible disease. I work in the marijuana/hemp industry in Oregon and have seen so much good come out of these products. People need to be reeducated about cannabis/hemp. The anti-marijuana propaganda is still doing its job even though the truth is readily available. If your mom has the gene, you have a 50% chance. If you have the gene, your kids also have a 50% chance. If your mom does not have it, you and your kids have a 0% chance of getting it. What makes you feel that way? Do not get me wrong, I understand, but I would like to know why from the perspective of someone at risk. I am writing a paper on it. The 25% only applies if your mom has it and if you are untested. Honestly I am scared to get tested because I do not want to live in fear of what is going to happen to me. I know symptoms do not show until later in life. So I do not want to freak out over every little thing that might be a symptom.", "Need A Place to Vent I do not want to bring anyone down-you are all so positive and supportive. Where can I go to let all of this anger and bitterness out?  Any suggestions? Therapy On my list of to dos for tomorrow... I will speak for myself and say that I think it is ok to venthere. Worst case is that you will not get much responses. Sometimes we all need a place to vent even when we know it will not \"fix\" anything. You could even talk about your venting in therapy tomorrow. :) Find one of those smash rooms in your area and go break some stuff! I really could do some damage...not a bad idea.  I have such a headache from the rage crying and I just may take you up on that suggestion. I am sorry you are feeling angry and bitter. I do not think voicing your frustration will bring anyone down. I think most people can relate and will validate your feelings. I think the real question is how to cope with those feelings.\n\nI think everyone has a different ways of coping and some are healthier than others. I think best advice I have ever heard and given to others is to be kind to yourself. Holding onto anger and bitterness only hurts you. \n\nI feel bitter when I feel trapped by my situation or when I feel like I do not have choices. Most of my anger is really just frustration over lack of control. Both of these emotions for me surround the idea of powerlessness. Trying to accept a loss of power or control over your life or the life of someone you love is difficult. I think that takes time so if you are in the middle of a loss be kind to yourself and give yourself time to heal without expectations. If some time has passed and things are not getting better or are getting worse then I would reach out to those that you are closest to for support. If you do not have people that you are close to then that should be priority number one because almost everyone can benefit from having meaningful relationships in their lives.\n\nReally general advice but I hope it helps even a little bit and I hope that in time you feel better. Take care. You described why I feel this way perfectly.  I accidentally discovered through Ancestry that my father (deceased) with whom I was VERY close, was not my bio dad and my bio and his cousin died from HD and my two new bio sibs have HD.  I am a middle aged mom of teens and am furious. I am also trying to keep my shit together in front of the kids while I get everything in line to be tested.  I am nothing short of enraged, terrified, and utterly heartbroken. I really appreciate this sub and everyone who has the strength and courage to share.  I never knew what HD was before.  If by the sheer Grace of God I do not have the marker, you better believe I am NOT leaving you all behind.  We need a cure yesterday!\u2764\ufe0f I praying for you!! \u2764\ufe0f Please, voice your frustration and anger. I think it will be therapeutic for you. I am sure we have all felt very similar emotions to you. This is a safe space. What a sweet thing to say. Welcome to the community. I hope you are negative but regardless we will be here for you \u2764\ufe0f First of all, you can vent here. Anyone who does not like it does not have to read it. Sometimes we are positive but this is a horrible disease and it is okay to be realistic. Let anything you want out!\n\nAlso if you go on HDSA\u2019s website you can join online support groups where you can vent all you want. I recently found my biological family too, and found that I had a chance of HD. I went through the testing process and it was agony. Between finding out I had a 25% chance of HD in April, and getting my results this week, it was a 2.5 month wait and it was absolutely brutal. It was a rollercoaster. It is okay to vent, you are going through something so scary, and some well-meaning people will tell you to \"stay positive\" or some useless advice like that. Just know that what you are feeling is normal. This is scary.  I found out Monday that I am negative. It is so cheesy, but I truly have a new lease on life and I feel like this experience has changed me for the better in a deep and meaningful way. I wish you all the best, and am happy to listen to you vent!", "I look like my HD+ mum! In your opinion, have the people in your family who have tested positive been genetically similar to the positive parent in other ways (looks, height, eye colour etc.)? I know this is not an indication of what genetic testing would show, I am just curious. I look much more like my mother than my sister does - and I have always assumed I would be the positive one (if one of us were). We have chosen to not be tested at this point as ignorance is bliss, for now. I was diagnosed last summer and my mom passed in December. I look more and more like her every day, especially now that I am wearing all her old clothes. I look exactly like my Dad but inherited the gene from my Mum. My sister looks a lot more like my Mum than I do, but is negative. Sorry for the loss of your mother, enjoy wearing her clothes I am sure she would like that. You never can tell, thanks for sharing x This is a common question! We have maaaaany many genes that influence our appearance, and they are independent of the HTT gene. You can look identical to your HD mom and not be HD positive. \n\nThat said, my whole life people told me I look just like my dad, and I did inherit the mHTT gene. I used to worry about this a lot. I was sure that I would be positive as I am the only one of the kids with my hd + mom's looks; fair skin, blue eyes and light hair. The reality is I was the only child who was hd negative. I would not so much say genetically similar as far as looks. \nBut I do believe I can \u201csee the HD\u201d in my family members faces when I look back on pictures. Obviously some of that is confirmation bias, but. It is weird because (I am positive) I feel like I can see the fact that I have Huntington\u2019s in some of my pictures. Like the change in my smile as years have gone by. Maybe true, maybe paranoia. How do you see this in pictures? Am trying to trace family history of the disease and am not sure how far back I can get since it was not diagnosed until 1800s. My thought was to ask people who share a common ancestor if they knew about it in their family. So if my group A has 7 people so far and group B has 3 or whatever and we all trace back to William Smith then maybe that is my patient zero.", "Late onset Is there anyone here who has experience with late onset HD? My grandma died at 83 with HD and Alzheimer's, which is very rare since usually people with HD die before Alzheimer can even present itself. My mom is 60 and has no symptoms, I believe she has a CAG of 39. I got tested negative a few months ago, my twin sister is not tested yet. My question is if people have any experience with late onset? It is obviously way better than early onset, but it also feels like a ticking time bomb. My Mom was diagnosed in her mid 60s. This was before there was good testing, so we were living by the general guideline that \"if you make it past your 50s you are probably safe.\" She was not presenting any clear symptoms so we figured we were good and that it had stopped with her Dad. We lived life and did things not knowing what was lurking in the wings.\n\nHer diagnosis was devastating to say the least. \n\nMy Dad, who had been involved when my Grandfather was sick, was kind of in denial for several years. He freely acknowledged Mom was sick and declining but believed that he could take care of her long after she had progressed beyond his caregiving abilities. The four of us siblings mostly rallied pretty well. One sister, the caretaker among us, probably dedicated too much energy to helping out. There was one huge argument with another sibling about my brother exerting his power of attorney authority.\n\nMom died at age 79. I would like to know more about the environment and physical actions of your grandma as well as the mental condition from 50 yrs on.\n My wife has 37 CAG and the line leading to my her died at 76 and 75 (her dad and uncle), 80 dad of them. But the mental issues for her and her uncle started at 50 yrs. Her dad did not start getting physical symptoms until 66 yrs. Uncle was a machine shop owner/worker and dad was a trucker. Neither of which is particularly healthy occupation, especially in the time of leaded gasoline. \n\nMy wife does not have physical symptoms but does have learning and problem solving issues now. Perhaps her dad had the same. I am hoping that healthy living and low stress can extend her useful life. Grandfather did not have symptoms until his mid-60\u2019s and passed around 80. His family (mother and siblings) all got symptoms in their 30\u2019s so when my grandfather hit 40 he figured he was safe to have kids (obviously no test at this time). Perhaps his CAG count had something to do with it (41), but he might have just been lucky. My grandma died at 86, my mom is 61 with a CAG of 40 and no noticeable symptoms. I am 32 with a CAG of 40 and hoping for many many many more symptom free years. It is enough of a ticking time bomb feeling though that I did IVF with PGD so that my kid will not have this shit hanging over her head Thanks everyone for your replies.\n\nI do not know much about my grandma's progression, just that symptoms started above 70 and that she struggled with depression her whole life. Age of onset of the parent you inherited it from seems to be most accurate on estimating your own onset.\nWhat I can say is, that my grandma has worried her whole life about the disease and this made her mental health so much worse. Low stress is definitely something I wish you guys can keep managing. I am not aware of the influence of healthy eating/exercise on the disease, you might find some scientific articles on that on Pubmed. Dad is the first we know in our family with HD, though in hindsight my granddad definitely had it. \nDad has a 40 CAG repeat. Started around 69 with some odd things he would say, but it is declining rapidly recently with visible changes in every 4 weeks. In hindsight he started having some mood issues early to mid 60\u2019s. Late onset but still no ability to enjoy retirement for him. \nThat is why I am choosing not to have kids even though we could have PGD IVF. \nWith late onset it is still a tough decision. It is sacrifice for kids (which I get is worth it for many), or front load life and live with the flexibility to eat and drink and go places now instead. My CAG is higher and I do not want to risk being sick earlier in life with a child still in the nest. My mom is cag 42 she just turned 80", "Huntington\u2019s and ADHD? Anyone have any experience with HD and ADHD/ADD? I know the two are not correlated but I am curious to see if anyone has or taken care of a loved one with both of them?\n\nI have recently been diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD (ADD) and am curious to see how they exist together. Thanks in advance! My mom has HD and ADHD.  I think the ADHD was one of her earliest symptoms, along with her depression.

Hello I am a 15 year old with no symptoms of this disease my parents have no symtoms they are 50 my grandparents on both sides lived 77-83 without going to the doctors \nMy grandmother on my dad's side was 50 when he first went to a doctor same with all my grandparents. \nI don have a valid reason to be concerned the only reason I could think of is genetic mutation so what are my chances? So no one in your family has it? They have never been tested but no they never have shown any symptoms at all. I have never even met a person who has this. So? Do not worry about it! You should only be worried if your mother or father have it, and it sounds like that is certainly not the case. There are much better things to spend that brain power on. Do not be worried, really. Ok yeah do I have a higher chance of getting struck by lightning? I do not know off the top of my head the percentages of each one, but most likely yes. This is absurd. If you do not have it running in your family and you do not have any symptoms, why would you even be asking this question? Why are you even interested in this question? As I staited in the post the only reason I am asking thos is because i read that you could have a gene mutation and get it even if ur parents do not have it what do u think? As I said in the post the only reason I am intrested is because i read that you can have a gene mutation and get it even if u do not have family hiatory can that happen and how rate is it? And also I have a little bit of health anxiety Why would you be worried about the ridiculously low chance of having a spontaneous mutation if you are not exhibiting any symptoms?\n\nI am not sure what you are looking for here, but it is odd.\n\nYou could get into a fatal car accident at some point, and it is much more likely, do you agonize over the odds of that happening too? You do not say! Well your chances are very, very small. I would find try to find something else to worry about Sorry but I cannot comprehend how very very very small rly is could you put it in perspective like umm geting hit by a meteor or something? No I do not. But I have a little bit of health anxiety. Could u put it in perspective of how low of a chance I got to like being struck by lighting or getting hit by a meteor in the face Jesus now you are on to this &gt;I don have a valid reason to be concerned \n\n4-15 in 100,000 people get it with 10% of cases being a genetic mutation according to Wikipedia. assuming the worst case scenario lets say that 15 in 100,000 people get it, 10% of those would be a genetic case so (15*0.1)/100,000 = a 0.000015% chance of getting Huntington's disease if it is the result of a genetic mutation since nobody in your family has it. \n\nYou have a higher chance of dying from tsunami waves, a hurricane or tornado or a bee sting. Nothing to be worried about. Take a bit to think about your audience here. Everyone on this sub likely comes from a family where HD has ravaged their families. This is one of the very worst condition you can have. Please do not come here and play hypochondriac. Look at this person\u2019s post history. Hypochondriac does not even begin to describe it. Hey man I would seriously look into talking with someone or letting your parents know about how serious your health anxiety is. You really should look into getting some help to help calm your anxiety down because it is a tad excessive You need to see a therapist. Everyone here either ACTUALLY has this disease or knows someone that does. The people in this group are hurting and you coming here with this question just spits in our faces. \n\nSpend your time enjoying your life and not coming up with reasons to think you are sick. \n\nSo many people here would love to be in your shoes and not in theirs. Just think about that and take your questions somewhere else please. Do I have a higher chance of getting struck by lightning or choking on a sandwich? I took and look. It is pretty sad. He/she is too young to be feeling this way about life. I did, that is why I said something. You have a better chance of being struck by lightning while choking on a sandwich. To be honest I think you have posted in the wrong sub and it is quite insensitive for you to persist the likelihood needing to be compared to being hit in the face by a meteor.  You can check these sorts of stats for yourself very easily.  \n\nThis sub is generally for people who have it, or has it in the family and is more like a support group for us.  It is a horrendous disease to have and deal with and it is aggravating when people ask these kinds of questions.  I am not trying to be mean or anything but maybe have a look into previous sub posts and decide if it is an appropriate question or not.  You clearly do not know enough about Huntingtons to understand why this has been a bad call, but try and be a bit smarter about where you are posting things. I agree with this OP. Looking at your history you seem to really have a real problem with asking inappropriate health related questions when you are obviously not at risk for them. You need to work with a therapist, and not ask internet strangers who are going through a hard time for advice on a disease you will never inherit. I think you have a special case of stupid.", "How can I be a better caregiver? (Semi-long post) Hey everyone,\n\nI am a caregiver for people with disabilities as well as elderly people. I feel like I have got an ok-grasp on dementia and elderly people, I have about 5 years experience. But I recently started with my first HD client about 2 months ago and I have no clue what I am doing. \n\nFirst off, she is about my age, mid 30s. She was diagnosed 5 years ago. Her father had it, he passed at 49 and his mother had it, her mother had it and so on. She lives in an assisted living facility and it is not the best. That is another story in itself. My first thought was to be more of her friend since we are almost the same age. I do not want to be an authority...but maybe that is the wrong approach?\n\nThe thing I am struggling with the most is the apathy. She is glued to her phone and wants to do little else. Getting her off the couch is really hard. She just does not want to. Almost never wants to shower. Recently went 5 days without one. I am scheduled to be with her Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays for 4-5 hours. I am to make sure she eats, try to prevent falls, help take care of her small dog, and try to encourage a shower. She is just caring less and less about life. Sorry for the long post...any advice is appreciated!! Here is a good resource.  Thank you!! \ud83d\udc96 I love that you care. I love that ou care enough to ask for help to better yourself and provide a better level of support. The link that was posted is great. But most imortantly, keep being you. We need more of you.\nApathy is hard. It agrivates my wife that i am this way. But it is what it is. If you attempt to get her to do sonething small, dont push for more too soon. Chip away slowly. Good luck. More than anything just wish we could get her to shower regularly. But I just wanted to see if there is anything I can do to be better or something I am not doing right. I think some people in her life try shaming her choices and I know that is not right.", "Questions about Huntington\u2019s My (23) mother (52) was just diagnosed with Huntington\u2019s yesterday. For the last year and a half, I and other family members have noticed a slight decline in her mental state, including bad memory, confusion, and clumsiness. After convincing the rest of the family to encourage her to see a doctor, she finally stopped being stubborn and consulted with a neurologist starting about a month ago. Yesterday she received confirmation that she has Huntington\u2019s via tests sent to the Mayo clinic by the neurologist. \n\nThese are some of my questions that a simple google search cannot help me answer: \n\nWhen is the right time to tell my mother she can no longer drive? She drives my very younger brother to school everyday and he has noticed times where she was not driving right. \n\nHow should my siblings and I go about getting tested? Should we go to our regular doctors and consult or should we get anonymous tests?\n\nIf it turns out that me or any of my siblings do test positive in the predictive tests, what does that mean for our lives if we do not have symptoms? Do we keep working to build up our futures or do we go on disability or something? \n\nFinally, my younger brother (9) is the only one in the family we have not told. Is this a good idea? We do not want him to be preoccupied with what is going on, but I know eventually he will see his mother\u2019s decline and know that something is happening. Does he have a right to know or when is the best time to tell a child this? \n\nI am sorry if some of these questions come off as ignorant or misinformed. I had heard of Huntington\u2019s before and knew a little about it, but most of what I know has been learned in the last 24 hours. \n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to answer any of these questions. Firstly, I am sorry that you are having to go through this, I know it can be a lot to take in right now. I have been dealing with this for a while so if you have any questions in the future my inbox is always open.\n\nYou are first question: That is something you guys need to talk about. Ultimately if her driving is unsafe, she should not be on the road\n\nFirst you have to ask if you want to be tested and what that entails. I am 23 and have had my whole life to think about this question. I am not saying take 23 years, but take some time to think about it. The first and biggest question is do you want to know? Will it improve your life in anyway to know the answer to that question right now? You are at risk, but that does not mean you are positive. And also to remember, if you do test positive you will now have a pre-existing condition. But I do encourage you to look into protections in regards to insurance for those with huntington's. Now if you could get tested anonymously that would be a different story. I will tell you I started the process at 18 to get tested and ultimately decided not to go through with it.\n\nMost people** do not start showing symptoms until later in life and live full and productive lives, do not ever think that just because you are positive, that it means your life is over. There are new medicines and treatments being tested every day.\n\nAs to whether or not to tell your brother, I really have no idea. I am sorry you have to think about that now. But will his life and understanding of the situation be improved with knowing? Or can it wait a few years? That is what I would ask.\n\n\nReally if you ever have questions or need to vent, reach out, we are all genuinely in this boat together. Before I answer any of this, I want to add the caveat that all of the answers to these questions are really complicated &amp; very personal in many ways. You should do your best to get input from lots of folks and think about all of it long &amp; hard from your own values before you make any decisions. A lot of us have had a lifetime to consider these, so we sound very sure of ourselves. Give yourself time.\n\nFWIW, my answers to your questions would be:\n\n*When is the right time to tell my mother she can no longer drive? She drives my very younger brother to school everyday and he has noticed times where she was not driving right.*\n\nIf she is already showing symptoms, you should start having this conversation with her **right now**. Giving up driving is a big deal for most people (it is a big loss of independence). It is probably going to take you a while to get her onboard (unless it gets to the point where the danger is such that you need to take her keys, which you should be prepared that you might have to do).\n\n*How should my siblings and I go about getting tested? Should we go to our regular doctors and consult or should we get anonymous tests?*\n\n*If it turns out that me or any of my siblings do test positive in the predictive tests, what does that mean for our lives if we do not have symptoms? Do we keep working to build up our futures or do we go on disability or something?*\n\nI hate to sound dictatorial, but if you all have only had this on your plate for a day (or even a few weeks while you waited for test results), then 100% none of you are ready to get tested yet. You have not had enough time to process this and you cannot possibly know enough about your options or have had enough time to consider how you will feel in the possible outcomes. Getting tested in your 20\u2019s is relatively early and I cannot underestimate the impact it can have on you (positive or negative \u2013 because survivor\u2019s guilt is very real for many HD gene negative siblings). If you are in the US, you should check out the( they are open to folks up to 29 and its full of young people with tons of good experience deciding whether to test &amp; being told about their HD risk. These are your people; reach out to them.\n\nAll of the questions in your second set are things you need to work through before you make a decision about testing. Look for a certified genetic counselor in your area \u2013 most can refer you to specialized medical psychologists who work with folks in situations like this, with expertise in helping you process around complex medical choices. Most insurance will cover most of these services (and this is just pre-test counseling, so you do not have to worry yet about how a positive test result may impact your insurability for Long-Term Care or Life Insurance yet). Because yeah, it is not just emotional and life choice considerations, there are practical impacts of a test result.\n\nYou are not ready to test yet. Learn more, process more (like, I would suggest at least a year). Then decide whether to test.\n\n*Finally, my younger brother (9) is the only one in the family we have not told. Is this a good idea? We do not want him to be preoccupied with what is going on, but I know eventually he will see his mother\u2019s decline and know that something is happening. Does he have a right to know or when is the best time to tell a child this?*\n\nI believe he absolutely has a right to know and that you should start telling him now. I knew when I was 9 (I had symptomatic family members). I was given age appropriate answers and details, but it was never hidden. Think about it like you would talking to them about sex \u2013 provide answers that are honest and correct, but do not get into detail that they have not asked about and do not need to know. HD was something that was a little scary to me, but it was not any worse comparable stuff kids learn (like when grandma has cancer and is dying &amp; that is scary).\n\nYou are 100% right that he will notice, and honestly, if you all have, he probably already has. You said he is already noticed the driving, right? I would bet you he is noticed other things too and just has not known how to ask about them. Not knowing is so much scarier than knowing. The worst pain I have seen from folks in this community &amp; on these boards is when there is hiding and lying and not-knowing. When you know, you can cope; when no one told you, you feel betrayed.\n\n**So, if that is all TL;DR, my big takeaways are 1) deal with the driving issues now, they will take time to get sorted 2) none of you know enough to even consider testing yet and 3) tell him now, like right now.**\n\nHope some of this helps! These are excellent answers.\n\nAfter 17 years of living with a HD patient I could add nothing. I am sorry for what you are going through. We also struggled with how to take my MIL\u2019s keys away. We ended up going to a neurology appointment with her and asked the doctor about it. He confirmed she should not be driving. She swore she was fine (she was not). So he asked her to prove it by doing a driver\u2019s test. Since she thought she was fine, she agreed. She failed the test. She then refuses to stop driving. If it was my mom I would have taken away the keys but it was up to my in-laws and they allowed her to continue. She eventually got in a small accident and gave up the keys on her own after that. \n\nRegarding getting tested, I would 100% get life insurance and long term care insurance if you can. Because if you get diagnosed, all of that will skyrocket to the point where you will not be able to afford it. Another option would be to get tested anonymously without getting insurance involved. That will allow you to know the results without it being on your medical record. \n\nI am not much help with the rest of your questions though. Best of luck. \\&gt; When is the right time to tell my mother she can no longer drive? She  drives my very younger brother to school everyday and he has noticed  times where she was not driving right. \n\nNow is the time to tell her. It only takes one slipup on the road to end somebody is life.  She cannot be allowed to drive herself or anybody else anywhere again. We are going to be having the discussion with her and her doctor at her next appointment which is in like a week and a half. I know that may seem like a long time but she does not drive everyday and I have volunteered to take my brother for the foreseeable future. \n\nI just cannot bring myself to take her keys without some backup. I do not want her to hate me", "I have many questions for anyone who will answer Hi, there!\n\nMy 18-year-old niece is going in at the end of the month to test for HD. Her father, and his father, died of the disease; his sister is currently suffering with it. My sister has been reluctant to have her tested, which I have always disagreed with. But, now I know that my niece\u2019s father had 52 gene repeats. My niece also exhibits some of the cognitive issues associated with HD and has since puberty. The certainty I felt that she should know has been shaken a bit. \n\nI tried to find the answer myself, but still was not sure. Is her likelihood of having it 50%, or is it higher because of his repeats? And, if it is more likely, do you feel like an early diagnosis is beneficial? Or is there bliss in ignorance until she exhibits physical symptoms? \n\nI am scared for my niece and my sister, and I want to be able to support them with knowledge and care as best as I am able, but I feel a little overwhelmed. \n\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated Her mom did not actually have a say. In general, unless a minor is showing symptoms, once a person is born they will not test them until they are a legal adult. You can get tested before birth, but will have a hard time doing it. My sister in law was told they would not do it unless she committed to abort if it was positive. Obviously they cannot enforce that, but they chose not to test at the time.\n\nSo do not be to hard on her mom for not testing. The whole family is going to need emotional support as she does this even if it is a negative test. People with negative tests (I would not know, I am positive) report a lot of emotional turmoil even though they are ok, I including guilt, because the rest of the family is not ok.\n\nAnyway, onto your question. No. Number of repeats in the parent does not change the chances of the child getting it. A positive parent means the kid has a 50 percent chance, period. Ok, one exception, i will get back to that. You may know that for every gene, you have two. One from mom and one from dad. When you have a kid only one of a gene gets passed down to your kid. The parent then, has one HD+ gene from their affected parent and one HD- gene from their unaffected parent. The exception I referred to is if both grandparents had HD+ then dad would have 2 HD+ genes, of different # repeats. In which case one would have to get passed on. No idea if this has actually happened, but is theoretically possible.\n\nNumber of repeats is important, but does not increase the chance of the HD+ gene being passed on. It is an indicator of severity and age of onset of the disease. And sorry, but 52 is a lot. But that does not mean she is sick now! There are loads of other things that could cause similar early days symptoms with less dire outcomes. For instance, I am not showing symptoms yet, according to my neurologist. I have nerve damage in one leg from something unrelated and it makes me more clumsy. I also got diagnosed with RLS, which could convince someone they are jittery from HD. Right? So, she could be fine. It could even be the stress of maybe having it is giving her psychosomatic symptoms that go away entirely with testing. \n\nLastly, age of onset and path, because it is mostly genetic (some environment factors may have small impact) will look a lot like her affected parent. Repeats can error and repeat more (but also less) from one generation to the next, but usually it is a good indicator. So if her affected family did not get sick as teenagers the is probably not what is going on with her either. \n\nHowever since she may be showing symptoms I would encourage testing to be sure. There is no cure, but medicine can ease the symptoms. Thank you so much for taking the time to respond. \n\nI would assumed that the chance was still 50% based on what I knew, but I wanted to be sure. It seems like everyone in my family was encouraging her to test, but now that I know more, I definitely can understand her hesitance. And it is good to know that it was not an option before because that was never clear to us. \n\nMy sister has been convinced that my niece has juvenile HD because of her cognitive symptoms, but it is tough to say because my niece was in a car accident as a child and has been deemed to have developmental/comprehension issues because of it. I have not seen any of the physical symptoms of HD yet, so it is one of those tricky situations where I think my sister is seeing correlation that may or may not be there. \n\nFrom what I remember of her father, he seemingly exhibited symptoms around when  she was born, when he was 17. He died when he was 32. \n\nMy only concern now with her getting the test is insurance and life insurance. I am curious to know others\u2019 experiences with that. Of course, if she truly wants to know, she should, but I feel conflicted now in a way I was not before. Would it be best for her to wait until she exhibits physical symptoms? Or is it better to start supportive care early on? \n\nI am asking all these questions even though it is up to her, ultimately. I just want to be able to pass on others\u2019 experiences before she makes the decision. \n\nAgain, thanks for your response. Seeing the way the disease affected her father\u2019s family was heartbreaking, and my absolute empathy goes out to anyone in this sub whose lives HD has affected. She will not be able to go out on the open market for life insurance after testing. Obamacare put in place protection so she should be able to get health insurance after testing. The best thing is to get insurance now and not let it lapse - which as an 18 year old is not an easy thing to commit to. If she gets insurance through a job they do not ask about existing conditions for health and life. Going To get political for a moment though, the best way to protect people in her position is to support universal health care and Bernie Sanders. It is absolutely horrible that we have to worry about loosing our job and then getting a gap in coverage and having skyrocketing premiums. I was uninsured for years in my 20s because my company was to small to provide it and I could not afford it. I waited until I was insured to test, because one it is expensive to do the test, and two I did not want denial of coverage (before Obamacare, so a little better now). And not knowing was fucking seriously with my mental health, which I assumed was more symptoms. \n\nIf she is already to sick to work by the time she ages off family insurance (25 - pretty likely if dad died at 32) she would qualify for (Medicare? I forget which) and social security so insurance could be a non-issue. Probably worth it to get a whole life policy before testing anyway.\n\nIf dad started getting sick at 17, it could very well be HD. It may be the car accident and she is fine. One thing I know, is peace of mind is possible even with a positive test. I still fear the eventuality of getting sick, I still look for it everywhere, but it is a much calmer sort of searching since I already know the eventual answer. It is a hard won calm with a lot of therapy, but it exists. \n\nEasily the worst part about this is how it destoys family. It will not just end my family's suffering for me to die. You watch and caregive as someone else does then wait in fear for your own onset. It starts late enough that it is easy to have kids and pass it on before you know you have it. Being a kid with an unstable deteriorating parent is a recipe for trouble. You are preaching to the choir re: Bernie. Believe me, it sickens me that we have to do this insane arithmetic for whether or not she should get tested in case her access to medical care becomes limited. And while she would have some preexisting condition protection now, there is no guarantee of anything if Trump is re-elected, or Republicans continue to hold the Senate. I want M4A so badly, but my family is all rural and conservative, and it can be difficult to show them the stakes, but I try. \n\nAgain, thank you so much for your time. You have given me plenty to think about. \n\nI am glad that you have found some peace and comfort in knowing. I cannot imagine the anxiety of anticipating some genetic trigger, and it is inspiring that you\u2014and many others here\u2014have managed to be much stronger than I would wager I could. \n\nI am glad that she is young enough that the child thing will not be an issue, but I feel for her grandmother who had to watch her husband, two sons, and daughter suffer. I am assuming by your response that you have kids, or have cared for your parent? I can only imagine the emotional toll that takes \n\nI hope that CRISPR offers a solution for those with this terrible disease. Science is a slow and careful thing, and some promises\u2014like stem cells\u2014never manifest. I have a family member with Parkinson\u2019s, too, and I would love to see these awful things erased. Lol do not be to sure about the child thing. 18 is old enough. \n\nI am pregnant with twins right now. They are my first (and second) and only. We did IVF with genetic testing before transferring the embryos. It is expensive, and might not work, but for me it is the only way I would have children. I was very careful with birth control and swore if I accidentally got pregnant I would test and terminate, because I would never forgive myself, or expect my kids to forgive me*, if I knowingly passed it on. We have been married ten years and always wanted children. I am getting my tubes tied when they are born. I do not expect to be able to afford it again anytime soon, and might start getting sick as soon as ten years from now. It is hard to do it that way, though. IVF is no picnic.\n\n*I do not blame my own parents. They did not know HD was in the family. My dad's dad had it but committed suicide before anyone knew what the problem was. My dad did not get diagnosed until he is been sick for years and I was already in high school. Your niece could have JHD (Juvenile HD), especially since her father was symptomatic at such a young age (he technically had JHD as well).  Unfortunately, males with HD/JHD and a higher CAG count have a greater incidence of passing along an even higher CAG to their children.  I suggest you research JHD, and the similarities and differences. It is possible her symptoms attributed to the car accident in childhood are actually JHD symptoms.", "Living at risk Hello everyone,\n\nThe first thing is first, I am happy I found this group. I have never talked to anyone else who lives with this disease directly or through a loved one.\n\nSome background, I am a 29-year-old male. My mom had Huntington disease and passed away when I was 14, she was 39. My older brother and sister both tested in 2010, my brother, fortunately, tested negative, however, my sister was not lucky. \n\nI never got to know my mom personally as she was always sick for as long as I can remember. Me and my sister grew up close. My sister first started showing signs around the time she was in high school (I would say 17 was when it was getting obvious she had without the need for a test).\n\nFast forward to today, she is 33 years old and is in the very late stages of the disease. She is 100% dependant on my grandma. The disease progressed extremely quick with her. The past few months, she just screams and cries in bed all day and violently flails around and is super thin although she does eat. It is truly heartbreaking. My family are trying to care for her as much as possible and are not open to keeping her in a nursing home until we truly have no choice. \n\nFor most of my life, I have been at peace at the possibility of getting this disease. I elected to not test because I know I would not be able to handle a positive result.  My outlook on life is positive, aside from my sister's condition, I am a happy guy.  I always told myself that \"I could waste my life feeling sorry for myself, go get tested, find out I am negative and get hit by a bus on the way home.\" which to me means to enjoy the life you have because you never know. \n\nI recently got engaged (I fully disclosed the nature of this disease and the odds I may get it to her). Now that I am engaged and my sister's condition is worsening, I have been thinking a lot about the possibility that I may inherit the gene more and more. I have become too self-aware with my behaviour and anything that matches one of the symptoms of the disease, I attribute it to Huntington and not a normal human response to something. For example, if I feel depressed, it is not because of my sister's status but because I have the disease. If I forget something, it is because of the disease and not just because I forget it.  It can be exhausting and obsessive at times which is ironic since I read symptom of a disease is obsessive thinking or being stuck on the same thought.\n\nI am not sure what the point of this post was, it was a bit of a ramble. I never had anyone to talk to that I could relate to. Me and my sister never discussed this together and now it is too late. So I just needed people to relate to and dump this on.\n\nI am ok with not getting tested, but I feel that is not fair to my fiancee (She is supportive) and I feel like I am going to live my life always being anxious about whether I will be HD+ or not and become too self-aware and over-analyze myself.  But should I for the sake of my fiancee? I feel like she needs to be able to prepare for it and we would need to explore IVF if we elect to have kids. But I am too fearful of how I will become if I test positive. \n\nThank you to those who chose to read through that diary entry and provide some insight. I am sorry you have not had anyone to talk to. There are quite a bit of pages on Facebook you can join too! Also if you live in the US I highly highly recommend going to convention if you are comfortable with that. AND it is in New Orleans this year :) it is possible to get scholarships to help pay for travel, hotel, and the convention itself. \nGetting tested is something I feel like you should do only for yourself. You do not want to resent your significant other for feeling like you needed to get it done for them. IVF can help you have HD free babes and you do not need to know your status. My sister (who did decide to test) recently got pregnant from PGD IVF and she would be willing to share on that experience. \nWhile yes, HD is a terrible nasty thing there are many terrible nasty things that affect people that you have no idea may affect you or her in the future. (I know how hard it to remind yourself of this) \nSending positive thoughts your way \ud83d\udc9c I am sorry you are going through this. For the depression though, an HD researcher told me that families with HD have a near 100% hit rate for depression. It is not a symptom. \n\nAlso, 39 is still so young for it. All I can say is I am sorry. (Based on my dad I probably have 10 years before obvious symptoms). But, with that probable timeline, and being 29, it is almost time for you to start accepting you did not get it and live your life. (Congratulations on the engagement). I really think you are out of the danger zone, and can safely test to prove it and give you peace of mind. Also, the first few months after my positive results were rough, but now I am way better than I was living under the mysterious doom cloud.\n\nI did IVF last year (preg now) so if you have any questions feel free to ask. Before I got tested, I felt like you do. Every twitch was a symptom. Every time I forgot something, it was a symptom. As my mother's condition got worse, so did my anxiety. I tested mostly because I was already living as if I had it. Knowing for sure would allow me to monitor it and get the best care. I told myself I was just finding out how many repeats I had. I ended up testing negative.\n\nMost neurologists and HD centers will require you to do genetic counseling before you test. That can help you decide whether or not you want to, and how you will use the knowledge you gain. Good luck! I am sorry you are dealing with this terrible disease.", "My dad has HD. 42 Repeats. He is 58 between early &amp; middle symptom stages. My Mom has filed for divorce after 30 years together. Do you have any advice or tips? Yeah so, my parents are getting a divorce, it is not a surprise, their relationship has been rocky for a very long time, even before my Dad had a positive test (positive test was ~3 years ago). They probably should have been divorced more than 10 years ago. \n\nI do not even live in the same state as my parents at this point, so I do not interact with my Dad on a daily basis. According to my Mom, his symptoms seem to be progressing, I would say based on her reports, he is somewhere near the Middle-Stage. My understanding is that his behavioral and cognitive symptoms are progressing more than the motor symptoms. \n\nIf you are curious, my siblings and I have not been tested. We have not talked about it either. \n\nJust looking for advice on old people divorces, HD symptom progression, caring for an HD parent when their partner is not in the picture anymore, or anything you think might be helpful. Thanks I am sorry you are in this situation. My MIL has 43 repeats and was diagnosed when she was 58. This was after several years of symptoms. \n\nShe is divorced and lives on her own. We live about 45 minutes away from her. We setup an in-home aid to come and help her three days a week (she pays for it). She cannot drive so the aid also takes her to get groceries and run errands. \n\nFor now, it is a good system. We know that in the next year she will probably need to go into assisted living. We are working towards getting her the Medicaid waiver by spending down her assets responsibly to qualify her. The waiver can be hard to get and many hire lawyers to help them. \n\nI would also highly recommend getting him on disability. My MIL gets a decent amount a month from that and it keeps her going. Many use a lawyer for this as well. I will say that I have not used a lawyer once and I have been the one managing all her paperwork. It is time consuming with a lot of red tape but it is possible to do without a lawyer if you have the time and energy. \n\nIn our state, my MIL qualified for the fast track program due to her having HD. That meant that while many wait months to years to get approved for disability, she took a couple weeks. This is due to the severity of the disease. Only the most severe diseases get this perk. \n\nI hope this helps. Feel free to shoot me any questions you might have. \n\nI would also find out if he has any retirement, pension, 401k, a will, life insurance, and anything of that nature. \n\nBest of luck! Sorry you are in this mess. People in this position often commit suicide so brace yourself for that. I am aware, my HD positive Grandpa was in the exact position, divorced, and cognitively declining, probably similar age to my Dad today. Grandpa committed suicide in a particularly gruesome away. I really hope my Dad does not follow in those footsteps... fucking bummer. This is super helpful. I really really appreciate your response. This has given me some important things to research and get out in front of. Absolutely! One other thing I would recommend is getting yourself on life insurance. If you get diagnosed, it would be practically impossible to afford. \n\nWe did this for my husband just in case he has it. It will keep our family afloat financially during a time of great stress if he passes away earlier than expected. It is not a fun topic to discuss but it will help your family/future family a lot. It is one of the best things you can do now to help your future. \n\nLet me know if you need any other help! Just want to say it touched my heart how much you are doing to get your MIL the best in her situation, God bless you \u2764\ufe0f Thank you for saying that! It means a lot. It can sometimes feel like a thankless job so having a stranger say that to me is nice to hear. \n\nI have have not been able to really know her because she is never been 100% since I have been in the picture. But I do it because I love my husband. I might have to do it for him one day so in a twisted way I consider it practice. Hey there, I do not really have much advice to offer but I can offer my shared grief about how shitty the situation is. My mom tested positive just about 8 years ago now and she and my dad split up about 5 so also after the was diagnosed and having pretty severe symptoms. And it fucking sucks. My dad is a decent guy but he is completely obtuse to the situation because the way she changed before we found out about her diagnosis made him bitter and hate her. I thought the diagnosis would change things and make him more understanding about why she changed but I was wrong and to be honest I kind of resent him for that... but what is done is done. I fucking hate this disease and my life.", "What should SLPs know about working with patients who have Huntington's? ", "28 yr old positive test I am feeling a whirlwind of emotions right now after receiving a positive test result.\n\nBackground:\nI have always known that my aunties and uncles have had some movement disorder or some parkinsons like disease but i rarely seem them (yearly at most) so never thought anything of it or how it affects me. My mum passed away when i was 16 and she was 48 from a cardiac arrest. She lived in a different country to me so i also rarely saw her but she never had any HD symptoms that were apparent.\nFast forward to present day and i have met the love of my life and want to marry her. She is a medical student and her dad is a doctor so they were asking me about any genetic disease in the family. I said well my auntie and uncle have some sort of auto immune disorder is the exact words i used. any they got really worried and from symptoms they mentioned the huntington word and asked if i would get tested. I had never considered it at all and so thought it is unlikely and agreed. For me it didnt fit the typical pattern as not present in grandparents or their siblings etc. The clinic i got tested at was in london and the geneticist agreed that a recessive ataxia was more likely than huntingtons, but they are very hard to test for and Huntington is much easier.\nLong story short i received my result and it was positive at 42 and now i have no clue what to do.\nI anticipate that the love of my life is going to leave me though. Also this has implications for my 3 siblings who already have kids do they have a right to know?\nWhat were peoples first reactions? I am currently a mixture of laughing at how surreal this is and crying because my life has changed and the girl I will no longer be with the girl I love. personally i had years of depression when i found out. i would just had a boy and so that added to it, not knowing before my wife got pregnant what even HD was only to find out that i could not have him tested until he was 18.\n\nnow that he is, he is been tested too. positive. he says he is ok, but I know better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\none thing to hold on to tightly is the knowledge that you do in fact have tie, most likely lots of time. relish that time, make every minute of it worth something. I mean the one thing I can tell you is that if your girl leaves you because of this, she was not the right one for you long-term anyway. What if you found out when you guys got engaged? Throw off the wedding? After you got married? Instant divorce? \n\nI am not blaming her for her possible future decision here, not everyone can handle that; it is just better to find that out sooner rather than later when you are way more invested into it. \n\nAlso, the other silver lining here is that you are quite young. Even with the diagnosis, you got a good part of your life ahead of you, and can adjust and plan around this news accordingly. Again, would have been WAY worse if you found out much later in life after you started showing symptoms and had to make the adjustment with far less options available. If she leaves you over it than chances are she was not the one for you. Im 29 and trying to get tested so I am in a similar boat. \n\nAs far as your siblings go, id probably tell them since there is a chance they have it to. Theres still plenty of life to live, hopefully it does not effect you until late in life. From what I have read getting it from your mothers side makes it occur later on, I think those that get it from their fathers side get it worse. If she leaves then she probably was not the one for you. \n\nAlso, depending on when your symptoms begin, some sort of cure or treatment could be out before it gets to you badly. There are multiple drugs for HD in the works and recently, Pridopidine made it to phase 3 and will begin more testing in early 2022 if I am not mistaken. There is a lot of heavy hitter researchers working on it so I am trying to remain cautiously optimistic for my mom. I am so sorry to hear about yours and your sons result. I tested positive this year. Luckily I am a later bloomer on the family front and was only just starting to try for a baby. I really wish you and your son the biggest hugs and a good life. Yes tell the siblings. If you do not say anything, and they have more children. That is going to drive you crazy. Not to mention, the way to eradicate this disease is by spreading the word. If people just stop passing it on, which in this day and age is completely plausible, then HD will be a thing of the past.", "advice about dealing with the decline? Hi everyone, I am hoping that some of you lovely folks might be able to provide some perspective about dealing with a parent\u2019s decline due to HD.  I am especially looking for advice from children who did not become a full time caregiver (because I already feel so much guilt that I do not want to take that on). \n\nI am really struggling right now. I am 23 and in medical school. I love school and learning and I am excited about my future career but it is tainted by feeling guilty that I am not spending every moment with my mom while she is still relatively okay. Every time I find myself enjoying something in my life, having fun with friends or something I feel an intense pang of guilt. Has anyone else felt this way and how did you deal with it? \n\nHow do you balance living life with having a parent with HD? I hate this so much. I love my mom so much. I cannot stop obsessing about how things are just going to get worse when things are already so hard. I hate this disease. Are you spending any time with her? Can you allocate a little more time? My wife has hd for a long time we tried to \"make every moment count\" but its such a slow decline that it can be over whelming, we would be constantly organising to do things then cancelling when they came around, not matter how much u do u will always feel like you should of done more, she will be happy you are living YOUR life, enjoy the good times dont let this illness ruin any.more moments than it already does My dad died in 2009. I did not have healthy coping mechanisms until much later. \n\nIf you do not already have a therapist you like, it is probably a good time to get one. \n\nDo not give up on your goals. You know your mom would have wanted you to finish school and be a dr. She would be proud of that. Do reduce your load of you need a bit of time to breathe. This is import to remember. Make everything count, but it is a long slow decline. You cannot live as though tomorrow is your last day for the entire time! \n\nI have a positive test, but no symptoms yet. I got it during summer before my last year of college. I almost dropped, because I was so sure I could not keep going. What was the point? But I did not. I finished. With honors. My dad would have been very proud of me, since he was also an honors college grad. After, my husband and i kept on with our plan of professional license for me and then IVF baby (twins born last year). We are living the life we wanted and loving it, even with the understanding that it will fall apart one day. Mentality I am doing better than before I tested. This summer has been amazing I have spent so much time with her. I moved back home for 3 weeks. Usually I am able to get home every 1-3 weeks for a few days. We talk or FaceTime on the phone every day. Spending time with her does help for sure I am so happy to hear this for you! You are exactly right and I know deep down I am honouring her by achieving my goals but it just is so hard. The slow decline is also hard but in a way it makes me more conscious of spending time with my aging parents than others my age do Thank you for saying this. It is a toxic trait of mine but I really feel like I almost need permission to live my life. I do really love my mom and I think no matter what I think I will always feel like I could have done more Thank you so much for this comment, I really appreciate it. I am sorry to hear about your dad. Fuck this awful disease Following. I jumped on just now to ask this same question.\n\nMy dad seems to be declining quite quick at the moment. My brother is under a lot of pressure as is my mum. They have had to call an ambulance out a few times this month but he is been sent home so they have not felt the need to keep me in the loop.\n\nI work retail as my main job so it is hard to get consistent time off to go and see him. I have actually requested weekends off due to quality of life going forward and dad (mental wellbeing - also tested positive a few months ago) so that would be ideal. \nIf it is not agreed, I feel like the only option will be to change jobs to something with more consistentcy for better planning. It would be a shame because it is a great job and they have really taken care of me during the councilling and diagnosis recovery.\n\nI live a few hours away so I miss a lot of the information that makes the big picture. I fear being left out because individually these small things are not so important when you are there every day, but I do not see that and I am also not informed. I understand this is because it is hard for them, and sometimes they just need a break from it.\n\nI do not want to end up feeling guilty about not being there, or never being called on to help because the assumption is I cannot make it down. \n\nMy mum and dad came down to my new house a few weeks ago. It was lovely, but mum said they would be unlikely to make it down again. My sister reports he is \u2018wrapping things up\u2019 like asking whether she would take care of mum, and teaching her how to feed the birds. \n\nThere are visible changes every month at the moment, so it seems like it is happening quickly. He falls backwards, sleeps all the time, needs someone there every day to help with medicine. Moved downstairs. Does not really talk much. Eats very slowly to avoid choking. I am not sure why he is needed an ambulance on a few occasions, or why my brother gets called home from work.\nMy gut says he might have a stroke soon if he is like my grandad. Dad certainly feels some level of end here whether it is cognitive or physical. It is currently hard to gauge how he is actually doing, but in context of Huntington\u2019s this is new to our family and we have no basis of where he is at stage wise. We did not know his dad had it, he had a stroke so I did not know him well. In hindsight we can see it.\n\nI want to be there for my family. \nI am not overly worried beyond a natural fear of losing my dad and a desire to understand and to help. This is part of our lives now. I feel sad for my family and I want to give them all a big hug, this is not going away and I need to learn how to navigate this to help them, and to help myself feel like I am contributing enough love and care. \n\nThanks for the vent. Do what you can, do not overburden yourself because you do have a lot going on, guilt is reserved for not doing what you should do and it sounds like you guys are getting to enjoy each other before the disease robs you if that. Try to be at peace about it by remembering that you are in relationship with her the best that you can in this season :) thank you for your kind words. I am trying to be at peace with the fact that I will spend as much time with her as possible while also trying to balance school and other responsibilities. She is so proud of me and I love her so much. I am so sorry to hear about your dad. I hate this disease and how it tears families apart. I am glad you have the support of your brother and it sounds like he is a bit closer which is good. Personally for me I have decided that once I am done school I am moving back home (to my own house but then I am only minutes away vs hours). I know that is not possible for everyone but having this move to look forward to in 2 years time gives me some hope that I will be able to help mom and dad more. That is personally helped me a bit. I do not have good advice, just as a 21F with a mom who sounds in a similar state to yours, you are not alone. I know it is hard to live your life, and feel like you are on a time limit with your mom, but just tell her you love her every chance you get. Try to be in the moment and give her everything you can when you see her. When you are away from her take time to enjoy yourself and take care of your own needs. Your mom doesnt want you to feel guilty, she does not want you to suffer. You doing right by yourself is doing right by her. Thanks for your comment. Message me, we should chat! It is hard to go through this at any time let alone being so young. thinking of you and your momma", "A bad week for HD drug development - Wave ends two programs  My heart goes out to everyone involved in these trials \u2764 :-( I am sad Shit fuck What the hell is happening? This is devastating. On the bright side they are already working on a new approach. This one and the Roche-Genentech were both Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASO\u2019s). Looks like ASO\u2019s just are not it for HD. Honestly, it would have sucked anyways. You would have to get a spinal tap every 2-4 months for the rest of your life. \n\nI am looking forward to the small molecules (read: PILLS!) that are in development from PTC and Anima Biotech. I admire your positivity! And yes, the spinal taps would have been not ideal. But at this point I will take anything, ya know? \n\nLet us hear it for pills! Definitely preferable to developing HD, I will give you that :)\nWhat else can ya do - sink into despair? Not an option for me. Good for you. Onward my friends. One day this will look a lot different. Source: \n\nExcept: Wave will, however, continue on with a third asset, which it sees as a next-generation drug, in WVE-003, which is designed to selectively lower mHTT by targeting a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP3).\n\nThe biotech is planning dosing in a phase 1b/2a this year and will offer some trial subjects from its failed test that may have this biomarker for \u201cpotential enrollment in the WVE-003 trial.\u201d Wave said 40% of adults with the disease carry SNP3 in association with the Huntington\u2019s mutation, so there could be some crossover.\n\n\u201cEveryone at Wave wishes our PRECISION-HD programs had yielded different results, but we believe our WVE-003 program will enable us to address deficiencies with our first-generation candidates while maintaining our commitment to developing wild-type sparing therapies for HD,\u201d said Paul Bolno, M.D., president and CEO of Wave. As a parent of an at-risk son, this news was beyond heartbreaking", "I am planning on coming out to my gf next week about my risk of having HD. Tips? Hi,\nMe = male, 26, Dad tested positive for HD last year and I found out in May this year he, scored 42. He is 57 but not showing physical signs. This is one of the reasons he waited so long to be tested. Lots of internal family drama around his results and if he is showing psychological signs or not. This drama is very hard to explain to my gf and it is also really hard not having anyone to talk to about this.\n\nI plan to get tested soon but I am still trying to decide. My Dad thinks I should wait until we have a cure or treatment at the earliest. In his and my opinion there are a 1000 other things that could kill me before the HD would even show it is face.\n\nI have never been in a position before where I have had to tell someone I love that I am at risk of HD. I love my girlfriend and obviously want to tell her but I am kind of at a loss for words.  Any tips/advice from others who have had to do this? I do not recall what it was like telling my husband about my risk, he is been around so long. I just wanted to wish you good luck. Most people need time to understand and process what it really means and will not really get it at first. Expect her to Google it later and come back with questions. Make it clear what kind of warning you might need when she brings it up again. Having it brought up out of nowhere by someone else is always a bit of a stun gun for me and my brothers.\n\nI told one friend who took my word on it and did not Google for more information like I assumed, so I had not gone deep enough. A while later he cracked a joke about science getting good enough I could just replace any part messed up when I start getting sick (like a robot hand). I said I would need a new brain and it kind of left him unsure and concerned but I was laughing. I told my boyfriend I was at risk before we were official. My feelings on it stem from the fact that my mom is 50 and is in the final stages, so there was no way of hiding anything. If I was you, I would just be honest with her and give her resources to educate herself if she feels like it. It sucks. It is very scary to tell a S/O and not know how they will react, but they need to know to plan out their own lives. I was lucky and my boyfriend has been super supportive of everything. Even with his support I told him before he wants to marry me, I have to be tested, so he know what he is getting into. I wish you luck with your decision and good luck with your testing!", "Want to know early symptoms Hi. Huntington quite heavily runs in my family but as I have not seen the before/early stages , just the full on disease, I am not really sure how it begins.\n\nI am 29, not tested, my mother had it and the ones in my family who had it got it pretty early (my uncle Around 20-25), my mom around 30-35)\n\nAnyone able to tell some early signs? I am aware of the movement and twithing parts of the diagnosis, but not the psychological. Will an early sign be worse memory? Anger? Harder to remain self control? Losing words?\nI have tried to find symptoms of the very early stage but I cannot say I would find any answers.\n\n\nPlease, if it is not too much to ask, if you do know you have the diagnosis and starting to feel symptoms, or have someone close that you can tell differences on,  please explain or tell them to me. Hi. I am sorry you are going through this. Early symptoms can vary but emotional outbursts, saying inappropriate things, agitation, anger, and hypersexuality are all some of the earlier things one may experience. Loss of impulse control is pretty common too. If you are worried about your risk, visit the HDSA website for more resources. They can help you find a testing facility. Most importantly, you should look into purchasing long-term health insurance BEFORE you get tested. It is really cheap when you are young and will give you financial relief when you need it most. \n\nGood luck to you and again I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I am confident we will see a cure in our generation. I am sorry you are at risk. My wife has tested positive for HD, she is 30 now and pre-symptomatic thankfully. I am posting a link to a great YouTube video that does a really good job of explaining what HD is, early symptoms, and long term effects of HD in a simple way. I hope it helps. Good luck!\n\n One thing I can tell you is that if you worry about this constantly, you will see Huntington's symptoms in very normal behaviors. Everyone forgets things. Everyone has a little muscle twitch occassionally. Everyone cannot find a word sometimes. Patterns of consistent behaviors are a bigger deal, and if worrying about it causes a lot of anxiety, it can be better just to be tested and know for sure. \n\nAs for your question, for my mother and my aunt, early signs included a lot of impulse control stuff. For my aunt, it was gambling and risky social behaviors. For my mom, it was shopping and what some people would call \"having no filter\" or \"boundary issues.\" She would often say or do things that were highly inappropriate to the situation. She did not recognize social norms, like she would overhear two people talking next to her and inject herself into the conversation as if she knew them and what they were talking about. My mom also had a lot of angry outbursts, with more anger than a situation warranted. Both had a strong history of depression. Their father, who they inherited the gene from, was a violent abusive womanizer. My cousin's signs started more obviously with abruptly quitting her job one day, leaving her husband and child a month later, and accusing him of some stuff that was just not possible. A year later, she was completely delusional and in inpatient treatment after again accusing people around her of terrible things. Interestingly, my aunt also had delusions, but my mom never has. One common thread is that no one in my family who has had it recognizes these behaviors in themselves. My mom swore she had no symptoms right up until she was in the back of a police car for the second time, and that is about twenty years after I recognized the symptoms in her from having seen them in my grandpa and aunt.\n\nI am sorry you are dealing with this too. It is terrifying, but there is hope on the horizon. I am so sorry for what you are going through. I have been watching a family member exhibit signs slowly for almost 10 years. She showed cognitive delay before any physical signs. Her first giveaways where that she was unable to learn new things, had memory problems, was slower to respond in conversation, unable to form original thoughts and opinions, lack of reading and comprehension, and constant anxiety. She also started to get in car accidents. \n\nIt is different for everyone. Other family members showed physical signs first. Hopefully, this helps. Best of luck to you and your family.", "I am so sad and I do not know how to handle this. I met a girl in September of 2017 while on my lunch break at a coffee shop.  We hit it off right away and talked for an hour until I had to go back to work.  We made plans to meet at the local dog park early the next morning before work.  I remember exactly what she was wearing and how cute she looked.  She had on black leggings and a denim button down shirt.  It was a nice morning and she took off the button down shirt about 20 minutes after we got there.  She was wearing a grey tank top underneath and I definitely noticed how good she looked.  I was totally oblivious to the fact that she wanted me to notice.  Before we left we were talking near our cars.  The sun hit her eyes at just the right angle and  I told her that her eyes looked beautiful.  I gave her a hug and we both left.  She told me later that she thought I was going to kiss her.  I always think about how I wished I had kissed her in that moment.  Everything was perfect.  \n\nThe next night she came over to my place for drinks.  We talked for a few hours about our lives.  I have never felt such an instant connection with another person.  She was beautiful, smart and caring.  I was already falling for her.  A few days later we went on our first date at a new taco place.  While we were out I needed to get something for a school project for my kids.  Not an ideal adventure for a first date, but she was so sweet about it.  She was so understanding and supportive.  I was falling in love.  One night about two weeks after we met she txtd me that she needed to tell me something and it had to be in person.  I knew it was going too well to be true.  There had to be a catch.  \n\nThe next morning we planned to meet at the same coffee shop where we first met.  I live in a small town and the shop was closed because it was Monday, and that is how small towns work.  We walked to a gas station nearby to grab a coffee.  While we were walking over, I asked her, \"what is up?\" and could tell she was having trouble finding the words to tell me what was going on.  As we entered the gas station's convenience store, I was holding the door for her, and I said, \"you are not dying are you?\"  I could immediately tell by the look on her face that she was dying and that it was bad.  \n\nThis was how I learned about Huntington's Disease.  From a chance encounter with a beautiful young stranger at a coffee shop.  After she told me, she said she would understand if I did not want to continue seeing her.  She gave me some time to think about it and get back to her.  I started doing research and really considered whether this relationship is something I wanted to pursue.  Huntington's is a brutal disease.  About a week later we spoke and I told her I definitely wanted to continue seeing her and see how things go.  I knew it would not be easy, but I also knew that I was very infatuated and quickly falling in love.  \n\nThe next day the power went out on her side of town.  I work from home so she txtd me and asked if she could come job hunt using my wifi.  From that moment on we spent almost all of our free time together.  A month later she moved in with me.  We were definitely moving fast, but every move has felt right along the way.  I have never been this close to someone who knew they were going to be dying at such a young age.  Meeting her has changed my life in so many ways.  I have started thinking about life differently and really began living in the moment.  \n\nAbout 3 months ago I was on a work trip, and I got a txt that she was just at a doctors appointment and she received bad news.  I called her immediately, and she told me the disease was progressing faster than they thought and she only has 1 to 2 years left to live.  I dropped everything and drove 9 hours home to be with her that night.  She was not taking the news well, and I was really worried about her mental state.  It was such an overwhelming feeling to know that someone you love so much only had such a short time left to live.  I cannot even imagine what it would be like from her perspective.\n\nA month later she got a call from her doctor that she was accepted into a new trial!  It was a trial that I read about in the newspaper last November.  I could not believe that it was true.  It was a real life miracle.  She told me not to get my hopes up, but they were up so high.  For the next 2 months she was flying out to California to receive the treatment.  Her symptoms virtually vanished.  She was doing so much better.  When she was due for her 3rd treatment she called and they told her there was a problem with the scheduling.  About a week later her symptoms started to come back, but they were a little different.  Things would happen earlier in the day when they used to only happen at night when she was tired.   She called them and they said that they were waiting for a doctor to fly in who could administer the dose, and they needed her to keep track of her symptoms.  Two weeks later they told her that her body was rejecting the treatment and they were going to drop her from the trial.\n\nCurrently she is feeling suicidal and I do not know how to help.  I feel so powerless and alone.  I am so sad right now.  I do not know what to do or who to turn to.  She is my best friend and I love her so much.  She does not want to go through the later stages of the disease, and wants to end her life.  I do not blame her for wanting that, but I do not know how to handle this. Is she on astedo? I am about to be put on that. It is a reformulation of xenazine. My mother was on xenazine and went from wheel chair bound to walking unassisted for short durations! So, it is night and day, and she should try that.  Yeah that is... difficult. There is no good way to go about this. I feel like you should have a serious discussion with her about assisted suicide and other healthcare options. HD is one hell of a disease and living untik the end of it can be worse than a death sentence, but it is what some people prefer. If she is against that idea, which is understanable, considering other options surrounding her final destination are a smart move. \n\nThis is an awful situation for you both and I am so very sorry. I wish I knew how to help you and her. This is a horrible disease that has devastated my family for years and will continue to do so. \nYou can call a hospital to have her committed or just be with her right now. She knows you do not fully understand what she is going through, but I am sure she does not want to be alone right now. Call me an asshole but I have NEVER heard of anyone being given a timeline on their life for HD. And to be told 1-2 years to live after not having any visible symptoms when you met her seems outlandish. The usual onset is 15 years from symptom manifesation. \n\nMy Mom's symptoms are super agressive and even she has been sick 10+ years.  Hey, ihave30teeth, just a quick heads-up:  \n**agressive** is actually spelled **aggressive**. You can remember it by **two gs**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. I agree. If she was at the point where she only had a year or two, she would likely already be quite symptomatic and possibly already in supportive/long term care. \n\n I do not think you read the post correctly or I did not communicate it clearly. She had tons of symptoms. The symptoms stopped when she was receiving spinal injections of the new drug. \n\nShe is only 23. The disease is way different when the symptoms start at that age. \n\nI thought this would be a place for support.  From Mayo Clinic:\n\nMost people with Huntington's disease develop signs and symptoms in their 30s or 40s. But the disease may emerge earlier or later in life.\n\nWhen the disease develops before age 20, the condition is called juvenile Huntington's disease. An earlier emergence of the disease often results in a somewhat different set of symptoms and faster disease progression. Well when you have the risk of getting HD and many people you are related to also have it and someone makes a post that sounds like the plot to a badly researched novel then it gets under your skin. Sorry for jumping the gun but you did not give much information regading the actual illness.  My best friend started showing symptoms before age 20. She has very few years to live. Very few. I feel your pain and frustration. She just had a beautiful baby boy :( ...", "The Huntington's disease headline I cannot wait to see ", "Should I get tested?\u2026 Hello, I am a 22 year old female who has had hand and leg tremors for probably close to 8 years now. \nBeta blockers did not stop the tremor. I had a brain scan; no tumors. Everyone says the tremor is from anxiety. I have had anxiety since I was a child. Extreme depression for as long as I can remember. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was stable on medication (Vraylar, extended release Xanax, birth control, hydroxyzine for anxiety attacks, vyvanse and Adderall for concentration) for awhile -not happy. In fact, I ended up extremely depressed and got off of them. Before that the only antidepressant that i responded to was amitriptyline. I have tried so many medications for my mental health and somethings i have reverse reaction to but most just do not work. I am with a psychiatrist now working on getting a GeneSight Test to find out a med that works. They have now labeled me with just mood disorder which means they do not know what kind because i cycle between impulsive and miserable so quickly and often. It does not fit classic bipolar timeline. I started needing uppers because i was on so many downers (i thought) the adderall and vyvanse have been helpful to keeping me going but I still do not focus well. My memory has gotten so hazy. It comes and it goes. I blamed it on being a side effect from medication but now that I have been off the meds for almost 3 months it is not gotten better. Some days I think worse. \n\nNeither of my parents have HD (no one in my family i know of at all) but my dad recently (9 months ago) got a really high fever and seems to have lost a good bit of his memory. (It has hardly returned) He is always had a sleep disorder that doctors have not been able to diagnose. He does not go into REM sleep. So doctors blamed the memory loss on the no sleep. \nMy mom always tells me I probably have Parkinson\u2019s which is bullying right? But what if it is Huntington\u2019s ?\n\nShould I get tested? \nI am clumsy I am depressed I am impulsive \nI shake\nMy memory is shit \nMy mood swings are crazy \n\nIf you read this til the end thank you If you do not have family history you do not need to be tested for HD. Good luck on your journey You do not need to be tested for HD.\n\n1) You have no family history.\n\n2) If someone with HD developed symptoms at 14 years old, they would have what is called Juvenile HD. And to be honest, you would probably be dead right now, or in a wheelchair. Juvenile cases are quite severe and progress fast. \n\nI work in HD, and know the disease in and out.

My mother has later HD in her 60's when we first learned. Her parents were Christian Scientists so did not believe in medical treatment. I have shifted my family tree research since her great grandparents Albert G Byers II and Minnie Zimmerman now from my research have at least 7 descendants with Huntington's. Recently found the earliest case in the family was second son of Albert and Minnie,  William Zimmerman Byers 1907-1952. \n\nI was reading that several HD people were linked to Jeffery Francis who came from England in 1634 and was early settler in VA. So now am going through my family tree and DNA matches to see if I can take the dieease back farther in my family. I did found some early family in VA in 1700s. There also might be a link to America Colonies. \n\nFrom doing genealogy and DNA I have read that eventually we are all related because limited population creates pedigree collapse. The rare genetic factors I think would think there would be a common ancestor for all. Interested in thought and what is the first case you know in your family. As of now mine is 1952. I am not sure how far back I can trace mine. However my gene comes from the Native American side of my family. There are also other POC who have the gene too.\n\nWe all have CAG in our DNA. One in seventeen people have a grey area CAG mutation which can expand to be full on Huntingtons over time and generations- especially if passed along by a male carrier. I hope to talk about this at my mom's support group. If blue eyes can be traced to common ancestor 6000-10000 years and blue eyes are more common then HD. Just founding others in my grandmother's family with it was a great step since my mom was at a loss over where it came from. A cousin and I have been trying to find out where HD came into the family tree. It is been challenging because the disease was never really documented on death certificates and other historical records My HD side of the family is 100% Ashkenazi (confirmed via Ancestry testing). My ancestry has no links to western Europe, let alone England, so I do not know about the common ancestor thing. We know my great-grandmother had it, but all family history was lost in the Holocaust (she and her husband were sole survivors from their families), despite our best genealogy research. Since my CAG is just out of the 'grey zone' I have only been able to trace it to my great grandmother who moved to Canada from Scotland.", "HDSA MI State Education Conference  Is this the conference in Novi?

I am looking for relatives of Emma Jean Gordon who immigrated from Scotland. I think she might be the carrier but I need to see if any of her family members had it. :) I think your best bet with this might be to go through Ancestry DNA or a similar genetics-tracking company. You would have an easier time tracking down distant relatives that way. I just did a DNA test through another provider and have reached out to people with the Gordon last name. It makes me think that it was not the Gordon's but the generation before. Update: I found out she may be an illegitimate child, which makes this process impossible! This is interesting to me am wondering if all people with HD have a common ancestor. I read that an earlier settler of VA 1634 Jeffrey Francis from England has been linked to several HD people.

Nobody deserves to be affected by this disease, whether directly or indirectly.\n\nI am a 25yo female looking for a friend (preferably same sex and similar age) to chat with from time to time about the disease. Maybe on here or fb messenger, even instagram. I do not have a close connection with family, and my mother has never been tested (her sister passed recently from HD). I find myself spending too much time \u2018symptom seeking\u2019, and it is hard to talk to my partner about it because it gets too emotional.

I know circumstances are different for a lot of people, but what were her cognitive symptoms during the time that she thought she was not ill? She must have had a late onset, I presume?

It was first named by the neurologist Joseph Babinski in 1914. Anosognosia results from physiological damage to brain structures, typically to the parietal lobe or a diffuse lesion on the fronto-temporal-parietal area in the right hemisphere, and is thus a neurological disorder.

When I was 14, my grandmother (57) passed away after showing severe symptoms. At that point, no one knew it was because of HD. All of my relatives thought that her family had a history of \u2018pagal\u2019 (crazy) people (I do not mean to be offensive) who would develop a lot of diseases later in their lives. A few of my relatives also had the audacity to ask my dad to consider leaving my mom because my mom would also possibly suffer my grandmother\u2019s fate. \n\n\nA few years later, my mom stared showing symptoms and my dad immediately took us to a neurologist in Bangalore. Just after looking at my mom\u2019s symptoms, he asked her to tested for HD. After my mom\u2019s tested positive, the doctor asked me to get tested too. Results? 44 repeats.\n\nI was 20 when I got tested. I had worked really hard the past couple of years to top my school in the grade 10 public examination and then go on to an international school and complete IB. I had just started studying at an university abroad. My life had completely turned around from the small-town boy and I was having the best time of my life. \n\nAnd then the results hit me. I was not able to process what it meant at first. I would just google the disease and read about it until I could not take it anymore. The last two years in college, all I could think about was whether it was worth doing it at all. Whether I could pursue a masters or a phd without loosing all my time studying. Would it be better to just go home and help my mom and dad dealing with all of this? How long until severe symptoms hit me too? Will it impact my performance in exams? There were so many questions with very few answers. I became very depressed, alone, and messed up most of my courses the next few semesters.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, I promised myself to feel better and do things like everything\u2019s okay. And that the symptoms will come when it comes, I cannot do anything about it. Even though 2020 has been the worst year, I have grown a lot this year. I just graduated college (getting into the Dean\u2019s list in my final semester). I came back home and am helping my parents in their business. I am still looking for opportunities to work abroad. Also submitted an application for pursuing an mphil.

If you are in the U.S., HDSA has a trial finder ( In general though, there are several huntingen-reducing drugs (that is, drugs that actually target the \\*root cause\\* of the disease &amp; could potentially delay onset/progression) in human trials. The most promising so far (and the farthest along in the testing pipeline) has been the Ionis drug, but it is not the only one. I think most of the current trials for these types of drugs have completed enrollment for their current phases, but there is a \\*lot\\* of realistic hope that an effective drug could be on the market in a few years. It sounds like you are dealing with this really well, given your circumstances. I found out I was gene+ at 37 and I cannot imagine having coped as well as you have at 20. \n\nMy two cents: Keep on doing what makes you happy now, you have a LOT of life left to live (and even with symptoms, you can still do a lot of living). Your disease progression is not necessarily going to be just like your mom's - especially because you know what it is, you can work with neurologists as soon as you become symptomatic. Even if there are not delay-of-progression drugs yet by then (which there might well be), they can still help with meds that can help make your symptoms not as bad (keep your chorea minimized, help with depression &amp; psych issues, etc.). Keep your head up! huntingtonsdiseasenews.com \u203a after-...\nHuntington's Phase 3 Trial of RG6042 Offers Hope to Participant  HDbuzz", "How can I get tested faster? So I just found out my biological father tested positive on Friday. He is in the later stages. His sister was previously diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s and is now getting tested. I have to wait two weeks before I can even get in to my family doctor and I am honestly not even sure what the process is and if there is a way I can just get tested without going through a bunch of hoops. I am in Canada. Honestly just looking for tips and advice. Sorry for the rambling disjointed paragraph but honestly my head is in a bit of a spin. First off, I am really sorry you are in this situation. Being blindsided by this news is absolutely devastating and I am sure you are spinning right now.\n\nIt will depend what province you are in to some extent, but I do not think you can get immediate testing anywhere in Canada. It took me almost exactly 6 months from the doctor\u2019s referral to results, and every step of the way I was booking in as soon as possible. I know some provinces have fewer consults in their process so it could be faster, but I would expect a few months minimum.\n\nIt is probably a good idea to reach out to the Huntingtons Society of Canada in your area and talk to them, they are very helpful and should know the process where you are. There is only hoops. Once you submit the forms fits 4 separate dr visits here in Alberta. Just got my forms last week and they say the first appointment can take 3-12 months. \nIt is slow but they have their reasons for it. \nI think it can be sped up if you go private. Is there anyway to get tested privately so the insurance company\u2019s and stuff stay out of it? Kind of like a off the record thing? Please do not try to skip the process. It is there for a reason, and that is to ensure you are mentally prepared for the possible results. \nI am sure you are in a whirlwind right now; My dad had Huntington\u2019s too. I also am gene positive. I am sure you just want answers right now but please do not just take a genetic test at a random doctors office. I am in the Chicago area so I can only speak to how it is in America, but we have centers of excellence with specialists in this. Please go to HDSA.org and maybe they have a link for Canadian resources. \n\nGood luck Sorry to hear that. My process took 6 months from referral to result (UK). You need a minimum of three councilling sessions before they will let you test. It is a wellbeing thing.\nSadly I was positive, and in respect to that I am glad I would gotten to know the councillors first to be honest. \nI understand how you feel. Completely. When I found out about my dad a year ago, I would had my implant taken out and was ready to start trying for a baby. I was desperate to get it over with and move on. I was stressed and needed a line under it. Surely something so life changing cannot take so long right? Do not people know it is of utter importance? The most important bombshell to have ever entered my life? I had to accept it was not going to be the case, so at each genetics session I booked the next in immediately. They were very good. They understand you just want your results. \nAll the best to you and your family. Feel free to message if you want now or months whatever. I will be here to talk if you need to have a vent Agreed. Also tested and gene positive. Added a comment below, but wanted to support this one too. It is hard. We all understand how you feel receiving news of your dad. We have all been there regardless of our results. Even if you are gene negative, it is very much a family disease and most people find it still will not be the end of it. It will be very useful to understand it and find out what support would be available as next steps. There is no real way to speed up the process. Like someone else has said is it there for a reason. As much as I understand the want to know right away, the process can be helpful in getting some clarity around results and what they can mean for you. I found meeting a couple of times with the genetic counsellor really helped, even though I have know my risk for HD my whole life and have always known I would get tested. \n\nFor a reference, I am in Alberta and my testing process has gone like this, which I think is a fairly typical timeline for other provinces. Getting the referral from your family Dr for the genetic testing can take a while. Your family doctor will not be able to test you or give you results, you will be given a referral for a genetics clinic - the one where I am is at the Children\u2019s Hospital in Calgary. \n\n- October 2019 I got my referral re sent (I had gotten a referral in 2014 but did not follow through) \n\n- August 2020 was my first appointment with the genetic counsellor. \n\n- January 2021 was my appointment with the psychiatrist. Was originally scheduled for October 2020 but I had to reschedule and then Covid stuff got worse and it ended up being a zoom call. \n\n- April 2021 was my appointment with the genetic counsellor and the neurologist together and I did my blood draw that same day, blood can be drawn at any point in the process. \n\n- May 2021 I got the email that my results are ready for me whenever I want them. They do not share the results with my family doctor, when I want them I will call the genetics clinic and to see back to the genetics counsellor and neurologist and we open the envelope together - they do not review results ahead of time. I plan on doing this in October. \n\nHopefully that is helpful, and I am so sorry that this is now something you have to deal with. Please feel free to DM me if you want to chat about it or have any other questions. I am sorry I have not responded to all of the wonderful advice and thoughts shared here. The last month has been hard. I am just not dealing with this as well as I would other things. I read all of your comments and advice and all of it was very helpful. I have had my first consult and am just waiting for my first genetics counselling appointment. I have also started counselling on the side because honestly this has just hit like a ton of bricks.

I upvote every time I see this.", "How to prepare? So, my mother has HD and of course we have known its in the family, but i feel overwhelmingly unprepared for our future. It is still very early for her, but over the past months i have noticed her movements increasing, and her processing decreasing. I am here to help her as i can, but im not exactly sure how to or where to start. It would be wonderful to be able to gather more info and resources, but as i said, im pretty stumped at where to begin. Any help would be appreciated. First off, do you plan on being the main caregiver? If so, its going to be a hard road and kudos to you for being a good person. I was the caregiver to my mother aswel. First of all, get Power Of Attorney because its going to be harder when she cannot sign or speak clearly. Without POA everything will be 10 times harder. Id say being emotionally prepared is the next best step.. Eventually she will not act like your mom. She will throw fits and have zero reasoning skills so be prepared to handle that.\n\n My mom died around 6 months ago from complications. She lived in a hospice for the last few months. When we told her she was going into a nursing home she told me and my older sister that she hated us and never wanted to talk to us again. She could not understand why we were \"throwing her away\" and felt betrayed. Just know when its time, its OK to live your life and let someone else do the around the clock care. It does not make you a bad person.\n\n My mom fell a few years ago and messed up her neck. As she slowly lost her ability to walk over the next 6 months the doctors blamed it in on her huntingtons. After fighting with the doctors we got them to do some x-rays and such and they found she broke her neck and the swelling was pressing on her spinal cord. By time they started actually trying to fix the problem she became a quadriplegic and never walked again and could not even feed herself. So the lesson here is doctors are generally lazy. You will have to fight for your mother to make sure she is not blown off because of her diagnosis. This will take vigilance.\n\nOne of the most important things to remember is to make sure to take care of yourself and monitor your health and mental well being. It will be one of the hardest things your going to go through. So be kind to yourself. Just know you are not alone and if you need to vent, this is a safe place. Or you can just save my username and hit me up. Hello so sorry your family is having to plan for this, and most of all sorry for your mother!! \n\nThis disease does effect everyone so different, so it is hard to plan for. I found that most people including other siblings tend to scatter and leave the care to you.  Be patient, and though it will be crazy at times it will be fulfilling to honor her by taking care of them. My mom loves when we talk about the past!! She is 79 going to be 80 this year. Our goal is for her to be cared for at home with us\u2764\ufe0f Thank you for sharing very much, this is just so stressful, I might pop up in ur dms in the very near future.

My repeat is also 41. My mother is positive (repeat of 41) and my grandpa was positive (unknown repeat). \n\nI am so incredibly sorry your decision to get tested felt forced. I applaud you for looking at the glass half full and seeing it as a positive blessing. If you do not want to know the result or you are not ready, I strongly encourage you to postpone getting the results and seek counseling first. In fact, either way, please seek counseling.\n\nThis is a HEAVY diagnosis to receive. No matter how long you have known about it existing in your family, it turns your world upside down. Please reach out to HDSA (posted a link below). Sending you all the love and good vibes. \n\n Thank you! I made an appointment. I go back and forth pretty much hourly on if I want to cancel the test. My husband is encouraging me to stick it out. I just do not know. I am grateful I will have a support system either way, but its a heavy load. Also, I do not want my daughter to have the same feelings towards me that I am having towards my mother. Sometimes it sucks being brave. Whatever you end up deciding, I commend you for being so fierce and brave for your daughter. Sometimes having answers is not always best, everyone is different. I have decided to cancel the test.

My grandfather, both uncles, and father all tested positive. My test is scheduled for early next month. What to expect likely varies depending on where you are tested, but here is what my family went through. \n\nI am being tested at a facility in Virginia and they have a 3 step process. The first is a meeting with a genetic counselor to discuss the usual, do I really want to know, how to handle a potential positive result, and how to manage moving forward. \n\nNext up is a meeting with 2 neurologists that explained the testing procedure and how they make the diagnosis. They will ask questions and may ask for a physical exam (think walk a straight line, balancing, and coordination). They scheduled a visit to the lab to draw a blood sample and scheduled the final meeting to discuss results. \n\nThe last part was meeting with the same neurologist and counselor to discuss the actual results and receive the diagnosis. They provided information on local support groups for my father and uncles (grandfather passed away in the 80\u2019s before a lot of the HD programs existed). \n\nMy fathers test was a few months ago, so I am expecting the same when I go in next month. \n\nBest wishes.

He has a younger sister who he had an estranged relationship at the time. She was bipolar, irritable, and in his mind the worst person she knew.\n\nHe and I fell in love and I am certain he is the love of my life. We live together, travel, have a life, talk about the future. All the basics. \n\nAnyway, in 2017, after all of the testing and mental reviews of his sister for her issues (after some very bizarre events), she was tested and diagnosed for HD. Apparently their father has it and has not symptoms (despite almost being 70?). To be fair, he does have depression and lack of motivation, but no chorea or physical issues. Unfortunately has juvenile Huntington\u2019s disease with a CAG OF 65. She is progressing at a rapid rate and it is so sad to see.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together 6.5 years now. I learned about the HD early on, and know he plans not to get tested (we have discussed and agreed on non disclosure IVF). However, whenever I spend time with his sister, it breaks my heart to think about the fact that he may be like that one day. I cry myself to sleep some nights. I cherish my days with him. I do not know what to do. I love him so much. The thought of him declining before my eyes kills me.\n\nI know what his sister is going through (Juvenile HD) is much more progressive and intense (she never fully developed in her brain before this starting), but still being around her breaks my heart. Both for her and him.\n\nI am just looking for support here. I am going to marry this man. He is my love and rock, and I will be here for him no matter where any diagnosis takes him. But I just need some words of guidance from people who have been where I am and who are where I am. \n\nHow do you deal with the pain that comes when you think of what could be? I love him so much. Do not have any guidance. HD sucks. Wish the best for you, your boyfriend and his family\n\nAlso there is a grant for people with HD or At risk for HD who want to use ivf. it is called helpcurehd and i think they fund a large percentage of applicants. ivf costs like $30,000 so it is worth doing I have been married to my husband for 6 years now. I just had our fourth child together naturally. No clue as to the status of the children. Sometimes I cry about it still because he is so wonderful and I hate that I will lose him earlier than I ought to if he does come to a natural death but honestly we do not fight about stupid things and having ones mortality constantly in front of you keeps things in perspective. We both know and trust the Lord and I know we will be made whole and healed from all infirmity one day. \nLife is full of precious beautiful things and HD cannot take that from us. Even during the slow fade caused by HD dignity is not lost, ones value is not diminished, and the beauty snd goodness of ones life still stands. It will be an honor to care for him during the decline. I love him. I have read about that. Does he need to get tested for that? He and I would prefer to not know, but his father tested positive and his sister tested positive too and she is dying from JHD as we speak. Between stage 3 and 4. I am sorry to hear about your husband. This disease is just horrific. I read somewhere that you just had to accept that you are going to be devastated and treat all the time and moments you have as a privilege. I love my man so much. Sounds like you both have a great relationship with lots of healthy love and support it starts there for sure. I am so sorry for his sister it is the worst thing that could happen JHD!!! I worry about my kids and grandson like crazy! Sending prayers your way. It is just so sad to watch. JHD is just so horrific. My heart goes out to you all!! Also HDSA host a convention every year this year they did not have live event due to Covid. But I went to one and it was so helpful and full of others in the same situation it was so nice to have others to connect with if wanted to. Also they have JHD out there as well with lots of kids attending it was such a healthy upbeat environment with lots of information etc. they also have scholarships as well that will pay for the traveling expenses. I am sorry you are going through this.  I am The HD+ party.\n\nI am not really coherent and have to run, but I wanted to drop in and say, I had IVF twins last year and can talk (in short bursts, because twins lol) a bit about what that is like if it can help. I would love to hear more about your experience, because I think this is definitely the route we are going to take. Thank you for chiming in. No he does not need to get tested for it. You will have to show it runs in the family, but since you said his father and sister tested positive, that will be okay That is good to hear, because we would prefer to keep that unknown to us. Just such a horrible disease. You do have to accept it- also while understanding that NO ONE knows the hour of their death. I have been criticized by family for \u201cmarrying someone fucked up and having fucked up kids\u201d \u2026:the most vocal of which died suddenly and unexpectedly at home\u2026 just dropped. That was it. Life cut short. We do not even know if your spouse or loved one will make it to the end of the disease- so it is not just that we all have to be aware that life is fragile and can change at any moment- not just the typical 10-15 years after symptoms begin\u2026 since we have to deal with this disease it is easier to remember our mortality and appreciate all of life to the fullest but really it is wise for all people to remember this. Humans are so prone to take it for granted! \nHD sucks but life is so beautiful- despite this and all other hardships.\n\nEdited for typos\u2026. It is late and my newborn is kicking my butt. Hopefully I make sense My fianc\u00e9 also has a family history in HD, and things hit the fan rather recently as we are officially looking for testing now. For us personally, adoption is the best outlook in the future if we decide to have children, but I know that there is a specialized form of in-vitro which only implants children without the gene. I cannot recall where, but I know there is a grant that offers 3 free attempts at fertilization this way, however only for the first child. Siblings would cost around 15,000.\n\nAs far as the daily goes, it is okay to take it day by day or minute by minute if you have to. If you are not already, consider therapy if you feel it might benefit you. It is definitely scary, but I work hard to focus on the now and save what we can in case things do go sour medically. \n\nBe sad, be scared, be whatever you need, but also be in love. Honesty, your family should be supporting you. I hope your doing better now. I wish the best for your marriage and precious children. Bit late to this thread but wondering how you are doing? \nI am 36 year old and at risk of HD. My dad is in the late stages and with my age being what it is, I am obsessing about it and reading threads. \nJust wanted to say sorry for what you are both going through. I am untested and have 2 children, there is no way to plan, prepare or be OK with HD. I hope and pray everyday symptoms do not show up but there is nothing I can do either way so I have to live life. Sometimes it gets overwhelming and my heart breaks for my whole family because I have lost so many to this disease. I know how triggering it can be to spend time with someone with HD and then your mind goes off thinking \u201cwhat if.\u201d\nI wish I had some advice but after 20 years of dealing with knowing dad is HD+, I am yet to find anything that helps. Personally the support groups and being around people with HD just makes me feel worse. Reading comments like this helps sometimes when the anxiety builds up. But enjoy the moments now while you are both healthy anyway! I just lost a dear friend at 37, he fell down the stairs and bumped his head.

Far too many caregivers die before the one that they are serving, or have their life expectancy significantly shortened. But paradoxically, it can also be an endeavor in which some people thrive. How exactly does that work? Maybe it has to do with how we define \"success.\"\n\n I have been my husband's caregiver since 2015, I still work. Dont know what Im going to do when he cant be left alone. He is on medicare. I now have to help him in the bathroom with everything. HD sucks My father (81) took care of my mother (76) to an extent, that my wife and I (48) worried more about his safety, than about my mothers well being, including two strokes, lack of sleep, stress related weight loss, aso. \n\nShe developed HD late, around 65, and my father wanted to have her with him. In part to make up for mistakes he made during their marriage. \n\nAnyway, she had to undergo surgery twice 4 weeks back, and, most probably due to the general anesthesia, her huntigton got worse. Basically, she cannot hold herself upright, let alone stand on her own any longer. Now she is in a full time nursing home, and my father is free of a burden he was not physically able to handle for much longer.\n\nSo, what is success? Well, we cannot cure huntington. But this way, at least my father can get better and hopefully enjoy his remaining years. I will call that success. We were able to get caregivers to come to the house through Medicare, long process but it has been very worth it! It is helped give my mom the free time that she needs. (Also we remodeled a lot of things in our bathroom, the shower head that works like a hose, idk what else to call it, can be a lifesaver)", "Thoughts?  I wish I knew enough to have an opinion more helpful than \"I really hope this is legit.\" I understand, that is kind of where I stand. As much time as I spend stalking any sort of news on a treatment or cure, I am not a scientist or genius so it is hard to have much of a reliable opinion on these things. Sounds like one of the most promising treatments for HD. Exciting stuff!!! It is! I am a bit hesitant to get too excited though considering the Roche situation from a while back. This is the one I have been most excited about! They are supposed to announce initial results (brain imaging and other markers) from the first few people treated by \"late 2021\" so I am always checking for updates! This is IMO probably the most promising, and furthest along, treatment currently in clinical trials. If it works as they hope it is a potential cure with only one or two invasive procedures in your lifetime.\n\nIt is important to temper your expectations though, because it is still early. Only 20 people are currently in phase I/II trials, so no human results are in and there is going to need to be a much larger phase III trial to follow. Even best case, if it works exactly as we hope, I would expect it is 5 to 10 years out from being available to the general public. Worst case is obviously something like the Roche trials and we find out in phase III it does not work.\n\nI am trying to be cautiously optimistic, but not banking on it. Although I agree with your the rest of your statement, this study is being fast tracked so I do not expect it to take 5-10 years for it to reach general public. The current phase I/II study follow-up period is 18 months, with long term follow ups for up to 5 years following surgery. I would assume that means the earliest they would start recruiting for a phase III study would after the 18 month follow-up period of the last participants.\n\nIf phase III also has an 18 month follow-up then that phase will probably take another 2+ years for recruitment and trial, plus time after for analysis. That is assuming it is not halted early due to overwhelmingly positive (or negative) outcomes.\n\nI think hoping for treatment in &lt;5 years is extremely optimistic, but if it was available in that timeframe it would have to be because it is extremely effective so it would be amazing news. Same I really want to believe the other response but my pessimistic ass is more inclined to believe this one lmao They do not wait for the follow up period to be over for them to move forward. And it does not takes two years to find enough eligible participants. I am not saying it will be overnight. Just saying 10 years is unrealistic timeline given what we know. I said 2+ for recruitment and trial period, not recruitment alone. Either way I hope you are right and I am wrong. Some Uniqure representatives came and spoke to our local HDSA chapter recently! The study sounds really promising, I am cautiously optimistic. They told us that they are in desperate need of young people who are gene positive but either not yet showing symptoms or in the very early phases. If that is you, I would encourage you to send them your info! Id love to, but I am not old enough to test and my parents would never let me lol \n\nCould I ask you your thoughts on this? \n\nCould I ask you about your thoughts on this? Please know that I do not have a scientific background, I just have a vested interest in HD treatments panning out.\n\n\n\nHDBuzz is generally my go-to for information about research and trials, and according to this it sounds like they are hoping that this will slow disease progression though they are not entirely sure how it works. Phase 3 of this trial will run until 2023 and then should be able to conclusively say whether the drug works or not and how effective it is.\n\nEarlier phases of the trial would not have been designed to test effectiveness, though it sounds like it showed promising results particularly in people in early stages. \n\nAs far as I know there are no other treatments that have been shown to slow progression, just mask symptoms, so if this does work it would be a first. Even if it does not slow progression but does help people function normally for longer it would still be valuable.", "\"Welcome to Gene Positive\" column  Awesome.

I had read about anonymous testing on this sub so I asked about it and they said it is not really worth doing for the sake of not letting future insurance companies know about your status. They do offer it though. They said that I need to get whatever insurance I want to have before I get tested. (Disability, Life, Long term care). I thought the whole point of anonymous testing would be so that those insurances couldnt discriminate against you in the future? But they said the insurance will ask you questions about your medical history and family history so you would have to lie to them. Then what would the point of offering anonymous testing be? Sorry if this is rambly, just looking for advice. Also, would not it be more suspicious for a 21 year old to be applying for life insurance? Like why else would someone that young be doing that besides having some medical reason. It is because technically if you were to find out you are gene-expanded, and then apply for life/disability insurance later in life but tell them you do not know of any pre-existing genetic/conditions, technically that would be insurance fraud. Most anonymous testing facilities will tell you this risk, but also say that they are not the insurance police, which is true.\n\nAlternative/related scenario is it could \"slip out\" if you happen to see a doctor in X years from now because let us say you are concerned about possible HD symptoms you start having, and you are wondering if you should now purchase life/disability insurance. Dr. asks, \"why do you think it is HD?\" or \"have you been tested for HD?\" and you mention you anonymously tested in 2021 and found out you were gene-expanded. Then the doctor innocently makes a note of that that in their records because it is relevant to your care, even though they do not diagnosis you with HD yet. So now, say you try and take out an insurance policy, and tell the life/disability insurance companies you \"do not know\" of any health issues. If they find documentation of that anonymous testing in 2021 your doctor noted, they can deny you and/or void your life/disability insurance policy you try to get after the date you anonymously tested according to your doctor's notes.\n\nJust like anonymous testing sites, a doctor would not likely intentionally get you in trouble, because their primary concern is you, and they are not insurance police either, especially not for life/disability since it does not affect them. But information slips out innocently, and if it snowballs into a fraud lawsuit, a doctor or social worker will not lie under oath and risk their job/license for someone who technically lied on a life/disability insurance application.\n\nThat is my understanding of it. Got this info from a social worker on anonymous testing. They will not report you or anything, but they have to make you aware of the risks, no matter how slim the chances.\n\nAs for the 21/life insurance thing, I have had life insurance since I was in my 20s. It is just good planning and would not raise any red flags in and of itself if a 21 year old took out a policy. Just covering your bases like retirement or other long term planning.\n\nEdited for clarification. Agree with this. You will be asked by insurance companies about being tested eventually. You will have to lie to secure those policies. \n\nAs for being 21, that seems early to be worried about insurance. I am not sure I would be worried about that stuff until you approach the expected age of onset. I was told to get the insurance policies now before I test because if I am positive the insurance will not accept me in the future It is definitely a tradeoff. If your symptom onset is at 40-50, you would be paying premiums for 30+ years before ever collecting. There is no correct answer here. Some jobs offer a basic guaranteed life insurance, usually a multiple of your salary. Sounds like OP wants to find out their gene status now though, which means securing insurance policies now.\n\nPlus you would not know predicted age of onset without the repeat length.\n\nDefinitely a tricky situation. I personally got tested anonymously because I have a lot of other medical issues that will require elective surgeries. And I get MRI's and imaging and blood work a lot. I did not want my diagnosis getting in the way of those things.  21 is only a little young, but it is really not that suspicious. If anyone will be dependent on you financially (this could significant other, parents, god children or even the bank or employees if you are starting a new business) insurance makes a lot of sense.  \n\nTheir rates will already be based on the pool of 21 year olds who purchase insurance. The actuaries have handled that. They just need to figure out which class of 21 yos you belong to (preferred, super preferred, declined, etc).  At 21, even with a positive diagnosis you will not be flat out declined unless you are presenting with symptoms already. You will, however, pay more.", "Looking for answers Posted here before. Had kids before I knew about hd fully. I found out a lot of back story on this disease and my family history in the last few days\n\nThe disease started with my great great grandpa. He lived to 67\n\nPassed it on to 2/3 of his kids\nMy great grandma ( died at 55 from it)\nMy great aunt ( died at 29 from it )\n\nMy great grandma passed it to 2/3 of her kids\nMy gma ( 44 ) and her sister (43)\n\nGreat aunt had 1 kid.

My uncle died at 39 from it. \n\nEvery single one of them showed symptoms in between 25-30. Aside from my great great grandpa and the one who died at 29. Her symptoms started at 18. \n\nMy dad passed away before every being tested. He passed from cancer at 35. Never any symptoms. No memory loss, shakes, could still play guitar, even when he was sick. \n\nI am feeling a little more optimistic that my did did not have it after doing research and reading about cancer and all that. It basically splits my family 50/50 even. \n\nRealistically should my dad started showing symptoms? And if he did when should me and my sister expect to notice ourselves. (22 and 26)\n\nThanks Looking at your history possible HD parent is dead and you have kids. I would test to see if your kids are at risk. I have read the child could get a higher count if inherited from father. Since my family seems to get signs in their 60s for the most part am not testing because am not having kids and if I have it I will just worry. Clearly you seem worried so should probably test to get an answer. I plan on testing in 8 years. When I hit 30. I already had kids so I cannot change anything. Knowing will just make me depressed and angry. I know my chances are 25% since idk if my dad had it. 12.5 for my kids. \n\nMy whole family is super early onset so that worries me. But not for myself. \n\nI already spend as much time with them as possible and love every second of my life. Only thing I am doing since learning about it is putting away money so my kids can get ivf and get this stupid gene out of our family You are making alot of frequent posts with possible signs just get the test and your answer. I do not have any signs? You had a post about weather your dad's cancer made him less likely to have HD. Trying to figure out signs for him or yourself is pointless. Only way to know is to test. People get different signs based on various factors. Yeah I was just asking about onset and wanted to hear from other people about there family history? My great grandfather Albert G Byers III was the oldest of 7 kids of Albert Gallatin Byers and Minnie Zimmerman. Albert III hide it and we are not sure my grandmother knew because her brother was surprised when my mom got it in her 60s. The uncle tested negative. \n\nAlbert III only brother died in his 40s and spent the last 15 years of his life in insane hospital\n\nOne sister of Albert III and all four of her kids got signs in their 60s and according to DNA match her mother a granddaughter got signs in her 50s sped up by a stroke.\n\nBased on links to early America I believe it came from Mary Rathbun mother to Albert II. I found another Rathbun family that also descends from early settler of Block Island RI. I did trace down descendants of Mary Rathbun and Albert I but did not see it yet maybe all the other descendants with it died out or because its under diagnosed people do not realize they have it.  \n\nI think my family is unusual with the later signs from what I have observed of others. Mines the polar opposite as you can see\ud83d\ude02 how many of your direct family has it. known mom/grandmother/great grandfather but it does not really skip generations you might be in a grey area and not show signs. But still have it and pass it on hence you should test. My mom's sister in her 60s has kids and I think she should test because her daughters and grandchildren could be at risk. Since my uncle does not have kids I do not think him testing matters. \n\nMom's HD came as a shock and then in building my tree I came across an obit for grandmother's 1st cousin that asked for Huntingtons donations. Then had other DNA matches confirm HD in the family. Yeah I know if the parent does not have it then the kids will not. But I know there is a small gray area where you might not but you are kids potentially could.", "Well I Guess I Belong Here Now Grandma died from it. Mom has it.

This is my first comment, ever.", "broken tooth Huntington Beach ", "How I feel about the fact that my brain cells have been dying for 41 years ", "HD informational video posted on the Neurology sub  (comments are positive) \n(Have not yet seen it myself, but will)", "The WeHaveAVoice Huntington's Disease podcast is starting this week ", "Huntington's Breakthrough from Johns Hopkins? Cysteine depletion may play a role. ", "Early HD? Am in test process.. I am 29 years old. My dad has HD, stopped working at probably about 35 yrs old, still lives. He is 53 yrs old, and progressively getting worse, but he is not really too bad. He gets a bit restless when stressed, but he is got very light visible symptoms still. For him the symptoms so far has been mental. \n\nSo, back to me. I am recognizing more and more of my fathers symptoms in myself. Things he is said, and things I have seen. The problem is that most early HD symptoms are things that most people experience at times, so many of them can be interpreted as stress or a normal depression. \n\nSome detail (these are things that I feel have been getting worse):        \n\n* I forget stuff. ALL THE TIME! I suppose most people have walked into the kitchen and wondering why did go there. And most have probably looked for something that they have been holding in their hand, and stuff like that. But to me I feel like this is getting worse. I am loosing focus and short term memory. Mostly things works fine as long as I am focused on that one thing, but if anything disrupts my flow, I loose it. Like in conversations. We are talking about something, and someone changes the subject, and one minute later I have NO idea what we were talking about before.          \nBut the really difficult things are the future things (Next day/next week/next month) that I have to do. For example, for probably 4 months I have been supposed to deliver a urine sample to my doctor, and at the same time take a blood sample. This is for something totally unrelated. To deliver the urine sample I have to first go to the drug store to get a container of some sort (do not know what it is called) to piss in. This is fucking impossible. The drug store closes early. I have to remember it during my workday when I drive past it. The doctor have ordered a morning piss. So I have to remember do the following when I wake up: *First get clean and shower. Then first piss goes into the toilet. Then into the container.* Then, during my workday before the doctor closes his office I have to remember to deliver it to him.        \nI went probably two months without remembering to buy the container. During that time I was at the drug store many times, but I bought other stuff. (A normal working brain would connect probably remind me to buy the container when I am there.) Then, finally I remembered it. I had the container at home for  probably a month without remembering to take use it. Then, one day I smarted up enough to set a reminder on my phone. Finally I would be able to take the sample to the doctor, I thought. The next morning I went through the procedure. Pissed in the glass, and even brought it with me. Then my workday ended, and I had forgotten to deliver it!!         \nI still have not made it, a month later. \n\n* Also related to memory is \"blackouts\". (not really, but that is what I call it.) It is something that might be happen when I am talking or writing something, without getting interrupted, I suddenly just freeze. I cannot figure out what I was saying or what I am going to say, it all just stops for several seconds. But more often it happens when I suddenly do something different. Typically when I pick up my phone to check something, (like facebook, the time, reddit, or whatever). I hold the phone in my hand, and just stare at it, not remembering the icon that I am looking for, or why I am holding the phone. It usually comes back to me if I sit down, take a deep breath, and focus away from the phone for a moment. \n\n* I am also having an impossible time with routines. I moved into a new apartment 10 months ago. I still open the wrong drawers in the kitchen. \n\n* I feel like I am getting more clumsy. Walking into stuff. Kicking my toes into stuff that hurts. At work I am slipping things out of my hands, and I accidentally throw things. (Like picking up a screwdriver from the floor, and somehow while picking it up I throw it a meter along the floor. \n\n* Socially.. Well, I am introverted, but also this is getting more difficult. I used to be better at getting friends, inviting people, etc. But nowadays I never know what to talk to people about, and like my dad have been complaining about, I have problems keeping focus and paying attention to what people are talking about. \n\nI am thinking that I might have early symptoms, and I have started the test procedure. \n\nHow does this sound to you? \n\nIf this is actually early symptoms, I do not want to continue working until I get so sick that I need help with everything. I want to stop working, and experience things. Travel, spend more time with friends and family, etc. In my country there is a really good welfare system, and in addition to that I have gotten a very good insurance that secures me enough money should I become permanently sick. I am afraid though, that since I do not have any visible symptoms that I even if I have HD, they are not going to let me stop working because I am not \"sick yet.\" ", "What a day! Dear Reddit, \n\n    It is currently 10:41 pm. The last 24 hours have become a blur. I married the love of my life 5 years ago. She is the most amazing human being on this planet.  She adopted our teenage daughter right after we were married.  I was a single,hard working parent when I met her. The cosmic cluster fuck of how we met is a different story in itself.  \n\n    My amazing wife has never known who her father was. She was fine with it, I was fine with it.  She is 29 but madly successful.  She is the smartest person I know! We had done 23&amp;me a few years ago and had a few hits. We did not think much of it and kind of joked about her second family.  \n\n  Last night through a series of extreme coincidences we found out her biological father passed away from HD. Like fall on your lap and punch you in the face coincidences.  It was a few weeks ago. My wife and I were freaking out. Long story short My wife's father passed from HD. Her new found siblings are diagnosed with HD. We are seeking a genetic counselor.  But mother fucking fuck! We were cool the day before.  This shit did not even exist.  \n\n  She went full csi mode on the family tree. 70% have hd. We are worried for her. I keep saying it is 50-50. That does not help. Today has been full of uncontrollable crying for something that may not exist.  As well as uncontrollable laughing because I am going to love my wife like never before.  If you know us, its impossible.  We are so tight and so much in sync.  Noone has the love we got. \n\n  Long story short,  we have nobody to talk to about this. It is highly probable she has hd. There have been mini symptoms but who does not have symptoms to everything.  .. I am scared,  I am buzzed, I am listening to my one true solemate snore next to me. \n\nHow can I fix this? Help? Anything? I just never thought a possibility would change our lives in a moment we ha e done it all right! Beyond kind! Is how I describe my wife. How the fuck do we go from the highest high of life to this. Hey, I hope you get some rest tonight. I understand this can be a very scary and challenging time. I think that the fact you are here trying to learn how to help is awesome. Being there for your wife is the best possible thing you can do for her! A genetic counselor is an awesome place to start and they can help guide you to the best way to get tested etc. I have found the best way for me personally to live and keep going with the possibility of having HD is to live like I do have it, and plan like I do not. That means I take vitamins and try to keep muscle mass, as well as eat healthy and do not drink, but I also try to plan for a future where I am negative. I think that it is important to have things to look forward to. And even if your wife does test positive, your support and care and her kindness will mean she will be okay. I am a 34 year old woman who lost my dad last year due to complications from HD and have not been tested. I am planning to respond fully to this post tomorrow when I am on my computer. Take some deep breaths, friend. It is going to be okay. I am sorry this was dumped on you so suddenly. Damn, I am kind of in the same boat, I got the drop in February, but I am 20 years in with two kids, I am terrified of the unknown, watched my SIL decline in a matter of months(it got confirmed in February)her cag is 43. And what tops this whole shit show off was when FIL died of a \u201cbrain tumor\u201d in 2000 at age 50, SIL received a letter from a family friend stating the HD family history, to which my SIL(who is/was RN)convinced everyone around that \u201cit is super rare, like 50,000 people have it\u201d leaving out the family history and well I feel ya, I just want to know for my kids sake, had I done my due diligence with the ancestry stuff I may have not taken a Willy billy chance with my kid having a 50/50 chance of normal. Because one thing HD is, is not normal. I feel you and it fucking sucks to feel alone so I am down for chatting with ya, not talking about it it will make your mind go straight off the cliff. My (42f) hubby\u2019s(46m) sister (44f) tested positive for HD with a cag of 43, in 2-2020, and that was only after she lost almost 80lbs in 6months, she quit working and the crazy started, the totally out of character crazy, her denial of the HD from 20 years previous had finally been brought back to light and furious does not cover it. Take it one day at a time and get your insurance ducks in a row before getting tested. Do. Not. Get tested before having insurance. If you start making babies before you get tested, that is really irresponsible, and you should not reproduce unless you know that your baby will be healthy and normal. Thank you! We will continue to talk about it and figure out how to handle this. We do not want to jump off a building just because there is a little smoke in the lobby. Kids are out of the question  now. It kind of sucks that the decision was made for us. Honestly we may not have testing.  Who knows? The comment of live like you have it and plan like you do not.  That Is wise. We have already talked about insurance.  If we never get tested we have that deniability. We have insurance in place already so that is good. Thanks! You are welcome, and I am sorry that you all are going thru this. We found out that my niece(21)(SIL daughter) is pregnant. She watched her mom deteriorate right in front of and she did the opposite of live like you have it plan like you do not. When it comes to testing, I get it is a personal choice, but if you are at risk(and do not want to test yourself) there are ways to have kids without passing it on, so do not give up on kids just yet. There are ways to have healthy normal kids. But, yea, this boat sucks we are in, just got to take it one day at a time. Thank you for your wise advice  . We are still processing but \"live like you have it, plan like you do not \" sounds right up our alley.  We are going roller skating today. My wife has never tried roller skates. We roller blade but never with skates. It is just weird. The uncertainty of it all. We do not know what will happen. We just found out her dad had it but it feels like we received a diagnosis. Does that make sense? Family history does not mean anything - its 50-50, plain and simple. Anyone can imagine \"mini-symptoms\" if they think they may have something, so just take a breath. \n\nThere are tons of amazing clinical trials ongoing as we type, many of which will hopefully be successful in delaying onset of the disease. Not that it is ever a good time to be diagnosed with HD, but yeah, it is a good time in the science world.\n\nHoping you guys the best. It does make sense, when I learned what was happening with my dad my first thought was this is what is going to happen to me. But that does not have to be the case, and especially now there is a lot of hope for cures, or at least gene therapies that will stop progression of the disease. These are things that you should ask the genetic counselor as well as what they think the best way for you to proceed is. They may suggest your wife wait awhile to test until she is had more time to process this or they may say that testing is the best option. Either way I hope that you guys do what is best for you and continue to live life to the fullest! Hi again- I would like to just share what comes up for me and hope that some of my thoughts will be helpful for you and your wife. My parents told my two sisters and I that my dad was tested positive for HD in 2012. My dad was 55 at the time and looking back, we can see that he had mild symptoms for several years but they had not really interfered with his life. My dad had a CAG repeat of 42. My parents were super careful about how they presented us with this information so we were able to slowly process and absorb. All three of us avoided Googling it for awhile, which was helpful. I cannot imagine how hard it would be to have this thrust upon you and your wife and to be inundated with all of the awful descriptions of HD online.\n\nMy older sister wanted to get tested immediately, my younger sister did not feel the need to get tested because she would live her life fully regardless, and I was right there in the middle- I could obviously see the benefit of having that information but also how not getting tested allows you to stay in a better place mentally and emotionally. We all took a pause on getting tested. I went through a lot of emotional processing over the years. Different events have triggered big emotional releases where I am screaming and crying about how this is not fucking fair- and then I can go months and years feeling pretty emotionally stable, after awhile I would surprise myself when I realized I had gone weeks without even thinking about HD for a second. Because this is a genetic disease, a thought that helps me is that (if I am positive) I do not exist without it. There was one sperm out of the million possibilities that made ME and allowed for my existence and it comes with HD.\n\nMy older sister got tested first because she was experiencing cognitive impairment and she tested positive with a CAG repeat similar to my dad's. I want to be careful not in invalidate my sister's experience but at the time note that she was also in a high-stress job and supporting her girlfriend through an MS diagnosis. Our brains are powerful and your wife's brain will be looking for symptoms and is also under a huge amount of stress at the moment. Stress and anxiety can have the same effects on the body and mind as early HD symptoms.\n\nI was planning to get tested with my sister. However, I had a moment with myself the night before where I was noticing all of the knots in my stomach. I had the thought, \"I do not have to do this, I can stay in this place for now\" - and I experienced a huge wave of relief, my stomach settled and I knew it was the right decision for me. When you consider getting tested, you cannot just think about how nice it would be to \"not have to worry about it anymore\". You have to really think about how it will feel to lose the 50% chance of not having it. You have to consider your own mental and emotional resilience and consider the emotional toll a positive result would have. For me, so far along this journey I have not felt confident in how my brain will respond to a positive result. I am currently able to look at my future and see both paths simultaneously and that helps me to live my life without fear and anxiety. I have had enough time to process that I have made peace being in the unknown for now and like I said above, I can go significant amounts of time without even thinking about it.\n\nMy younger sister got tested very spontaneously and has also tested positive. She said that the moment they told her, she laughed out loud and realized that she was fully expecting a negative result. It is human nature to want your decisions that you already made to be the \"right\" one. I think that is why you hear a lot of people say they do not regret getting tested. I think, like for my sisters, there are reasons that they are glad they know, and there have been feelings of wishing they could go back to that place of not knowing.\n\nI am someone who always wanted to be a mother, from my earliest memories. I still very much plan on becoming a mother in the next 5 years. I think it is very inappropriate for other people to tell you that it would be irresponsible to have children. You get to decide what is right for you. I was in a relationship 4 years ago and had an unplanned pregnancy that ultimately ended in miscarriage. My partner was someone who believed in living your life as it comes without worrying about what might happen 30 years down the road so together we decided we wanted that baby without knowing my status and without plans to test the fetus for HD. That was the right decision for me and my partner. Part of why I feel strongly about this is because a baby born today has 30-40 years of scientific advancement before they would start showing symptoms. The chances of us NOT having a widely available treatment for HD in 30 years are miniscule. Also, my boyfriend just told me he read that HD can also spontaneously appear in individuals without a family history- so the idea that HD would be eradicated if everyone with HD just does not reproduce, is false.\n\nThere are also several ways to guarantee having a baby without HD. You can do IVF- and I just read that there is an organization that will help HD families pay for a huge portion of the process. You can also get pregnant and test the fetus and then chose to terminate the pregnancy if it carries the gene. There is also a process for testing the fetus for parents who do not want to know their status. Basically they would see if that portion of the DNA came from you or your wife. If it is from you, great. If it is from your wife then you would need to decide to terminate the pregnancy or not- the \"catch\" being that your wife could be negative in which case you would be terminating a negative fetus. I want to have a baby in the next few years and find myself re-examining the possibility of getting tested in order to make an informed decision and not do IVF or terminate a pregnancy if I do not have to. I also may decide to not get tested and not test a fetus.\n\nCircling back to the treatment mentioned above- while it is true that treatment is not yet here, we are on the cusp of it. Your wife is young and I believe will most likely see treatment either before she shows symptoms or before they are severe. I know it is such a mind-fuck to be in this position and at a time where we are right on the edge of treatment.\n\nMy advice would be to meet with a genetic counselor but to give this a little time and space before you jump to getting tested. Your wife may of course decide that testing is right for her (and it truly needs to be her decision) but once she has that information, she cannot go back. You are right that she has a 50/50 chance even though it happens to be 70% in the family. It is like how there is a 1 in 8 chance that my sisters and I would all be positive so my brain wants to think there is a higher chance that I \\*do not\\* have it, but it is still 50/50.\n\nI would recommend books like \"Living Beautifully with Uncertainty and Change\" by Pema Chodron. Wisdom and exercises to help you live in the present moment and not be consumed by the possibility of something bad happening in the future. I could fret about HD all day long and get hit by a bus tomorrow and then what? I wasted my time fretting about something that never came to pass. I do not want to diminish the anguish of this but another thought I have been having lately is that there are millions of people in the world who would trade their lives for ours, even with HD. There are cancer patients who are given a few months to live and would trade our 15-20 year life expectancy in an instant.\n\nI take care of myself physically and emotionally. I run and do little balance exercises when I stretch, I meditate. I do not think I would be doing more of these kind of things if I knew I was positive. I have been telling myself for 8 years that I need to find a therapist- I am hoping to do that over my winter vacation (for lots of reasons, HD being one of them). My sisters and I all take mushroom supplements also. My sister has a good friend who is very interested in mushrooms and several years ago he compiled a bunch of information on certain mushrooms' impact of diseases like Alzheimer's and why he thinks they could be helpful for HD. The details are a little fuzzy at the moment but Lion's Mane was one he recommend for brain health and increasing brain plasticity. I buy capsules from Real Mushrooms. Of course, I do not know if they are benefiting us or not but they are not doing any harm so I take them just in case.\n\nYou probably got more than you bargained for with my ridiculously long response! :) Your post just struck me and I wanted to try to share part of my journey in hopes of it helping in some way. I am so glad that your wife has you. Yes, the future is uncertain but we are living at a time when treatment is within reach for the first time ever. It is coming, as well as new options for managing symptoms in the meantime. You have got this. Please feel free to private message me if you want to talk more. I met the 10,000 character maximum so I want to add this piece:   \n\nAfter my dad passed away (he died peacefully in his sleep due to a heart-related event- not directly related to HD but his body was compromised from HD), my mom received an email from a family friend a year ago- I would like to share portions of it:\n\n\"I attended a meeting last week where the cutting edge neuroscientists, pharmacologists and physicians attended. I found myself sitting next to and old colleague from my residency days, who directs the Huntington's Disease Center at Hopkins. I asked him about the status of treatments for HD.\n\nAs you may know the era of gene therapies has begun and things are moving very fast. There are new game changing methods that can directly alter targeted genes and are starting to make a very significant impact on genetic disorders. i think there is very real optimism that these approaches will have a very significant impact on many genetic diseases and especially those that are 100% genetic and result from a single gene.\n\nHe told me that he expected that in the next 3-5 years they would have a gene therapy treatment that would have a significant impact on HD. I told him about your kids and he was surprisingly optimistic... Apparently there has already been substantial success reversing the genetic effects of HD in animal models. In the old days studies in animals did not necessarily mean that studies would progress quickly to humans. But that is not the case today where these interventions, and especially for relatively rare and highly impactful diseases, are moved forward very quickly.\" This was perfect,  sent a pm Love your information and yes I have heard about lions mane mushrooms that is what a director named Mariana palco I am not sure o her name takes I love you both", "HDBuzz on deutetrabenazine FDA approval ", "Worried 27 Male\n\n\nMy muscles are sore and weak all the time I have to keep constantly keep changing legs when I have them crossed.\n\nI notice when I drive my hands are clenched to the wheel and my shoulders are shrugged up.\n\nI made the mistake of looking at Huntingtons disease and bam I match everything.\n\nLike before I read about Huntingtons I noticed my \"personality\" changing I was like a different person like more angry to people cheeky in a way.\n\nBut I am thinking maybe my anxiety and depression was slowly creeping in and did not notice\n\nCould this be infact anxiety or?\n\nBoth my granddad's died when my parents were young so I do not know if they had it \n\nBoth my grandmothers are 70+ and have no symptoms.

Typically around age 30 is when signs start to manifest, but there is also a Juvenile HD that can present much earlier in life. Your best bet is to start with ( and go from there. It is usually diagnosed when symptoms are present.

Hello I am just a friend of someone who is homeless and on the final stages of Huntington's disease the hospital has released him out on the streets and I am curious if the hospital can be sued for such a thing. I myself am homeless and have been observing him for the past day last night he was up all night walking around and nothing but underwear around a parking lot after being released from the hospital two days ago after being held for over a month can the hospital be sued for malpractice?.\n\nThe man is obviously not fit to take care of himself Maybe, if you are in the US. But it would be a long expensive fight. Hospitals are immorally lawyered up, imo, and fight any allegations of malpractice.\n\nI wish I had more to offer. Thank you for being a friend to this person. Ty for the reply. We can only make him comfortable at this point Is he alert and oriented? If so- he can make his own decisions including walking around in underwear. \u201cIt is not illegal to be crazy\u201d if he can tell them\nWho he is\nWhen it is\nWhy he is there\nWhat is going on\nNo one can hold him against his will. The only other option is to contact HDSA and see if they have any resources. At a certain point, Medicaid should be able to pay for some sort of facility to manage his care. The downside is without the proper medications, the patient might not be willing to accept the care and might make it impossible for caregivers to manage. That is what I am worried about.

Also, this could vary based on the fact of medicare vs. medicaid. This would be something to research. They are supposed to not release a patient without an appropriate discharge plan. I do not know if that is a law, or just a policy most hospitals have. If he is still in the hospital, you can try to speak with someone with a title like \u201cdischarge coordinator\u201d or \u201cpatient liaison.\u201d They might not speak to you if you are not family!

My mom is showing no symptoms and she is 54 but 5 out of 7 of her siblings had HD. My grandma is almost 98 with no signs and so it is assumed that my grandpa had it but since he died at a young age from a heart attack no one was aware of his HD. I was supposed to get a genetics test a couple years ago but I cancelled the appointment since I think finding out would be worse than not knowing. I am turning 32 should I get the test done? Should I just live my life without knowing? Can you tell me what approach you took that helped? When my cousin spoke to a genetics counsellor they said that there is an approx 25% chance that a person who has a history of HD in their family but their parents do not have HD the child has a 25% chance they might get HD. Since hearing this I cannot stop thinking about it. Any advice/knowledge would help. That is not true. If a person\u2019s grandparent has had HD, but their parent has never been tested, there is a 25% chance they have HD. If their parent is diagnosed with HD, they have a 50% chance. If their parent has been tested and it comes back negative, their child has a better chance of being struck by lightening than having HD. It is not impossible but it is very unlikely. \n\nI do not have any advice on whether you should be tested. I would suggest seeing a genetic counselor. No one can tell you whether you should get tested or not. It is an incredibly personal decision and everyone has different circumstances which affect their choice of whether to test. Out of my sister and I, I was the one who chose to get tested and she has not. For some people knowledge is power and for others living with \u2018maybe\u2019 is better than possibly living with \u2018definitely\u2019. If you have children or are thinking of having children that can affect your choice. Whatever you decide you need to be prepared for that choice and make it knowingly and fully informed. It is an incredibly tough thing to decide. For me not knowing really affected me. It was on my mind all the time and any bout of forgetfulness or a twitch for me worried. Even knowing I wanted to get tested it took time for me to go through it. I found the process really hard, the waiting, the possible results filled my thoughts all the time but my need to know got me through it and the support of friends and family. Take your time and be sure, if you are not ready now maybe you will be in the future or maybe not.  For me getting tested was the right thing to do and as difficult as it was I am really glad I did it. Equally my sister is totally fine not getting tested.  If you decide to not get tested but would like to help the HD research and also have doctors keeping an eye on you then think about signing up for the EnrolHD study.", "I cannot get it off my mind, but can I be hopeful? My grandpa had Huntington\u2019s. He showed symptoms pretty late (about 54). His mother also showed symptoms pretty late. My mom has not gotten tested because she does not want to be hindered by any diagnosis. I agree, I do not want to be tested either, but I cannot help but worry. I am currently 19, she is 45. I have been doing a lot of research ever since I asked what it was that my grandpa had and found out that I might also have it, and I have seen a lot of stuff about breakthroughs and hopeful research that may lead to a treatment/cure. My mom told me that I should not worry about it, even though it is scary, because there very well may be a cure before it even gets to me, and because there is a chance that she will not even have it so I may not even have it. Should I stay hopeful? Should I be worried about my mom? Should I be worried about myself? I feel selfish, but I have been trying to educate myself as much as I can. I am 34, tested positive. I am hopeful. I am confused as to how or why you feel selfish about being worried about the future of your mother and yourself. If your mom does not want to get tested and does not have symptoms, I would just try to live my life and not stress out over it. You are not at risk if your mom does not have it. \n\nIf I were you I would just wait to get tested if that is what you want to do until you plan to have children. That is when I think you would have a solid incentive to want to make sure you were gene negative even if your mom is still not symptomatic at that time. Know that if you were to test positive that would obviously inform your mother that she has it too, which she may not want to know. (Sounds like she does not) \n\nGene positive or not, I hope you help spread awareness about this disease and advocate for the rights of people with HD, including access to potential future therapies. \ud83d\ude0a 35, tested positive 8 years ago. I am not going to lie, I went through a rough patch there for a bit but I honestly think I am better for it. I started thinking about the present a lot more, both on enjoying it and on what I can do now to help my future self and my family through the probable future. For me that means a robust savings, an outline for long term care, doctors that know me and know what my norm is so that we can track decline when necessary, I am health focused and I am active in my local HD community. My recommendation is that even if you do not want to get tested, a lot of the stuff you can do now is good for your future self no matter what happens. If HD can push you toward stuff you should do anyway then it can work as a positive force more than you would think. Stay hopeful. Our family movement disorders Dr told us that within 10 years, there will be a CURE, not treatment, but a cure. \n\nWe have to stay hopeful and not let it consume our lives. My mom passed away when I was 13. It was the most awful experience of my life. I am still recovering from it and it is been 6 years. You are allowed to be scared. You are allowed to worry.\n\nBut you have to have hope. Hope to get out of bed, see friends, work hard, pet dogs, and just enjoy life. You have to live you are life the best you can so you can look back and be happy with it. \n\nWho knows if she even has it. And if she does not, you would have wasted so much time and energy worrying that she does. But also do not completely forget it. Treasure those around you like they will not be here forever. Live your life expecting the worst, but hoping for the best.\n\nGood luck. Thank you so much. I think I feel selfish because she has told me not to worry for her, but I am, and I feel like I am wasting time worrying (which I have been a little bit). I have been trying to educate those who are closest to me so that they can potentially help educate others in the future. Thank you for the kind words! This is a very good outlook on it. You have helped me realize that I should not just sit around and wait, positive or not. Thank you so much; best wishes to you! This is very nice to hear. That could save so many people. I never really knew my grandpa because of HD, and so even though I did not get to know him, I hope that others can benefit from this so that they can get to know their grandpa. Thank you so much. I am sorry to hear about your mom, but I am glad to hear you were able to bounce back and remain hopeful and grateful. You are absolutely right; life is not going to wait around. Hearing from someone who is around my age brings a lot of comfort. Thank you so much. Yeah you do not hear too much about 19 year olds worrying or dealing with HD. Just know you got this \u2661", "Support groups? I have been living with a positive diagnosis of HD for a little over two years now and although I have spoken with friends and family about it I feel I have little in the way of support. I am currently in therapy over all this stuff I feel I cannot share with people either out of guilt over further burdening them or because they really have no frame of reference for my thoughts and feelings surrounding my diagnosis and the reality of my life around it and seem to have little more to offer me other than pity. I have looked into support groups in my area (Wisconsin) and it seems that the very few there are meet very infrequently and are mainly for caregivers. So my question for those of you out there who are positive but presymptomatic is, where do you go to vent or to seek advice? Are there online communities?

It definitely depends on the trial. \n\nObservational studies, like Enroll-HD, test the participant themselves but that information never comes back to the participant- so, in this case, the participant does not have to know their numbers. \n\nOther clinical trials typically test CAG repeats as well, but also ask for the person to provide lab results from a previous test and/or family history w/a clinical diagnosis. \n\nA good place to get started for HD studies is HD Trial Finder (( A great place for all sorts of studies in the US is (  As someone currently in the hospital waiting as my girlfriend donates some spinal fluid for a clinical trial.

But I am only 18 and my family does not want me to get tested. I cannot help but feel that I will meet the same fate as my mom if I do not get tested, and forget about it. it is not something I want to leave in the past. It is terrifying to think you can live your whole life only to be cut short by something you cannot even see. I do not want to be the kid who everyone feels bad for because he is going to die. And I do not want to be the kid who dodged the bullet after the thought of dying of Huntington\u2019s basically ruled my life. Does anyone have any similar experiences? Any possible solutions? Opinions? Really anything that might help me in my decision to get tested? A few things: \n\n-it does not matter what your family thinks on this. Were they there when you and your mom were homeless? Did they watch your mom deteriorating like you did? No. But even if they did, they do not get a say. It is your life.\n\n-you are not likely to just forget about it. You can take your time to think about it and go to therapy. Once you know you cannot unknow. But knowledge is power. \n\nI tested at 30. It was positive but I still feel better about knowing then I did about not knowing. so I believe testing is good, however definitely make sure you are in an ok mental place and have a support system ready to help you process the results. There is no need to rush into testing tomorrow.\n\nSorry you have to deal with this. Best of luck, whatever you choose I went through something similar. I was thinking about testing and working myself up a lot over it, all I kept thinking as I need to know. But now that I do and I am gene positive with no symptoms at 53 I wish I could take it back!! I think about now more than I did when I had not yet tested; it is the first thing I think about when I wake up and when a go to bed. No easy answer and honestly I do not think I could of done it differently as I was so set on finding out. What I was not ready for was the positive as I thought I am late 40 with no signs and felt great. Good luck and take care you are so young and seem really strong. God bless you. Thank you I appreciate it Thank u for ur response What was your CAG count , if you do not mind? Like everyone will tell you (as they should) this is a deeply personal decision and there is no right or wrong decision to make. That being said, I would like to share my own personal opinion:\n\nI considered getting tested at 18, again at 26, and now at almost 33 I am finally doing it and waiting for results.  I met with a genetic counselor at 18 and 26 and after my session decided to wait. \n\nLet me tell you, I am so thankful I did not go through with testing in my 20s. You are not \"fully cooked\" until 26. I am a completely different person now than I was at 26 and at 18 I was still a child. There is no comparison to my emotional intelligence now versus then. At 18 I did not practice mindfulness, radical acceptance, and did not have the years of therapy and emotional labor I did coming to terms with my situation. \n\nMy recommendation? Spend the next few years working on yourself. Get a therapist who has some experience in these kinds of things, spend the time and all that hard work practicing mindfulness and radical acceptance. \n\n If it is ruling your life not knowing, it will rule your life knowing, too. That is not to say knowing does not help people, it does help some people with acceptance, planning and moving forward. But just having a yes or no is not going to relieve your anxiety, the work you do before and after your results relieves your anxiety. And for some people knowing helps them do that work. Take time to do that work. Thank u this was very helpful 42 My family did not want me to get tested either, though they were supportive of my decision to find out. If you are worried how they will react to your diagnosis just do not tell them. You do not need to tell them you are getting tested and if you do, you do not need to tell them your result. Do not let other people factor into your decision too much.\n\nAs other comments have said, 18 is probably too young. You still have a lot of maturing and developing to do.

I honestly had never even heard of Huntington's Disease until my mother told me about my grandma's diagnosis. I did some research, and I was just looking for opinions and advice. I still do not know much about the disease. Sorry if I am lacking details, I am 27/f, and I know that on average people do not start showing symptoms until they are in their 30's or 40's but I am still wondering if I should worry quite yet or not. Any and all advice is welcome!  Does your father have symptoms or a diagnosis? You cannot inherit it unless your father has it Hey \n\nFirstly, I am sorry about your grandmas diagnosis, it is not an easy thing to find out. Make sure you and your family are getting the support to understand the disease, the prognosis and what treatments are available to help. \n\nSecondly, the decision to get tested is a tough one and you will find a lot of arguments either way. \n\nYou are right about the symptoms not usually starting until 30s and 40s, there is often a correlation for age of onset being a bit younger than parents, but only a bit. \n\nYou need to think about your reasons to get tested, what do you gain and lose from finding out, can you live with not knowing? \n\nI got tested at 25 before making decisions about careers and family. Its hard to know, but you come to accept it and there is a lot of support. I know of a lot of people who chose not to get tested through. \n\nThe genetics can be a little confusing at first, but here we go. \n\nWe all have 2 copies of the gene, one from our father, one from our mother. If either of these is faulty then we will develop symptoms at some point. Its also possible to have 2 non affected parents, but for the mutation to occur and cause one of our copies to be affected (rare). \n\nHaving 2 affected parents would be very very rare, so we will consider the situation that is most common. \n\nYour grandma has 2 copies of the gene, one of these is faulty. \n\nWe can use h to represent the normal gene, and H to represent the faulty one. \n\nSo your grandma has h and H (represented as hH)\n\nOne of these had passed to your parent, so they have a straight 50:50 chance of inheriting the faulty gene from grandma (hH) and grandpa has 2 normal copies (hh).\n\nThere are 4 possible combinations from this hh hh Hh and Hh. 2 carry the affected gene to the next generation, 2 do not. \n\nCarrying this into the next generation, your at risk parent either has hh or Hh, your other parent ( assuming no history) is almost certainly hh. \n\nBecause of the unknown status of your parent, there are 8 possible combinations \n\nhh hh hh hh Hh Hh hh hh \n\n2 of these carry the faulty gene, so without knowing your parents status you have a 25% chance of getting the faulty gene. This can happen if and only if your parent also inherited it \n\nYou have a slight added complication in that if you test positive then you know for sure that your parent (whoever's mum your grandma is) also has the defective gene. They may have chosen to not get tested, they have the right to not know (which could lead to a situation where you have tested positive but you cannot tell them without revealing their status.) . \n\nYou need to talk to your parent about your consideration around the test. In the uk at least, there is a psychological assessment as part of the testing process and you can be asked to attend counselling before off through the testing process. There is a lot of support at all stages, whatever the outcome. \n\nIf you have any questions, this ha a good resource. I am happy to talk about my experiences, manly others are too. \n\nNo one can tell you whether you should get tested, its absolutely your choice. But we can help with understanding the process and implications. \n\nBest wishes to you and your family though  Some people still consider testing even if their parent had not had a diagnosis, it complicates the decision, but with an at risk parent, op is still at risk. \n\nIf the parent chooses to not get tested, op can still go ahead and get the support. \n\nIt seems like a fairly late diagnosis, so maybe a relatively late onset, so her parent may not yet show any symptoms.  What type of symptoms is your grandma showing? What is her CAG repeat (in the genetic test this is the primary result)? If she is near 70 years and the CAG is low (35-39) the onset is later. It does not take away from the suckyness of the disease, but it makes having a full and satisfying life easier. There is a noisy statistical correlation between CAG repeat and age of onset of physical symptoms. \n\nIf you get tested follow the HDSA guidelines on counseling etc. ( Sorry for your grandma to have this disease.\n\nI may have an unique perspective on this, about 7 years ago I was to diagnosed with a very rare brain disease called ADCA-SCA1. And ADCA SCA1 is related to HD, ADCA shares the same type of genetic fault HD has. And that type of genetic fault causes these diseases.\n\nHD is an \"autosomal dominant\" disease, that means that direct siblings of your grandma have a 50/50 % change to have it or not to have it. (my mother had it, but her older sister not, also the kids of the sister do not have it)\n\nSo it would be advisable that the kids of grandma need a check too.\n\nA new life and reality will begin, until recently there where no cures available, but since recently a few new \"medicines\" and a new method has been developed that makes for the first time the forecast for these diseases not so bleak. These type of diseases are better understood.\n\nA helpful \"HD website\" is HDbuzz.net.\nIn layman terms it explains HD, its problems, new cures, research and medicines. It is run by HD doctors and researchers from the whole world.\n\n\n\nOh and get to know other patients, in my country there are \"patient associations\".\n\nhth \n\n My dad had HD and I got tested when I was 18. I found that most people fall into one of two camps: one kind that hates uncertainty and would rather know things, even bad things, than wonder about it, and another kind that finds knowing bad things creates a constant black cloud over them. Knowing can help you plan your life better or differently, but there are ways to plan without knowing. Ultimately it is a deeply personal decision though, and does carry potentially carry implications for your father and your siblings. \n\nDo you live in the US? If you do, you should check out the HDSA chapter nearest to you. That is where most genetic testing is done, so they are well-equipped to help you learn about HD as well as help you grapple with the decision and work through your thought process. HD Centers of Excellence, as they are called, have neurologists, geneticists, counselors, neuropsychologists, psychiatrists, and more, and you have to meet with all of them over the course of months before you get tested. So, I strongly recommend that you call a center near you to get some information and talk through your options with experts like that. I am sorry to hear about your grandmother. Good luck with everything.", "Finding a good therapist Hey everyone. New to this subreddit - spouse of a person with HD in the family. My husband has decided that testing is not right for him at this time but we do want to seek counseling/therapy to help manage the day-to-day mental burden of being in a HD family, not to mention caring for my husband's father as he progresses. Does anyone have advice or personal experiences re: finding a good therapist with specific experience helping people deal with genetic diseases/terminal illnesses? Not talking about pre-testing genetic counseling, but rather a long-term therapist relationship for the day to day. Thanks in advance. I do not have specific recomendations. A lot could depend on where you are. Maybe try contacting the nearest HD center of excellence?\n\n My therapist has been working with me since way before I got tested. Since February when I got my results she has been earning stripes. If you want her info pm me. It is a great idea to start therapy - I have found that there is a lot of mental anguish and guilt being the child of a HD positive parent and there is a lot to work through as they progress. Therapy is a great way to start combating some of those unhelpful feelings. If you or your husband have a family doctor you could make an appointment with them and get a referral or recommendation for therapists or psychologists they recommend. \n\nDMs are always open :) Im so glad that you are taking this mental burden seriously, and willing to get help. \n\nMy wife has advanced/ early late stage HD (wheelchair, in home nursing, but no tubes yet) and this 20+ year journey would have killed me long ago without a small army of therapists and mental health pros. \n\nWe did couples therapy for a few years ago until she was not really feeling it anymore, but I stayed with that couples therapist and eventually found another therapist for me personally. So I now have individual therapy and group therapy every week. Couples therapy is no longer possible, but if it were, I would be in that chair 3x per week. \n\nAs to finding a therapist, it is a lot of trial and error. We went through a half dozen couples therapists before we landed on one we liked. It was a frustrating process, and I did most of that work myself. This was post-genetic testing, mind you, so the burden was less vague and more of an impending threat.\n\nPsychology Today website has a ton of great resources. We also went through the neurology department where we have done testing and treatment. Their social worker was able to help us find a couples therapist that understood our situation. \n\nHope this was helpful. Best of luck to you both. I will second this. We used a COE to find our first couples therapist I agree with the suggestions already posted but wanted to second what EnlightenedApeMeet said- that you might have to try out a few therapist until you find the right fit.  It is also unlikely they will know much about HD (not that this would prevent them from doing a good job).   If the therapist you do connect with is willing or interested, there is free HD focused continuing education for professionals provided by the Huntington Study Group ( or HDSA's (\n\nAlso, I work in the HD space and we have an AMAZING therapist that sees individuals, couples, and families.   She provides therapy using a telemedicine platform and is licensed to see folks in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia- in case you are living in any one of those states. (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck to you both and feel free to DM with questions!", "Afraid of getting huntington I am afraid  of getting huntington disease ,I do not have any family members with this disease but I road about de novo mutation and I am very sad.\nThis is possible?", "UCL Huntington's Disease Research \u00bb First patients dosed with \u2018gene silencing\u2019 drug, ISIS-HTTRx, for Huntington\u2019s disease ", "Got my results today - sorta. I have been lurking for a bit and thought now would be a good time to start posting since I need a distraction. I grew up knowing that HD ran in my family. My grandmother passed when I was in middle school from it. My mother refused to be tested or even discuss the possibility that she may have it too. She is currently symptomatic but will not see a doctor. Mostly memory issues and declining cognitive function. She lives with me and is safe and happy, so I have been trying to just appreciate the time I have with her for now. A few weeks ago I asked a neurologist to help me get tested and he agreed to do it. This morning he called and told me my test was positive but forgot to tell me the number of CAG repeats and I did not think to ask. I am currently waiting for a call back from him to give me the number and it is driving me insane. I am someone who needs all the info available in order to even start to process this. I took a Xanax and went for a walk but it did not help much. I just feel so guilty that I so glibly confirmed that my mother has HD without talking to her first because I felt like I needed to know for my own purposes.\n I received my positive test before my father was tested. You have to do what is right for you. My dad's cognitive status was well declining at the time, so it was not something I felt guilty about, in my situation, but I can understand.  Thank you for responding. I am going to take my time and make sure that if I tell her, it is for her benefit and not mine. I feel like that is all I can do. You are entitled to get tested. I would not share the results with her. If she is happy sticking her head in the sand even though she is clearly symptomatic, I do not see what is to be gained by dropping that bomb on her. Agreed. I am lucky enough to have a friend who is a mental health professional and she helped me to make sense of it all last night. My right to know and her right to not know are not mutually exclusive. I can honor her wishes by simply not telling her. My mum was similar, in that she did not want to be tested. She was recently diagnosed through symptoms alone, with a test being carried out to give her a count and a more 'official' diagnoses.\n\nI still feel she is in slight denial, accepting that she has it perhaps, but maybe not realising how symptomatic she actually is.\n\nIt does not really hit our family until our 50s. I am currently 31. Now that my mum has been diagnosed, I have started the process of being tested. I will have an appointment next month, where if I want, I can have the blood taken and know by Christmas.\n\nHope you are doing okay with your diagnoses.  Thank you. I am still a big ball of anxiety because I do not know what my count was yet. I spoke to the doctor who ran the test and he said he was out of the office when we talked but would send me the report. I just want all the info so I can work on dealing with it. Being in limbo is no fun. I am wishing I had asked a less busy doctor to test me but there is no fixing that now. I was at the neurologist to check on my progress after having a stroke almost a year ago and it seemed like he would be a good person to ask for help with testing. I think I overestimated his familiarity with the testing process and delivering results to patients. He was very kind and told me he does not think after doing a thorough exam a week or so ago that I am symptomatic. It is hard not to wonder if the stroke aftermath is really Huntington's so that was comforting. Nothing to do now but wait. Sorry to hear your results and understand the anxiety.  I would recommend seeing a genetic counselor that knows HD once you get results.  It is just  good to have someone to ask questions that understands the disease and the genetics/CAG count science.  Either way, there are a lot of people in the community who are willing to provide support and understanding.  Not sure of your age, but if under 35 i would recommend reaching out to ( and connecting with others in similar situations. Best of luck! &gt; It does not really hit our family until our 50s. I am currently 31.\n\nThe good news is there will be a definitive cure well before you start showing symptoms, if you have it at all. ", "WORLD-WIDE Flash Mob  ", "Grief My partner has huntigtons, we have a daughter. How do people deal with the grief? Or lack of grief. Im watching her slowly deteriorate and change and i just wish i could grieve. Each step towards the inevitable it hard but i think im finding the lack of a solid grieving process or a solid thing to grieve hard. It feels endless. I can be sad she cant so this or sad to see her change but i cant grieve solidly. Even if i sit a cry i dont feel better for long before some new change starts it over again. Is there a word for that or something i can do? If i were spiritual id turn to that but im atheist and honestly i feel it to be a disadvantage here. Does anyone feel the same? Are you going to the support meetings? \nOther families have tread this ground before you, and she are on the same path you are right now. \n\nSpeaking to others in person can be cathartic. I havnt been able to attend any support meetings no. I think its going to be time soon to do that. But its hard to find the time supporting my family working a full time job ect. But i have to make the time Support meeting are definitely something you should check out. A good cry in the privacy of the bathroom every so often helps too. My mother and uncle passed away from it when I was 6 and 21 respectively. There is no real grieving process unless you make yourself address the problem head on. Go to support meetings, find an HDSA chapter, see a therapist, or even talk about it with someone you trust. I really did not talk to anyone about it until I started talking to my cousin regularly about how I felt and what was bugging me. Even just saying it out loud to another human is a step forward. I used to get panic attacks and since I have started talking to him it is really become infrequent and reduced in severity. You cannot make it go away entirely, but you can certainly manage. DM me if you even want a phone call I would be happy to talk. Thanks so much. this community os so supportive. Im so sorry for your losses. I think i will start talking to a few friends about it. I know it affects them too. And your right jut saying it out loud helps. Just having said it out loud here has helped at least today. Tragedy is a pillar of character. If there is anything we know about modern day dealings, its that technology has usurped the role of close friends and true connectedness. It is very easy to be lonely without being alone per se, but for things like this you have to do something in person. You will not get a fresh genuine perspective or a new idea without the aid of a real conversation, and opening up to someone you trust is therapeutic. As a matter of fact, I will tell you this, I did not start talking to my cousin about HD. He actually mentioned it during a conversation we were having in a long car ride. It can be really tough to break that first barrier. Sometimes you feel like a burden or like you are just going to make people sad, sometimes you feel nervous even mentioning it. There is a lot at play. but once you crack the dam the rest comes easy, and it is going to be hugely cathartic to regularly address it. For that reason I am really glad my cousin did the hard work for me and brought it up. After that I never felt uncomfortable bringing up my own worries and woes to him.", "I just do not know what to do.... I met a wonderful woman last year and she pulled me out of a dark depression and she told me her father had huntington's I did not think much of it but now I have done more research and i am scared of everything our hopes and dreams.\n\nShe wants to be a mother and i would love to give her children but she is scared of giving her children the gene. \n\nShe is doing more research on the disease as well but.\n\nI just do not know what to do... I have done research and found a lab in the Netherlands that had a gene therapy but it is still in trial maybe I am just panicking and just scared she is still pretty young the though of losing her is my greatest fear. \n\nIt  pains me to see that there is nothing I can do it makes me want to quit everything and look for a cure or a treatment/something anything...\n\nI am just ranting... I want her to get tested but scared of the result... I just do not want to lose her. You can still have kids. Ivf allows for genetic testing embryos before implantation. I just had ivf, HD free, twins and am HD +. \n\nThere is still room for hope. Some of life will definitely suck, but if you love a person it is still worth going through it with them for all the good times you can still have. I remember this feeling well. My husband has the disease. We found out his mom had HD two weeks before our first daughter was born. \n\nPlease know that people with HD can still live normal lives for a long time. It depends on what her CAG number is. My MIL did not start to exhibit symptoms until she was in her 50s. \n\nOur genetic counselor said that if our daughter does end up having the gene, chances are there will be a cure by the time she starts to show symptoms. \n\nThis is a very tough decision. However, life is short and be with the one you love. I do not regret marrying my husband knowing what I know now. I want to live each day to the fullest with him and never take him for granted. \n\nThere is a lot of drugs in trial right now that are looking hopeful. They will not be out for years but it is something to cling to. \n\nIf you do get married and decide to have kids, I would encourage you to talk to a genetic counselor. We are doing IVF for our second child to make sure that they do not have the gene. It is truly the best way to eradicate this horrible disease. However, I know this is a luxury many cannot afford. \n\nI would hate for you to end a relationship over something that your girlfriend might not have. And even if she does have it, she might be able to get it treated before she even shows symptoms or she might not show symptoms until much later in life. If you love her, be with her. \n\nBest of luck to you. Thanks she is consoling me more then anything. I have a habit of finding a solution for everything but she keeps telling \"Stop trying to over engineer everything...\" I just want her to be okay... I just need sometime to process... I totally get it. This is how I felt. The best thing you can do is to learn that this is out of your control. I have been in therapy for a while now to help me with this. It might be something that would help you as well. This is a hard thing and you should not have to do it alone. Thank you. So much. I have wiped most of the tears. I am just going to take it day by day and hope for the best. She just keeps telling me to pray and see what God brings and i not religious but i am hopeful. \n\nShe wants to to get tested and to see what happens.\n\nI am just going to enjoy my time with her as much as I can. Hey! I have been in a similar predicament. If you would like to chat via private message let me know! All the best. The IVF thing has already been covered, but I wanted to say that while HD is really, really terrible, it is not a reason not to live a joyful life together. First, many people do make it to a normal lifespan. My mom is 68, and she is stage 4 and just now showing signs that she is ready for assisted living. My dad died at 68 from congestive heart failure, so she is already outlived him. My HD+ uncle died at 60...from lung cancer. I have lost family members in their 20s and 30s to auto accidents and liver disease. There are no guarantees in life, and HD is just one of a myriad of ways she could go out.\n\nIf she is positive, there may be symptoms to manage even before the worst of it, but having a neurologist to help with that will improve her quality of life and yours. You can plan a financially secure future, with good health insurance and long term care insurance before she is even tested, just in case. She really needs to find a clinic that does testing that has a genetic counselor on staff who will talk her through the decision. There is no right answer for everyone, and good reasons to make either choice. But there is still joy and hope no matter the result.

I would really appreciate talking with someone who knows what I am going through bc no-one I know has anything like this\ud83e\udd7a Well, its the first time I have heard a doctor claim that high repeats means it will onset earlier. The disease is so random, your mom could have went onset at 30 and you not until your 60. Have you been to a psychologist yet to see of you have started symptoms or not. This disease takes a long time to progress. Activity and brain exercise can keep you going longer. It might sound callous but odds are you will die from something else before the disease fully takes its hold. Make sure you talk to a therapist. One of the leading causes of death amongst huntingtons patients is suicide because the fear of what might/will come is overwhelming.\n\nMy mom passed away 3 months ago from complications with Huntington's. It took a long, long time to get to where it ended. 2 sisters have tested positive and I feel I am getting onset symptoms, but cannot afford the testing process. My wife and I decided to not have children because we refuse to pass on the gene. Im not sure how much experience you have with the disease but I can answer any questions to the best of my experience/knowledge I am so so sorry to hear. I literally just tested positive for the HD gene today. My mom is positive too. Freaking sucks. I feel you. I do not know about you, but I am feeling a mix between sadness, wanting to do everything I can do delay symptoms, and also wanting to live life to the fullest in the meantime. Such a mix of emotions. Are you doing ok? How are you feeling? I am so sorry. Genetic diseases are so cruel and unrelenting. My Mom used to stay up at night begging God she did not have the gene. It is so .. i have been staring at the screen for a while now and I cannot come up with the words:/ maybe I will reply later if I figure them out\n\nand I do not know if repeat amount/location applies to every genetic condition (my Mom does not have HD). I did not specify in my prior post (just said it is a neurodegenerative disease that affects motor and cognitive function) but if you are curious, the gene causes frontotemporal dementia and ALS. specifically, they talked about how the copy number repeat \\*for my Mom's mutation\\* tends to increase with generation and onset becomes earlier and severity becomes higher. I truly do not know if any of that pertains to HD. please, please forgive me if I scared you. I really appreciate you replying. I am so sorry - for both you and your Mom. life can be so cruel and I hope that you can soak up all those good moments. I know nothing can really offset the bad, but I hope life gets you at least close.\n\nuhm I guess my thoughts are kind of all over the place. I keep feeling nauseous whenever I think about it for long (not that it is always up to me if I can stop):/ Understandable. It is exhausting to think about as well as physically and emotionally draining. That is wonderful you are caring for your mom, though I am certain equally as difficult. I know I see my mom and think oh gosh that is going to happen to me - it is downright debilitating sometimes. No pun intended. But really, these genes fucking suck. \n\nThere is a support zoom meeting hosted by National Youth Alliance for people who tested positive for HD tomorrow at 11am CST. I know your gene is different.

I find out my results in a few weeks. yes and no? it is the c9 gene but my family\u2019s form has so many repeats they said current technology is not specific enough to count them all. they said bc of this atypical presentations can be seen so that was why my family\u2019s symptoms and onset were so \u201coff\u201d from the norm. my Mom\u2019s symptoms are like a cross btwn ftd and huntington\u2019s. apparently they would seen the huntington\u2019s gene cause the ftd/als combo but not seen it happen the other way around. \nI mean there are probably at least a handful of others who were told this before (we cannot be the only ones, right?) but it feels so weird to be a \u201cmisfit\u201d even within that C9 genetic disease. Gotcha. I am really sorry to hear that. How old was your mom at onset? My mom and sister had an onset in their 40\u2019s, which is considered early. I am 32 and thinking that I have around 8 years before onset. My mom also had a presentation of FTD/Huntington-like symptoms.\n\nWhere did you get your testing? I am so sorry, that is really early:(\nMy Mom was about 50 and her brother (deceased) started showing signs around 42 or 43, I think. What scares me tho is the difference in onset across generations - my Nana did not onset until she was into her 60s and her Mom did not onset until even older than that. It is like 10 plus years get shaved off btwn each generation. \nMy Mom and I got our testing done at the mayo clinic.

We had a few drinks and got to talking about everything that has transpired due to HD. Eventually she came to the point that she feels since I have started down my path of getting diagnosed that I have made her my emotional punching bag and that I am emotionally abusive to her. I got a little upset and had to walk away. We got into a fight later where she refused to communicate. She just shut down and went to bed silently and refused to say any words no matter how much I begged for her to talk to me. She just said she was too tired to talk. I felt betrayed that she felt my emotional reaction to my diagnosis was unfair to her. I do not know how to act right now?\n\nNone of this is fair. At least you get to live a normal life from here out without having a slow and slippery decline into psychiatric madness before you brain and body fails you and you are forced to be bed ridden. I am being emotional. I am distraught. I am a mess. I have never had routine panic attacks in my life until now. I have never experienced pain and suffering and hurt like this disease has brought into my life. \n\nI have not slept in the same house as my wife now for 10 days. I have not just been able to sit down and talk to her. She refuses to answer my phone calls or respond to my texts. When I am able to talk to her I ask her about counseling and she just tells me she is not ready to talk about it yet and she is refusing to look for marriage counselors. I have had a lot of doctor's appointments in the last 10 days with some monumental findings regarding my prognosis and I have had to do it alone. I never ever thought HD would take everything from me, but seemingly it has. I have no idea what else I have left to give. Instead of focusing on healing myself and figuring out how to claw my way out of this deep dark pit that is HD, I am focusing on \"being a better person\" to get my wife back so I can have someone hold me when I am having panic attacks.\n\nFuck this disease. And, fuck people who will not keep a promise.", "How far away do you think we are from a cure? My husband\u2019s family has been annihilated by Huntington\u2019s. His mom got diagnosed 2 weeks before we gave birth to our daughter. Before that, all we knew was that her mom, sister, grandma, and great aunt all died of it. We thought his mom was in the clear since she is almost 60. She even told us she did not have it and implied she had taken the test, which was not true.\n\nSo now I am worried about my new little family. I am worried about my husband who is the best thing in my life. I am worried about the possibility of my daughter having it. I have dreams that they both have it and die and I am left alone to pick up the pieces. I am so scared of seeing those I love most slowly die. \n\nI have been helping care for my mother-in-law for years because we knew something was wrong. We just thought it was dementia. Caring for her has been a full time job for me on top of being a first time mom and working. It is very tiring. I am worried that once his mom passes it will be time to start taking care of him. I know it is selfish to think of myself in this moment considering I am not at risk. But this is not how I pictured my life being. This is not what I wanted for my family. \n\nMy husband is in therapy and I start therapy this Friday. I just need some encouragement right now and am wondering when you guys think a cure could be discovered based on where science is at right now. I do research constantly but struggle to find a timeframe. I feel like if I can read that the cure might be here in 5 years then I can hold out until then and take it 5 years at a time. \n\nMy husband is going to get tested next month. Everyone in his family that could have the disease has had it so I am not feeling hopeful. He assumes he already has it. Everything right now feels surreal. First let me express how sorry I am for the challenges you are facing. My wife is positive for Huntington\u2019s with a CAG repeat of 44. She is pre-systematic right now thankfully. There are several companies doing research and getting very close to promising treatment. Being that HD is genetic, personally I do not think there will be a cure necessarily, but I absolutely believe we are close to seeing treatment to prolong the life and quality of life for affected individuals.  I have posted a link to an article describing such treatment that I think is most promising.  I wish there was more I could do to help your little family. \n\n I am so sorry to hear about your wife. I am glad that she is doing okay currently. And I should have rephrased my question because you make a good point that it will never fully be cured. \n\nThank you for sending this article my way. I am going to read it now. I am so sorry to hear about your family. One thing you might keep in mind is that your husband\u2019s chance of having the disease, regardless of how many of his relatives have had it, is 50/50. He might have it, and he might not. I know how awful that period of waiting and wondering is, but do not give up hope yet. Also, I am not in any way a geneticist or medical researcher, but my doctor seemed very sincerely hopeful about the advances being made with the Crispr gene editing technology. There might actually be a cure some day, even in our lifetime. He said that the tech is so quickly advancing that it was impossible to tell where we would be in five, ten years but that there is definitely hope. Plus, there have been advances in treating the symptoms. There are trials right now for RG6042, a treatment which targets and destroys the mutated proteins and dramatically slows progression and onset; apparently it is a pretty major breakthrough in treatment and researchers feel very hopeful about it. I hope this helps you find your hope. Good luck to you and your family. Impossible to say really. I am hopeful, but regardless everything about it will be better when it is my turn then what I watched my dad go through. In part because he was not diagnosed until years after his symptoms were apparent. And I take some comfort in that. a more direct link  There is a class of drugs based on CRISPR that is moving forward. The best test results were released last year. A group was dosed by a shot in the spine, 1/2 fake, 1/2 drug. After six months they both got the drug. The fake first group had normal decline, the drug group did not have any decline. In the second half, the fake group had no decline. This is just one of four. \n\nThere is a lot of hope, not for a cure but for the first effective treatment. In my opinion, if started early enough and your CAG is low enough, you likely will not show symptoms. \n\nTrue cure can be had by in-vetro fertilization embryo selection. We are a hundred years away from that being offered to everyone. Now it costs $25k out of pocket in USA with insurance. &gt;There is a lot of hope, not for a cure but for the first effective treatment\n\nYeah, I think effective treatment will be in the next few decades. A cure? I do not know, but technology is exponential. This just made my day. Thank you! And I will do my best to not give up hope. I am so sorry to hear about your dad. That is essentially what happened with my mother-in-law and she is 57. What age did he start to exhibit symptoms?  I do not recall exactly. I was in 7th grade when he stopped working, so before that. And he was incorrectly diagnosed for several years after that point. &gt;There are trials right now for RG6042, *a treatment which targets and destroys the mutated proteins and dramatically slows progression and onset*; apparently it is a pretty major breakthrough in treatment and researchers feel very hopeful about it.\n\nThe Roche trial for RG6042 has only just begun phase 3 to determine efficacy for the drug. So the statement above has not been proven to be true. We do not *know* yet if the drug does slow progression of the disease. We do not even know if it improves symptoms for people with Huntington's Disease. We will not know that until the trial is over and the data is analyzed. The trial is currently still recruiting patients. There will be 660 patients total, and each patient will be dosed for around 2 years. According to ( the last patient dosing is expected to be completed in March 2022 and the study results are expected to be finalized by August 2022. You can read all about it for yourself, here: ( \n\nThe facts are that we do not know if RG6042 is the answer to our problem. It is just the first drug to attempt to change the course of the disease. And that alone is great news.\n\nEven if RG6042 does not work out, which we will not know for sure or not for another \\~ 3 years or so, there are several other companies who are working on this problem (though no one else is as far along as Roche is right now). \n\nI believe whenever CRISPR delivery widespread into the brain can be sussed out, we will have our closest thing to 'cure'. Advances are happening every day. So, we just have to stay hopeful, educate the people around us, and be advocates for genetic science and discovery. Some people are very afraid of what CRISPR is capable of, so I think that we have a responsibility to guide the discussion appropriately whenever possible. \n\nBut Hi-Def\\_life has a great point - your husband's odds are 50/50. Best to not put the cart before the horse, love.  He has the same odds of not having it as actually having it. You should not fret so much until you get his results.  Even then, life goes on. You must enjoy every moment that you have together today. \n\nI am 28 and I got diagnosed earlier this year. Tested positive, but I am not symptomatic and I likely will not be for at least another 10 years. The only thing there is to do is prepare for your future as best as you can, have hope, and enjoy the heck outta life. Can you please provide a link to a source that describes a trial of CRISPR use in humans to treat Huntington's Disease? \n\nI think this is it. \n\n\n\nThis is the first Q and A Gotcha! So you are actually referencing here the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug by Roche. It functions in an entirely different way from CRISPR. CRISPR would physically and permanently alter the genome in the cells.\nThe ASO drug that is currently in testing right now works completely differently. The DNA remains in tact. It intercepts the messenger RNA and inhibits protein synthesis. \n\nThe current hypothesis for the way that HD progresses is due to toxic build up of the long, mutated Huntingtin protein. So, the idea with the ASO is that your body generates less of the protein so there is less to clean up. However, ASOs must be administered through the spine at regular intervals for the entirety of a patient's life. \n\nThe problem with CRISPR right now is that the delivery into the brain is a challenge and the technology is still very new to be permanently altering the genetic code in our brain cells. \n\nThere is a great article about CRISPR applied for HD though - the scientists are hopeful that there may be clinical trials within the next ~5 years or so. \n Thank you for the detailed response. I am sorry to hear of your diagnosis. I admire your outlook on everything! I definitely have good days and bad days. I wrote this on a bad day. My husband is scheduled to take the test in a week. I will do my best to remain positive until we know for sure. Thanks again If you are not rolling in the dough, then not for at least a few decades. I think it is awful that people could be denied a potentially life changing treatment, because they cannot afford thousands pretty month. \n\nLiterally putting a cosy on someone is life. From 6-22-17 To my family. \"Today I spent the afternoon at the HDSA conference center. I was in a Wave pharma patient question group. This is the SNP technology that finds the mutated gene and silences it by CSPIR. It does not actually look for  the CAG repeat, it looks for one of three unique sections of   code near the CAG repeat. That part of the technology seems to show that the side effects should be limited to  HD stuff and not other stuff. So you may sleep different, but your gut will not start hurting.  It  was an interesting look into how drug trials are set up. A big part of this technology is that it has to be delivered into the spinal fluid. They said the needle is a 24 gauge and smaller than an epidural needle. But any doctor that can give  an epidural,  can give this medicine.  At this point first product 2/3 of HD patents have the right SNP to grab. The other 1/3 will have to wait at least 8 years before they find and get through regulatory on that. In lab dish tests they zap 40% of the bad HD gene and 20% of the good. They expect to do a shot every four weeks for ever. In exchange it may be enough for your regenerative system to fight off the plaque. So with our low CAG, this could be a technology that would allow you to live a very long time. I would expect after a decade of the first generation product, new easier to use products would come out. Technology marches on. The last two issues I left them with were the decades old gel formation that forms and how that changes, they could not model that in test tube. That leads me to think that the first really early stage tests should be closely watched, you would not want to fuck that up. Second suicide. From a health standpoint the mortality is so much higher, younger due to suicide. I feel one reason for that is lack of hope. I was with three HD+ ladies today who had had epidurals and would do that every month if it meant they did not have to go through what their mom or dad did.\" I was at the Wave Life Sciences tour before the HDSA conference too! That tour was really cool and their head neurologist is an awesome woman. \n\nWave is working on another ASO, similar to Roche\u2019s drug. It does not use CRISPR either. It differs from Roche\u2019s approach in that it the ASO only binds to the messenger RNA of the mutant huntington gene so that the mutant huntingtin protein is not created. As you mentioned, it looks for sequences only found on the mutant huntington gene called SNPs to selectively disable the production of mutant huntingtin protein. I work in the industry and in fact for a company that has licensed one of our compounds out to a big pharma for treatment of HD.\n\nHere is my realistic assessment without sugar coating anything.\n\nAt earliest we will have an effective treatment within 2-3 years. This treatment will halt or dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These are not the old medicines you remember but highly precise targeted medicines.  \n\n\nWe have the technology to suppress gene expression at this point. It has been proven using ASO technology (Ionis Pharma) and is being worked on for siRNA (Alnylam). For these technologies it is just a matter of time to find the right target + have enough potency to reduce the mutant genes. If the compounds do not work in their first generation/ongoing attempts the big delay will actually be that HD is a very slow progressing disease so all the clinical trials to show benefit will take a long time as clinical benefit has to be measured against the (slow) baseline decline. Gene suppression can absolutely address HD.  \nCRISPR and other gene editing technologies still have a lot of barriers to overcome.  \n\n\nAt the absolutely latest if it turns out that we misunderstand the pathway (which I am confident that we do not) then it will be 20 years. I am amusing in this number that there are multiple follow up failures.  \n\n\nYour daughter will likely never suffer from this disease. Depending on the age of your husband it is also very likely that he will have preventative treatment especially as your mother in law was slow onset. Wow. Thank you for the incredibly informative response. I appreciate your honesty. You have given me hope and that is what I need right now. Thank you! I am not a scientist, nor an expert on HD. \n\nOur movements disorder Doctor said that he fully believes their will be a cure within 10 years. \nI have to believe that for my family. Too far. My (23) dad (58) suffers from HD and this comment helped me a lot. I have not been tested yet but I have been thinking about it a lot lately. I am thankful for medicine and hopeful that you are right. Glad to help. We are at an incredible time for treating neurological diseases. I suggest you look up the companies I have mentioned and their neuro pipelines if you want to learn more about progress in the space!", "Relationship advice? (Me venting) Long story short I met a girl and immediately fell head over heels for her. It was silly and lovey dovey but I really immediately thought I finally found the one for me. She told me she was Huntington\u2019s positive (46) 2-3 months in. I was so distraught thinking about it and she tried to end things with me saying it was not fair to me and she is sorry as she does not know how to handle relationships being positive yet. But I talked her out of it saying we do not know if we are getting married yet it is \u201ccasual\u201d now and if I do fall in love it can be ok. We kept seeing each other everyday and it was so wonderful. I was so happy and falling for her but the closer I got to fully loving her the more I became overwhelmed with grief thinking about losing her in the future. We were talking about kids one day which she is split on and I am as well but this time I said part of me would want kids so part of her would live on and I would not be alone after. After I cried while cuddling to sleep with her thinking about the future. Things were not the same after that. She felt so guilty for my grief and insecure that I will panic and abandon her with my grief. Now she is asked for a break in our relationship as she soul searches on what she wants in life relationship wise. I am obviously heart broken and posting here not sure what to do. I so badly want to talk her out of a break and for us to talk through this obstacle. I also want to respect her decision and give her space and time to think. It can help her and help me too. But what next? Sometimes I want to say I love her and idc. Part of me wanted more time. Idk how to proceed it is so difficult. However I appreciate this community I found after learning her diagnosis. I am sorry for my vent and if you are on here reading this sub. My advice, some people never find a soul mate if she truly is yours then fight for what you have\u2764\ufe0f We all die, mate. The only thing different about her from anybody else is that she has a glimpse into the future. Does not know who you get with, they could get ALS or MS or anything else down the road. If you love her, just maximize your time together and live with love. Best of luck to you both.", "Getting testing done tomorrow So it is time. \nAfter deciding with my therapist I am getting tested. 20 years of my life was and is watching my mother slowly fall apart and her side of the family trying to tiptoe around what feels like a taboo'ed word now.\nI am on my own at this point of my life. My mom is in a full care center, my dad is a deadbeat drug addict that abandoned me and my younger brother and is in and out of our lives. The only other family I have is either displaced or unknown. \nI have told my brother about my decision but he is uncomfortable with the subject and at a hundred miles away, we rarely talk at all. I have a couple friends that are going to be there to support me after I get the results as well as my S/O who wants to be there for me 100% but I see his emotions slip out whenever we really get into the subject and it hurts. \nSo what is next? Drug Managment? Support groups? Driving to UCLA every month like my parents did before they drove each other apart because of it?\nI am own my own, working almost 40hrs a week, without a car, and a 0$ copay insurance through the state for the time being but I do not know what to do after the results. \nI need advice. It is all so confusing and any advice or piece of experience is welcome. I do not have advice, I am so sorry, but I have support. This will be hard, and I am so proud of you for making the decision to do this as it takes alot of courage. Hug your so next time you see them and know that this will be something you get through together. Keep on fighting the good fight.  May I ask what made you decide to do it? I am 22yrs old with most my mum's family and herself in late stages. I struggle with the decision everyday. I am not in therapy currently. I have a s/o also. My father is still in our lives but does not have much insight he still thinks my mum is all there. When I was 19, I was going through mandatory counselling for testing but pulled out as I thought I would just kill myself if I found out I had it. I have not decided if I ever want kids yet and I guess this is largely to do with not knowing my status, among other reasons. You can do this. It sounds like you have a good support system with friends and a therapist. I am getting tested in 10 days. You can message me if you need to. I am looking into all of the drugs and treatments in development right now. the future looks a lot more promising then it did just a few years ago. The pain, guilt, and fear associated with a positive result now has a bit of hope tinged in there too!  Thank you, it is taken a lot of courage to make this desicion after a lot of people even a couple primary doctors telling me just to live my life. I think the scariest part for me right now is the needles and blood haha. I think the major point in deciding whether or not I should get treated was watching my mom these last few years just completely fall apart to the point where we are not able to understand her and she is not all there at this point having accidents in her wheelchair which is awful because she is in her late 40s. I just do not want to wait until its too late and I am there in a wheelchair. I agree! The future is beginning to look bright for the huntingtons community! Getting tested is not easy. My wife tested positive about 6 years ago. It sucks because we cannot really make many long term goals without considering her test results. On the flip side though, my wife is currently enrolled in 3 different research studies to help find treatments and hopefully a cure. I hope you do not have it, but either way, you have a lot of life to live so make the most of it! I am cheering for you. ", "Taube Philanthropies to donate $3 million to a collaboration between Stanford University School of Medicine and the Gladstone Institutes in California for Huntington's research ", "Easing in instead of diving head first. Help? I (25f) found out two years ago that my father tested positive (age 63, 39 CAG). Since then I have been living my life with the assumption that I do not have it as the alternative seemed too big to deal with. Except, I was not because I panicked every time I forgot a word, or stumbled, or did anything my brain thought was a symptom. So I have made the decision to get tested at the end of this year. \n\nPart of what informed that decision was my choice to begin therapy so that I am able to deal with my diagnosis; positive or negative. Right now, I am not able to fully confront the idea of being positive, but I am able to take more steps in that direction than I was before I started therapy. Right now, I have decided to live my life as if I were to test positive as living in limbo has honestly kept me spiraling a lot harder than I realized. \n\nAll of that leads to a seemingly insignificant question, but an important one. What things do I need to consider in terms of financial future when I comes to a positive result? I am fortunate in that my husband is in the military, so I do have good health insurance and know that money will be okay, but I also need to work so I will not go insane sitting around the house. I am more curious about life insurance, 401k\u2019s, saving plans, investing, bonds?? Things of those nature, because honestly, I have not really had the wherewithal to do anything about this kind of stuff because I thought that I would I just saved enough money I would be okay. \n\nI am aware that family planning is a big part of this, and decisions like this, but I cannot approach that subject without feeling a little broken, so I am just looking for a starting point. Thanks in advance! You sound like you have a lot already figured out. As for work given life insurance usually you are not required to divulge any medical history but outside of that you will and honestly they go deeper even asking if you have neurological diseases in your family so that usually will do it Unfortunately as everyone will die of something at some point and usually not just of old age!  I went through the same as my mom was diagnosed with HD at 70 and I was going crazy not knowing so I found out and I was gene positive no symptoms at 51. Now I think about it every waking moment, if I could go back I would not find out.  Good luck in your testing and make sure to take care of yourself! Plan as if you have it, live life as if you do not. \n\nGet everything in place as if you needed to plan for the illness later on - get life insurance, get a money market account that is pretty safe and has a good yield (you can lurk in the finance subs for that info), DRAFT A WILL (everyone should do this, sick or healthy). \n\nThere are special reproductive doctors that work with at risk patients. They can extract eggs and test them for HD without ever giving you the results if you have it or do not, then they fertilize them with your husbands sperm and implant them into you (IVF with genetic testing). You will not ever figure it out either because lots of eggs are lost over the course of IVF bc of different reasons, not just discarded bc they had the HD gene. \n\nThere are so many options out there, do not be afraid. Just plan and prepare. I come from a family of Huntington disease.  I have yet to get tested myself. I too live as if I am going to have it. I was able to get a life insurance policy through AIG at a great rate. That was probably my best move.  As far as investing, it depends on your tolerance, I would recommend OEF (iShares S&amp;P 100 ETF). It is the top 100 companies in America. Cannot go wrong with that one.

I would love to see some of your work if you are willing to share! A farm sounds lovely, there is nothing like working in the dirt to calm your nerves. Life insurance is separate from employment, right? For investing, do I need to go as far as having a company/banker manage my investments, or is there a more direct way of doing it? I learned a little bit about it in college, but I am no guru. You have no idea how much relief you have given me and my husband about the IVF treatment info. And your advice is exactly what I needed to hear for this stage in my life. Thank you. I will be referencing your comment for a long time Anytime! My wife and I did reverse IVF bc she is at risk, so she used my eggs. But we did go to a genetic counselor before hand in case she decided to use her own. If you ever want to talk I am here! As far as life insurance goes, you would have to ask H.R. Some companies offer it while others do not. Regardless of how you get a policy, I strongly recommend you get one BEFORE you get tested.

So I got diagnosed last August I am 27, and since then I have kind have been lost on what to really be putting my money towards. \n\nI am making 80k as an Electrical Engineer right now but my company does not offer any benefits at all\n\nSo here are a few questions:\n\nShould I even bother with retirement at all? \n\nIs there some kind long long term insurance I could get now that would benefit me later down the road?\n\nI had to get an individual medical insurance that has a super low deductible. (UCare Gold - $315/mo)\n\nRight now I am paying my student loans off as fast as I can. \n\nShould I be trying to find a new job with actually benefits or does it not matter so much? I am sorry i would not be able to help you, but maybe you can cross post this in r/personalfinance Retirement? Depends on what you think your life expectancy will be. How many repeats? Any symptoms yet? How long did your relatives live? Obviously, if you are unlikely to make it past 60 any tax advantaged retirement savings would be a poor choice. OTOH such accounts might have advantages in protecting wealth from medicaid or medicare. tldr; you should seriously consider a financial advisor, but they will need you to advise them on your needs.\n\nLong term care insurance is likely off the table since you have already been diagnosed. If not, it will be really really expensive.\n\nRegarding a new job with benefits, I hope someone else here can shed light. I do not know that in the early stages or pre-symptoms if there are any expenses.  (I would guess there are not. Otherwise, would not testing be more highly encouraged?). So I do not know that benefits will be that much more beneficial now than prior to your test results. Do you have a significant other that is going to be there for the long haul? Are you looking for one? Savings to help cover the cost of them caring for you after you cannot work is still useful. Maybe that is not traditional retirement accounts (but company match on a 401k can make it worth it even without aging into tax benefits). \n\nAn alternative (or addition) to traditional retirement accounts some companies offer is an HSA that rolls into investment instead of needing to be used every year. Still tax advantaged, but more easy to use for medical bills before retirement age, for instance.\n\nOr save for a few big trips or events to make the most of the life you have now. If you a very short time left, from high CAGs and do not want to burden a partner, that is probably the way to go. What are your CAG repeats?\n\nIf they are high, man, live your life. Forget about retirement. Have as much fun as you can for as long as you can.\n\nIf they are low, you might want to think about saving for retirement because it is entirely possible you will be 50-60 years old before you start seeing symptoms. What exactly do you mean by this The number of CAG repeats is a predictor of when symptoms will start and therefore life expectancy.   ( \n\nIf you have a high number of repeats and no spouse/dependents live for today and the near future. If you are low, say, &lt;45, you have a much better chance of reaching retirement age. So plan and save accordingly.\n\nAt least that is what I believe Chester was saying (do not want to speak for him) and I would second that advice. &gt;(but company match on a 401k can make it worth it even without aging into tax benefits).\n\nGood point. I understand, thank you. I am a financial consultant at a credit union in Alabama. Where are you located? My mother and two sister's both passed away with HD. I was somehow spared. If there are any specific questions please ask them. Like others have said, what are your CAG numbers? You need to act on a financial and symptomatic plan now. Yes it may be time to enjoy life to it is fullest. I have been through a few different scenarios, I hope you revisit this discussion and please ask specific questions or DM me and we can connect for easier advice. Upvoting this because at the end of the day a financial advisor is really the best option when it comes to getting advice on your finances. You do not need to give them the entire story, but if you make them aware of the timeline and what you are looking for they will know the best available tools in your region to get what you want. The sooner you start the better as well. I am located in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nCAG is 46. \n\nI guess my biggest problem right now is the fact I am an only child and my dad is close to 60. If he were to pass away in the next 10-20 years I would be left with nobody to take care of me. I am also single with no kids and I am not sure if that will ever change.  Is there some things I can do now to make sure I have a roof over my head when the time comes? I would suggest you talk to both an insurance broker and financial adviser and get some professional advice specific to your situation.\n\nI would not forego retirement savings entirely because you may need them - best case perhaps a treatment is developed and you end up living 30 years longer than expected, worst case you are forced to retire early and can use savings to help with your quality of life. As happy as we would be with effective treatment, it would suck to be a Wal-Mart greeter into your 80's because you did not save anything. The trick is balancing doing things now while you still can with saving for the future.\n\nThe (cheap) insurance ship may have sailed for you, but you may be able to find a job with good disability benefits before you become symptomatic. If you have those benefits when you are forced to quit working you may get some % of your salary paid for X years or until retirement age. 46 is not super high but it is not low either. Do not prioritize \"retirement\" necessarily, but it would not hurt to keep a nest egg in case you live longer than you expected. As everyone else has mentioned, treatments are getting better all the time. IMO and I do not do anything in financial services... you may want to just pay minimums on that student loan debt and see what happens in the next couple of years with forgiveness and/or changes to payment (possibly based on income, which would be in your favor if you are disabled early).\n\nAlso most ppl assume they will live as long as their parents and invest accordingly.  I reset my target retirement date when I tested positive, and took standard financial advice as if I were 20 years older.\n\nI did a ton of research on LTC insurance and you may not qualify if you have your HD status in medical records.  I was DQ'd just for having a brain scan.  And LTC ins may not be worth it, when you run the numbers.  For me was better, with 20 years to go, to invest/save the money instead.\n\nSave save save. And if you can, get retirement with matching. And get financial advice on what to do with it :-)\n\nBest of luck!", "The Shepherd's Gift: GM1 for HD ", "Promising results with CRISPR!  This is awesome news.  Let us hope this makes it to the public in time to save some lives.  I know lots of people in my family that time is ticking against... That is really cool! Unfortunately it is still in it is infancy and super far out for HD. It is appropriate for sickle cell because they can take the blood cells out, correct them and then put them back. They cant really do that for neurons... But, there are lots of other approaches being worked on right now and in the clinic or going to be in the clinic soon!", "This was on BB2 last night and features a family going through HD ", "I am a speech therapist currently working in a medical facility with an entire unit dedicated to individual's with HD. Hi you all, I just recently joined this sub to gain some perspectives on family members/friends of those affected with HD. I am often referred to help individuals affected by HD with their eating and swallowing. I also see that every single person I have worked with wants to communicate, whether it be through eye contact, movements, slight gestures, single words, or their own special way of communicating. There is so many different ways we can communicate! \n\nI walk into these individuals rooms every day and see their lives in pictures on their walls. Their families, places they have been, their life accomplishments, likes and dislikes. I think it is truly eye opening to see these individuals lives before this disease has brought them to the need for long term care. \n\nI do my best everyday to give ample time, take individuals out of their rooms, and even if they stare at me blankly, talk to them just as I would with anyone else. In fact, this wonderful man I work with knows my whole life story by now! \n\nPlease, feel free to provide me with education, tools, and knowledge from your point of view. I have what school and courses taught me, but I would love to add special elements that family and friends provide so I can maybe brighten someone is day even if just a little bit! \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, my heart goes out to every single one of you all \u2665\ufe0f This post brought tears to my eyes. Nearly everyone in this community will have to deal with placing their HD positive loved one in LTC and it is SO comforting to me to hear that there are workers with this level of empathy and compassion. \n\nSome suggestions I would have would be to spend time looking through those photo albums with the client. If they have home videos to watch that would be great too. My mom loves watching her favorite tv shows and movies; if you played these during your time with them this could be a great conversation starter. \n\nSeriously though, thank you for being so caring. You are amazing &lt;3 I will definitely take your suggestions and use them! I also always encourage family to bring preferred food items (I can change the texture) and favorite smells! I love that one of my guys had his favorite cologne on his night stand- he loved smelling that. I feel like a good place to come back to is always the caregivers/family too, if I was caring for your mother I would now know to turn the channel to her favorite shows while we practiced safe swallowing together. Thank you for your response and awesome information! As a healthcare worker, I so so so appreciate your kind words, that means alot! where is there an entire HD unit? Robbinsdale, MN"]
