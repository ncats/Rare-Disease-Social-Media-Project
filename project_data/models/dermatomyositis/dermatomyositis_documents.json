Crummy teeth issues seem to be very common in them. My labs are normal so I do not 100% believe I have dermatomyositis but I really do have crummy teeth. I floss daily, brush twice a day 2 mins each and they still find cavities... I am glad I have good dental insurance.

Finding something that actually helps is an amazing feeling. Thank you!!", "Dermatomyositis and Spurts of Unintentional Weight Loss I know unintentional weight loss can be a sign of Dermato but there seems to be a bizarre pattern to mine. I was around 215 one year ago when the weight sorta just randomly started to melt off. It was not super drastic at first and would typically level out in the week prior to and during my period before circling back around. I think it was about 20 total in the first 10 months but the last 2 have matched that and a bit. Im like 160 now. 15 of that was in the last like 4 weeks. \n\nI was recently hospitalized w/ a rare pneumonia tho bc my immune system sucks. (CVID) I thought it might have been that at first and I am clearly sick again, not that I know with what tho. I can only really tell bc I wake up soaking wet and my rashes have made another appearance despite treatment and that always happens when I get normal people sick. \n\nI dunno, Im a bit concerned and hate going to the Dr especially to complain about weird non consequential shit if I do not got to. I am just so so tired, you guys, which is why thought I would ask about anyone else\u2019s weight loss symptoms to see if it is like normal or whatever, I guess.", "Can someone with Dermatomyositis drive? My dad is a van driver. He got Dermatomyositis 3 months ago and was in a really bad condition where he could not even walk or speak and was hospitalized for 3 weeks doing tests and examinations. Now he is a lot better, he can walk do household work like installing a mounted flat screen tv on a wall. \n\nHe is been on disability these past 3 months. But now he wants to work again which is like 8 hours of driving. \n\nDo you guys that have Dermatomyositis drive? is that even allowed? Everyone that has DM is impacted differently. My wife was basically bedridden until starting all her meds. Even then she was miserable for a couple years until finally approved for IVIG treatments this year.\n\nBut some are barely impacted. And I am not sure what you mean by allowed. There are not any DM police.\n\n (  for more info. Their annual patient conference is a great place to meet other patients and learn more about the disease. Once they found the right med, Rituxin, I am pretty stable, up to and including working part-time.  I do have limitations about lifting things, how long I can stand, etc.  But driving has not been a problem.  Now, if I have a flare, it is in bed until it goes away so I make sure my FMLA is up to date with my employer. When I was at my worst, driving was not a good idea.  It was incredibly difficult to turn the steering wheel and keep pressure on the gas/brakes, so I did not drive.\n\nI can drive now no problem, but I will get tired if it is more than two hours or so.\n\nI hope your dad keeps improving! :) I had to drive myself to PT so I did! 3x a week got me back on my feet, but it was definitely a struggle to get back and forth. I have it chronically, but it is real mild, and I can even drive during flares. If I am having a bunch of muscle pain I might avoid driving or take some anti-inflammatory stuff if I have to. When you are strong enough to drive, you need to make some changes. Always wear sunblock and bring some with you. \n\nI always wear gloves to protect my hands from the sun. And I wear sunglasses, and some sort of hat. \n\nI have not yet but I need to tint my windows to help. When I was in my first 6 months of getting sick, I absolutely could not drive. I was basically bedridden (29 Female). After finding the right treatment, I am almost back to normal. And driving is not an issue.", "Was anyone here diagnosed with cancer? I have had DM for about 2 years and every time I go see my doctor they also tell me it is related to cancer and I should watch out for it. It is kind of nerve wracking. No but my mother was. That was a scare for me. I was told that if the Gottron Papules were odd shaped, kind of like when a mole is discolored or not round, then there would be a chance. Cancer can cause some of these symptoms, so OP I pray it is JUST DM! Yes. I had the rash for about 6 months and finally got diagnosed in May 2009. I researched DM and read about the connection with cancer. So I went to my obgyn and told her to do any testing she could. Sure enough - found uterine cancer. This led to a hysterectomy in September of that year.\nThe removal of the cancer also stopped the rash. \n\nFast forward to 2019 - found cancer in my left breast.\n\nBecause of the DM, radiation was not advisable, so I had a mastectomy. Is always on my mind, but first and foremost treat what you can see / feel. \n\nIf Doctor is giving you cookie cutter advice (2 years in they should know you know myositis has high association with cancer), get a new doc. I mean this is most positive way, many docs do not know this disease Hi. I thought that the cancer risk was only higher in the first 5 years? So, do they screen you every year for cancer?", "Any clue what this could be?? It came out of my face. my dermatologist was clueless.  Wrong sub. This is for a very specific auto immune disease.

It took an unrelated visit to her dermatologist to finally figure out what was wrong, and I think we have concluded that it stems from her time on Lipitor. She is currently on a strong dose of steroids and if those do not work, I believe the next step is chemo. \n\nAnyway, I am just hoping to get some information and support vicariously through you all. Thanks for letting me join! So, diagnosed with Dermatomyositis?  So sorry...but before chemo, there are a MILLION other possible drugs to try. I am currently on Mycophenolate and it is working well with very few if any side effects. Please explore other options. Also, REALLY clean up her diet! I found this to be a major relapse factor. Good luck!!! Hi, just found this sub, wondered if you could be more specific for foods that do and dont work for you, thanks \ud83d\ude0a That would be a loooong thread, but, if I could be brief and then leave you to do your own research, I would be happy to set you off in the right direction.\n\n1. Avoid high processed foods, like fast foods, cakes, chips and crackers, bread, etc.  Try to stay away from the following: Grains, dairy, SUGAR, and nuts.  Just for now...\n\n2.  Stick to organic proteins like chicken, fish, beef, etc. No hot dogs, ground beef (unless it is organic), processed meats like lunch meats.  Do fresh veggies too like broccoli, spinach, zucchini, etc.  If you must do a grain, keep it simple and plain, like white rice (it is gluten-free...gluten might be the issue, as it was with me).\n\n3.  DO take a probiotic EVERY DAY!  This is what I believe really really helped my gut heal.  Drink kombucha if you like it.\n\nOkay those are the top 3 things to get started on right away. To research, look up anything to do with the AIP diet, which is Auto Immune Protocol diet. It is STRICT but I stuck to it for almost 2 months before slowly adding foods.\n\nAlso, any keto-friendly diets will be helpful.  \n\nGood luck and I am praying for you! It is a tough road, but incredibly eye-opening as to how most foods that we eat are actually poisonous (over time).\n\nEDIT:  I forgot, any kind of beans are really ROUGH on your system (pinto beans, chili beans, green beans, etc.) The AIP diet is a good place to start.

Here is the thread, hopefully this helps settings expectation and improve morale :  (\n\nbest Thank you all for your responses...we will definitely look into these suggestions; I really appreciate the support! Honestly, do not get caught up on diet fads. Just generally watch your health and use common sense\n\nPrednisone is a great first step, and once stabilized generally she will begin trying other immune suppressants (sometimes called chemotherapy btw), like methotrexate or cellcept etc. \n\nIn general it may take 1-2 years to find a right treatment, so my main advice is patience! Also any new drug just read up on it, for example cellcept is best on empty stomach (many docs fail to mention)\n\nFeel free to drop me a line or comment here if you have any questions (2+ years with myositis here) Organic and Gluten free did wonders for my mother.

I am not crazy concerned, but still a bit. I am more than willing to give more info. Thanks in advance  The best way to tell is look closely at your cuticles. I would you see little blood capillaries appearing there, that is often a symptom. It is how I finally got diagnosed after years of misdiagnosis . Similar to how my wife started.

Thank you for this I appreciate it a lot. I will let you know thank you very much At least ask for a blood test. Definitely a ck level panel and cmp. If your ck levels are high, that will be a determining factor. Yeah can you update? Doctor was not too worried about it. I have had sensitive skin since I was a young kid. I was overworked and working out too much I believe and just hit a crash point for like a month.

This is according to rare diseases.org. It is difficult to find other people to talk to about this disease-even online. I was so glad to find this thread but there are not many subscribers here either. It is discouraging. How have those of you that are here dealt with this disease and are there other resources that you have found helpful? I have been lurking this subreddit for awhile.  I was diagnosed back in April with amyopathic dermatomyositis.\n\nBefore my diagnosis I was doing very poorly and no one could figure out what was wrong with me.  They told me it was Lupus for the longest time or that I had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  The inflammation and pain used to be nearly unbearable, but I have since been put on prednisone and methotrexate which have both done wonders for me (though I cannot wait to keep tapering the awful prednisone).\n\nMy doctors and my parents say my strength has been improving significantly.  I hope things are going well for you too.\n\nAs for other resources, I have not found much of anything support related for DM specifically.  Though I do frequent the Lupus subreddit here because of the crossover similarities.   Thank you for responding. I have amyopathic dermatomyositis, too. My labs were a crazy mishmash of positive dsDNA antibody, negative ANA, positive rheumatoid factor and elevated titer, etc. It kind of went on like that. I actually diagnosed myself before any labs by Googling \"what causes red knuckles\". \n\nThen, I broke out in ulcers on my hands/fingers, got purple eyelids, etc. My muscle antibodies and EMG were negative. I am on prednisone and my doctor recently put me on Plaquenil. I understand that it takes a long time to see a benefit from Plaquenil. Did your doctor put you on methotrexate to begin with? Did it take long to see an improvement? I get very discouraged because a month or so before I was diagnosed with dermatomyositis, I was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency! My adrenal gland is no longer producing cortisol. That is why I was on prednisone before the Plaquenil. \n\nI am glad that you were lurking here! I am sorry that you also have been struggling with this disease but it is good news that your medication regimen is helping.

So true", "Myositis Patient Conference Has anyone been to this before? Just wondering if it is worth going. My wife has DM, starting to get worse, or she is in a bad several months long flare up, and we were hoping their might be good info there. Or at least meeting others and seeing others might be a good support for her.\n\nSteep price tag though for attending. $540 for two tickets, along with hotel and transportation from Michigan.\n\nSo again, anyone been and what did they think?\n\nMore details:  My Mother and I went together hoping to get some insight on where I was on the spectrum. We are both nurses, so we were a little better able to understand some of the pathophysiology discussion that I could tell was going over some heads. \n\nWhat I learned was if you are on four immunosuppressants or more, then you are in, essentially, the \"worst 8%\". It was a little disheartening to hear, but I do not have lung involvement, so I am still thankful for that. The Q&amp;A portion with the physicians was cool. People were asking about things like positive dietary interventions they could do and the answer was \"do what makes you feel good\". \n\nThere were a lot of pediatric patients so it was good to talk to some parents like \"Hey, I went to school. It took me 6 years to finish, but it is possible if you are dedicated to your profession.\" I enjoyed that aspect of instilling hope in others a lot. \n\nThis conference was in my home town and less than an hour away from me, so it was worth it to pop in. Would it be worth flights and hotel accommodations? Probably not for me personally, but if it comes nearer to you, I would go. Thanks for the reply. Still on the fence about how much help that would be for her, but actively doing something always feels better than being inactive so maybe we will figure out a way to make a vacation out of the trip. Too bad it is not NoCal or Pacific NW. Or that time of year maybe even SoCal would be ok for her. Another cool part I forgot to mention was talking about research currently going on. For example, the biologics have now been found to work better for people with specific genetic markers and I found out I was on the best biologic for my kind of dermatomyositis! Pretty neat. Patient's also had to opportunity to give blood towards further research. \n\nI know that I have seen a list before of where the annual conference is with 2 or 3 years in advanced planned, but I cannot find it! Maybe it might be worth the wait to go to somewhere where you can make a nice vacation out of it. :) Thanks for the info! We have thought of going several times but my DM seems to mostly be under control with Rituxin so have put it off. Awesome for you!", "Do relapses occur? Basically my dad has been takings his meds as treatment the past 6 months. (Before he started his treatments 6 months ago, he was bedridden for 3 weeks at the hospital taking tests). He got a lot better since than but now he has been very sick the past 3 days. His back, stomach really hurts among other things. He asked me a question about his finances today that leads me to think that he does not think he will make it to 2021..... \n\nHe has a Catscan tomorrow even though he has taken many in November and December of 2019. (He has been avoiding the hospital these past months due to COVID)\n\nMy question is, does this happen to you guys? Will there be a time where you feel really Ill after a period of time even though you are taking all your meds? And you just get over it? I am not sure if this is common or not with this illness. Yes, it happens.  DM is easily triggered by other things. I was hospitalized for four days last year when a kidney infect caused the DM to flare, which resulted in my stomach lining getting inflammed.  I just spent three weeks with erythema nodosm as well as all the muscle pain.  The EN was caused by the DM which was triggered by a UTI. Hope things are going well with you \n\nAs far as your question - relapses can happen especially early on (first couple years). Also sometimes if he is tapering down on prednisone you can have side effects like fatigue, muscle stiffness, etc\n\nThat being said, a flare up does not mean something is worse or you are going to die, mainly need to usually bump up prednisone and tweak meds. \n\nWhat I would watch for with your father is signs of depression, this disease is a mental burden and also the inflammation aspect can cause odd mental issues. For me personally I experience some moderate to severe depression symptoms during flare ups.\n\nIn general - make sure he is keeping n close touch with rheumatologist (even with covid!), keep an eye out for lung issues (coughing, shortness of breath etc), and also work with primary care doc on mental support.\n\nIt is a lonely disease sometimes and it can sneak up on you I would echo the other commenters. It takes a long time for the disease to stabilise and for you to get used to the meds and such. Maybe see if he can get some support from an exercise physio or massage therapist to help with aching muscles. Keep an eye out for underlying infections and always reach out to your GP as a first line of treatment. Thanks for the reply, it turns out he developed the shingles which spread VERY rapidly the last 2 days, hopefully with the medicines the doctor prescribed today he will get better Thanks for the reply, it turns out he developed the shingles which spread VERY rapidly the last 2 days. Hopefully with the medicines the doctor prescribed today he will get better", "Opinion/experience request post - does this sound like JDM/DM? Hey everyone, another one of those posts looking for opinions. I know ultimately I just need to wait for the specialist, but I have been sitting here in pain for months now (rheumatology appointment in April) and want to educate myself as much as possible. I have access to research papers through my university library so I try to find most of my info through that, but research unfortunately does not adequately describe the nuance of lived experience! Thanks in advance for your thoughts and I apologize for this being an absolute essay. Just wanted to give detail. I have been really ill since May and I am just sitting here feeling like my body is progressively failing/I am going to die most days, so I am trying to figure out whatever the heck my body is freaking out about! \n\n**Tests**: The only abnormal bloodwork I have had thus far is elevated antinuclear antibodies: 1:80 at the beginning of all this, re-tested twice at 1:320, homogenous all times. My white blood cell count has pretty consistently dropped since I first has it tested in January from the top of normal down to the bottom, but all within what is considered normal. Other tests that have been done and are within normal range are: Complement 3/4, RF, CRP a very unremarkable 0.5 (normal &lt;4.8)  dsDNA, ENA\u2019s negative. Cardiolipin Ab IgG/IgM normal, Creatinine, GFR within good range. Vitamin B12/D normal, electrolytes, hemoglobin, ferritin normal (but actually kind of high for someone who basically was not eating/is a vegetarian and I know ferritin can act as an inflammation marker). TSH has been tested in the past on a couple occasions, was 2.7/2.4 (lab range around &lt;5 though I have heard about the controversy on this), other hormones have been tested in the past and apparently unremarkable, though I am still skeptical because I have mild hirsutism and inexplicable weight fluctuation.\n\n**History**: I am 28/F, not on any meds. I had been experiencing right sided neck pain for the past three years and it kept getting more frequent, but I went back to school and figured it was all the computer work. I also had spells of itchiness all over my body. Then my vision started to go kind of blurry, like my eyes had difficulty focusing. In February I noticed particularly bad fatigue. I am always tired but this was impacting my ability to cognitively function. I should mention during all this time I was steadily gaining weight (or at least swelling..I do not weigh myself but my clothes were not fitting and my face looked swollen) despite vigorously exercising for at least an hour a day and not overeating (I never eat out and eat very healthy too). \n\nThen in May, I had a two week long cold and a few days later the left side of my body went tingly and weak. I think overall I was weak but I had these specific spots in my bicep and my thigh that hurt alongside the weakness so I noticed the left more. Went to the ER, cleared stroke and for MS, referred to a neurologist and declared fine. Had a CT angiogram with iodine contrast dye, and a few hours later the muscles all over my body (like everywhere, random small muscles on the head, back, arms, legs, feet) started twitching, but the neurologist unfortunately did not see this symptom because it started later. Also had an MRI which came back fine. The weakness seemed to progress for the next couple of months and kind of stabilized, and overall now I just feel symmetrically weak but I still get those weird specific pains in my bicep and thigh if I use them. Though the muscle twitching is everywhere, some of it seems to be evoked by using the muscle. \n\n**Symptoms I have noticed since:** Lost about 20 pounds since the angiogram even though I stopped exercising, lost my appetite though. Facial redness/rash (maybe heliotrope because my eyelids look lightly red/purple compared to the rest of my face colour, but all my rashes except the chest one are pretty faint tbh), rash on my chest in v neck area, mild redness/dryness on my elbows and ankles, redness on my knuckles that comes and goes, migratory mild joint pain and nail pitting, joint clicking (basically a million things start cracking when I move), hair thinning, incredible neck pain which physio deemed weakness. Increasing fatigue, a random swelling muscle on the top of the left side of my foot, tingling mostly in my feet and arms when I lie down at night, I am a singer so I am pretty hyper aware of my throat area, but my voice definitely fatigues a lot easier than it did. I have realized recently that I am pretty sure weakness/symptoms are induced by UV rays. Even a moment without sunscreen even on a cloudy day, or under fluorescent lighting seems to make my muscles start to hurt and feel weak. It is become more symmetric now and I notice both arms and legs are weak. Though I could be wrong and it could just be exertion or whatever. \n\nI did not recognize it at first but the more symptoms that appear, the more I remember that I had many of these as a child. Hair loss, mild joint pain and nail pitting, stomach aches, days where it felt difficult to go up the stairs and I had trouble breathing (sensation of \u201ccannot get enough air\u201d), and an overall feeling of weakness that stayed with me up until now but nothing bad enough to bother me too much, except the breathing thing. I have always wondered why it feels as though my muscles do not work, like they will not engage or something, despite the dance/yoga/rowing/whatever other sport I tried and gave up on because I could not improve. \n\n**What makes me suspicious of JDM** is that I had some symptoms/attacks as a kid and most of the symptoms seem based around muscles, my persistent weakness (been tested for anemia so many times), and the v rash seems to be pretty specific. Also, I had a white spot appear under the surface of my bottom lip, reminding me of calcifications, and I had white spots show up when I was a kid on the pads of a couple of my fingers. They went away though. \n\n**My questions** to the community are I suppose if this even sounds at all like DM or JDM? Do your symptoms of weakness seem to get worse with UV/fluorescent exposure or wax and wane in nature? I know that the weakness with DM is supposed to be progressive and debilitating, but I have heard that there are experiences with milder muscle weakness? I mean, I hardly made it home from the bus stop the other day I felt so weak and when I did I was shaking, but again, I did not feel the same the next day. The only other thing that I know is photosensitive is lupus, so either way I think I am in for not a great diagnosis unless I am imagining the photosensitivity. Any tests you think I should request from my GP until I can see the specialist?  \n\n\nAny other thoughts are welcome, and thanks very deeply for taking the time to read this. I have been so amazed in my lurking through the autoimmunity subreddits at the generosity from folks who are dealing with so much who find the energy to read through the panicked and lost posts made by those of us wading in the murky waters of non-diagnosis land. It is really, truly, appreciated. Personally this doesnt sound like JDM to me. It DEFINITELY sounds like some kind of autoimmune issue though. \n\nI was first diagnosed at 9, the year before that my symptoms began and continued to worsen (I was misdiagnosed many times, it was esp. rare back in the mid 90s) and it got to the point I was unable to walk, breath, or eat without assistance or frequent breaks. I never felt any let up in these symptoms either, they just got worse until I ended up in a wheelchair and on a heart and lung machine while I was admitted to CHLA for 3 months. Intense treatment and medication was needed to put me into remission (and that took 3 tears) or I would have died from malnourishment or the heart and lung involvement. \n\nWhen I came out of remission as an adult, it was different but still similar. Once the muscle weakness started it just went down hill from there and there is no recovery day. \n\nThe rashes are similar but those are seen in many autoimmune diseases. As for bloodwork, that shit goes off the charts. WBCs, creatine ratio, liver enzymes, antibodies, etc they all go extremely high with this disease. \n\nSo while I dont think you have JDM, or at least not a typical version, it does sound like you have similar symptoms that fall under the umbrella of autoimmune disease. So seeing a rheumatologist should definitely help. Good luck! Thanks for your input! I am so sorry your symptoms have been so intense, that must be difficult. \n\nGood to know re: rashes. I had a hard time figuring out how specific that rash really is. \n\nThanks again for sharing your story, wishing you all the best! If you do have DM or some form of autoimmune\u00a0disorder, you need to get it diagnosed.  See my other post ", "What do you think? Hey guys! I am new to the group. I was diagnosed with DM when I was 3. I am now almost 25. I have lived with the disease forever. The last couple of years I have felt pretty good. I have not had a major flair up since high school. I used to get the rash on my wrist and my knuckles. \n\nWhen I turned 21, my rheumatologist told me that the disease can go dormant and he then diagnosed me with fibromyalgia. \n\nFlash forward to now: I have had a nasty rash on the back of my neck for a solid year and a half. Nothing helps. It gets worse with stress. And it is spreading. It is not up inside my hair at the base of my scalp. \n\nMy dermatologist said that it looks like stress induced eczema, but it is not going away. \n\nI am worried that this means that the DM is back. I am also now wondering if it ever went away. \n\nWhat do you all think? Am I just crazy for thinking it is back? Or should I be a little more concerned?\n\nThanks guys! I do not think it ever really goes away, to be honest. I think we just get lucky sometimes and the demon stays hidden. \n\nI would err on the side of caution. Can your doctor order a lab work up to check your muscles? I would start there. I go to see my rheumatologist in a couple weeks. I will ask him to do some new bloodwork then. Thank you! I would think if it is just the rash and it is not getting worse or spreading rapidly that it may really just be eczema. My boyfriend was diagnosed last year (he was 31 at the time) and although his rash was the first symptom, the muscle soreness came on pretty sudden. That for us was the big tell. Of course it sounds like each case is different... Hope this helps and wishing you the best! My flare-ups start exactly that way - with a rash on the back of neck. It is very much stress-related in my opinion - physical (like heat rash) or emotional stress. It usually spreads down my back in itchy, blistery fashion. Thanks for telling me! The rash always seems to get worse before I end up with a ton of pain. Other issue is that my doctor did the blood panels and everything came back normal. So now I am super confused.", "This red rash is also on my other hand as well it was more red when I first got it and it is swelled down a lot since this picture.  I am also going to post the symptoms I have been experiencing for the last two years maybe they match up maybe they do not I might as well share what else is happening anyways. \n\n\nIt all started two years ago not sure what causes it might be nonstop stress for weeks on end never ending or something else. My first symptom was an electric shock that I felt in the back of my head and throughout my body. Never felt anything like it before. Then when I was outside at my cousins football game I can only describe it like an axe came down on my head and open up this pain on my scalp. So dealing with I thought was headaches weeks on end and going to a doctor found it was actually seborrheic dermatitis. So that took months but it finally cleared up. When I thought it was over More symptoms followed after this loss of appetite and feel very gassy, back and joint pain along with shoulder blade pain  frequently my back cracks now almost 24/7 with pain following it after.

When I get out of the shower my hands and feet are bright red. There is also a purple like bruise on my foot looks like a blood clot. Heart palpitations, And my overall body temperature I feel cold not warm like I used too. I also have twitchs and muscle spasms mainly in my back. My newest symptom is chest pain that will not go away like someone is sitting on my chest. As for mental symptoms anxiety, depression, and OCD. During these two years I have went to doctors to get blood work done and everything came back fine same with a cat scan and mri on my brain. I think I should get an X-ray on my back though since that is my most frequent symptom. I know there is something off about my body because I have never felt this way in my entire life and I am maybe missing a certain test which can give me the answers I am looking for. I should also mention I have vivid dreams almost every single night since two years ago  Is good set of criteria to diagnose myositis\n\nWould recommend seeing a rheumatologist, some of your issues as familiar to me as secondary to the myositis (circulation issues, heart issues), but honestly best to be checked out as this disease mimics many others\n\nAlso just take care of yourself and watch your mental health, myositis or. It your are not alone and will feel better", "Is this the beginning?  Went to a md urgent care earlier for these bumps that have quickly appeared on 6 of my fingers. He thinks of have dermatomyositis. He wants to me to see a dermatologist. This is nowhere near as bad as the pictures that come up in google but is this what it looks like to start? I do not feel weak or overly tired. I walk 30k steps a day on average and work out intensely multiple times a week.\n\nAny input I am sort of freaking out! I would be surprised if you were diagnosed after 1 visit with no systems other than a rash. It took my wife over a year to get a diagnosis, with a variety of truly terrible symptoms and a multitude of tests. She is not even really diagnosed. They just \"cannot rule it out\" and it is \"likely\". Because they have ruled out pretty much everything else and her disease responds to the same treatment.\n\nI have had a rash numerous times on my hands from chemicals, plants and who knows what else. I am not saying you do not have it, I am just saying it is kind of early to freak out. The paperwork the doctor gave me sounded kind of morbid. It also included a list of \u201cthis actress died at 50, this pro football player died at 29 from heart problems caused by the disease.\n\nThat does make me feel a little better thanks.\n\nI am a fairly bad skin and nail picker and I always assumed the redness at the ends of my fingers was from a lifetime of picking and biting. And much of the redness at the base of my fingers is scarring.\n\nWith the bumps, it does not feel like it is my hand or joined that hurt but the bumps themselves. And what really made me decide I needed to get it checked out what on the knuckle that has it the worst, there seems to be a hard protrusion forming. 1. Do you have any rashes anywhere other than your knuckles?\n\n2. Are your muscles hurting/ or sore?\n\n3. When did you notice this hand rash? \n\nI will try to help the best I can. I just got diagnosed a few days ago. No other rashes, no other soreness. \n\nSo for as long as I can remember I had two weird patches of skin on two of my knuckles on my left hand. I always though they were some type of warts. 2 weeks ago is about when these bumps starting forming, and I believe the patches I thought were warts and these new bumps are the same.\n\nThe two fingers that are the worst are sore and tight when I wake up currently but subsides shortly after getting up Again, I am not saying it is not, I just would not panic yet. My wife has had it for 2 years now. She takes 20 pills a day. Which ones vary every 4-6 months as they change to balance out side effects. She now has a sun allergy and gets severe itchiness and pain when she sweats. And yet we still took a trip to China and Japan this year. She hiked the Great Wall in 100F temperatures. If this is your diagnosis, it sucks and a lot of family and friends will not understand. But it changes your perspective, also. You stop worrying about accumulating useless crap and start living life. Heck, if you are lucky all you have is a rash but you still come away appreciating life more. I am really keeping my fingers crossed, thank you for your words. There is a huge spectrum in how dermatomyositis (DM) presents. Some people can have skin only disease and some have a mix of skin disease and muscle disease with weakness and fatigue. \n\nIn my experience (I am a dermatologist and my wife has had DM for 17 years) most urgent care and emergency room doctors do not have much of clue about the disease. Your best bet is to see a dermatologist who can do a biopsy and run some bloodwork if needed. Rheumatologists also manage DM patients. You may want to go to an academic medical center if you have access to one. \n\nThere are lots of other skin conditions that can show up on the hands. A dermatologist will be able to think about all the options and look for signs of DM in other places you may not think to check. ", "How I put my juvenile dermatomyositis into remission Hey everyone. I wanted to share my story and experiences with juvenile dermatomyositis and how I put the disease into remission. :) \n\nI want to give hope to those who are struggling and suffering from DM. Hopefully my method works for you too!\n\nI fell ill at the age of 6 and got diagnosed with JDM two years later. I developed a rash on my arms and legs, lost a lot of weight, had very limited energy and lost mucle mass and strength. \n\nThroughout my adolescence doctors put me on several meds. A high dosage of prednisone (hello moonface!), methotrexate and eventually IVIG treatments. At 11 years old the JDM was relatively manageable thanks to the IVIG treatments though unfortunately, I relapsed at age 20. \n\nFor reasons unknown, my leg started to ache badly. It got so bad, I got to a point where I could not walk properly anymore. The rash on my arms returned, I looked pale, my whole body hurt and I was bedridden too for 3 years.\n\nMy doctor increased the dosage of methotrexate to 20 mg. I had to inject it weekly. They also gave me a treatment of rituximab. None of it worked. \n\nFinally, at 24, they put me on IVIG treatments and I felt amazing again. My new found happiness was shortlived as I had to receive the IVIG treatment every 6 months and every time I relapsed, it hit me hard. I also still used 20 mg of methotrexate weekly and I was starting to get sick of being nauseous (pun not intended.)\n\nThis went on for another two years until finally I did something that still works for me up until this very day. I know it sounds ridiculous but by changing my diet, I put the disease into full remission. I am still skeptical but I never thought I would hear my doctor say to me that it looked as if I had grown past the JDM. \n\nHere is what I did. I stopped using methotrexate altogether, I do not recommend to stop using your meds but I did because I always thought it did not really work for me. \n\nMy diet is both super easy and restricting. I only eat meat and drink water, sparkling water, tea and coffee. \n\nI mostly eat beef, chicken and sometimes fish (prawns and tilapia.) I have been on the carnivore diet for 8+ months now. I do not cheat with my meals, I am off all my meds and feeling better than ever. \n\nYou can also read my story ( If you want to know more about the carnivore diet, visit meatheals.com,  or follow Shawn Baker on Twitter/YouTube and  just to name a few. \n\nAgain, I know how weird it sounds and I do not know if I will ever reintroduce vegetables or fruit but for now, eating nothing but meat is my safe bet. \n\nThank you for reading my story. I hope this will work for you too and I wish you all well.  Thank you for sharing. Did you ever try keto?  Yes, I went keto first for a month or so! I ate vegetables then still and also cheese. Now it is meat only.  I am guessing it was still bad under keto, but did you see improvements? No, it was not bad with me being keto. I actually had no symptoms. I relapsed every 6 months and the last time I got the IVIG treatment, they increased the dosage so I could last at least 11 months. Normally, I would relapse around the end of October this year (it would have been 12 months since my last IVIG treatment then). That did not happen. What happened instead was my doctor telling me my bloodwork looks fine and no IVIG was needed! :)  ", "Looking for opinions on this photo while I wait for my doctor's appointment. Hi guys,\n\nI am a 30 year old female. I have been feeling unwell for months, but about 3 weeks ago my right hand has started getting really crusty, sometimes bleeding. There is no itch whatsoever. \n\nOther symptoms I have been experiencing are bruising (you can even see one on my hand in the photo), hair loss, weakness in general, and weight loss.

(  \n\n\nI have a doc appointment scheduled, but the soonest I can get in is Feb 11th unless I want to see a nurse practitioner, which I do not. I was googling and came across dermatomyositis. It intrigued me because I notice my hand/knuckles have never itched whatsoever, so I am ruling out some of the more common issues I am stumbling across. I do remember having some really dry red skin on my hand when I was much younger, I would say middle school aged. Never had any issues since, but I am not sure if this is the same thing.   \n\n\nHas anyone here had something similar to my photos? I am worried and just looking for any opinions from folks that have this issue. Thanks in advance for any responses I might receive. :-) Hello!\n\nI am sorry that you have been feeling unwell.  :(  I am not knowledgeable enough to say if it might be DM or not, but I can give you my experience.  However it is very rare, so it is more than likely (and hopefully) something else.\n\nMy illness started out like your symptoms other than the bruising.  One of the earliest things I noticed though was these weird red sort 'loops' around my fingernail cuticles.  My hair was falling out everywhere and got noticeably thin and I could not do things I could normally do (like play piano or walk up stairs).  The weakness part was debilitating, at my worst I could barely swallow food.\n\nHere is the picture of my hands a few months after I began to feel sick.  There was a lot of inflammation along with the rash that started on the joints closest to my finger tips and then spread further up my hands.\n\nI also attached my hands now, so you can maybe see those red loopy things I talked about. They are dilated capillaries iirc.\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure if this helps or not, but I hope you get the answers you want in February. I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good Thank you soooo much for your response.   \n\n\nI should also add I get very nauseous often, and it does not sound like other folks around here do.

I do not see them in the photo, but I am not sure know what exactly to look for.   \n\n\nI appreciate you answering so quickly, considering how inactive this sub is. You are welcome!\n\nYeah, I do not get nauseous at all from DM.  Nausea is such an awful feeling though, I am sorry that you have to deal with it so often.\n\nIf you look up \u2018dilated nail capillaries\u2019 you should be able to find pictures with the abnormalities that I am talking about.

I have been taking 1 cortisone tablet a day and it seems to be working better. What can I expect in the long run. I am also a type 1 diabetic... Which makes it harder.\n\nIt sucks and it feels like a never-ending thing. I would also like people to share more experiences since this is a rare thing and I think that healthy people have a hard time understanding.\n\nI am posting this because it is the first time I have the guts to share. I have not read all the posts in this subreddit yet, but will try to.  All I can say is hang in there. My wife was diagnosed. I have watched her go from loving the beach to having to cover up almost completely just to do yardwork or go kayaking.\n\nShe is dealt with hair loss, itching, muscle aches in various amounts. As well as other side effects as her meds get switched around every 3 - 6 months.\n\nWhy am I saying all this? Because in spite of it, she, and therefore we, have embraced life more. We took a trip this year to China and Japan. Though she struggled, we walked up and down steps along miles of the Great Wall, through the Forbidden City and Summer Palace, castles in Japan...\n\nWe went to DC and saw the museums and monuments. Go kayaking and hiking as much as she is able.\n\nYou have hard times ahead of you. But you also have opportunity. You realize how precious your time and health and mobility are.\n\nWe do not accumulate material things anymore, buy the latest gadgets or live to work. We live the hell out of life.\n\nI agree others will not understand. They will offer you advice about finding different doctors or just not understand the weariness, soreness, itchiness or anything else.\n\nBut you do not have to live by their rules and expectations. You just have to live your best life.\n\nDo not know if this helps. Hope it does. My wife is not on Reddit but I can have her post on here if you want. She is 44 so a bit different perspective maybe. It totally sucks. I had a really rough first year or two, and then physically started feeling better most of the time. Anyone who tells you it could be worse, at least you are still alive, things happen for a reason - tell them as kindly or unkindly as you like to shove it. Those kinds of statements were really hard for me to deal with. If you can be direct and respectful with what you need from people, that is great, and if not, that is okay too. Take care of yourself!  Thank you so much, exactly and wow :)  We started to bonsai and we also have the dream to travel to Japan and China. Our world has also changed, from staying in an apartment on the 6th floor and basically being gamers we switched to being outdoor people even if my husband has to get me out in a wheelchair.\n\nIt helps to get replies, not feeling so alone in the world and very inspiring to read about your travels.

Mine have been for the past two or three days now and I am wondering if that is why. Definitely.  I get quite stiff in my hands, feet and legs. Ah that sucks Hope you find relief.

Was almost like my muscles did not want to stretch (i.e. crossing my legs was near impossible)\n\nReally only cleared up for me when I got disease under control (tried narcotics, muscle relaxers, cannabis, cymbalta, celebrex and they did very little for stiffness). Really after my second round of Rituximab is when I noticed the stiffness resolve mostly (still have stiff hands in mornings sometimes)\n\nIs kind of funny because as time went on, the stiffness was one of the things that impacted my daily life the most, so I can totally see why you asked Sometimes I have difficulty even just closing them.

And suddenly my whole body started to hurt and every day i begun to lose strength. It was very painful and i became useless. I could not even touch my head, my muscles were dying. I was not able to dress myself, wash my hair, eat (i could not swallow) and even talk well cause my tongue could not move.\nI got diagnosed after 2 months of exams, it was easy for the doctors cause my symptoms appear all at once and very aggressive way. I started treatment: corticosteroids, cell cept, plaquinol, exercise was banned also.\nNow, after one year and a half later i recovered my strength (not 100%) but I am back. I still hace to be careful, there are painful days, sometimes my tongue still feels strange and if i walk too much i stop feeling my legs.

So, after years of back and forth I was finally diagnosed with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder. However, the past year I have noticed rashes getting worse. I have had these bumps on my knuckles for a while, but they seem to be getting worse and are now spreading to my other hand.\n\nI have redness all over my shoulders and upper back as well as across my chest and stomach. Doctors have brushed off the knuckles before as eczema - but the actual bumps do not really look like any eczema I have seen. I do have weakness in my thighs (struggle with stairs) and I struggle with holding arms above my head, especially when drying my hair - but I thought this was related to my hypermobility.\n\nWhat do you think, worth getting checked or just eczema?\n\n Go to a rheumetologist. It looks like my hands when I had DM. \n\nIn my opinion, a GP cannot diagnose serious skin ailments such as PGP or Dermatomyositis. In my case, I saw a Dermatologist I completed their recommended treatment, then my General Practioner (GP). After speaking with my GP, he suggested another Dermatologist.\u00a0\n\nI completed treatment with that Dermatologist, which still did not identify the problem. I asked the last Dermatologist he suggests as the next step, he recommended either Standford's Dermatology clinic or UCSF's Dermatology clinic. I choose UCSF and but I needed to wait for the referral from the last Dermatologist. I stayed on the phone in the parking lot calling each office until I got the appointment. I saw the director of the department; he knew what it was but had to have the diagnosis confirmed. This confirmation required testing and involvement of multiple departments: Neurology, Rheumatology, and lab testing. To get this done quickly resulted in hospital admission. To get a Neurologist or Rheumatologist appointment would take months to see either as an outpatient. Also, treatment required three infusions for 3-4 hours (one each day) plus medications and followups. I was in the hospital for 4 nights.\u00a0 DM is an autoimmune disorder which is why with the correct paperwork admission was easy. \n\nI am lucky I have great insurance, and I am near two exceptional teaching hospitals.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI had all the symptoms, muscle weakness, itching, inflammation, and fatigue. My hands look similar.\u00a0\n\nI do not know where you live or who your doctors are but I would check the local teaching hospitals to see if they have a dermatology department; ask if they have seen\u00a0Dermatomyositis?\u00a0\n\nIf you still strike out, call UCSF's Dermatology dermatology department and ask them where they would recommend near you? 415-353-7800\n\nBelieve me, going through all the treatments was hell with the other Dermatologist with no improvement.\u00a0\n\nThe itching was so bad that I wore long sleeve shirts and socks on my hands.  See if over the counter cortisone helps on your hands and anywhere else until you get accurately diagnosed.\u00a0You want ointment not creams if you can get them over the counter.\n\nI hope you get diagnosed and treatment. I am in the UK so the process is a lot different unfortunately. I have to go to the GP and hope they think it is serious enough to seek a referral to a specialist.\n\nThanks so much for the advice.

Threw away my blankets/sheets/pillows. Bought new clothes/bra/underwear/slippers/socks/blanket/sheets and pillows after I picked up my prescriptions. Cleaned furniture. \n\nTook a shower and used cream everywhere. I am a 36 year old woman and my mom helped me, that is how important it was to make sure it was all over. \n\nItch stopped for a few days and then got 10x worse.\n\nWent to dermatologist.\n\nAsked me questions, I brought a time line of the progression of the rash along w my current med list.\n\nShe checked my whole body except my breasts and pelvic area because it was not necessary. \n\nShe did a scratch test on my back and it immediately welted and was hot/itchy. She took a picture of it.\n\nI have Dermatomyositis. Most likely from asthma since 6mo old and allergies since I can remember. My mom told me when I was younger she took me to be allergy tested because I was always sick. She said I was allergic to different foods but grew out of it. \n\nPretty much anything I touch, my skin is allergic to ranging in severity/duration from a little bit to A LOT. \n\nSo the NP (who was not only very smart but also really nice, and it was easy to explain things to her without feeling judged or \u201cwrong\u201d). I asked if it was from recently  starting Prozac and she said no. RX\u2019d Claritin in the am and Zyrtec at bedtime. Also a steroid cream Triamcinolone acetonide 0.5% apply up to 4x a day. \n\nIt is been day one and my skin already feels completely different, and finally I have relief from constantly hot itchy painful hives. \n\nShe also gave me a list of good skincare products that are for sensitive skin...\n\nI will post a picture of it. After I figure out how lol :/", "Do not know what this is  I keep popping this blackhead and all the black stuff comes out but within 3 weeks or so there is  more and the cycle repeats any help would be appreciated. It is on the side of my knees btw Do you have dermatomyositis", "DM since 18 and am now 29 Hello all, seems like a mellow sub so im not sure who here is active. Anyways I will just throw my story out here in case anyone stumbles across it and hopefully it helps. Pretty much jut going to give a biography of what my treatments have consisted of and where I am now. \n\nSo as the title says I started getting the symptoms of DM around 18 fresh out of high school. It sucked as I was very active, surfed every day, basketball, football, baseball etc. Anyways went to the docs for almost a year and half bouncing around trying to figure out what was wrong with me. Only symptoms I had at the time were swelling and my cpk levels were off the charts! So it was very hard to narrow down. Anyways finally after doing tons of tests and biopsies I was finally diagnosed and was right around 20 yrs old. \n\nAfter that my doc prescribed 60 mg of prednisone, after awhile on that he also added cellcept (mycophenolate). \n\nSlowly my prednisone was tapered down and I am currently on 9mg of prednisone and have stayed on the same amount of cellcept. My CPK numbers tended to stay in the 6-800 range. \n\nThen about a year ago I was put on a new treatment plan to coincide with the current one. This consisted of immunoglobulin infusions. Of all the treatments I had tried this one brought my CPK numbers well within normal range. After one treatment my numbers dropped to the 2-300 range. Later they fell to around 150. The drawback was my insurance covered 80 percent which left me with a 2500 dollar bill. The good news was this is all I had to pay for the year so if I scheduled them at the beginning of the year then I would get charged 2500 and every treatment after that would be free for me. These treatments happened once a month for 2 consecutive days. I eventually stopped doing them because it was just so expensive for me. The treatments without insurance are around 30k so 2500 was a steal but it was still a lot to do. Secondly these infusions lasted all day long 8hrs. If you need immediate help I would have to say I recommend these infusions since they do help drastically. Also another note about these infusions is they are pumping so much water into your system you are constantly peeing. This causes you to lose a lot of electrolytes. This caused me to receive pretty bad headaches afterwards. So I started drinking coconut waters while I was doing my infusions to help replenish my electrolytes. This definitely helped with the headaches so keep that in mind if you do this treatment. \n\nLastly regarding immunoglobulin infusions. In case you are wondering, immunoglobulin is naturally occurring in our bodies. Basically it is your immune system. That is about the best way I can describe it. It is how the mom gives here immune system to her baby when pregnant with immunoglobulin. So again basically they are infusing you with a healthy immune system. I could be wrong and I am no doctor but from all the reading I did that is what I got from it.\n\nThroughout all these years I have lost pretty much all upper body strength to the point where it is hard to even do normal things like wash the dishes or raise my hand. \n\nI finally had enough and recently have gone to see a doctor in San Diego who did a complete blood workup and when I say complete I mean COMPLETE! He found I have a mycoplasma infection. He is on a very prestigious board of doctors specializing in rheumatology and arthritis. He also prescribed many supplements I was missing and needed to stay healthy while suffering from DM. \n\nHe stated that the work he is done and testing that has occurred regarding DM has shown that in rats and mice whenever DM is present a mycoplasma infection is also present. The thing with mycoplasma is it has no cell wall and can pass wherever it chooses and cause whatever problems it wants. Because of this doctors are finding that if they can eliminate the mycoplasma infection DM usually goes away. So he put me on an antibiotic along with another supplement to drive the mycoplasma out of wherever it is hiding so the the antibiotics can kill it. I am not sure if this will work but this is where I am at in my life so far. I go to see him in January again and see how things are coming along and will update this post.\n\nAlso some other things I looked into regarding DM that may also help. Water fasting may help. They are finding when someone does a 7 day water fast your body actually goes into a self healing mode. Many people have also cured themselves of DM by water fasting however you will most likely need to do a doctor supervised water fast due to the dangers involved. Secondly after the water fast a complete diet change is required. Basically a paleo diet is needed. \n\nRegarding a paleo diet, if you can afford it, it is actually a very good diet to be on when suffering from DM. A paleo diet along with a workout regimen can really help you stay healthier with DM. I unfortunately could not stick with it because of the costs involved in eating all organic foods, gym membership and other bills. However I am hoping to be able to get back to that schedule soon. \n\nLastly before I close this post out, I feel it is important to whoever comes across this to understand that when they are offered treatments from doctor always try the most natural ones/least harmful first if you can. For instance I too was given the option to take methotrexate and some other drugs which were for cancer patients but I rejected those and instead stayed with prednisone and cellcept along with the immunoglobulin. While prednisone is not great and cellcept too, they have been less harmful to me in the long run vs the other options. Immunoglobulin especially is very good since it is something our bodies already make. So if you can please consider natural options or at least the less harmful ones first and you will do yourself a favor in the long run. \n\nBest wishes to all on here, again I am new here and I hope this post is helpful in some way to any of you.  Have you been to the doctor yet? Very curious if the antibiotic is working. Unfortunately while I visited him the first time he looked at my lung function tests and speculated that something was wrong. So after visiting him and being out on his treatment plan I went to the doctors up here to look at my lungs and it turns out I have interstitial lung disease caused by the DM. So now I am off the antibiotics he prescribed while I try to get a hold on the lung disease. However doing more research I have found that most auto immune diseases originate in the gut. So I am off all gluten and dairy and sticking to anti inflammatory foods. I am also drinking probiotics as well. If you would like more info I would gladly share it with you. I just do not want to spend a ton of time giving out info if someone is I interested is all. But I am more than happy to help and pass along info I have learned.  Gluten free &amp; dairy free will for sure help calm down the inflammation. Have you had an allergy testing? If not try looking into it. My husband did (has DM for 3 years now) and found out he was allergic to weird stuff. We thought we were being healthier eating more oats, almonds, cashews but turns out he had a mild allergy to all of those. Also has your doc done any testing for possible Lyme's?  I am actually making an appointment this next week to do an allergy test. I am sure there will be stuff in there haha. But I have been pretty strict so far with my diet. All organic, non gmo, gluten free and dairy free. So it is pretty restricted. However I am still doing the allergy test to see if anything else pops up in there. I believe when I was first diagnosed with DM I was tested for Lymes but I will have to check. ", "Tiredness/Grumpiness Hi,\n\nComing on two years now (18 with diagnosis), so I am slowly being weined off steroids.  I only drop 1mg/day each time, just gone from 5 to 4.  And I am tired and grumpy and irritable.  My legs ache.\n\nI wake up as tired as I go to bed. And I am awful to be around.\n\nI just wondered what other people's experiences were.  And if you found anything that helped?\n\nCheers. I get irritable and achey every time I go lower on prednisone as well.  I typically just warn my family that I am tapering and try my best to take deep breaths or remove myself from the situation if I am getting frustrated/angry.\n\n\nThere is nothing I found that really helps.  It is just too bad it turns me into a total grouch because that is not what I am like normally at all.  You are not alone in feeling like a big grump. I have had to chip off halves and quarters before on steroid weans. Sometimes a turtle's pace will get rid of the grumpies! Thanks for reassuring me I am not alone!\n\nI did alternate days of 4 and 5 for 2 weeks. It is amazing the difference 1mg makes. I had same effect on high dose prednisone, but totally agree stepping down sucks. I have found the slower the better as you already have observed. I also agree with other commenter that being very transparent with your loved ones helps so they know it is just the withdrawal from steriods. \n\nAlso, vaguely related, but I recently started Pramipexole 1mg at night (3 months ago), and that has helped me a quite bit with some of the mood and motivation issues, so you may want to consider a consult with a psychiatrist if continues to be issue as they may be able to give you something to help get through the steriod taper\n\n( After reading the comments, I finally understand why I was so difficult as a teenager. On top of all the other hormones going on, I was also on and off prednisone throughout my teenage years. Thanks for posting and helping me realize that!", "Recently diagnosed. Can I eat chicken? Hi guys! I was recently diagnosed with dermatomyositis (about two months ago) but I am doing much better now. So glad I found this subreddit! I am on 50mg of prednisolone and 5mg of Vitamin D as of right now, as well as methotrexate and folic acid. My doctor says there should be no restriction on my dietary needs but my dad had a friend that also experienced rashes and he said the rashes was triggered by eating chicken so now he does not let me eat chicken (but sometimes I still secretly steal some because I really love chicken). He says it is because of all the hormones they put in the mass produced chicken, which could make sense but guys help me I MISS MY CHICKEN. I have never heard that chicken will increase your risk of flares! My doctor has told me to limit red meat, but that is it. Some people follow an anti-inflammatory diet, but chicken is allowed on most of those. Eat your chicken! No! Chicken is absolutely not a limitation. There has been no evidence that diet influences our disease process, but the US expert on dermatomyositis said, \"eat what makes you feel good\"! Never heard of that. If anything, I would be mindful of refined sugars/super sugary things because of the prednisone. It boosts your glucose and you could become diabetic. It also increases your appetite which in turn can make you gain weight. (i think sugary things make the inflammation worse too) I heard a lean meat /high protein diet is good for dm, and omega6 (so certain fish) Tumeric helps with inflammation. I kind of eat whatever but my diet has changed because of meds making me lose my appetite. I try to eat yogurt for breakfast (either greek or skyr. They are both high in protein, skyr is less in sugar. I would say get at least vanilla for some flavor) and add chia or sunflower seeds to give it more protein and for the crunch. I did at one point try to eat salmon once a week, but one time got nauseous (my improper taking of meds lead to that). \n\nYou are better off just cooking your meals and just keep the processed foods to a minimal. At least you know what is in it, what type of fats are being used (both good and bad) and can always fortify it. Yayyy! Thank you so much, I finally ate some and it was so good. Hehe. Thank you!!! That is what I said to my dad but he is the type that says \"Do not believe so much science,\" and I just cannot win \ud83d\ude2d There is a reason science exists you know haha. Ate my chicken \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb Ooo I will try the turmeric out! I have already reduced sugary things from my diet and the doctor says I am doing good so far (probably because I have always been sensitive to sweet things and people always say my food is quite bland). Are soybeans and lentils okay? What about peanuts? Any chances of developing gout? I do eat chia seeds for uhhh digestive purposes \ud83d\ude02 Most of my meals are also home-cooked (dad likes to cook so he keeps a close check of what I eat). So far my weight is stabilising so I am trying to maintain it hehe. Thank you soooo so much for the tips! Truly appreciate it :) I do not see why not about the soybeans, lentils, and peanuts. But I suppose in moderation since you already have gasto issues I am guessing? But those items are good for protein. It is good your weight is stable, especially on prednisone. I think in other threads of this subreddit, people discussed their diets while having DM, and do not take any meds to help maintain. Everyone is different so the disease affects everyone differently, so if just that works for them, that is good. If a bit of meds and diet works, awesome. Just do what you think is best and what the rheum will suggest. I have found increasing protein makes me feel better. I do not know if it is a genuine improvement. Or just adding lean meat is just good for you. But I kind of stick with it because feeling better is the aim, right? For whatever reason, it is still good overall.  Even the healthiest diets that include meat/animal products will tell you to have lean meats and high protein.  I try to add seeds and nuts to some of my foods.  I would add more beans but my boyfriend do not like beans and I hate to cook a bunch just for me (and end up not eating it.. though I could freeze it). I believe refined sugary things are bad for inflammation.  \n\nI personally am not on a particular diet but am a bit aware of what is healthier out there.  I cook mostly with extra virgin olive oil and only deep-fry with canola maybe a couple times out the month? I do not eat much fast-food because once I started to make a bit more money at my job, (several years ago) I treated myself to McDonald's frequently since it was like a treat and my cholesterol was a bit high (though around this time I was riding my bike to work..about 12 miles away for reasons that was not related to 'being healthy.'). I cut back sooo much on my Russel Stovers and Whitmans and this yummy bomb cake and breads from Chinatown because 1) Was kind of putting on weight, 2) was a long distance to get to Chinatown via public bus 3) Eh... rather wait till Feb 15!  I do not eat nearly enough veggies but I try to buy some bagged salad high in Vit A and K and add some extra crap to make it yummy, but still healthy (sauteed chicken, grapes, chia seeds, non-salted sunflower seeds, apples, raspberry vinaigrette etc). I eat yogurt/skyr that is high in protein.  Was eating greek yogurt but I am also cheap so the ones at Aldi's was just getting bland to me and at one point, I was losing my appetite (my meds which I was taking improperly which also caused me to throw up) so now recently in the past few months, resumed yogurt but got skyr which is even higher in protein that greek.  I cheat once in a while, when I have a bit money to splurge but being a broke person can make eating healthier home cooked meals a lot easier lol. Free range chicken?", "Opinions Please (\n\nSo I have had this rash on my eyelids for a few years now (I want to say two or three years I do not really remember when I first noticed it) but I have always assumed it is eczema because I have eczema on other parts of my body. However, this rash on my hands has gotten a lot worse over the past year or so. Also, I have been experiencing extreme fatigue lately. I have been brushing it off as running after a toddler and dog and trying to adjust to all the crazy shit that is going on, but I am thinking it might be more serious than I thought. Unfortunately, I cannot get an appointment at my PCP until July and the rheumatologist probably will not be able to see me to closer to the end of the year at this point. \n\nSorry, I do not use Reddit much to post, hope I linked the images correctly. Let me know if I need to do something else to upload. Try to get in with a good, university based dermatologist.  One visit and mine was diagnosed. Follow up to their comment, do not put up with scheduling issues if you feel ill.

Noticing this hand discoloration along with what seem to be little \u201cpimples\u201d which come and go. Does this look like Dermatomyositis to anyone?  For a bit more context I have not had any swallowing difficulties or any muscle pain/weakness that seems to be out of the ordinary. I have noticed a little redness on the face but it does not itch, sting or anything like that. Physically I have been feeling pretty good. No abnormal fatigue. \n\nI have also been diagnosed with \u201cchronic\u201d Epstein Barr, which is its own frightening google search trip!\n\nEdit: the ugly mug for added context - I am not really sure if this resembles a heliotrope rash:  Does your face/hands/chest feel extra burn-y in the sun? Thanks for the reply. No, there is no real burning sensation with or without sun exposure. So people can have skin manifestations without muscle and fatigue complications, but this does not look like gottron's papules to me. I am not a physician, but if you are not having complications with sun then it does not sound like this is the disease for you. It is on the rarer side but I have heard of people having the skin issues first and later having the muscle weakness but I really do not think those pics look like dermato. \n\nThe rashes are usually much more vibrant and almost uniform and those bumps do not look like gottrons papules. But as always, a doctor would obviously know for sure. Appreciate the reply! One thing I forgot to mention in my summary comment was that the \u201cbumps\u201d could easily be the result of a skin condition I do know I have, pityriasis lichenoides chronica (diagnosed via skin biopsy a couple years back) - they are fairly similar to a couple of related spots on my arm/trunk. Do you have any antibodies? Did you have an MRI, EMG, Muscle Biopsy Or Skin Biopsy? They do not look a whole lot like mine but my rashes did come\nfirst. I am still pretty  hypomyopathic too but my case is fairly atypical. DM is not even the only rare disease I have. The CVID (common variable immunodeficiency, so immune dysregulation in general) They are both considered Service Connected which is why they think it might be so weird, so it is kind of hard to go by my experience, but weird presentations do happen. A Doc is clearly your best bet. I have DM and that is typically what my hands look like. 7 months since start of symptoms and I have just started developing what look like more classic gottrons on my knuckles. I do not have SIGNIFICANT muscle involvement although I do generally feel weaker and more exhausted and know that real muscle decline could strike at any moment. Get two things done: a skin biopsy of the reddest more irritated knuckle and a lab work up w/ myositis panel. I am serum negative for everything in labs but skin biopsy confirmed diagnosis. Sending well wishes to you! Thanks for your reply! Out of curiosity, the way your knuckles look - is there similar \"discoloration\" on any other joints? With me, my knees and elbow look similar. Yes! Both elbows and knees were red and I noticed when I took hot showers my knees would turn a speckled red. In the last couple months I developed a chest rash that since has been mostly tamed with a Medrol dose pack I was prescribed. I also have eyelid swelling in the mornings. My DM does not look text book and there are many of us out there that will not appear like the photos you see on google. I also do not get the classic itching or burning. Very occasionally will I feel itchy but not typically. Keep an eye on it and follow up with your primary/ see a rheumatologist. Thanks for the info! I have been noticing the redness of the knuckles/joints for around 1.5 years at this point and seemingly have not developed any other symptoms - so that along with the fact that I have got some other health things that might well be causing it makes me hopeful that my issue is not with Dermatomyositis.", "Help? &amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(", "19 year old female, never had knuckle rash before I have not been diagnosed with anything and do not have any muscle weakness but I I have never seen a rash on my knuckles in my 19 years of life.

Please DM me if you have any other questions and I will be happy to try and help. Like the other guy said, everyone experiences it differently. \nMy biggest advice in the interim is avoid the sun whenever possible. I see that you are driving in this picture- where the sun hits ya pretty easily. Checkout coolibar or pantagonia for uv clothing.  There are other websites you can google (like solumbra). They sell uv gloves which you should wear while driving. \n\nMake sure you have good sunblock too. Note, wear the uv clothing plus sunblock even if it is cloudy. Clouds do not block uv rays. This is great advice! Thank you. I have heard to avoid the sun, but what is the reason? (I am not much of a sun person anyway) is it for normal skin cancer reasons or are we more susceptible to rashes? Thanks so much for responding! You are very welcome!\n\nWith DM, we are highly sensitive to the sun. The uv rays can cause major flare ups.  \n\nAnd I am a pale person to and not much of a sun person- but you still want to take precautions.  Like I was saying- just driving down the road can be rough- since the sun hits your hands and face directly. I had no idea that clothing had an spf level associated. \n\nThey also sell a laundry powder called sun guard. It can boost your the spf  level of your clothing to about 30. Its cheap- it does not hurt and makes your clothes a little brighter. It is called Sun Guard if you are interested. The clothes last about 30 washes without needed the powder again. Oh wow. This is incredible information. I am already a little gotchu so this helps, and luckily I wore a scarf all winter. Ironically, this flare up was on my arm and neck when I was visiting LA and so happy to be out of my winter clothes. It is also only affected my left arm which is the side closest to the window when I drive. Very interesting stuff. \nDo you have any of the illnesses associated with Dermatomyositis? There are so many. Now I am getting tested for every time of cancer and interstitial lung disease, etc. holy crap what a roller coaster this is. I thought I was perfectly healthy. Same here, I was 27-28 when I was diagnosed. And I am overall a healthy guy. This is one of those autoimmune diseases that you can just get. No real reason for the cause. \n\nFor me personally? From the top of my head I am also diagnosed with Alopecia, and raynaud's.  When I came back from Hawaii, I had oral thrush (that was gross but they took care of that pretty quickly)\n\nThe Rashes are all but gone but I do have hair loss (eyebrows and scalp). \n\nIf your eyebrows ever get crazy itchy - do not scratch! I was diagnosed with DM in September, they did all kids of tests and I am cancer free but scares me so much. I developed DM due to Embrell, the medication for RA, which I was diagnosed in the summer of 2015. So far I am on a xelyanz, which is supposed to be good for both but I have not seen a result yet. I do not have the rash on my hands or eyelids, I do not even have the little veins on my cuticles. The dermatologist even second guessed himself about the diagnosis. I have a new rheumatologist and will see her next Tuesday, I am hoping both doctor would come up with a plan to help me as I live in pain with my joints swelling and the pain, other than that the rash is not itchy, it is just scaly. Did they do a biopsy of the rash? Where do you live? I have had two biopsy and it was positive for it, I do not really understand how or what they saw. \nI live in Dallas.

Hi everyone,\n\nI just started prednisone last week.  The reason I seeked medical help is for sudden arthritis in my hands, wrists and knees + rashes on many joints (including what turned out to be gottron's papules).    I am starting to feel weak in the thighs, but this might be also due to me spending 16 hours sleeping per day for the last 5 weeks.\n\nMy doctor told me that I shouldnt panic because she has patients raising kids and working, but reading about DM on uptodate and bmj best practice has me super worried.   It looks like  if cancer doesnt kill you, then you will need an electric elevator to climb stairs at home with with a feeding tube in your stomach or interstitial lung disease will kill you.  Seriously, the uptodate \"long term follow up study\" has death at 20%, severe disability at 24% and muscle weakness at 23%.  \n\nSo what I am asking for is this:  does anyone have a \"good\" story, where they went on to live relatively normal lives after first year of prednisone?  It would definitely help me sleep at night.\n\nbest What you are reading on UptoDate and most of the other sites are case studies, which tend to pull the most interesting (and therefor most terrifying) stories together. Do not get me wrong, DM is a Bad Thing\u2122, but every case is different, and there are plenty of people going about their days in remission or living with the disease on a regular basis. If you let it define you, it will define you. Thanks for replying.  \n\nIt helps to get some perspective.   I think my doctor was overly optimistic and now that I get the other information I reacted by being overly pessimistic.  \n\nBack to living one day at a time.  \n\ncheers When I started college I could not walk. It took me 6 years to finish and I was at my peak when I finished (nowhere near baseline, but functional). Now I am working and am in my 3rd flare. You just kind of have to majorly suck it up. My body is miserable and riddled with systemic inflammation right now, but I absolutely love my job! Do not let this disease take over your life. Make it your bitch. I am finding a new rheumatologist currently to switch up my routine meds right now! I remember feeling the same way when I was first diagnosed. It is been 5 years for me, and while not \"back to normal\", I am still pretty active and I have learned to live with my limitations. I gave up on running and backpacking and most cardio. That being said, I still hike a lot and I do field work in remote polar regions. I am now at 10 mg/ day of prednisone, and function as a slightly out of shape \"normal\" person. The hardest part is learning what your body is telling you, and slowing down when you need to to prevent flares. If you find a good doctor, it will get better! Feel free to reach out if you have questions or would like advice. Good luck! \n\nOh- one other point- so many DM patients are elderly that I think that skews the statistics. Thanks you so much for replying.  \n\n We are also outdoors enthusiast.  I thought any outdoor activity would be impossible, so hiking and field work sound great and give me some hope.\n\nI am starting at 70mg/day of prednisone, with tapering expected to begin in a couple months.   Did you have to do multiple cycles?  Did you also have methotrexate?\n\nthanks Thanks for replying.  Any stories with some \"ups\" is good for me right now.\n\nHow long did you go between flares?    Am I understanding correctly that we basically take crazy high levels of prednisone for a couple months then taper and keep a low level (5-10 mg/day) until the next flare? I was diagnosed in June of 2009 and immediately put on steroids.  I had a tough case, could not get off the pills until my doc put me on Rituxin in 2015.  Been okay since then with the occasional flare.  Continued to work, ride horses, etc.  I developed side effects from the prednisone that lead to some other issues and recently was diagnosed with  fibromyalagia but the DM has been under control and not an issue. Thanks for replying!  \n\nNot able to get off the pill = 6 years of high daily  prednisone dose, or 6 years of  10 mg/day prednisone?  My understanding is that the tapered dose is forever.\n\nWishing you a lot of courage for the rest. Six years that varied between 5 and 40 mg a day.  I got down to 3mg a few times and would flare.  Ask you doc about Rituxin. It is not approved for DM but the pharm company is trying to get it approved so they will supply the drug. Yes, I have gone through multiple cycles of flares. I tended to push my limits in the beginning when I thought I was \"better\", but you need to go REALLY slow when trying to get back in shape. \nI am on Cellcept. I had a really bad time with methotrexate- it made me a zombie. Cellcept works a lot better for me. \nI would recommend finding a specialist who works with myositis, if you can. Some rheumatologists are great, but others do not have a lot of experience with myositis and it really affects the quality of care. \nHang in there! It sucks the most in the beginning when you end up learning all your lessons the hard way. My symptoms started late 2015 kept getting worse until officially diagnosed (Oct 2016) . Honestly, I dunno how I still worked (ck levels were 6000+) but I managed and was put on prednisone to reduce inflammation, and on maintenance meds.  Every so often, I will have a Rituxan injection done but held off due to thoughts of pregnancy (am now officially off prednisone since that can make your symptoms worse long-time use.)  I am not back to myself since it also gave me arthritis so my hands are greatly affected but I still do the same job and can still do my same activities... just not at the same rate as before.  It affects everyone differently.  It \\*can\\* potentially have you wheelchair bound and \\*can\\* affect the lungs and it is always good to be aware of worse case scenarios to know what is the worst outcome to happen.  But also to know people can still live their lives with this condition.  I just traveled to Iceland alone and the only worrisome part was if I woke up unable to move (which has happened twice)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do want to get a new job (have been wanting to before diagnoses) that will be a bit less physical but I am grateful I am able to work, get health insurance, and still go out to have fun.  I still like going on walks, biking, DDRing and whatnot.  But you will learn your limits and how much you can/cannot do.  Just... keep being active, really.  It is one of the most natural treatments you can do for yourself.  Just do not get discouraged yet!  I was, and was upset it took a long time for my symptoms to go down.  Oh, and you can also see if your region has legal marijuana for medical use.  That has helped in many occasions. Wow.   I will ask them what they think of rituxin and and Cellcept which was mentionned in another comment.    \nCost really isnt an issue, we are in Canada (already cheap) and my work insurance covers 90% of what is left. I paid 12$ for a few weeks worth of prednisone. It is really good to hear that people can still live and work and *do something*.    Huge thanks for sharing.   We are in Canada, so it is legal marijuana for the whole family if we wanted.. :) thanks again for your input, really appreciate it.     \n\nDocs are considering adding methotrexate to the mix current mix of prednisone and plaquenil, but will hold off   for a month.  I think they just want me to have a few weeks of \"feeling better\" before introducing methotrexate, which has harder side effects \"right now\". Must be nice.  Without getting the drug approved, it is $18k every six months.  \n\nI was on IV methotrexate, then pills, then at home shots.  It would work in one form then stop working. Cellcept made me very sick.   Same thing with tacrolimus. I know there were a couple more but cannot recall right now.  The IV methotrexate worked the longest.  On it, I got down to 5-10mg pred a day, almost off. It is nice, I feel very lucky.  DM is stressful enough that I do not need to add money issues to the mix.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully all I need is pred, we will see how it goes.\n\nbest I was diagnosed with DM when I was 3. Even though I was in so much pain, I still led a pretty normal and active lifestyle. Even now at 25, I lead a pretty active lifestyle. I have good days and bad days. But I have been able to get on the right medication to help control my bad days so I end up having more good than bad. \n\nDM sucks. I thank God for meds thanks for comment - it is very inspiring knowing there are good days to look forward to. I got diagnosed last December. I went from being able to bench press my bodyweight, and deadlift 1.5x my bodyweight, and row 2km in 7minutes to not being able to open my car boot or a drinks bottle within 2 weeks.\n\nIt is a serious disease.\n\nI had 3 months off work. I am now on 5mg pred/day. 400mg of hydroxychloriquine/day, and 22.5mg of methotrexate a week.  From my reading 3 immunosuppressants puts me in the \"top\" 10% or so...\n\nI have had 4 infections that required antibiotics.  2 from single mosquito bites.\n\nMy partner just came home and sat in my arms and cried, because it is still hard to accept that we are more than likely not going to grow old together.\n\nBUT, I teach fulltime, I do 5 mins of exercise every other day wiith weights.  I cook. I do the shopping. I mow the lawn. I decorate (slowly).  And I can play with my partner's kids at the park.\n\nI live a pretty normal life.  But I am tired, all the time.  And my legs ache by 3pm everyday.\n\nI can walk to town, drink with friends and walk back (20 mins each way), but I feel it the next day or two.\n\nIt is about moderation, and accepting that somedays you just got to sit on the sofa drink tea, dunk some biscuits and tackle the jobs tomorrow. Hey thanks for your replying.  Congratulations on your courage, it helps me looking forward.\n\nA few weeks ago, I learned that I had the MDA5 version of dermatomyositis, the one that goes for the lungs too.  I have a very small interstitial lung disease.  Doc is confident they caught me on time and will be able to bring me back.    I am on chemo, tacrolimus and pred.  I also get some ivig.\n\nWe will see how it goes. I am pretty sick aside from the DM (CVID, so I get weird shit, like Shingles) but I am still doing pretty okay. I am stronger at least and my rashes serve as a decent warning system for any imminent infections so that is nice too. It is been rough but I am learning to live with it. I dunno if you would consider that \u201cgood\u201d but it could also definitely be worse and sometimes you just got to take what you can get, I guess. My boyfriend started getting sick in July 2018. It started with the butterfly rash and then started spreading to his entire body. Doctors thought it was Lyme disease or lupus. Muscle pain started in September and got progressively worse everyday. I did a ton of online research and came across DM. I called his doctor everyday for three weeks to expedite all the testing (had to go to neurologist, rheumatologist, neurologist, and primary) and finally got results that confirmed diagnosis at the end of November. Started treatment in December. At this point he could barely walk or eat. Could not sit on the couch without falling or pour a glass of water. It was so bad at one point where he fell at the store and had to go to the hospital. By early spring he started feeling a lot better and by April he was able to drive again. Early summer he could walk up stairs and lift things again. We had planned a trip to Europe before he got sick and our trip was this September. I can proudly say we went on a pretty hard hike and although we took our time and it was not easy, he did it! He is doing so good that I almost forget how bad it was and that he still has the disease. He just stopped prednisone last month. We are so grateful everyday that he is better and although he is not at the same strength he used to be and things are different, he is a million times better than he was and he is able to be independent. Hardest thing about all of it was that he was a VERY active person. We are still not sure how it is going to be long term but it is really uplifting that he can walk on his own and if we take things slow we can do things that we used to. Stay positive! Hey thanks for replying,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWow, that is a very low bottom. I am glad I was caught early.  It took 4 weeks from the  first joint pains (fingers, wrists, knees) to my first dose of prednisone).    My rheumatologist and dermatologist both said they never caught a dermatomyosytis that quick. I am about 12 years into my diagnosis. A good psychiatrist can help a lot, especially if you get the mood swings with high-dose prednisone.\n\nIt is been hard for me to accept help from the people in my life. But the truth for me has been that most people are dying to show you a moment of kindness. Let them. I am here, late to respond, but I wanted to share. Also, PLEASE update us on your status!\n\nI was diagnosed with DM February 2019. It is now March 2020 and I am KICKING THIS DISEASES ASS.\n\n1.  From 80 mg to 0 mg of prednisone, which gave me awful side effects.\n\n2.  from 3000 mg to 2000 mg of mycophenolate, which gives me no side effects, except possible lung issues which I will go over.\n\n3.  although it is tough to work out, I did 12 squats yesterday...and was hella sore that night, lol.  I plan on slowly adding working out whenever I can.\n\n4. I work in entertainment ( and expend a LOT of energy each night, 5 - 6 nights a week. Thankfully I can rest during the day if I need to...but I rarely need to.\n\n5.  How have I recovered so strongly?  #DIET, DIET, AND DIET!!!  \nI was 100% on an AIP diet, now I am 80% on an AIP diet, adding gluten-free grains and, well, beer :). A couple days a week, I eat an AIP diet still.  Drink tons of water, gatorade, green tea, vitamin supplements esp. vitamin C, oh and the most important thing:  #Take a probiotic every day!!!  \nI also replaced sodas with kombucha. Yum.\n\nSo, my lungs are really my only issue right now. I have to use abuterol 2x a day as I get some kind of asthma/tight lungs.  That is really all I am suffering from with this disease.\n\nHang in there, be positive, and make any changes you can.", "know basics about dermal fillers ", "Does anyone have anti-mda5 dermatomyositis? Hey all,\n\nI was wondering if any of you is dealing with the even rarer anti-mda5 ?  I developped it last Summer and was thankfully caught early, meaning that my lungs had \"only\" lost  about 10% capaciy.  \n\nI am about to start tofacinitib as my main weapon.   Survival after 6 months is pretty good for the whopping 18 persons who tried it ((    I am kind of scared because it is also my last \"ace\":  tacrolimus almost killed be and dermatomyotisis came back after I switched to it.\n\nI could really use some positive anti-mda5 stories.\n\nbest, Hey!\n\nI have the same dermatomyositis and am still here doing well after 2 years!\n\nPlease look at some of my previous comments for some advice, but specific to mda-5\n\n1) For me prednisone is first line of defense. I am bigger guy, but was on 100mg for 270lbs. This is vital if you are flaring up (weakness, muscle stiffness, shortness of breath)\n2) Cellcept 3000mg per day, this is second line of defense. Takes 3-5\nmonths to be effective, thus point #1. Key with cellcept - do not take within 2 hours of eating food for max effectiveness. I do mid morning and before bed\n3) Rituximab was final game changer for me, allowed to lower prednisone down to 12.5mg per day. Is expensive but for sure worked especially on hands and lungs\n\nGeneral advice:\n\n1) The lung issues sneak up on you, I went almost a year before they manifested. I recommend quarterly pulmonary function tests, and just keep an eye for for low o2 symptoms (coughing, confusion etc)\n2) Do NOT be ashamed to ask for second  opinions. I would say 90+% of docs have NO idea how to treat this disease. I had best luck going to a university backed hospital / clinic system\n3) Take care of yourself and do not overdo it, especially mental health as inflammation and low O2 can mess with head \n\nPlease write me here or direct any time and I can help however I can. Can feel like you are alone but you are not hey thanks for replying!  we are such a rare bunch I am glad to have found someone.\n\nPrednisone is indeed the first line of defence, but it cannot be kept for too long at high dose, as you already know.  For the first flare last Fall  I was up to 1 mg  per kilogram of bodyweight.\n\nThe initial second line defence was tacrolimus, but I reacted to it and it almost killed me.\n\nThen we tried cellcept for a few months.. I would say December to May.   Symptoms came back when I was down to 10 mg prednisone, so we went back up to 25 mg and increased the dose of cellcept.     We slowly started reducing the prednisone after a few weeks  and I flared up again (skin, arthritis), this time at 17.5 mg, so we concluded that it didnt work for me.\n\nThe new second line is defense is tacrolimus.  I have been on tacrolimus for 10 days.  So far no ill effects and the arthritis symptoms are getting better so I have (cautiously) high hopes.\n\nGood points regarding the lungs. I have had a few lung capacity tests, I guess it amounts to quarterly.\n\nMy doc is awesome.  She already saved a  anti-mda5 patient already 5 years ago.  He is back to work and doesnt bother showing up to routine exams, so that is good.  She is also in contact with a lot of folks in other hospitals.   Really lucky to be with her.\n\nThe \"do not overdo it part\" is the hardest.  We are stuck at home with the kids for the foreseeable future until a vaccine for the stupid covid is out.\n\nwishing you the best of luck. I am glad too, is a disease that can make you feel isolated that is for sure!\n\nHopefully the tofacinitib works, as far as the cellcept (mycophenolate), I honestly think it works well for me now but has a massive lead time to work (and you have to be disciplined about not taking with food), so guessing that is why many have issues. \n\nIf you can afford or have coverage, would encourage you to ask about the rituximab (rituxin) infusions, I really do think they were game changer for me (took 2 infusions 6 months apart tho), especially for the rash / nail fold sensitivity on hands. Happy to say currently my hands are like 96% better\n\nHonestly the only med that works \"fast\" with myositis is prednisone, after those first couple weeks it is really a patience game which is very hard\n\nAnyways, just want to emphasize again you are not alone and good chance with patience you will get better. \n\nSpecifically with the MDA5 though, watch your lungs and mental health I take cell-cept, and weekly infusions of immunoglobulin. Still on 20 of steroids and trying to taper off after getting rituxan.\nAlso my doctor doing research on it found out the the microbiome of people with mda5 is different from other people with dermatomyositis. Did the rituxan make you feel tired after it really took effect? Lately I have been absolutely exhausted. And it really takes a mental toll. Steroids made me gain so much weight. thanks for this reply thanks for this reply Hey OP! Have you started treatments? I hope start feeling better soon! yeah I have been on tofacinitib for about a month now.   I started feeling better because we increased the prednisone (Which always make me feel better) while we were waiting for the tofacinitib to kick in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a mistake when they sent my prescription to the pharmacy, so prednisone was tapered off way to fast and my symptoms came back.  We increased prednisone again, waiting for tofacinitib to kick in for real.\n\nreally hope this works, because I dont know if there is anything left to try if it doesnt.\n\nthanks for checking in!\n\nwishing you the best of luck I hope it starts working much better soon! It is really hard to get off steroids! I hope this treatment does work for you. Have they tried IVIG for you? That is the gold standard according to my rheum, they say she is the best in the west coast (I am in the U.S), and I believe them!\nYou can always hit me up for a chat if you would like. I am always here, and already quarantining before it all went to hell. IVIG was the first thing we tried when I was hospitalized last Fall\ntacrolimus + IVIG  + prednisone + antimalarial\n\nI reacted badly to tacrolimus and IVIG.  :/\n\nthanks for asking and offering tips! Did they give you plaquenil? That messed me up so bad my skin would slough off by itself. My rheum said people with MDa5 gene react badly to plaquenil specifically. I have not heard of the other meds tacromilus. I hope you are doing good. I was just diagnosed a month ago, and so just starting the whole process.  So nice too know I am not alone. I had plaquenil at the start (that is what  I called antimalarial because I couldnt remember the name).  It was stopped when I reacted badly to the first cocktail of meds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntacrolimus is part of this combo (that also includes Cyclophosphamide, aka chemo)  ( believe I forgot to mention chemo in my first cocktail.. it was quite a big hitter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: spoke with my rheum last week.  turns out that IVIG is one of two suspects (with tacrolimus),  but isnt considered \"guilty\" yet.  We might try it again if the tofacinitib cocktail fails.  Tofacinitib isnt look that great. I am down to 12mg pred and I am starting to have neck pains.  It is been a bit less than 2 months with tofacinitib, we are going to give it 3 months before changing things.

All patients had ILD, and all but one had RP-ILD (93.3%; V  test *p* &lt; 0.0001). Patients in this cluster were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in 86.7% of cases (*p* &lt; 0.0001). The early mortality rate was high (80%; V test *p* &lt; 0.0001). The other main characteristic was that these patients frequently had mechanic's hands (73.3%; V test *p* = 0.006).\n\nCluster  2 (55.4%; n = 46) corresponds to a pure dermato-rheumatologic pattern  (rheumatoid cluster). As for the RP-ILD cluster, patients in cluster 2  were mainly women and less frequently had skin lesions (82.6%; V test *p* = 0.03), digital necrosis (4.35%; *p* = 0.04), and the Raynaud phenomenon (10.9%; V test *p* &lt; 0.0001) (( Most patients in cluster 2 complained of arthralgia or arthritis (82.6%; V test *p* = 0.01). Signs of myositis (muscle weakness 15.2%; V test *p* = 0.0005 and increased creatine kinase \\ level 21.7%; V test *p* &lt; 0.0001), as well as RP-ILD (17.4%; V test *p* = 0.001), were infrequent, and no early death occurred in this group (V test *p* &lt; 0.0001).\n\nCluster  3 (26.5%; n = 22) corresponded to patients with severe skin  vasculopathy and an intermediate prognosis (vasculopathic cluster).  Patients here were mainly male (72.7%; V test *p* &lt; 0.0001).  In addition to the classical DM skin rash, those patients frequently  harbored signs of skin vasculopathy with the Raynaud phenomenon (81.8%; V  test *p* &lt; 0.0001), skin ulcers (77.3%; V test *p* = 0.0006), digital necrosis (31.8%; *p* = 0.001), and calcinosis (22.7%; V test *p* = 0.01). In addition, most patients had proximal weakness (68.2%; V test *p* &lt; 0.0001) with increased CK levels in 63.6% (V test; *p*  &lt; 0.0001). Some of the patients in cluster 3 had RP-ILD (22.7%), and  the early mortality rate was low (4.5% in the vasculopathic cluster).\n\n###", "How I stayed positive with Dermatomyositis ", "Help shape a public health mobile app for teens/young adults ages 16-21 with dermatomyositis!

It looks like what I have on my hands. Anything you take help at all? Plaqenil? My hands are really bad, the skin is so dry and sensitive that my knuckles have open ulcers. My dr. prescribed silver sulfadiazine cream. I dont know that this is what you need as your skin does not look dry. Btw I saw the pic of the rash on your chest, I get that too.  Do you have a pink rash on your cheeks or over your eyes? That is how my dr knew it was Dermatomyositis. Yeah kind of. My nose and cheeks are always red. If it is indeed dermatomyositis do I have to take meds for it? Yes. I went a year misdiagnosed and almost died, ended up at the hospital for a few weeks. I take daily meds and get an infusion 2x a month. If yours is caught early, you have an advantage. Also, the sun makes the redness worse, so try not to be out in the sun long and cover up. Please see a dr for proper diagnosis. My regular dr. and rheumatologist could not pin point my illness, it took me to almost die and going to the Mayo clinic to get better. Jeez glad your okay. What about this disease caused you to almost die? I am worried now Well, I got sick with all the symptoms but I was misdiagnosed with psoriatic arthritis.  And the medicine for that was not helping me feel better, I kept losing weight (in total about 70 lbs) always fatigued and muscle aches was horrible, and the skin rashes and dryness of the hands.  I had blood test weekly for about 6 months and all my drs could not figure out what was wrong. Until finally the muscles in throat were so weak i was unable to eat or swallow and a sip of water almost killed me. I was so malnourished, I looked like death and could barely move. I went to Mayo clinic where I was properly diagnosed in a a few days. I have been in treatment for the last 6 months and doing much better. I am not 100 percent back to normal but getting there. Is muscles weakness one of the worst symptoms of that? Cause my muscles, especially my arms and core got super weak almost over night. They violently shake when I try to use my abs. Yes, and if not treated it keeps getting worse. That is one of the main symptoms of DM. I would sit on the couch and I had no strength to push myself up, I would try and my arms would shake and just the effort would drain me completely, I was always so tired and sleepy. I lost my appetite too. Well, at least there are meds i suppose. Hope you continue to improve. Honestly so much overlap is best to see doc, diagnosis crieria here \n\nRecommend seeing rheum with experience in these diseases if you have not, also patience.\n\nFeel free to write me or comment here and I can help however (2+ years with dermatomyositis) I definitely seen my symptoms get worse almost overnight in terms of muscle weakness.  Is the enzyme test the best way to diagnbose and can most people live normal long lives  with it? For your question - for me first clinical signs were abnormal liver tests (ast alt), then abnormal CK protein test (shortly after). My personal symptoms at diagnosis were - fatigue, weakness, muscle cramps / stiffness, dental pain, facial rash (red stripe on bridge of nose, eyelid redness). Also quickly developed cuticle / nail fold issues and knuckle rash (gottrons papules)\n\nAlso big sign of these types of diseases is issues happening bilaterally (both sides of body)\n\nAs far as normal life, the answer is most definitely YES! While serious, these diseases are generally manageable with patience and proper care.\n\nMaybe not related to you, but I know not everybody is as lucky as I was as far as timing and health care, but myositis on a budget is possible in many cases. \n\n1) Stay ahead of it! Prednisone is dirt cheap, and a single doc visit and some labs can get you on track to better health. Just try to get into a rheumatologist \n2) once diagnosed and on road to stability, many drug companies have assistance available. \n3) Final resort - myositis is eligible for disability if needed (USA)  Thanks!

Mine are usually gone or dramatically reduced within 12 hours but recur frequently. This does not seem to be the norm, and I am not finding anything online that provides an \"average duration\". I have not yet been diagnosed (awaiting further labwork), but DM is suspected for a variety of reasons. The way my rashes come and go seems to set me apart though and makes me wonder if we are headed the wrong way. When mine started they did not get better until I was out on prednisone. Overlap myositis can present with a more transient, relapsing/remitting rash than classical dermatomyositis. I am on prednisone plaquenil and Cellcept now but still have random flares. I have a rare Primary Immune Disease that seems to have been the cause of the DM in the first place and the rashes last either as long as I am unwell or my immune system crashes. I am sick a lot. The last time I suddenly found myself in the hospital for a week with an uncommon pneumonia. The rashes faded so they thought I was getting better but I was not. My Rheumatologist took one look at me and knew. He tested my Immunoglobulins and IGG was 308 IGA was 42 and IGM 39. Then they discharged me immediately bc it was not safe to be there. \n\nAnyway it is unusual but not unheard of and in my case the reason is my overall terrible immune system.", "UPDATE FROM PREVIOUS POST BELOW: \"2nd week of December the rash &amp; painful skin on my hands started...\" 3/8/2019 UPDATE!\n\nHello fellow humanoids.

Three to four times.  Then the move the Skittles up a little higher and ZzZaaap!  And again. And again. Thank you sir may I have another. So about 7 of those, they then moved to my leg, attaching the wires to my toes. After about 20 of these x 3...\n\nI thought I was done.  Here comes the actual doctor to have some fun.  \u201cSo I am going to take this long needle and jam it into your muscles in your forearm and send electricity into it.  Ouch, I know riiight? Oh, you also have to FLEX.\u201d\n\nForearm, to the biceps, to the triceps...then down to the calf, thigh, behind the knee, quadriceps, and ankle. \nOh I forgot...both procedures were done on my upper and lower back. \n\nWell, I survived and it was not that bad (brave face).  And it led to some very good news. the Myositis (muscle weakness/deterioration) is VERY mild!  Which means I am getting even better.  Strength is returning.   She also suggested that the muscle biopsy is UNNECESSARY!  So happy to dodge that excruciating procedure.    \n\nAlso, turns out this Dr. is on a 20 person national board that specializes in Dermatomyositis!  She was thrilled with my progress, telling me most people suffer from this disease for 2 or so years before finally getting treatment. I could NOT even IMAGINE that. I would not make it 6 months it is so awful.  I attacked it fast, and that meant less damage to my body which also meant faster healing. So a huge thank you to Sheri &lt;3 for not letting me wallow in misery and making me get off my butt and to the doctor. Doctors. Multiple Dr.s, offices, and hospitals.    \n\nAlso, the Dr. was completely fascinated with my Gottron\u2019s Papules on my hands, taking photos from various angles...as I made love to the camera. It is come true. I am a disease model. Holy crap.\n\nAnyway, I am still slogging away with this awful diet--because I know it is truly helping. I still get bad days now and then (probably ever 8 to 10 days), but I have got energy and I am kind of back to my normal self, especially when I am working. Joints are stronger, no more pain, just a little stiffness when I try to breakdance. (JUST KIDDING--when I try to kneel down) . I am 80% to 85% there--if not 90% to 95% on really good days (like today!).  The worst thing are my hands.  The skin on my hands hurt a few times a day still. I am ready for that to go away.\n\nI am working on The Cool Kids tonight with my buddy Allan Murray for their season finale, so watch the show on FOX! It is dang funny. \n\n3/21/2019 UPDATE\n\nCT Scan + MRI = No Whammys! Just here to make sure my symptoms are not caused by something else.\nWell, dang it. Looks like I got One Whammy. It is called a pulmonary embolisms.\n\nI know, WHAT!?!?  P.E\u2019s can kill you instantly. So I got my CT scan and was waiting in my car for 90 minutes to get my MRI when my Rheumatologist called and said, \u201cYou need to go to the EMERGENCY ROOM RIGHT NOW!\u201d\n\nI said, \u201c...okay.  Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CT showed two pulmonary embolisms in your lungs!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no! Um. What are those?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlood clots that could break loose and go to your heart or brain. Very dangerous.  You need to get on blood thinners and will be admitted to the hospital for a few days to a week.\u201d\n\nNOW, I was finally scared.\n\nDr.:\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI feel fine. Normal.\u201d \n\nSo I should have had shortness of breath, pain in my chest, etc. but I really had no symptoms. \n After 7 HOURS of testing, they did conclude that I have two blood clots in my lungs, not good. The good news: I had no other bad symptoms and was functioning normally.  They caught it early enough that I can be put on blood thinners for a while and NOT get admitted to the hospital. Whew, I was THIS close to going away for a few days. That would have SUCKED.\n\nAnyway, No other issues on my CT scan or my MRI--so far. \n\nOh, I also have scarring on my lungs (stupid dermatomyositis). Plus, a large clot in my left leg (with no deep vein thrombosis symptoms...again, weird!!!). \n\nI am going to get better you all...And huge thanks for the prayers. Love to ALL of you!!!\u263a\ufe0f\n\n4/2/2019 UPDATE\n\nMet with Dr. Goya regarding the possibility I have malignancies causing the symptoms, including my blood clots.  First off, she says I am probably free of the blood clots by now (YAY!) because I have been on blood thinners for over a week. I have to stay on them for 6 to 9 months though, to completely make sure that those pesky clots do not return.  \n\nShe also thoroughly went though my scans, charts, blood tests, etc. and stated she sees NO SIGNS of any kind of cancer! Hallelujah.  She wants me to do the colonoscopy when I drop off the blood thinners and a prostate exam. \n\nI do not want to be an \u201cass\u201d over all of this, \u201cbutt\u201d I am not looking forward to it. If I were to \u201canal\u201dyze the situation, I should be happy Dr. Goya gave me good news, I am her biggest \u201cfanny\u201d now. I am far from the \u201dbottom\u201d of my health scares now &amp; I still need to \u201cbum\u201d around &amp; rest when symptoms \u201crear\u201d their ugly heads.  Okay, enough.  (Wish I got \u201ctushie\u201din there somehow...)\n\n I am close to 95% better people. Just weak from the debilitating muscle stuff and some finger tingles and pain. Again, thank you for the prayers, well wishes, words of support, and more. &lt;3 \n\n5/9/2019 UPDATE\n\nA quick update with the drugs. I have dropped my Prednisone down to 40mg and I am doing 2000 mg of Cellcept (Mycophenolic acid) per day. I am hoping to totally eliminate the Prednisone!  \n\nSymptoms are still the same with a little less tingling of the hands, papules are starting to fade.  I am more weak, muscle-wise, though.  Not sure why.  Am I just LAZY now!?!?  \n\nAlso, I am dealing with a chest cold while on immuno-suppressants.  This cough is lasting FOR.EV.ER. \n\nDiet-wise, I have started adding gluten-free grains back in with no issues.  A little dairy (cheese) here and there.  Still avoiding sugar (besides dark chocolate). \n\nI hope all of you are doing well! Love the update - glad to hear you are doing well!! Thank you! Just dropped the prednisone down to 20mg! Feeling pretty dang good. I am So Glad You are Doing so Well! It is Awesome to See Someone Fairing Quite Decently Through All The Dermato Nonsense. I am Very New to it And Do not Know Anybody Else Who Has it, So It Really is Nice to See it Can Get at Least a Little Better. Best Wishes and All The Positive Vibes!!!! Thank you!  I continue to drop the prednisone dose. Now down to 20mg.  Keeping up with the diet mostly, and I know I will continue to get better. You can do it. Keep thinking about the future, where your symptoms are either gone or so minimal, you barely notice them. That is where I want to get to!!!", "Best Dermatologist in Delhi for Acne Scars ", "Finally a diagnosis? So, I was technically diagnosed with DM recently even though all my labs have been normal. My rash, and weakness were enough for the drs. Also they diagnosed me with fibromyalgia. So now I am on a lot of meds and hopefully can feel a little bit better. Most days I need help with basic things like getting dressed due to the weakness and pain. Is there any other ways to feel better? Homeopathic maybe? It is weirdly comforting to finally get the diagnosis, right? I hope you are on your way to feeling better. CBD and hemp oil help me with the pain. If medical marijuana is legal where you live maybe give that a shot. I have not had much luck with the rash or itching. Best of luck to you!!! Just staying warm helped my pain a lot. Heated blankets, heating pads, lots of layers Thank you! It is been tough but yea I smoke weed and it helps the pain but I am thinking of getting just cbd for when I feel like being sober or when I have responsibilities lol Did you have a muscle biopsy? No I have not. But when I go back I am going to ask for more testing to make sure That is pretty much the gold standard for diagnostics, I would get that done before going down the treatment road. I have been taking medicine for 5 months due to my rash and muscle weakness and pain. I had a skin biopsy done and it came back with connective tissue disease and they narrowed it down to my symptoms being almost textbook dermatomyositis but I will push for the biopsy. Thank you! My dad is 71 newly diagnosed and I got got him started on a variety of cannabis...cbd, cbd+thc, edibles. He feels so much better with symptom relief that at least he can get through his day.", "Pretty inflamed today. :-( but I feel good overall. I am just concerned that this is going to turn into full blown DM. I tried taking plaquinel to no avail. It made me feel horrible. I had strange \"coldness\" in my forearms and shins and terrible deltoid pain bilaterally.  Needless to say I stopped the plaquinel. Plaquinel made me feel awful too, and apparently it is pretty well tolerated by most. :(\n\nI hope you find something that works for you! I think most people do.  What kind of side effects did you have? For me it was awful diarrhea and body aches.  I dreaded every time I had to take those pills. I hear you.  I just couldnt.  Were they able to find you a drug that worked for you? I am on Methotrexate and IVIG at the moment.  Supposed to be trying Xeljanz too.  The IVIG is really helping my skin I think, but if I get the same side effects as last time I will not be allowed to take it. :( I hope you dont get the same side effects my friend.  Have you ever looked into the leaky gut thing/diet for autoimmune disease?  Ive been reading about it and its interesting.  I think ill try it. I have looked into it a bit and it definitely cannot hurt to eat healthier! I hope it helps you. So has the Dr. confirmed a diagnosis of Dermatomyositis at this point? No. He now says its undifferentiated connective tissue disease The rash and red patterns look so similar to mine. Have you had any sensations of swelling or detected differences in your knuckle function? No thank goodness. I started the Autoimmune protocol diet.  It has helped so much. Just curious, do you find that your hand redness varies a lot during the day? Also does red color change in intensity with pressure to the skin or if you apply any topical such as hand lotions? Yes on varying color throughout the day.   Yes to changes in temperature.  Not so much with lotions.", "reading material: uptodate.com patient information beyond the basics ( is the website providing information to medical professionals that your doctor probably reads.

I had a skin biopsy done that said it is a connective tissue disease but other than that nothing. Is there any chance that I could have DM with normal blood tests? Every situation is unique of course but my disease rarely shows up on bloodwork. \n\nWhen I was first diagnosed at 9, my blood levels were off the charts but my 3 subsequent relapses (the first being 10 years after remission) showed little to no JDM positive blood results. We have had to do muscle biopsies to confirm. \n\nThis last relapse I was siiccckkkk, like, could not bathe myself, brush my teeth without breaks for my arms, had to walk in short stretches, etc, and my bloodwork only came back slightly elevated. Like, almost normal where they would not have even considered a disease if I did not have JDM already. Ended up getting a muscle biopsy that proved I had severe myelin sheath and muscle depletion/swiss cheese. \n\nSo.....yes, sometimes bloodwork doesnt always show active disease but, per my rheum doctors, that was super rare. I was diagnosed last December. Pretty much all my blood levels were normal. Except for a few inflammatory markers.\n\nKeep pushing for a diagnosis. My blood tests show positive for lupus but my skin biopsy showed mixed connective tissue disease like you. My rheum basically said you have an \u201cautoimmune thing\u201d but my derm who is a pretty established expert on Dm said my skin manifestations are pretty much enough to confirm the dm diagnosis. She said the results are not always conclusive for a dm diagnosis. Sorry for the late reply, I am a possible new DM patient trying to get some info ahead of my bloodwork next week. \nCan you elaborate on what your doctor said about the skin being enough to tell? \n\nI am curious because my rheumatologist is the expert for DM in my part of my country and did a thorough examination of my hands yesterday (including magnifying my cuticles) and then told me he believed I had DM, but further tests were needed. \n\nIf what your doc says is true, that sounds pretty damning....", "People in remission, are you still feeling weak ? Because I do. But I have never been in anyone else's shoes, so I cannot compare. I do not think that it is pure laziness but... Maybe it is, I cannot be sure?\n\nI have been diagnosed with juvenile dermatomyositis at 7, I am 22, but I have been in remission since YEARS now. Which means \"*the disease should not be activated right now*\". But still, I am often tired, I feel weak with very few effort. I have little energy to spend. \n\nI feel muscle weakness mostly in my arms, I am almost sure I am waaay weaker than normal (*I often say that water bottles are my kryptonite because I cannot open them*).\n\nI feel muscle weakness in my legs too, although I do not know for sure if any other person without DM do experience the same.\n\nI have a pretty healthy lifestyle otherwise, except that I do not do much sport (I like to walk, but that is it)\n\nSometimes I feel like quite an imposter, I do not want my muscular disease to be an excuse to not do too much efforts... But I do feel weak, whatever the reason is.\n\nPeople in remission, are you *still* experiencing muscle weakness too ? I have been in remission for like 8 years now (diagnosed at around 16, now 26) but I am stronger than ever now. It is 100% the fact that I work in restaurants where there is surprisingly quite a lot of heavy lifting at least for me. \n\nWhen I was first diagnosed I could not even brush my teeth without two hands, but now I can lift 25kg bags of potatoes. So I think the key is to just slowly build up with LIGHT exercise. Being in an active job industry helped lots, even though on my days off I just play games literally all day.\n\nBut that being said I have a red rash on my left eye that has not gone away since being diagnosed, noone knows why. I hear you!  I was diagnosed as a child and have been in remission for over 15 years.  My arms and especially hands are still very weak, my legs look strong and ARE strong for very short time frames, but even lighter activities can leave my legs feeling like I have spent too long at the gym.  \n\nI agree with the other commenter though, I do find that the more time I spend building my strength, the stronger I feel/am.  I do find that my progress is slower than those without DM though, and my recovery time between workouts is longer.  But its not impossible!\nMy biggest complaint honestly is flexibility though, sitting cross legged absolutely destroys my hips.  But it used to hurt my entire body, so I will take the small win! Yes, this is common. Just because your blood work is fine (ie no raised CK) the disease can still cause fatigue and weakness. \n\nMy dr has recently diagnosed me with fibromyalgia on top of the DM, so that is also a possibility that you could look into. \n\nUltimately, working on your diet and exercise levels will help. Try and get some time if you can afford it with an exercise physio who can help you rebuild your strength, and also work on getting adequate nutrition. \n\nIt takes time, so do not beat yourself up - be kind to yourself! It is been 3+ years and I am mostly 100% except my shoulders, I am pretty sure my shoulder muscles are pretty much gone. Sucks but I think my other muscle groups around my shoulders are trying to compensate for my lack of strength there. Visually it looks like there is nothing on top of my shoulder bones. I am very glad to hear that people are able to build strength in the context of DM. I have the adult kind and was diagnosed at 47 thirteen years ago. I have not been able to regain any strength and fatigue is a huge factor for me. My CK gas been ~200 for 10+ years, but strength has been decking all the time. FWIW, I also have Inclusion body myositis, so that is a major contributing factor as well. It is incredible to read, thank you ! How much time did it take you to build this strength slowly ? It is very inspiring for me to know that you can lift such heavy items after being in so much trouble. Would love to hear your advice ! This. \n\nI feel exactly the same than you, and it feels so good to know that I am not alone, and that change is possible. \n\nI do not know if my arms and hands will ever recover, my hands are stupidly weak. But my legs DO work fine... For a limited time, after which I feel exhausted. That is why sometimes I ask myself if it is because of my DM, or if anyone else is experiencing it too ! \n\nSame for flexibility, for example I cannot (and never could) touch my feet when I am standing, but who cares really. Other more positions are inconfortable too, but less than before.\n\nCongratulations for your small win !! Thanks a lot for your advice ! I will look into fibromyalgia, seems like DM often come with a bundle of other things.\n\nI was already thinking about seeing a physiotherapist in order to rebuilt my strength for a long time, but never actually did it to be honest. I was of kind of scared that it would not be the right place for that, so your tip is very useful to me. Thanks for your answer, it is good news if your other muscles are doing more work in order to compensate, congrats for your almost 100% recovery ! I think that some of my arms and hand muscles are pretty much gone too, but who knows haha Thanks for sharing your experience, hope that you will be able to recover one step at a time ! Does not seem like it is possible to rush the recovery process apparently, we are all in this together No worries hope I was able to give some helpful info haha. I never did any exercises like pushups etc, as the steroids took the muscle pain away my muscle strength slowly came back as well. Then I just did some part time work at a very small cafe, then 1-2 years later fast food, at that point I was back to normal skinny boy strength lol. From then I started working at a bigger restaurant where I slowly got stronger. Looking back, I did make quite the journey! I am still on a low dose of Imuran (25mg/day) but otherwise I am totally ok now. I agree, it feels good to know I am not alone too.  I sometimes have a hard time explaining to my partner why I need his help to move heavy things.\n\nI have hope for us though!  A couple of years ago I was jogging (not very far haha) a few times a week followed by a good stretch session.  That was the only point in my life that I could touch my toes while standing. I was scared too, but honestly it is been amazing (but expensive). My physio has chronic fatigue and so really understands how tired I am. But the good news is that after just 5 weeks of regular physio, I am not needing to nap as much and I am in less pain. It really works if you can find the right person. \n\nWishing you lots of luck! Thanks a lot, that is really inspiring for me to do the same. So glad for you that it worked ! \n\nI will try that, even if it is still a bit frightening for me, do not know why exactly.\n\nIt is so helpful to me to read that other people with DM could regain strength, because rationally I now **know** for a fact that it is possible to achieve that. \n\nBut instinctively, I am frightened, because by body does not know any better than being tired easily. It would be **so** incredible to feel different about it. And I see all of these advice on this post as a last thing that I can try to be better, and it seems amazing as much as scary, because I have never been entirely confortable with physical effort, even at my best. Will definitely try though, because it is worth it ! \n\nJust venting, but I needed it Thanks a whole lot for these advice, you are amazing!!\n\nQuite a journey indeed, congrats for achieving so much despite of your DM ! Good to know that even if it can take a few years to regain strength, it is possible. I will try my best to do as you say, and do simple things\n\nI have for an habit to simply take care of myself and do not do too much efforts when my muscles are aching, did not tried protein powder. \n\nBut when my muscles aches for a few days straight I am incredibly stressed, I always feel like it could easily lead to a relapse, it is overwhelming, so I stop **any** kind of efforts to preserve myself. \n\nI am really unsure about whether if it is a good strategy or not, but it does help for me a bit I guess Yeah, I feel you. I was in that exact same position in December, I just thought there was no end to the fatigue and the weakness. You can do it though with the right support. Do not try and do too much too fast. Work with a professional and think about pacing your activities. \n\nKeep venting here - it is what spaces like this are for :) Same, not always easy to explain to others ! \n\nI wrote this post because I felt so bad after I have been called lazy by a friend. I felt exhausted for a few days straight, and refused to cross the town to help for a house moving (of someone which I did not even know, and I already told I probably will not come from the start). If I am not protecting my health, nobody will. \n\nI tried to explain by saying \"I do not have energy to spend today, because I do not have enough of it for myself currently.\", but in any case I would not have been able to move heavy things\n\nCongrats for your jogging habit a few years ago, that is amazing !! Toes-touching is over-rated anyway haha Thanks a lot for your support, it means the world to me &lt;3\n\nWill do, thanks for your help and advice, hope that it will get better. I cannot even imagine how nice it would feel if the fatigue and the weakness were not there anymore!!\n\nI read that muscle atrophy can be caused by DM, and is my absolute nightmare to feel even weaker that I already am I know, it is so scary! That can happen, and you can lose muscle mass, but when your DM is in remission / dormant then that is the time to really go for muscle building exercises, lots of good protein, and doing your best to strengthen your core. yea I was afraid whenever I ached as well, but just do some stretching to relax the muscles and adequate rest and you should be fine I was diagnosed last year, after a year of hell in which no one knew what I had. I am still weak and overweight from all the steroids, and we are still trying to taper off. \nIs anyone else all scarred up? I did not have much much muscle weakness, but my skin was horrible. I have been in remission since I was 8 (I am currently 21) and I am still pretty weak. I walk a lot and can do some cardio, but I have tried strength training and cannot seem to build up anywhere. Even with cardio, I walk and do home workouts quite a lot and should be able to keep up with just one Chloe Ting video with upper body stuff but I cannot even do that and I have been working at it for so long it is not even funny. I am glad to know I am not the only one who still experienced upper body weakness after all these years. Here is to hoping someday we will get there :) Hi!  Can anyone tell me what their first symptoms of this disease were?  I am doing some freaking out right now, sorry! I (F, 52) have been in remission since 2000. I cannot run, mount a horse, squat, lift over my head. Despite going to the gym over the years, I am still weak and fatigue easily. Hi, sorry to see that you got no response for a whole month. I was diagnosed in 2018 and I understand your horrible first year struggle. A year (on medications) it\u00b4s definitely not enough to regain yourself it took me a year and a half to feel confident again on what I could do or not and now I still have ups and downs, but I can promise you it will get a lot better! Diet-wise I tried anything, the cortisone is a hell of a medicine and I tried to consume the least sugar, snacks and crap I could, eating natural, drinking a lot of water (at least 2lt and a half but it depends on height and weight) avoiding sun without 50+ sunscreen and I did almost daily light exercise, increasing when I felt like it. Try to understand what\u00b4s your limit and set your goals, it doesn\u00b4t have to be anything extreme! The experience is definitely different depending on the age, but the fact that you are going to the gym is amazing, probably so much more beneficial than you can see. I find helpful not to compare myself to others (I mean, we have a disease, of course most of us will never lift much more than a water bottle over our heads!) just look at your own progress. I stopped going to the gym because muscle weakness caused fatigue and I started falling over and off things such as the elliptical trainer snd treadmill. Physically I am no better off than I was 10, 20 years ago.\n\nI should have made that more clear perhaps. i was diagnosed at age 4, suffered with jdm for years and had another attack when i was 12. im 22 now also (wow!) and have been in remission for some time, but to answer your question: yes, absolutely. mine was worst in my hips, thighs, and abdomen, and while i had to use a wheelchair most of my life im able to just use a cane now (or nothing if im feeling well!!) ive come a long way but i still cant get up the stairs without a struggle, and i cant open water bottles to save my life \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nlet me just say though: youre not lazy. being lazy isnt inherently bad, and jdm is rough at the best of times. if you cant do something or your body is telling you not to or that it doesnt want to, then dont!! but not a day goes by where i dont feel weak. i dont think its ever going to get much better for me, but the right exercises do help me a lot!!\n\nif you ever need someone to talk to about your experiences just shoot me a dm :) most people develop something called a heliotrope rash, fingernails change color, and occasionally ulcers in the mouth. it depends person to person (i have a permanent set of scars under my eyes from the rash, it never went away). a big thing too is increased sensitivity to sunlight exposure and weakness in the body. when i first got it i couldnt sit up in bed or walk on my own. i would look into it!! apologies if my information isnt 100% correct, the science may have changed since i got diagnosed in 2002 Thank you for all of your helpful information! I hope you are doing well!!!! Are you better now than you were at the beginning? absolutely!! i appreciate your kind words, im doing much better than i was, but its still rough going!! i hope youre doing well, too \ud83d\ude0a\n\nim able to walk now without aid in the house but its bad for my knees so i wear braces on both legs most of the time. over time i developed a lot of conditions due to the jdm like costochondritis, arthritis, lipodystrophy, gastroparesis, fibromyalgia, and was separately diagnosed with some hereditary neuropathy. so a day to day can get pretty rough sometimes, but with a cane/wheelchair im doing great!! i actually went out for a short hike yesterday and although i get tired really easily ive definitely built up some strength in the past few years!! i hope this helped and if you have any more questions dont hesitate to ask!! Im so glad you are doing better!  Keep up the good progress!  All my best!", "Requesting opinions on my knuckle rash  Have had this rash for a couple of years now, started on one hand and has since spread to both.  Most of the time it is purplish, does not hurt or itch at all. I have considerable pain in my left hip and Lowe back area, have noticed increasing muscle weakness as the pain has gotten worse. I did see my GP about twelve months ago and asked him to run bloods which came back not showing any significant immuno markers, so he dismissed it as a harmless rash or some form of ecxema. I frequently also have little sores pop upon my legs and arms that flake when scratched and usually leave a brown mark when healed. Not sure if significant but my mother has Lupus and has had a large calcification removed from her abdomen several years ago.  Any input would be appreciated, I want asuch information as possible before I return to my GP and look for further diagnosis. I am unable to post a pic of my hands. They are a hot mess. My drs did the same thing to me. Labs every week. No explanation.  I got so bad I almost died. But here in Arizona, we have an excellent hospital call Mayo.  And they saved my life.i will post pics so you could see. I use a rose oil. Cost about 3 bucks. Dr said to keep skin from drying.  Keep hands and skin moisturized. ALL THE TIME. So they dont crack. I think you need to get a full bloodwork. There are many markers that are not typically run that should be run that could indicate you have something. Have you seen a rheumatologist ? Thanks for the tip about the rose oil, I will pick some up today. Great to hear that you found help at the Mayo, sounds like things had got pretty bad for you up until then. Have not seen a Rheumatologist yet, will be asking my GP for a referral when I see him next. From the little research I have done so far it seems a lot of people are not diagnosed properly early on. I know there is definitely something going on in my body and it is starting to progress quickly now, so the sooner I can get a definitive answer the better. Thanks for your reply. Fyi. Watch your elbows. Feet . Scalp. Oh and mouth like canker sores and weird painful spots on your tongue. One of the indicators for dm is broken capillaries at the cuticle. Not usually visible with the naked eye. Not saying this is what you have, could be anything. Bloodwork is a must. Go to the Rheumatologist. DO NOT wait. It progresses. Shame on your doctor for dismissing it and not running further blood tests. Did you get an answer yet?", "Muscle stiffness and DM Does anyone have any experience with their muscles feeling very *stiff* as a result of their DM? I am still waiting for my final diagnosis (and biopsy results from last week), but the last few days rather than feeling pain during muscle activity I have just been experiencing stiffness, especially in my upper arms. The weakness is still the same, but now I feel like I do not have the same range of motion as I used to - for example I can **barely** reach my arms behind myself to unclasp my bra, and reaching down to put on my socks feels worse and worse every day, like my muscles simply cannot bend that way anymore... does stiffness in the muscles like this sound familiar to anyone else? That is how I felt before being medicated.  Are you currently medicated? My wife was like that before starting her meds. She still has trouble climbing up stairs and inclines but it is much better.\n\nI recommend starting yoga or Tai chi or something if you want to increase chances of maintaining decent strength and flexibility. Nutrition and exercise are vital.\n\nWe just got back from a 4 day conference by the Myositis Association and I think they were putting the presentations up on their web site. Good stuff. That happened to me, too. Stretching really helps. My shoulders are still stiff and weird five years in, but doing yoga or just stretching CONSISTENTLY makes a big differene. Not yet, still waiting for the doctors to decide what to do. Did medication help with that for you? Like it went away? When the ck levels came back as high, my doctor put me on prednisone (though as of now, I am off) right away before the biopsy, only because my levels were really high (6000+) and they would not really affect the results of the test.  It helped a lot and helped the stiffness/soreness reduce so it was not difficult to get out of bed, or take a shower, or even bend.  But it was not immediately for me.  It took a few years to get it normal range (just this past Spring) . Moving helps a lot to keep them flexible, as many have said.  I know I should try yoga but I am just so tired when I get home and have to start making dinner, or running around somewhere.  But my job is a bit physical and I am pushing carts, on my feet, lifting etc so that helps too.  It just sucks that I have to keep moving in a pace that is a bit beyond I can do (I am pressed on time with my job) so I do get a bit overworked.  But if you have a sit-down job, try to walk around or stretch your legs and arms a bit to keep them working.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough my ck levels are normal, the DM gave me arthritis so my muscles are not sore... but my joints and oddly enough, the meds I take (many meds for DM treat RA) has not really helped the joints lol.  They are better than a year ago, but I think the damage has already settled in before I got officially diagnosed.  But if work or doing daily things are difficult, I will at least ask if they can give you prednisone to help reduce the inflammation.  There' booster pack thingys that lasts for like a week, at least until you get the biopsy done,  It really does affect work performance and just doing every day things.  A anti-inflammation diet is good too. My doctors just got the results of the biopsy now and they have diagnosed me with DM. I start treatment on Monday, prednisone and methotrexate. Hoping it will have a positive effect, we shall see. I am due to have a consultation with a physical therapist too, so I am hoping they can help with ways to (reasonably) stay active. Any advice for me RE: medication? I am really grateful for your response! You will probably do a few lab tests to see if your levels are going down and to watch out for your liver. I was on methotrexate, but it raised my liver enzymes, so I am on a different maintenance medication.\n\nHopefully the PT and maybe OT if youbhave hand issues, can tell you about household items you can buy to help make every day tasks a bit easier. Good luck! Absolutely how I felt when mine started to affect my muscles.\n\nMaking a fist became harder and harder until I could not. And I would look at my hands and wonder why, but the range of motion was just gone.", "I thought I was alone. Hello everyone, I am 20 year old female that no longer thinks she is the only one in the world with DM. Thank you. Back in 2017, I suddenly broke out with a rash on my eyelids. My skin was completely raw and extremely painful. With time it healed and over about a year I started having worsening joint issues. My mom, who has RA (auto immune issues run in my family) brought me to her rhumotologist who got bloodwork done. He noticed one of the inflammation levels were 20x what it was supposed to be, but everything else was normal. The doctor believed I may have DM, but it was not active yet. So, he prescribed some meds and I saw him every 4 months with blood work. My last appointment was last week, and it came back that my muscle enzymes were 10x what they are meant to be. I have developed what my doctor is calling lesions on my knuckles, muscle weakness has progressed and very mild chest pains. My doctor thinks that the DM is active, so I got prescribed steroids, more bloodwork, a chest X-ray (DM is associated with ILD) and I need to document my hands. Since the appointment I have done a lot of research, but the outcomes are never good. Cancer, lung issues, muscle weakness, skin flare ups. I do not know what to do with this. I am terrified. I am not ready to live the rest of my life in treatment for this disease. My life has not even started yet. I am 35, and had it for just over a year.  I am no expert. And I do not have it as bad as some, nowhere near.  But we can all sympathise with how you are feeling, however, the silver lining is that you are extremely lucky/fortunate in some aspects. \n\n1.  You have obviously got a doctor who knows his stuff.  And you have been keeping an eye out.\n\n2.  It is a managed disease.  Your life is definitely not over. \n\n3. You are young, which means you are in a much better position than you are typical DM sufferer.\n\n4.  Reading bad cases online is no good for you.  You can read some case studies of some very unlucky people.  But as you have said, you are a spring chicken.  And do not forget  20% of people go into remission within 5 years.\n\nYou will have bad days.  There will be times where your hands or joints hurt so much you will cry.  You will be scared of flare ups and you will worry about the next time your meds get adjusted. Because you and I, and all of us on here, have a serious condition.\n\nBut you will have good days too.  Sometimes you will forget about being ill. You will enjoy everything you enjoyed before.  It will not taint your whole life.\n\nYou have got a lot going for you.  Share your worries with people, and read around this Reddit. Everyone has experienced something different. And it is not all bad! Thank you so much. This helped me a lot. I am glad.  It is definitely not all doom and gloom, but keep an eye on your breathing and swallowing. I am in the UK and my specialist always asks if I can swallow ok.  And do not downplay anything to your doctor.\n\nHow are you finding your symptoms since starting steroids? Prednisone? I am on prednisone. Symptoms like joints aching, hands hurting, lesions on my knuckles, have not really suppressed. I have been on them a week. Prednisone helps my muscle and joint aches. Initially I was on 40mg/day. No I am down to 5mg/day.  I can feel it if I miss a dose, so you should have felt some response after a week.\n\nAre you on anything else?\n\nIve got hydroxychloriquine for my hands(this one really did help the lesions and scabby cuticles).\n\nAnd methotrexate, 20mg once a week.  Which is my main anti inflammatory.\n\nYou could discuss what else to go along side steroids at your next meeting. Wow! I am also 20 years old and I was diagnosed with dermatomyositis in 2017!! It was horrible for me since I randomly flared up. My face was red and purple and puffy and peeling horribly and it was so difficult and painful for me to even walk or and to even lay down in bed. And on top of that, it was a month before my senior prom. It was horrible. But honestly I have come to realize that it was the best thing to happen to me. I have grown so much from this experience... I still do have flare ups but honestly what has helped me so much is going plant based.. I know so many people roll their eyes when someone says \u201cgo vegan\u201d but it truly did help me. I have also been looking into Ayurveda, I believe that since going plant based really did help me. and being the less swollen patient according to my rheumatologist after making this decision; then I could possibly heal myself with natural remedies. I know it sounds crazy. But I believe I can do it. I feel like nature does have the answer and solution to everything. I have just been so tired of being on steroids and low dosage chemo and infusions and having random mood swings. After going plant based, i feel the difference. It is beautiful what nature can do. I am still on this journey I just started but I am very confident about it! Hi, just thought I would see how you were getting on?  How are your joints/meds helping? I feel good. The bumps on my knuckles are going down. My joints feel the best they have in years. I am able to do a full squat and get back up without getting stuck! Unfortunately, the steroids have caused me to break out horribly on my face but I am slowly getting weened off so that will go away. Thank you for checking up! That is good to hear. Glad you are doing better. Hello my dear. I am a 32 yo Female. Was diagnosed at 29. I used to work out every day. Was extremely into fitness. Once I got sick, I was bedridden for months. It hit me all within about 2 weeks. I had horrible joint pain, muscle pain, and a little bit of a rash on my eyes. I could not barely get out of bed, take the stairs, brush my own hair (could not lift my arms). I thought I was dying and was in so much pain that I wanted to.\nI have gone through a lot trying to find the right doctor and the right treatment. I am finally healthy and in medicated remission. I do not feel any pain any more. I am slowly trying to come off my meds. I can work out lightly now - I am trying to gain back all the muscle and some of the weight I lost. Things will get better! I am in a much better place now than I was 2.5 years ago. And I know that 1 year from now I will be even better! Hang in there. You are going to be okay!", "Curcumin and magnesium for pain Hi folks,\n\nAnyone had any luck with phasing out opiates in favour of alternatives like curcumin and magnesium? \n\nI have just started taking curcumin, and have bought some magnesium oil to put on at night. \n\nAny one recommend anything else? Tylenol scheduled and diclofenac topical Curcumin has very poor bioavailability. The current science does not support its use in medicine but it does not necessarily suggest you should avoid it either. That being said, high doses can cause severe gastroenterological issues including reflux, an already common problem for dermatomyositis patients.\n\nPersonally, based on the research I have done, I would consider it to be as effective as most other supplements. I am sure it is probably a very nice sugar pill.\n\n Thank you! I have bought a small bottle so will see how it goes but, yeah, maybe I am just paying lots of money for some nice placebos...\n\nI am trying to get off the codeine because it causes constipation...but it works though, that is the problem. Thanks - I have read some great stuff about topical diclofenac. I have got to check with my doctor that I can take it as NSAIDs are not recommended for my other meds. I use micro doses of weed to help with pain. Like \\~3-5mg helps a lot and also does not really get me high either.", "Does this look like dermatomyositis? I am 22 year old male and am currently taking accutane. These bumps are on both hands. Pretty worried  It kind of looks like mine did when I got diagnosed. Does it flare up in the sun? What set mine off was a week-long lake vacation where I was outside all the time. I am not entirely sure. It it is a little bit on my hands too. They look like little pimples though and I think I could pop them. They look like yours? Accutane can cause rashes so I hope that is what it is It could just be the Accutane then! My lesions were not \"poppable\". Were they raised and red? Did they kind of look like pimples a bit? I am sorry to ask so many questions I just have really bad anxiety They were raised and red and mostly on my knuckles. I would say they were more like hard bumps though. I also had bad inflammation on my cuticles. That was the thing that was the hardest to get rid of. So strange. How are you doing with it now? I am meeting with my dermatologist over Zoom this morning to express my concerns. What did the knuckle bumps look like at the beginning? I am lucky and caught it super early on so never had muscle involvement. I took hydroxychloroquine for nine years until last fall and have been off of it since. So far, so good. My cuticles are still sensitive though (for example if I were to get a manicure where they push your cuticles back they would flare up) and I try to use protection in the sun. I am glad you are seeing your derm. Good luck! I am very happy for you! I hope that it continues! Did the papules hurt early on? And thank you! I do not remember them being chronically painful. Just uncomfortable when irritated. Do you get any rashes any where else? It is on my other hand too. I had a rash on the inside of my arms bilaterally but those went away after using moisturizer. My dermatologist thinks it is from the accutane and is going to prescribe a steroid cream. I am still so anxious though. Does it look suspicious to you To be completely honest I get thoes rashes on my knuckles as well I was diagnosed in 2010 with dm ranards and ra when i was diagnosed i couldent walk up stairs or really do much of any thing.  typically a rash on your knuckles is not the first place you get a rash with dm it does happen tho.  have you had any muscle or joint weakness ? Does it get worse when your in the sun? It almost looks like ecsama have you use eczema lotion on it? i use it for mine just to keep my skin from cracking and to keep it from itching. No weakness that I have really noticed. Accutane is a medication that can really dry skin out so I hope that is what it is. Were the bumps on your knuckles red? How has living with Dm been for you? And I am not sure if it gets worse in the sun or not. This has all been really freaking me out Life with dm are not been bad I do not want to sugarcoat it there has been some very difficult times for me but I know other people that have it that it is been more of an inconvenience then a big problem How did you get it diagnosed? I got invited to a doctor conference type thing where lots of doctors come in and see you to try to figure out what is wrong with you and at the end of the day there was a old Dr that came in looked at me and smiled then left then all the Drs I had seen that day came in and started looking at what the old Dr was telling them to look at then they said you have dm we think then there was a bunch of lab tests.  kind of an odd story but that is how I was diagnosed My hands looked like that during the peak of my dermatomytositis. Is it itchy and uncomfortable too? It is not itchy or very uncomfortable at all. Were yours? I hope it is just the accutane If I put steroid cream on and it goes away am I in the clear? From the sounds of it it doesint sound like it is acting like mine will during a flair how ever I am not a Dr and everyone is different What does yours act like during a flair? Appreciate all your help. My derm is monitoring it It was more irritating if anything and it got a little more red. Doctors prescribed triamcinolone which helped alleviate the irritation Did you have any other symptoms? My muscles deteriorated, I was barely able to walk and eat, my arms and legs were covered in rashes, I lost so much weight due to my inability to eat, lost some hair, my immune system was pretty weak by the peak of my illness too. My muscles deteriorated, I was barely able to walk and eat, my arms and legs were covered in rashes, I lost so much weight due to my inability to eat, lost some hair, my immune system was pretty weak by the peak of my illness too. Was this while you had the rash? I do not have any of those symptoms so I hope that this is just from the accutane. I am really worried about it This was while you had the rash? The rash came after everything else started Oh okay. How old were you when you were diagnosed if you do not mind me asking? Hopefully this is just from the accutane for me This was late 2018 so I was 31. You doing okay now? I am doing much better these days. It was an agonizing road but I got better. Thanks for asking. Of course. I am really happy to hear that!! Keep on being strong Thank you! Make sure your derm is legit. He may not have a clue about Dermatomyositis. I have had to change dermatologists! If he suspected DM he will ask for a skin biopsy. Otherwise, you will just get the same treatment you have been getting. He does not suspect Dermatomyositis because once I stopped taking accutane the bumps mostly disappeared. After starting again the bumps returned. Would not the bumps stay for good if it was truly Dermatomyositis? Yes I believe so. It looks like some sort of dermatitis to my nonexpert eye. Like poison ivy, etc. Thank you. I really appreciate tour comment. I think it could very well be induced by the accutane You are welcome. Look up various side effects to acutane. I have a terrible fungal infection which was the side effect of one if my meds. Dropped the med, but infection is unresolved. Side effects can be brutal, but hopefully you do not have Dermatomyositis!! It is way worse!!!\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c I hope not as well! Do you have Dermatomyositis? Oh yes. Since the summer of 2010. I was in remission for 3-4 years. But I began a stinkin' flare in January and the pandemic in March. Active isolation. Instacart and Amazon are our friends. Hahahahaha! I am sorry to here about your flare! Is it a lot of muscle pain and weakness? I am glad to hear you have been able to have things sent to you though. Hopefully things will become more normal in the world! Doing well though! Blessings sweetheart!", "Gottron Papules? (more info in comments)  Hello DM Community!\n\nThe link to my Imgur photo album above shows photos taken today of both thumbs.  I (41F) have been getting bumps like this, mainly on my thumbs, for \\~8 years now.  They start out reddish and become more flesh-tone... and get drier and a little flaky as they begin to disappear.  Sometimes, there are more smaller bumps on other fingers.  Once they were so bad on both thumbs and all fingers AND on my left elbow.  I saw a dermatologist, and she biopsied a section of the small bumps from my elbow.  The results were \"non-specific.\"  I am not certain, but if I had to guess, I would say the bumps present 2-3 times per year.  About once a year, I will search the internet for keywords and look through pictures and articles in hopes of finding some possible answers.  Today, I discovered an article about Dermatomyositis.  It mentioned some things that hit home a bit.  I occasionally notice severe muscle tenderness (I will casually scratch an itchy area near my flank or upper arm, for example, and it will feel like I have instantly bruised it).  I regularly have Globus Sensation (lump in throat) that I believe is caused by anxiety and treat with Clonazepam on an as-needed basis.  My hands are quick to go numb, so I adjust their position often.  I have had GI problems since I was about 20yo, including stomach ulcers.  I literally ALWAYS have my sunglasses with me (on top my head when not in use every single day) because of photo sensitivity.  Another thing that was mentioned in the article that I can relate to is silicone breast implants (I got in 2006) saying, \"Dermatomyositis may be initiated or exacerbated following silicone breast implants or collagen injections. However, the implications of such findings remain unknown and more data is required to establish the association.\"  I have an appointment with my GP in 2 days.  I really want to ask her for autoimmune testing just to see what the outcome will be.  I want to thank you for taking the time to look at my photos and read my story.  If you have anything to say, any advice, any experience, any questions, anything...please comment or PM me, and thank you so much in advance! I have dermatomyositis and my grotton\u2019s are more red and very sore. \nNot saying those are not though. Thank you for your response. Several days ago, mine were more red. They have passed the itchy point and have become painful and make the joints feel achy and tight. This is about the halfway point. They will become lighter and then start drying out and go away soon.  I think next time I get them, I will take a series of photos to show more detail of how they begin and end. Curious...is your skin color the same as mine? I just wonder if mine do not appear as red as yours due to my slight olive complexion. I read about some differences in the appearance of the bumps depending on the patient\u2019s skin color. I am very pale. My redness looks almost purple/blue at times.", "HELP! Would appreciate all the help I can get! More information in comments!  I had these red spots appear on my hand and forearms back in November. They were not itchy, bumpy or dry, and lasted a couple days. I was worried about them to begin with but did not think much of it once they started fading, however I now have similar spots appear on the bottoms of my feet and they are extremely itchy but still no bumps or dryness. I have an eczema cream which has been prescribed to me for eczema that flares up on my face, tried using it to ease the itchiness as well as a socking my feet but nothing seems to help. I have tried researching online on what it could be but I have not been able to find anything with the same or similar symptoms. I would appreciate if someone could suggested what they think it might be or something to help with the itchiness. Thank you! Do you have dermatomyositis or are you asking if you might? Asking if I might, and if it is not if anyone would know what it might be. The rashes associated with dermatomyositis are normally found on the eyelids, face, and knuckles. They are not itchy; they are photosensitive, red, sometimes dry and plaquey. You need to see a dermatologist if this problem persists.  Is a start, also see a rheumatologist This can happen in syphilis", "Dermatomyositis? Hi everyone, \n\nI hope everyone is doing well and staying safe!\n\nI have had this redness + patches on my right hand for about 3 weeks (I do not want to call it a rash because it is not itchy at all). Dr thinks it is dermatitis (it appeared after renovating my flat and using chemicals however it is been over 3 weeks now) but I have got the feeling he was very quick to come up with a diagnosis. \n\nDoes it look similar to what some of you have experienced? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany thanks for your help. Compared to my I say no. But everyone is different.", "Beginning of Dermatomyositis rash?? Noticed it on both hands a month ago. Muscle weakness, muscle pain and tenderness, etc since January are among the other symptoms. Anybody have similar experience? Would appreciate any responses.  I would definitely go in and get it checked. Are you previously diagnosed? If so, yeah, that looks like the start of something. :/  That is how my hands look. Anything on your face, chest, or around your neck? Thank you both for the responses. I have not been diagnosed as of yet but am scheduled with a rheumatologist next month due to a positive ana. My GP informed me the antibody that was found is more related to SLE but the rash had me puzzled. I have only noticed it on my hands. Is it supposed to be painful? Other than the muscle pain and occasional joint pain throughout my body I have no pain associated with the rash.  The dm rash covers the joints just like yours. Lupus rash is supposed to be in between the joints. I have both. Is the rash painful for you?  Yea my hands get really sore. The rash everywhere else itches, but not on my hands. My hands occasionally get sore but it is never constant. I appreciate the response though!  Hey we got to stick together! Yes we do!  I have no pain with my DM rash.  It can sometimes just get itchy and flakey in an extremely bad flare up.\n\nWatch for the rash on your chest/face as well.   Mine has yet to itch or flake over and the rash is only on my hands so far but I will look out for it elsewhere. If you do not mind me asking, what were the first symptoms that you noticed?  I do not mind at all! :)\n\nMuscle weakness in my wrists and thickening cuticles as well as reddening and dilated capillaries just below my cuticles.  Shortly after that I started to get a the rash on my joints etc. Was the muscle weakness only limited to your wrists? Seems I have been having the weakness in my right hand and legs as well which makes me want to think it is something completely different than DM.  Nope, it went absolutely everywhere as I got sicker.  Even the muscles in my forehead.  It just started in my wrists, then my thighs.  Then it slowly progressed to the rest of my body.  \n\nNow it is mostly inflammation and pain since I am medicated, but I can do most things like everyone else.  Just a little slower. The slowness definitely sounds like me I constantly have to push myself. I hate it. As far as the weakness it is really just my hands and legs so far and my legs feel like \u201cjello\u201d after very little exercise.  But I do appreciate you commenting, I hope all goes well with you!  Jello is a fantastic way to describe it actually!  Same for me.\n\nI hope you get the answers you want from doctors and can improve soon! Thank you! This is my first post on reddit. I have/had the hand rash too though I personally think the first sign of my DM was the extremely dry skin on my fingers (mainly my right hand)  though I have told doctors it was a pain in my neck I woke up to one day. (the hands happened several months prior, but i thought nothing of it as juat maybe my hands were getting too irritated from the chemicals at work)  My rash is not that bad now but it is permanent, along with random calluses here and there, a lump on both my hands' backside (it gave me tendinitis and) and occasional swelling since now I also have arthritis too yaay. \n\nI hope the best. It is not fun dealing with (was officially diagnosed in October 2016) but I am managing. The swelling only appeared on my hands, but I think I have a rash on my stomach. Not itchy or anything, but I do want to get it checked out. People with DM/myositis have a higher chance of cancer. Just now my insurance's specialist and other things have went up in copay. I hope you already have answers, this being a couple months old, but I also know how long it took to get my diagnosis. My Hands were the first thing I noticed, I think. The Rashes, which look like yours even in remission, as well as dropping random stuff, bc unusual Distal Weakness, were the reason for the initial delay, but those Papules are pretty \u201cclassic\u201d.  \n\nThere was def more to it than just the rashes and weakness or whatever but my experience was similar. All the best wishes!", "Just diagnosed. No clue what this disease even is. Any insight as to seriousness appreciated.  Hi! I have been living with dermatomyositis for the past 5 years. I was diagnosed when I was 23. What is so difficult about auto immune diseases is everyone experiences them differently which makes it hard to diagnose right away. The sure give away you have it would be to look at your cuticles. If you have little blood vessels surrounding them it is usually a good indicator. If you want to DM me I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. It is scary at first but very livable. That the thing! I do not have the little blood cuticles or anything like that. And never have. They did a small biopsy and it came back as dermatomyositis. I wonder if I could be misdiagnosed? Skin symptoms might show up later? It could possibly also be another type of myositis, such as polymyositis or inclusion body myositis which do not include any/much of the skin element, but I do not know anything about those.  It took a lot of doctors before we found someone who would heard of it, and it seems to really only be confined to dermatologists and rheumatologists. It is important to remember that it is a muscular disease as well as dermatological and neurological.\n\nFor us, the myositis (muscle weakening) showed up much later than the skin symptoms, and some of the blood stats never really showed the expected lows, so it does present in a lot of different ways. My mum got really, seriously ill from it for a year (could not swallow anything or lift her arms at all), but she recovered really well with medication (a shortish course of prednisolone and still on methotrexate) and is mostly fine now (she also got the cancer). We actually know someone else who had it at the same time (no cancer showed up), and her hair and fingers were primarily affected, and she is absolutely fine now.\n\nDo not know if that helps, but it is a very varied disease and it is possible to recover very well from it too. Best of luck and feel free to ask if this was helpful in any way! Also, my mum also started showing on her breast and forehead a good while before it spread to her back/hands, etc. Interesfing. Thank you for the information. I had one visit to the dermatologist and that is why I am just a little in shock. No other real symptoms. Hickey like rash on my neck and arm: what was the time lapse between the rash and muscle symptoms? And the cancer? Well, she actually got diagnosed with two types of cancer and the dm over a three months or so. There is no real saying whether one of them was tied to the dm or not. One of the cancers was going for three years or so before we found out about it, so I think it is unlikely that that one is connected to it. \n\nThe dm may have occurred at the same as the other one. Dm might indicate cancer, but it also might not, and there are a lot of uncertainties about the link between them. I know the cancer link sounds really worrying, but you can also see it as a type of early warning system that you would do well to get checked more often than other peolle. I think (definitely not a doctor) that cancers would be indicated in your blood stats, which you say are fine, so you should be good. \n\nMy mum began having little energy and staying in bed a lot in November, then she slowly developed the chess/forehead rash. She started having difficulty swallowing around February, I think, which also worsened very slowly, and by May/June, I think, the rash was severe everywhere and very itchy and she was losing hair and could barely swallow anything. The muscle weakness only came on innn... late July maybe, with the thighs and the upper arms being sore, and it snuck up on us very slowly. \n\nShe was misdiagnosed at first though and took a looong time to go to the doctor in the first place, so obviously this is quite an extreme case. The dm was only officially diagnosed in August because the expected blood stats and muscle weakness had not shown up. It kind of helped us to google pictures of DM to find similar cases with unusual symptom developments and compare rashes and such. There is not that much information out there as it is so rare, so it was very valuable to find info on these sorts of platforms. \n\nAgain, as long as you are in treatment for it, you should be alright, do not want to scare you. It sounds like they have caught it early and that you are in good hands! :) \n\nAlso, greasy lotions with steroids were a god's send for the rashes. Thank your I am a little in shock as I am a healthy 37 year old woman. I suppose it is nice to have an early warning sign for cancer. I am not actually in treatment, tho. I made an appointment with a rheumatologist, but they could not take me for a month or so, so now it is just a waiting game. \n\nI really appreciate all of this information. Thank you so much. How is your mom, now? I have also had DM for 5 years, diagnosed when I was 23. Must be something in the air! If OP has questions I would be happy to help too. Best advice is to find a specialist who works with DM patients. My experience with general rheumatologists has been mixed. Do remember that there is not always a link to cancer as well. :) The important thing is that you do have a date with a rheumatologist coming up - and if he/she turns out to suck, be prepared to press on for more doctors and speak up for yourself (sometimes making a timeline to present and writing down anything you think might be a symptom can be a good idea too). Advocate for yourself. But fingers crossed for this rheumatologist, hopefully they will be great. For us, the rheumatologists were very helpful! (As were the dermatologists.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is much, much better, thanks. There have been some ups and downs, but the dm, though not gone, is under control, and she is recovering well (touch wood). :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck to you! Hi! I am 32 years old and i live in Boston too! I know some great doctors in the area to check out and definitely have some advice.  Feel free to DM if you want to chat! Yaaaaaas thank you, Brendamnit. I will DM you TL;DR It is very serious and difficult to treat. Tread carefully and prioritize your health and recovery. \n\nI had juvenile DM (13) with sporadic relapses until I was 26. As you can tell by the name of the disease, it can impact skin and muscles. Skin meaning horribly itchy rash and muscles meaning severe fatigue and weakness. The most aggravating areas will be different for everyone but for me it was my arms and my neck. When I was first diagnosed, at its worst, I lost the ability to walk or get off the ground on my own and could not eat solids. \n\nAs an adult, I have experienced bad relapses with blistering rashes (less muscle weakness now). Qualitatively speaking, this is a chronic disease that creeps on you but once it builds momentum, it is a deadly serious free fall. The key impo is early management of inflammation. The only thing that worked for me long-term was lifestyle changes and consistent exercise. DM is also absolutely magnified by mental stress, like any autoimmune disease. \n\nTreatment options are uberlimited. Prednisone is absolutely horrid for the body with its side effects but the key medication - methotrexate is basically chemotherapy designed to weaken your immune system. Everything else is random medication that they think could potentially work but with inconsistent evidence. If you cannot tell, my experience with doctors has been lackluster bc they are limited by what they can prescribe. Thank you for this blunt information. I really need it. No idea what to expect here. Are you still effected by this disease? Are you in remission? When you say, \u2018Life style changes\u2019 do you mean 100% anti inflammatory diet? Yeah, no problem. I am no longer affected but also not 100% cured. What I mean to say is I am still aware that my body under stress deteriorates a lot faster than other folks who are \u2018healthy\u2019.\n\nBut I went into remission when I was 25-26 (now 32). What happened was I got fed up and went off my meds cold turkey (which I do not recommend bc going off prednisone abruptly can cause kidney shock but I did not know any better at the time) and committed to healthy eating/exercise every day. That for me was veggie/fruit smoothies with very minimal anything else. I focused exclusively on rest and exercise. Keep in mind - this was to beat a relapse. I had to quit my job and move back in with my parents but my back and neck were covered in a blistering rash that I had to wrap in Vaseline and bandages because it was so painful - it was do or die for me. And it worked thankfully the sudden reversal in lifestyle was extreme and uncomfortable but it got me over my relapse faster in 2 months. Medicine had not helped in over 6 months. But I only think it worked because I did not wait any longer. \n\nThe emphasis on lifestyle changes is important for me bc for autoimmune conditions, it is important for me to feel like I can do something however small because I have been told all my life there is no cure. This disease is disruptive and frustrating and the medications that help control it are equally damaging to the body (speaking as a Immunology major). Also, honestly, I spent a lot of time mistreating my body (no exercise, junk food, bad sleep, etc) which in hindsight, hindered recovery. \n\nBut the most important thing to remember to as you deal with this disease is that you should be kind to yourself. Your body is at war with itself. Do not push yourself, let yourself rest, find peace mentally and try to the best of your ability to translate that physically. Thank you for all the insight. Every single anecdote helps. \nI am not on any medications yet. I do not see a specialist until the 23rd. \nI think the hard part is that I am already very good to my body. 8-9 hours of sleep every night. I eat organic, balanced, healthy meals. (Went anti-inflammatory diet the minute I found out I had an autoimmune disease) \nI do not exercise more than walking, but have been trying to get more involved. I am lucky I have good genes and did not need to for aesthetic purposes. My job is super stressful and I believe that is why I am having these attacks. \nCan I ask what state you had treatment in? \nDo you have scars from your blisters??\nMy attack in Feb left a scar, my attack this month was a totally different kind of rash. \nDo you have experience with that? Different kinds of rashes? Hi! I have been formally diagnosed in late 2016 after experiencing random pains and weakness about a year prior. Right now, I am 30. Once getting blood work done saying about the anti jo something, and having a CK level of 6000 (and I was still working on my feet for 8 hours!) I was prescribed prednisone. But doing research shows it is quite bad in the long run. It helped reduced the weakness and pain from my limbs, shoulders, neck, etc but long term use can cause bone deterioration. It was quite scary at first, and I have cried many times when I could not do simple things (took me 10 minutes to get out of a bathtub...) but it took time for treatment to become fully effective. I was put on methotrexate in early 2017, but in two months, raised my liver enzymes so I had to stop. I told my rheumatologist that I did not want to be on prednisone for long, and she did an infusion treatment (rituxan) and switched me to a new maintenance medication (azothioprine)  I slowly got off the prednisone and my numbers slowly went down. I am now in normal range but sadly, it gave me arthritis. \n\nSo as of right now, I am not having much of the muscle inflammation, but more joint issues (and I think the DM already did some permanent damage)  than anything. I do PT/OT which helps. I take vitamin d and try to eat more protein and such. Though this all chnaged my diet and appetite. Like, I do not crave for much (and was improperly taking my azothioprine so I was throwing up) Currently, I stopped my meds, trying to prepare for maternity some time this year and a bit nervous because of it.\n\nSo some of my symptoms are sore/swollen hands and I have a two hunchbacks on the back of ny hands due to the arthritis. My feet get sore, and so do thighs. I have cycles of things that hurt. My fingers as of now stopped cracking and bleeding, but sometimes gets purple around the joints. I do not have dysphagia but I did had very slight issues with constant chewing or opening my mouth wide. I think it went away once my levels went waaay down. I had a muscle biopsy done, so not only do I have to make sure I do not put myself in a position to get hurt (we get hurt and bruise easlily and intensely than others) I have to make sure my leg does not get hit because it is still sensitive there.\n\nI think the worse is the mornings because you never know how the day will be. I used to hate getting up, the pain, the motor control ugh... You are practically a young person in an old person's body. Just know the risk of cancer is higher for us sadly, so your doctor(s) may ask for certain scans or tests like a pulmonary function test (if lungs are ok), CT scan for bone density, xrays, mri, lots of blood test. Even if it were fine, depending ob your treatment, it may have to br watched to make sure your liver anf other organs are fine and not due to treatment. Also, if you are experiencing weakness and pain and even if medication may stop it or relieve for a bit, still good to get items that will help you manage. Sunblock, maybe a can, placard if you have issues walking and well... See if your state offers the medical marijuana program to help relieve pain. I wish I was on it definitely 2 years ago.\n\nI hope you are able to manage. I am still learning new things and adjusting how I live. My OT said, \"Work smarter, not harder.\" I live in Jersey. I do not havr much knowledge except for the one place I have been going anf it is only be for 3 years. I do not get much of the rashes (though I have something on my stomach I want checked out)\n\nA huge factor is being active. It sucks but works. Though reading, I am not seeing much about the muscle weakness but never know if it will come later. I guess it really does affect people differently. They might do a topical prednisone? But make sure to ask if that will be long term since that medicine is bad in the long run Wow, so much information. Thank you! I am also looking to get pregnant which is why this really could not happen at a worse time. \nWhat is the advice you have from your doctors? There is very little information about Dermatomyositis and pregnancy. Also, what city are you located in? I would say try to wait till your body is a bit stable and in remission. That is what my rheumatologist told me. I also consulted the obgyn and high risk because you will be considered high risk. That doctor was very nice and reminded me that when  we do decide, my well being is of importance; the fetus is secondary. It will be important to know how well your body does without meds, how you can handle it during the duration, etc. Also, depending on the meds you may potentially be on, you might have to wait a year (if doing IV, you are supposed to wait a year to conceive) or you might decide to be on it. Some meds are of a certain classification and may be used during pregnancy. I rather not and see how I do because we already are at risk, and at risk for the baby to develop things. I rather not up risks any more.  Just there is not much info on azothioprine and pregnancy out there so doctors suggest you do not take while pregnant (no real tests have been done) Miscarriage was not his potential concern because anything can cause it and not necessarily the DM. But just know it is a higher chance of happening. \n\nSo far, I am not doing too bad since I have been off my maintenance meds for about a month or 2. I have bad days, but did even on the meds. June would be my more \"out of the clear\" time since my last infusion was June 2018. I live in Burlington County, NJ This is great information. Thank you! I am not on meds, yet. Have not even seen the specialist, yet. How long do attack\u2019s typically last? I have had this rash for a month now. It is going to away on my neck but is still there on my arm. \nI am not sure if I have had the muscle weakness due to a spinal cord injury. So now everything feels kind of week. Especially on rainy days. \nI had a weird throat weakness thing over the winter when my epiglottis slammed shut on me while I was sleeping and jolted me awake. I passed it off due to anxiety or something of the like, but it seems a little too much like DM to be just coincidence. Well, I am not sure to call mine \"attacks.\" I got officially diagnosed October 2016, but had it a year before.  For me so far, it was about getting my CK levels under control which took until last year around August to see a steady, lowering CK level.  My last test showed I am in normal range.  So let us hope I stay that way for a while.  I just took another test today since I see my rheumatologist next week.  I also know for me, I will have good days and bad days. Yesterday was a worse day than usual.  Gradually, my body and hands started to ache as well as my hips and inner thighs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo your limbs, neck/shoulders ache a lot, and feel weak?  Do things feel heavy as you lift them, or you cannot hold yourself up as you bend with your knees or squat?  If so, that could be the muscles weakening.  And with your throat, I would definitely get checked.  DM affects the muscles so any type of muscles we have, can potentially get affected.  This is what makes it bad because we could develop dysphagia.  I did at one point had a sore jaw and could not chew  consistently certain foods (like cereal or crunchy things) and felt reeeeally embarrassed. I also could not open my mouth wide enough to eat bigger chunks of food.  I did consult with a speech therapist at my job about it (yay for working with old peeps) and suggested smaller pieces and extra gravy/sauce to make it easier and less to chew.  But I swear, one day when I did my medical marijuana, it went away!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCold is also bad for DM/arthritis (I also developed that from the DM so some of my symptoms  could possibly be due to that) so taking warm showers, getting the shoulders/back can help.  I heard walking in a pool helps too with the resistance and such.  But generally, weather plays a role.  The pressure, rain, etc.  But definitely see the specialists; they will (should) make sure you to do certain tests for common things people with DM develop and I would definitely mention the throat.  Hopefully an Xray/MRI could be done.", "My son's MRI results looked great After 7 months of Hydroxychloroquine my son's (4.5 years old) MRI looked great and he showed no signs of muscle degrading. So right now his only symptom is a rash on the joints of his hands. The rheumatologist wants to add some more meds to see if it can make the rash go away.\n\nHope everyone else in this sub is doing okay. Congrats on the good news! I have been on hydroxychloroquine for a few years now. I have gone through a bunch of drugs, but had been maintaining almost perfectly for a couple years on azathioprine  and rituximab. I was headed on vacation to a malaria hotbed so the doctor added hydroxychloroquine. No side effects, no problems, nada! Hope your son gets rid of that rash soon!

Ah okay!! That is really good to know - thank you!!!\n\nI ask because in my case I noticed some redness on my knuckles/finger joints but only 2-4 times a week. It goes away completely on its own after a few hours, is not itchy or painful, and does not really have nodules or skin lesions - just red.\n\nWhile there is some joint pain there is been no other classic DM rashes or muscle weakness...Have not had any formal diagnosis yet :/ I agree with other poster, although it is also anecdotal. My wife's will flare up or die down to barely noticeable, but they are always there. All my rashes wax and wane. Common triggers that appear to contribute to both major and minor flares seem to be Hormones, fatigue, and emotional distress.

I just hooked my dad up with multiple routes of administering cannabis I.e. joints, vape, edibles. Dad is 71 never used cannabis and has been a life saver. He prefers the edibles as he has mouth sores due to medications.

Never hurts to try as long as you know you are getting good cannabis. Also I hooked his 78 year old friend who was just diagnosed with polymyalgia and its helped him as well. Thanks for your reply.

But I am hoping for some reassurance from this community that I am not dealing with DM. I really appreciate it! \n\nThis all started after a particularly stressful couple of months, and a relatively minor surgical procedure.  I would say in mid-December. My ears, eyelids and elbows started itching, and my elbows got red and bumpy. The itching was pretty intense. Especially on my eyes and ears.  My ears started peeling, and my eyelids got rough, like they were getting ready to peel. Maybe some slight peeling.  Then the areas around my eyes, forehead and cheeks started to have a burning feeling too.   But they did not get red/purple.  Neither did my ears.  Just itchy and rough and burning.  My neck, though, is red and splotchy without itch and without burning.  Pic:  ( \n\nWent to dermo in early February.  He said the neck is sun damage (so poikiloderma).  He said the itching around my eyes and forehead and redness/itchiness on my elbows is likely seborrehic dermatitis.  Gave me some good lotions and a cortisone anti-itch.  Seems to help. \n\nShortly after the appointment, my knuckles closest to my writs started to itch.  Then got red.  It is pretty subtle though.  They itch much more than they are red (if that makes sense).  Very itchy, only slightly red. Pics:  (  ;(  A couple of small bumps involved too.  Also, my knees feel slightly burning, but no rash. And my skin overall feels extra-sensitive.  Kind of like a healing sunburn.  And I feel like my nose is redder than it should be.  \n\nNo muscle weakness that I can discern.   \n\nLooking for some comfort that this does not seem like DM. I know it is very unlikely.   Admittedly, I have a huge history of health anxiety. If you think it is something else, please just keep that to yourself.  I need to deal with one thing at a time. :)  \n\nThanks so much for your help! I do not really see any strong signs of Gottron papules on your knuckles (from the pictures anyway).  As for the itch, I do not remember that. I had pain at my cuticles and trouble making fists...my whole story is here:  \n\nI honestly cannot say if you are dealing with DM, but there is definitely something going on with you. My recommendation is CLEAN UP YOUR DIET right now!  Look up AIP diet, Keto, etc. and get rid of foods that may be causing flare-ups.  I am hoping this is all that is going on with you.\n\nAlso, I would add a daily probiotic. Either pills, plus kombucha.  I know it sounds crazy, but I went through so much and spent so many hours in research, I found this is the best place to start.  I mean, it certainly cannot hurt.\n\nGood luck, keep us updated, and take care of yourself best you can! Thank you for your response and suggestions! Any update on your condition? I have had a similar condition on my knuckles for about 6-9 months; dry, scaly, itching with a few bumps and red rash (Mechanic's hands). I honestly never thought anything of it - thought it was dry winter hands. In the last couple of years during stressful days I would also breakout on 1-2 fingers with these flat worts (presumably) and they would itch but often go away. Again I never thought anything about it and went about my business. I figured the red hands and bumps that I had were due to dryness/winter and the prior worts.\n\nI am a person with more arthritis than they should have for my age, I am 47 and 3 weeks ago I went to my Orthopedic Dr. after waking up in the morning and both my CMC joints at the base of my thumb were completely swollen after doing routine exercise. I had no injury or pain the prior day - I still do not know what caused the swollen joint. They did an xray and the Dr says you have early arthritis, and given my condition with arthritis in a few other joints she recommended that I get tested for a connective tissue disease. Well that set me in motion with Dr. Google, so I starting researching connective tissue diseases and noticing that Dermatomyositis (DM) came up with my searches and with images of red hands (like I have) and also statements about being positive for Raynaudes Disease (which I have how too - basically your fingers can go white when cold). The Raynaudes is a recent condition for me, its happened 6-7 times in the last 6 months.\n\nSo after my visit with the Dr. (and my research) I am concerned and I started treating my hands with a cortisone cream, I figure if the condition improves its likely not serious. However the treatment only intensified the redness of my hands. At this point they were quite (very red) and mainly just on the back of my hands, but the itching stopped. I switched to a basic hand moisturizer (no cortisone) after a week of the cortisone cream use thinking that this was causing a reaction (due to the sudden jump in redness). The redness has reduced some. This was about two weeks ago, since then my hands look moisturized and the itch is gone, bumps have reduced some (except for one finger) but the red rash persists. I do not have any other symptoms. The rash on the hands varies in intensity but its always there, looks just like the pictures of DM on the internet. \n\nGiven my chronic condition with tendinitis and early arthritis, just last month (before the thumb issue) I asked my primary Dr. to test me for RA - I just do not think all this early arthritis can be normal. We ran several blood tests and all came back negative but my numbers where on the upper end of normal. I just went back this week, explaining everything to my Primary Dr, showing my hands and he immediately suggests I get tested for DM. So that is where I am today, I will be going back in for more blood work for a bunch of antibodies. \n\nI understand your pain and health anxiety, I have my moments. I have already researched a lot on autoimmune subjects, preparing myself for some sort of diagnosis. I think its likely in my case be it RA, DM or lupus, etc. I definitely am hoping for the best. For now what I do have appears to be mild. Keep us posted on your journey. Wow.  Sounds like you have a lot going on in terms of symptoms.  But that does not necessarily mean you have something horrible.  Hopefully the rest of your tests will come back negative as well.  As for me, I made (I say \"made\" because he thought it was unnecessary) my Dermo biopsy a couple of the lesions. As part of that, he asked for a test that is good at detecting DM and Lupus and other systemic inflammatory diseases.  That came back negative. Although it was consistent with eczema.  Then I went and got my own test of a muscle enzyme that is usually elevated in DM.  That came back normal.  So now I am trying to forget about DM and get on with my life.  I have a history of health anxiety, so I have not necessarily stopped worrying altogether.  I still have anxiety.  But the chances look pretty low at this point that it could be DM (and the chances were low to begin with).  I will keep you in my thoughts, and send positive vibes your way!  Good luck with your upcoming tests!", "Hey DM, could use some advice on a worrisome hand rash \n\nHey all,\n\nA little background information, I am a 23 year old, extremely healthy and active male. I have had a pretty severe hand rash since the beginning of this year, that I am concerned is DM, or something autoimmune. It does not hurt or itch in the slightest, and is kind of just there. They start as little lesions, and eventually settle out to flat red patches. No other rashes elsewhere, and the only other symptom I have is slight joint pain in my left thumb, and some persistent brain fog (which could just be from me stressing about this). I have been seeing a dermatologist for the past couple months, and we have tried anti fungals + topical steroids with no success, so we went ahead and did a biopsy (the results are in my imgur link). Basically, my derm told me I had \"lichen simplex chronicus\" and that it was nothing to worry about, and I should just let it be. I would be happy with that answer, except for the fact I was discussing the issue with a family friend whose a rheumatologist who raised some red flags, and said that possibly the biopsy was performed in an incorrect site, and I should go in to get blood work performed. Unfortunately, he lives a couple states away, and the wait list to get an appointment with a rheum in my area is quite long.\n\n\nI know this subreddit is generally a help group for others that suffer from DM, but I figured I would get the best advice if I came to the source. I appreciate any and all help! Any rashes aside from the hands? Nope, none at all besides the stuff going on with my hands Without being any sort of expert on the subject, here is my two cents:\n\nWhen I first went to a dermatologist to have my rash examined, the derm told me on inspection that she was *almost 100% sure* my rash was \"lichen planus\" - a chronic, inflammatory skin condition. She especially pointed out that the octagon-like shape and scaly-ness of my rash was very consistent with lichen planus. She also examined my mouth and said I had signs of the condition there... but because she was not sure, she wanted to do a biopsy. Once the results came back however, it showed very few consistencies with a lichen-type rash and her report said that on a microscopic level my rash was a text book example of Gottron's papules: which is consistent with dermatomyositis.\n\nRE: \"I am no expert\", I am aware DM can be diagnosed amyopathically, and without the presence of Gottron's papules, and of course there is no way for anyone on reddit to tell you \"this might be DM\" or \"this is not DM\" -- but in my opinion if your dermatologist says it is not indicated through a biopsy, I would suggest trusting them when they say that. Like I said, my dermatologist was like \"AHA! THIS IS ALMOST DEFINITELY LICHEN PLANUS!!!\" - then she did a biopsy and was like \"oops wait, this is Gottron's papules, my bad\"... but a second opinion will not hurt. Bloodwork might also help to determine it, though if you do not have any problems with your muscles at all I imagine it is a lot harder to diagnose (for me, since I experience DM in its full form with muscle weakness and pain, an MRI and muscle biopsy have been crucial in my diagnosis process).\n\nGood luck though, hopefully my reply has been at least semi-helpful! I recently was diagnosed.  \n\nWhat DM does to your hands are Gottron's papules:  a flat red rash over the back of the fingers, elbows or knees. Gottron's papules are red, often scaly, bumps overlying the knuckles of the fingers (( \n\nHere is a link to \"beyond the basics\" information about DM.

The reason I ask is because I do have some symptoms that seem related still, ex: rash when I run, calcium build up on arms, rashes on back. \nHas anyone had experiences similar to this and is it possible that it could come back?

I am a current PhD student doing my dissertation on the experiences and stories of people with Myositis, inspired by my own experiences with the disease. If you have Myositis and are over 18, please consider filling out my survey! There is also an option at the end to let me know if you would like to do an interview with me, either in person or remotely, depending on where you live. If you would like to participate, comment here, message me, or email me at  I will get you the link to the survey. Thanks!  Juvenile Dermatomyositis count? ", "UNITED-RHEUM COVID-19 STUDY INVITATION ", "weird rashes on hand... do you think I have dermatomyositis? So I am 22 and female I also have tested strongly positive for Anti nuclear antibodies a few years ago (1:1280 in the speckled pattern) which apparently can be a sign of dermatomyositis but i was negative for all the other more specific tests so the doctors kind of brushed it off. I also have hashimoto's and celiac if that means anything to anyone. Obviously I am going to go back to the doctor but at first glance does this look like dermatomyositis to you guys? I have heaps of ill feelings all the time like fatigue/heart palpitations/pain breathing/joint pains/stiffness etc but I do not think I have muscle weakness\n\n*Processing img 1q3ugcnji2151...*\n\n*Processing img jlq7y59mh2151...* Is it crusty or just red it is seems slightly crusty the skin is definitely drier/harder with a weird texture but it is not that bad Mine were full on plaqued up, eczema looking lesions. I also had thickened and hardened, yellow cuticles with visible splinter hemorrhages. They looked textbook like what you see when you google. I did have very obvious muscle weakness, I physically could not climb stairs at a museum I visited before I was diagnosed. As far as fatigue I could sleep about 22 hours a day no problem. These were my experiences with the disease though, everyone is different. Some present with no muscle involvement at all, ever. Other rashes associated with the disease that I have experienced are a generalized scaly-ness on my chest and shoulders (shawl rash) and a red, hot, bumpy malar rash on my cheeks. Another type that I never developed is red scaly-ness on the eye lids. That is how mine started but I am dark skinned and mine was black Do drugs work? I have pretty bad symptoms and doctors want to put me on MTX. I have trialed methotrexate, cellcept, rituxan, and failed all of them. Failure does not mean I got worse, it means I only got a little better and they want you to be as close to baseline as possible. Right now I am on orencia subcutaneous injections weekly, plaquenil (which I took a drug holiday from and my skin rashes came back, so it is working fabulously), myfortic, celebrex, and IVIG infusions monthly. It took about 3 years to get the cocktail right, but I am off disability and work am able to work 13 hour shifts as an acute care nurse. Am I baseline? No, I never will be. But I am stubborn enough to make it work because I like it. :) Thank you. I have been recently diagnosed with DM (not even officially yet) after a few years of inconclusive examinations and negative blood tests. Six months ago I started presenting the typical skin rashes on hands and feet, somewhat mild, just like in OP's pics. That is how I finally got the diagnosis from a dermatologist. The muscular symptoms began 2-3 years ago though. I also have, among other things, red sore eyes, dry mouth, swollen burning feet, heavy breathing, severe hair and weight loss. I can still walk, but the weakness has worsened in the last months and I am forced to wait for further exams due to the COVID situation (I live in Italy). I do not want to scare the OP, but honestly I am pretty scared of what the rest of my life will be. I am sorry to dump all this on here, but I have dealt with depression for most of my life and I am all alone. I was admitted for all of my business and received the muscle biopsy a couple of days into my admission and got my diagnostics pretty quick, thank goodness. I know it can be a long winding path for some people to get there. I am sorry you are having to deal with worsening symptoms during these times, that makes it especially rough. I do not share my story with patients often, only if they are in my same mixed connective tissue/autoimmune overlap bubble (I also have RA, vasculitis, sjogrens, and a couple other comorbidities). But, You. Can. Do. It. It sucks, no one around you is going to understand what you have to face each day, but you have to get up and do it anyway because those are the cards you were dealt. I am not one that is prone to any kind of mental illness, so I am sure this wears on you pretty heavy. Quality of life is possible with this disease. Thank you for your words of hope. I really need it. My (21F) hands looked like this when I was diagnosed 2 years ago. Do you happen to see any tiny red dots/lines along your cuticles? I do not think I have any red dots/lines on my cuticles I do sometimes get red dots on the joints of my fingers though Please see my comment history for info, but if you have not already please see a rheumatologist who has experience with dermatomyositis. \n\nAlso see  for current diagnosis criteria\n\nIf waiting for doc mainly just take care of yourself, do not fall for BS home remidies. Primarily keep an eye out for major muscle weakness, unhealing wounds, and shortness of breath as those could be life threatening. (Generally handles with high dose prednisone)\n\nThis disease is not a death sentence, especially if you stay on it (like you are!) I had those as well! They have progressed to just swollen red knuckles now. Feel free to message me if you would like to chat more about it! May I ask you a question about how this disease initially presents.  I am in the \u201canxiety\u201dmode right now.  Thanks! It is in my first response there :) And you were diagnosed?  Was that your only symptom? I mean, that initiated labs, imaging, and a muscle biopsy that got me diagnosed. My Reddit knowledge is limited. Sorry. \nSo, does the redness come and go within the same day?  Or, does it last like an that for periods of time? Hi.  I am really freaking out right now....does the rash on knuckles come and go within a 24 hour period or stay for awhile? Hi. I am in a state of high anxiety right now. Just wondering if a knuckle rash stays around for a while or can get better in a day?  Thanks. Hi. May I ask if that makes a difference?  If it is just red, then what?  Thank you! Gottron's papules are hard, more crusted plaques of skin, not just red marks Is that what is usually found on the knuckles? My rash worsens with sun and heat exposure, because of the immunosuppressant creams I use on my face both sun and heat are quite uncomfortable so I use sunscreen every day beneath my makeup. I usually wake up with less redness, it is worse after my shower, and then it fades a bit after that, but never goes away. Correct So, you have a facial rash then?  Can I ask you if it covers your entire face or is just on one particular area? The rash associate with dermatomyositis is a butterfly shaped rash across the face, also called a malar rash. I also have a shawl rash of rougher, bumpy skin on my chest. Same deal, the rash is named for the shape. May I ask what your first symptom/s prior to diagnosis was? You asked me on another post, friend \ud83d\ude02 I was the one that slept for 22 hours a day. I had no skin symptoms during my initial onset, they popped up maybe 6 months later? So, your lengthy sleep schedule lead you to the doctor, or your skin symptoms? Yes I was having proximal muscles weakness with extreme fatigue. Could not lift a cup to my face or walk up stairs, no skin symptoms until later. May I ask your age when diagnosed? 17 That is super young!   Are you doing better now then?  Do you feel confident that this can be managed? I am 25 now, I have been better than I am now but there is no getting back to normal for me. Some people do totally recover and never have another flare, my disease is always right there waiting. I also fit into the mixed connective tissue disease/autoimmune overlap syndrome bubble because I have rheumatoid arthritis/Sj\u00f6gren's/vasculitis complications, so it is hard to know what is coming from what disease. Right now my body is pretty mad at me because work is very demanding (I am a floor nurse doing 13 hours shifts during COVID, so I do not blame me) I am able to work full time as a nurse, but my days off are for recovery. Wow!  Thank you so much for your hard work trying to help people with this horrible virus.  I do not know how you can work so many hours!  What are the best tests to take to get a proper diagnosis?  I really hope they come up with a cure for this disease soon! In my initial workup my liver function tests were very elevated, creatine kinase through the roof, elevated C- Reactive Protein and Sedimentation Rate (inflammatory markers), ANA positive, MRI showed pretty severe muscle inflammation/joint damage, definitive diagnostically is the muscle biopsy to show some microscopic changes in the tissues associated with the disease. I do not know if you are diagnosed, but we are in the red headed step child bin of the disease world (the NORD: national organization for rare disorders). The good news is biologics are coming out every year and one could be a pretty sound answer someday, but who knows. I am not counting on it haha Do you worry about having this?  Are the doctors encouraging about being able to \u201cmanage\u201d and stay ahead of this disease?  I am in an anxiety stare, so it would be good to know that it is something that you can live with and manage, stay on top of, and have a pretty normal life! No, I do not worry at all, but I am also very chill by nature. Also with a medical background my appointments probably look and sound pretty different than normal people's do. Very fast paced, jargon ridden, little explanation required, and my doctor takes my word and recs as gold. When you have a complex disease like this you have to become an expert and be your own advocate. Some rheumatologists just treat to what labs say, which is not the best answer. Get one that treats how you feel/present with the disease. You can live a normal life. No one would know anything's wrong with me until I mention it, but I just keep it to myself lol I am so glad you said that!  When I google DM, it scares me to no end....So, you think someone can live a normal lifespan with this? I think it depends on the person! Mine used to be consistent, but now it comes and goes. Was it just a red in color or was there any texture to them, roughness or scaling? The roughness I got especially on the knuckles above the ones that connect the fingers to the hand. My knuckles get swollen, and some have permanent almost scabs?? on them. Do you get encouragement from your medical team that this disease can be successful \u201cmanaged\u201d?  Do you worry about it or feel confident that it will be OK? No way I could even speak on that, I do not know anything about what type you have. Sorry to ask you that.  I am just in a high anxiety state. That is good to know. When you google this, it scary! You sound like you should seek counseling for your new diagnosis, I think that could greatly benefit you. Do you think I am overly anxious? I do not think therapists know much about this disease. Wondering if you were under 30 and if they did any cancer screening ? \nThanks! Hi again. Hope you do not mind another question.  So, my son had his CBC, Comp panel and CK blood work done.  All were within normal range.  That is a good sign, right? I am 22 no i have not had a cancer screening but probably unlikely i have cancer it does not run in my family at all and no signs that would suggest cancer for me more likely autoimmunity is the main issue I do not know you will have to ask your doctor about that one Hi!

One thing, do you always cover up in the sun? I am not saying it will make everything go away, but the Mayo doctors were adamant to my wife it is necessary.

By the time I was finally brought to the emergency room I had a fairly severe case and was put on an intense dose of prednisone, plaquenil, folic acid, and methotrexate. I was too weak to bathe myself, my rash was covering almost my entire body and was just awful. Even eating was difficult, and I was stuck in a wheelchair for a while too. \n\nEventually, after a few weeks in the hospital I got to go home and gradually saw small improvements. After about 3 months I could walk around fairly well, another few months and I could bathe myself and eat just fine. Stairs were still a bit of a no go and everything tired me out, but I could at least function somewhat.\n\nEventually I had a small relapse though, after about a year, and then my doctor put me on a 9 month IVIG treatment. It was very expensive but saw the most improvement in the shortest amount of time, and I felt absolutely amazing. I was able to completely get off the prednisone and methotrexate finally before I was in high school and it was a very good feeling. \n\nI relapsed again a few years later when I was in my junior year. I never stopped taking the plaquenil and the folic acid, which had over time given me serious headache issues but was still very needed, and I later found out long term folic acid also contributes to depression. I was back on IVIG treatments, and instead of methotrexate I was prescribed Ciclosporin, which performed much better and I was fully functional again in record time. \n\nI was in remission then for almost 6 years now and am relapsing again. I can remember my doctor telling me this can happen. I think one of the awful things about this disease is that a lot of symptoms very from person to person. I never had joint pain and the rash never spread to my face very much, and I have spoken to some people who never had a rash at all. It varies depending on what age you are, and just random chance. Add on the general rarity of it and the lack of solid information and its just terrible to go through. There is a decent chance I am going to be relapsing repeatedly over the years for my entire life. I hope that, even if none of the medicinces I mentioned help you with your doctor, that at least it helps to know you are not alone.

I am still in shock. \n\nMy mother died 12/27/17. She was 63, healthy all her life, never smoked or anything, fit, larger than life. \n\nAround September 2017 she developed a cough. After a ton of tests, they said she had Dermatomyositis. She also had stage 3 lung cancer. They said the two diseases usually appear in conjunction with each other. They said they did not know if one causes the other but that they usually appear together. She said the Dermatomyositis also caused a rash early on. Shortly after that was Thanksgiving and it was the last family function she was at. \n\nA few weeks went by with tons of hospital visits. Eventually she could not breathe and was rushed to the hospital (at Yale). We were all there with her. They told us she had stage 4 lung cancer and had 12-16 months to live but that the Dermatomyositis was doing the most damage. They said it was causing her lungs to turn into a material that looked shiny like glass or something and that is why she could not breathe. They said it is a super rare disease and not a lot of medical literature about how to treat it. They said they do not think it is hereditary at all and that women get it more than men. They talked about getting info from Japan on it at one point. \n\nAnyway they put her under a couple days later and did tons of things to treat her. The most radical thing was something where a machine extracted all her blood and then did something with it (maybe antibodies or something.) then put it back in her. Then we waited to see if anything changed. \n\nEventually the doctors said no change and because she cannot breathe on her own we had to respect her wishes and take the breathing tube out and let her die. They said if not for the Dermatomyositis she would have lived at least a year until the cancer got her. \n\nIt all happened so fast, her extended family did not know how bad her condition was. We told them on Xmas and they had a meltdown. We were going to let her die the next day but she woke up albeit with a breathing tube in. She could not talk but obviously knew we were there. We talked and cried all day until she fell asleep again. They pumped her up with more sedatives and morphine, and we watched her die the next day. 18 days after we were told she had 12-16 months to live. And a little over two months after I first heard the word Dermatomyositis.  I am so sorry. My mum also has/had the cancer/dm combo. People hear the cancer part and freak out, but it was the dm which was the bigger, immediate threat. Difficult to explain to people. \n\nMuch love to you and your loved ones.

I shower regularly though and I do not get dandruff otherwise, the red spots are puss filled (not always though) if that clears it up at all. I will definitely try it tho! Thank you for the advice Have you been diagnosed with DM and if so are you on immunosuppressives? If so it may be a fungal acne/fungal infection which are common for those with compromised immune systems. You really should see a dermatologist. If you cannot afford to see one in person you might try an online consultation service but to have testing done you will obviously have to go in at some point. I can tell you this does not look anything like the rashes associated with DM if that is what you are wondering. They definitely do not have anything to do with acne or pus. In perfect health, no withstanding (physical) health problems, mental health maybe but not even much stress. \nPart of the reason I posted was to see if I should take it that far tbh, I have had it for a long time and just kind of ignored it, but now my family wants to know if it is worth an actual doctors visit If you have had it for years, its worth a dr's visit. Get it checked out before that turns into something else. First thing after lockdown!

The sun is not your friend!", "Diagnosed with Dermatomyositis when I was 2 AMA I did post this already to r/Autoimmune but just in case I thought I would also post it here. \n\nI was diagnosed with juvenile dermatomyositis when I was two years old. The disorder causes my immune system to attack muscle tissue and unfortunately, it took a while for doctors to figure out what I had. The lower half of my muscles weakened to the point where I could not walk and I had to take the next three years to relearn how to walk. I have never had a flare-up as bad as that, so it is likely I had the disorder for several months to a year prior to it worsening.\n\nI am now 21 years old, been in an out of remission my entire life. Not super sure if I am starting another flare-up right now, my current rheumatologist does not think so. But all blood tests are coming back very similar to the ones from my last flare-up about four years ago when my pediatrics rheumatologist decided to put me on medication for it. I meet with my current one in a few weeks and I do not want to go through another flare-up, so we will see.\n\nI am majoring in genetics and genomics and hope to get into researching immunology because of my autoimmune disorder. I am definitely not a replacement for a professional but I would love to be a source of help for other people! If you could go back to when you were 6 years old and offer your parents some advice, what would you tell them?\n\nHave you ever tried dietary changes or investigated the effects of diet changes? About a year ago one person said she was able to get off all meds by going carnivore. Hope this passes and you are back to feeling like your DM is in remission! hmmm... I think I would have to tell them to listen to me more. I have a limp and my feet turn inward instead of outward as they should, so when I was younger and growing like a bean sprout I would trip over my feet constantly. My mom got annoyed with this for some reason. There were also a few times I complained about joint pain that was ignored but ended up being the start of a flare-up. \n\nI have a pretty healthy diet, or as healthy as a college students' diet can get. Eating well is definitely important to give your immune system enough energy and materials to build an immune response. But I doubt going fully vegetarian or carnivore will help much. Thank you and I hope you are also feeling well! Hey, I have JDM aswell, just want to say it is great that you are posting about it as it is rare to see anything. Also it is brilliant you are looking to get into the research side! Best of luck with everything! Thank you! I hope you are well and continue to be well! Hey, I hope you are still answering questions. My 5 year old niece was just diagnosed and she has been really depressed since she cannot play at recess with the other kids (her first year of school). Do you remember what people could have done to help you? I hate seeing her like this and I just want to help. For sure I can try to help! My parents put me in preschool, but schools in general tend to be a germ fest so they decided it might be safer, at least for the first few years of grade school, to homeschool me. I cannot say I liked it but I understand now that it was probably safer. I started at an actual school in second grade and it majorly sucked to not be able to run with the other kids. I totally get what your niece is going through and at that age I remember it was hard to find friends because the other kids just did not understand why I could not do X or Y thing. Letting the teacher know might also be helpful, I had some amazing teachers but I understand that is not always the case. It is also fairly easy to introduce two students together at that age and they just go with it; the teacher might have a fair gauge on who in the class might work best with your niece in terms of personality. I am pretty certain it is not a coincidence I was sat next to a very friendly girl who became my best friend until I moved to a different school. \n\nI really wish teachers or the school had offered an indoor option for recess, at my elementary school for some reason if you were at recess you had to be outside. If PE is as difficult for her as it was for me then definitely talk to the PE teacher, I hated PE and still do. My parents put me in piano lessons to make sure I had some sort of extra curricular. I loved reading to kind of \u201cescape\u201d or distract myself from how I might have been feeling physically and also all the doctor appointments. The most important thing was probably that I also had a younger sister, about a year younger than me and she is basically my best friend, so even if I spent recess alone I still had someone who would play with me after school. For obvious reasons a sibling probably is not an option, but I hope something here helps! Thank you so much for taking the time to write this out! I will definitely have my sister contact the school and ensure the teachers are aware of the situation. Hopefully that helps her with friends. I live far away from her and it broke my heart when she video called me today to draw together because she was sad none of the other kids liked her. Luckily she has a sister, but her sister is only 1 so there is not much they can do together yet. \n\nIf you do not mind me asking, when you had issues with your muscles, how long on treatments did it take to regain strength? I have done some research, but there seems to be a lot of unknowns with this disease. Yeah there is that issue with the younger sister when their TOO young lol\n\nI am not as certain how long it took me to regain strength, and it likely depends on the severity of muscle loss. I also do not remember most of that part, but I do know it was hard. My leg muscles deteriorated to the point where I had to relearn how to walk, and I do not pretend to understand it fully but I think it is essentially like my nerves had to learn to communicate with the muscle fibres again. Medical knowledge has progressed so much since then, that I doubt my muscle weakness would have progressed that much if I were to get diagnosed today. I remember lots of physical therapy, I was also probably taking methotrexate and prednisone at the time, and was walking just fine by preschool age so like 4ish. I am glad you are doing well now! Again, thank you for taking your time to answer my silly questions. That is the same medication she is on too, so I will hope for improvement! Your welcome! I will happily answer any future questions too, I am pre-med rn in college so I am not near as good as a doctor or specialist but I am more than happy to do my best. Your niece sounds like she has a good supportive family around her which is great and so important as well. I hope everything goes smoothly! I am sure you will be a great doctor! Thanks for the offer I might take you up on that. Being the supportive uncle can be hard when living so far away, but it is worth it!", "Excited! I am so excited about this.

All over my body. Went to a neurologist a few months after the twitching started and he diagnosed me with benign twitching syndrome. Well since then I have developed a strange click when I swallow, my tongue feels sore hard to speak sometimes and my jaw muscles are symmetrically sore and it feels tough to chew sometimes. Also I get out of breath when I am sitting sometimes. Obviously I am terrified I have ALS. I am a 28 yo male with no other real health issues. Has anyone on here had symptoms like this? I have heard prednisone can get rid of DM rash but the muscle issues still continue. I do not have any abnormal reflexes and I can still hike and everything. No matter what it seems whatever I have is rare for my age. Any help/info someone on here can provide is really appreciated. Yes, it did for me. I would even get tired chewing food. Yes, definitely. At my worst I could barely swallow food and I would choke frequently.  Like the other commenter, chewing was also exhausting.  Talking felt like such a chore as well. \n\nIt went away after I started on meds because my inflammation reduced.\n\nAs for the muscle twitching, I also have that right now all throughout my body.  Mostly in my feet and legs.  It is constant.  My rheumatologist said it is because of long term inflammation.  Like you though, I am also still nervous and apprehensive about that symptom.  :(\n\nCheck out r/Bfs for the twitching, the people there are super helpful. We are at the Myositis conference now. My wife has DM. There is a condition called Dysphagia that is not specific to DM but can occur where you have difficulty with swallowing and possibly speech.\n\nAlso about 30% of DM patients also present at some point with Interstitial Lung Disease, which shows as shortness of breath among other symptoms.\n\nThe Myositis Association has a good library on their web site, including presentation slides and videos from the annual conferences. The doctors from the Mayo clinic that gave the Myositis 101 and Focus on Dermatomyositis were excellent and so nice to stay late and answer question after question. Thank you very much for the information. Interesting about the interstitial lung disease as my grandmother was diagnosed with this lung condition about 4 years ago.", "Questions about your symptoms and maybe mine I developed a dry purple rash on my knuckles last week with a rash \"line\" that tracked up my finger to the other knuckle. It was slightly worse on my left hand but affected both. It felt like a burn but there was no way I burned both my hands on the knuckles and fingers. The burning sensation went away but the rash is still there, it is occasionally itchy. It gets worse in the cold, especially when my fingers go white and numb (Rayanauds) which has happened a couple times this week. I finally googled it and that is what brought me here. Other than the knuckle rash I have noticed a rash that comes and goes around my collar/shoulders the past month and I am extremely tired (but that just started yesterday).\n\nI am wondering, what is the timeline of symptoms for most people? How soon after developing a rash do you start to experience muscle weakness? Were there other \"oddities\" you noticed that were not necessarily listed on the top of a google search? \n\nI am not sure at what point to make a doc appointment. Symptoms just started and, except for now knowing  of dermatomyositis, it does not seem like much. I do not want to be paranoid but I am starting to feel that way. I am 38F and otherwise healthy. Thanks. I got the muscle weakness first, then the rash hit my thighs.  Make an appt with a good dermatologust, one at a university is best. Thanks. I guess what I am trying to decide is whether I am being paranoid or not. Should I wait to see if other symptoms develop before I bother going in? If so, how quickly does it typically develop? Weeks, months, years? The early you catch it the better, so go now. I went misdiagnosed for a year and a half and it almost killed me. Please make your appointment right away.", "Anyone have insight about my weird hands? For around 18 months I have been noticing red tips of fingers, slight knuckle discoloration, a couple white patches near the middle finger, and a couple bumps (which I know are caused by my pityriasis lichenoides chronica - diagnosed on my arm by biopsy over a year ago - at least they look the same as those lesions) My paranoid googling brought me here. There is also a red blotch now below the pointer finger that literally was not there until this morning. \n\nThanks for your time!\n\n Forgot to mention - no other rashes (other than the pityriasis) and no muscle weakness. It does not look anything like the rash on my hands from DM, but I am not a doctor. Have you been to see one about this? Hmmm, mine sorta look like that now that I am medicated but the beginning was a whole other story. Mechanics hands and the nail fold thingy were also important indicators as far as hands go. Also, people whack their hands on shit all the time and do not notice. At least I do. I am always bruised. Hopefully that is what it is.\n\nDef probs go see your Rhuem tho. The resulting complications of putting it off can be pretty awful. My esophagus has not recovered it is strength to this day. It probs never will.", "My Dermatomyositis Story Hi all, I have been really struggling recently with my DM and thought I could come on here and share my story.  I like this thread because it helps me not feel so alone in what I am experiencing. So my name is Kayana and I am 18 years old and was diagnosed with DM (kind of, long story) in April of 2018  right before getting my wisdom teeth out. However, it really all started near the end of December of 2017. For the first few days I had a high fever and stayed home from school because of just feeling useless and having chills and aches from the fever. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with fifths disease because I had flushed red cheeks and I was working at a daycare at the time.The next day I woke up very very nauseous and began to vomit non stop which continued for the next six hours. I went back to my pediatrician at the time who then said that I did not have fifths disease and mentioned lupus because of my butterfly rash but we never explored that idea. I was hospitalized to give me an IV for liquids because I could not keep anything down. While I was in the hospital my face rash got even worse like a flare up and looked like it was popping out on my face. I was tested for influenza and scanned for many things but they could not figure out what I was sick with and just told me I had a nasty bug. After the hospital I had blood vessels popped in my eye, an ear infection, and a pallet infection. \n\nBetween the months of December to April I had a rash show up on my forearm to which my friends and family told me to just put more lotion on and it would go away. One day during my biology class I noticed these bumps that showed up on my fingers and sent a picture to my mom. My mom wanted to take me to see my doctor and the lupus was brought up again. We were not sure so I went to go get bloodwork done and it came back positive for lupus. \n\nSo for a while I believed that I had lupus but just with my skin? I went to go see my dermatologist for my skin rashes which was the first time that Dermatomyositis was brought up. My dermatologist gave me skin creams, a short term steroid, and Hydroxychloroquine. I then went to go see a rheumatologist about two hours from where I live because I live in a very small town and continued to find out more about what I have and look for treatments. \n\nWhat I know now is that my DM is only in my skin and not shown to be in my muscles or my lungs. I feel very very lucky to have it like this because I have read and heard about how much worse it could be and what other people have gone through. I have experience some muscle soreness and also stiffness here and there however. My skin is the worst it has ever been and has been hard for me to accept and adjust to. My fatigue has been HORRIBLE recently as well which I also think could be a factor of my depression. I have been trying to find a treatment that works or ANYTHING that works. The rashes on my legs and arms have broken open and have started to blister which has become extremely painful to wear clothing on it and even put my creams on it. The medicine I am currently taking makes me very nauseous and most of the time I puke after taking it. I have become so disgusted and embarrassed of my skin and my body. Many people make comments about my skin and how I have burns and I try to educate them however it does truly hurt me every time. I know that it is probably because I am not used to this disease but it has become so hard for me to go through my everyday life and I just wish I could lay in bed all day. My doctors tell me not to stress but I simply cannot do that when I am a full time college student and also working part time. However, next semester I am taking a break from school to rest and hopefully get better from where I am right now. I am still going to work part time just to make sure that I get out of the house and will not get more depressed. \n\nI wanted to post this to let my story out and to see what you guys think. If anyone has ANY advice or just support I would appreciate it so so much. But thank you anyways for just reading this if you did. Not all meds work for everyone, sometimes meds work for a while and then they stop. Try and see the best doctors you possibly can. If you have an HMO Switch to a PPO health care provider so you can see more Dr and specialist. Check out \u201cFat sick and nearly dead\u201d on Netflix, it is pretty inspiring. I am sorry for what you go through. If you have a chance to go to the Myositis Association annual patient conference I highly recommend it. It helped my wife so much to finally talk to others who have been through what she has.\n\nShe made connections and friends and still keeps in touch with many of them. I do not know what your situation is or support is like from family and friends, but when it comes up this year, if you would like to go and are struggling financially, PM me, I will help sponsor you.\n\nIf you do not belong to the Association or private Facebook groups, you should join. I can let you know which groups my wife enjoys and participates in.\n\n Check out your local Meetup groups.  We have a DM group in Central Florida that meets 3-4 times a year that has been a big help with advice. Hey,\n\nIt is been a while since you posted this.  I just wanted to check on you and make sure you are okay.\n\nMerry Christmas / Holidays Thank you for checking in I am doing well and trying to keep a positive attitude:) Merry Christmas! People are more well-behaved and understanding of my girlfriend's DM.  I guess it comes with being older.  \n\nShe developped DM 5 months ago and has not worked since.   It will be many months before she can even consider going back.  I cannot believe you are surviving doing both college and part-time work with  a DM that doesnt appear to be fully under control.  You are strong af.\n\nPlease reach out to your doctor.  There are many possible combinations of medication, one  might help you.  We have already gone through multiple combos and the current one has less side-effects that the first few.\n\nWhen DM started, her rheumatologist recommended reducing refined sugar, gluten and dairy products (from cows) as much as possible to help with  DM.  Might be worth a try if you havent done it it.   For my  girlfriend it is critical as we learned last week that she has asymptomatic celiac disease and that any gluten at all can produce flares.    We decided to think of celiac as a good thing: less food to choose from means less difficulty picking food... :)  \n\nThere is a \"what is your good  story\" thread that is a few months old that gave us hope.    Some people have had some crazy lows before starting to get better.\n\nWishing you courage.", "IVIG Hello everyone,\n\nI am getting my first course of IVIG in a week or so and I am nervous.  This is not my first time getting an infusion, but a first for this kind.  I already get migraines with aura so I am worried that it will make me more susceptible to the headache side effects.\n\nWhat is your experience with IVIG? I have been taking it for around 4 years now, for awhile it was twice a month and now every 4 wks. \n\nThere are 2 major versions they use, at my hospital at least, gammunex and privigen. I used privigen for the first infusion as it is the more common one but had a major reaction to it, above usual IVIG side effects, ended up with a swollen spinal cord and the migraine was so bad I was throwing up and could not see at all. \n\nSwitched to the gammunex and I still have very intense migraines but they are mostly managed with meds. My infusion is over 12hrs since I am so sensitive to it, and I get migraine/pain and nausea meds every couple hours. \n\nI get mine on Friday's since I feel really shitty for a few days afterwards and can recover over the weekend. While the side effects suck and I really dread the infusion, they work really well for me and are worth it to keep my JDM under control. Thank you for the detailed reply.\n\nI am sorry that you have to deal with all those side effects, that sounds absolutely horrible.  That is great that it helps you though, it is just too bad that it is this painful.\n\nDo you get migraines normally as well? No problem, I had tons of Qs about IVIG that I wish I could have had answered 4 yeras ago, so I am happy to help. :)\n\nI would get them infrequently, maybe once or twice a year, but since starting IVIG I get them maybe 4 or 5 times, on top of the monthly ones that start during the infusion. \n\nSo not great but manageable. Hi! I am a patient, but also a nurse that gives it a decent amount so hopefully I can help. :) Everyone experiences it very differently, likely the first brand that you try will not be for you. I have been on IVIG for the last 6 years. I started on privigen, then gammagard, then panzyga (for me it is by far the best). I get a monster dose (1.5 g/kg) at a marathon rate (max, which is titrated up to 200 mL/hr) because I am impatient, but a lot of people choose to space it over more time to tolerate it better. I have even seen it over several days. Headaches are to be expected, some people get benadryl, zofran, solumedrol, toradol, extra fluids, all kinds of medications as pre medications. It really is a trial and error type of deal! Give yourself a few days off after for work for sure and hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. My post IG symptoms are lymph node tenderness, generalized body aches, moderate migraine, fluid retention, and constipation. Usually this all resolves in 3 days or so. Do not expect this infusion to give you a \"feel better\" boost, it is more of a long term function retention medication rather than a magic steroid feel good type of thing. Let me know if you think of any other questions. :) Thank you so much for your reply!\n\nI am starting to chill out about the infusion now.  Migraines are not permanent so I will get through it. :)\n\nI am just hoping I can get them to swap Benadryl for another antihistamine as I have had to premed for a different infusion with that before and it makes me feel terrible.  I flush and feel like I am passing out repeatedly.", "Searching for diagnosis?  I see people posting in here with questions, thought this might help if you want a chance to talk to an expert.\n\nYou can find more detail here: ", "Really long story and request for input **TLDR:** Got sick after a lot of sun exposure and sunburn. Main symptoms are kidney-area pain, headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, butterfly shaped facial rash (malar or heliotrope?), fatigue, weakness, generally feeling like shit. High CRP and CK, but negative ANA and specific antibodies. **List of questions at the bottom.**\n\n**Long story (sorry it is so much info... I even left some stuff out!):**\n\nHey all! I am still undiagnosed and I am hoping to get some opinions. My first rheumatology appointment is coming up on Friday, so I know I should be able to get some answers to my health woes soon. That said, I would love opinions on what might be causing my issues. I am 35, female, and have been relatively healthy up to this point in my life.\n\nEverything started back in early July. At the very end of June, I went camping and got a pretty bad sunburn. Then, for 4th of July I went to the lake for five days and stayed on a houseboat. I did not get burnt, but I did spend a lot of time in the sun. When I left, before I even got 10 minutes away, I started having a deep aching pain in my left kidney area. My hands were swollen so that I could not get my rings off. I was also really drained and fatigued, but I chalked that and the swelling up to too much sun and alcohol. \n\nThe kidney-area pain happened pretty much every day for a month, and I thought maybe I was going to pass a kidney stone or something. I never did, to my knowledge. I also started having terrible headaches - every single day for two months straight. Sometimes the headaches were the tension/pressure kind and sometimes they were migraines with aura. I had bouts of tinnitis and dizziness and nausea with and without the headaches. I also started having lots of muscle aches, almost like they were in knots. My thighs were the most sore, along with my shoulders and behind my shoulder blades. I was very stiff. \n\nThen came the joint pain. My left knee, which has been creaky since high school but has never given me pain before, started getting very stiff and achy. If I have to sit still for too long, it starts to ache and I have to move it to ease the pain. I chalked this up to getting older for a while. Then my left shoulder started acting up. My lower back was in terrible pain every day, sometimes feeling like it was compressed and other times like the muscles were seized up. \n\nI started getting a really obvious butterfly-type rash on my face and I am wondering if it is possibly malar rash from lupus or heliotrope rash from dermatomyositis. The rash comes and goes, and it is typically worse when I am feeling my worst. My eyelids do get puffy and red, sometimes even more obviously than the butterfly rash. And I have noticed that when the rash is really bad my ears turn bright red.\n\nThroughout this time, I was overwhelmingly fatigued. Despite getting 8-10 hours of sleep every night, I was so exhausted that I could barely get through my work day. It was like my body was simply too heavy to hold up. When I sat at my desk at work, I leaned heavily on my forearms because sitting up just took so much energy. \n\nI have also noticed that there is a gland on the back of my neck that is almost always swollen. I massaged the back of my neck when I had a tension-type headache and that is when I noticed it. It is not always sore, but it is almost always swollen. It is more sore when I have a headache.\n\nOne Sunday, I decided to install a medallion on the chandelier in my kitchen. I would just installed the light a few weeks before, and the cap did not completely cover the whole in the ceiling, so I would gotten the medallion to cover it up. I was barely able to unscrew the light fixture on my own in order to unwire it and install the medallion. My arms felt so weak and I could barely hold them over my head, much less hold the weight of the chandelier. I had no problem doing all of this myself just a few weeks before, so I was extremely confused by it. I would also felt completely fine that morning, so I was not sure why I all of a sudden felt miserably weak. My girlfriend helped me finish putting the light back up, and I immediately laid down. Within minutes I had a terrible migraine. I was freezing cold, could not get warm. I just laid there and cried because I felt so horrible.\n\nThe very next day, I started feeling better. I had energy and was not nearly as achy and I did not get a headache all day long.  My first doctor's appointment was scheduled for the following day, now the middle of September. I went in and explained that I was feeling better but still concerned about my symptoms. My doctor is an internist and I LOVE her. She immediately ran bloodwork and urinalysis, then scheduled an MRI. The urinalysis bloodwork came back mostly normal, except for elevated creatine kinase and c-reactive protein. Because this showed inflammation, she ran more bloodwork for autoimmune diseases. My ANA was negative (the result was .4 and since that is not how most people's are reported I can only go with the qualitative value they gave me), and I did not have high enough numbers in any of the specific tests to mean anything. \n\nFor the next month, I felt mostly normal. I did notice that my fingers were sometimes red and swollen and stiff, but it typically did not last long. I also got very itchy around one or two knuckles (often the pointer and middle finger knuckles on my right hand, but it did happen on other knuckles and finger joints, too). Other than this, the symptoms were gone. I had almost no lower back pain (which I would had since well before things got bad... as early as March), I only had one mild headache, the rash on my face cleared up, and I had energy. It felt SO GOOD to feel normal! I said multiple times that it felt almost euphoric to just live like a normal person again. I hoped that maybe I would gotten a really bad virus or something and it was all in the past.\n\nDuring that time, I went back to my internist. She said that despite the tests being negative, she wanted me to see a rheumatologist. She said that some people have autoimmune diseases without positive bloodwork, and my symptoms still made sense with a few autoimmune diseases, especially lupus. Since I have Raynaud's and I have a family history of autoimmune diseases, she thought a rheumatologist was the best next step. Plus a sleep study. She also prescribed Effexor, since it is used to treat migraines and muscle pain, as well as fibromyalgia and depression. I started taking it and continued feeling like a normal human being.\n\nIn mid-October, I started feeling bad again. It was like getting the flu, but without the snot and sore throat. My body ached, I was exhausted, and I noticed I was getting scaly patches of skin on my knees and elbows. The ones on my knees would sting and burn when I did knee push ups during my workouts. They were bright red, not covered in plaques like you expect psoriasis to be. My joints started getting stiff and achy again. The headaches came back, but only the tension-type ones and not the migraines. I am also having muscle aches, but they are not nearly as bad as they were during the first flare period. Maybe the Effexor is helping with both of those. :)\n\nI have a ridge that goes across both of my thumb nails (Beau's lines, I think?) and a single pit in one of my fingernails. It is the first time I have noticed any issues with my fingernails. I have had really gross looking pinky toe nails for a few years that are weirdly shaped and a little yellow and barely attach to the nail bed. \n\n**QUESTIONS:**\n\nDoes my story sound familiar to anyone? \n\nCan you have joint pain with dermatomyositis?\n\nCould all of these symptoms be caused by psoriatic arthritis? \n\nCould it possibly be lupus despite having a negative ANA and other negative antibody tests?\n\nIs there another (hopefully less scary) possible cause that I am missing? I was misdiagnosed with psoriatic arthritis.  Turns out I have Dermatomyositis.  Almost a year and a half. Please go to a specialist Your rheumatologist should be able to help you this Friday.  They are the one who diagnosed me.  \n\nI have the rarer anti-mda5 dermatomyositis.     \n\nMy first symptom was joint pain  (arthritis) in the fingers.  Hard to fold my fingers\n\nFollowing week I had joint pain in the wrists  - couldnt open a door with a round door knob.  I also had skin  rashes mostly on the hands , and some around my eyes.  \n\nThe next week I had joint pain in the knees - could go up or down stairs.\n\nThat is when I went to the hospital.    Most likely reason was a parvovirus (which I turned out to have!), but they did some tests for dermatomyositis.  \n\nThey told me to go home and come back the following week.  I had normal CK level (mda5 doesnt attack muscles and CK show when muscles are attacked), but the rheumatologist just looked at me and said \"you look like my patients - you start prednisone today\".\n\nShe was right - two weeks later the tests they did on the first day came back and  it said I not only had dermatomyositis, but the rarer and deadlier anti-mda5 version.", "This Dr Saved my life from Dermatomyositis ", "Joining the club My family doctor diagnosed DM after I presented as a text book case. From everything I have heard and read the diagnosis is right on.  She prescribed prednisone and I have been on it for about 5 weeks now.\n\nI went to a specialist Monday, had a chest xray and some blood work done.  I got the results online and everything looks normal. \n\nClearly I still have the rash, and although I am feeling much better than when it first hit me, I still cant do more than about 30 mins of puttering, and leaving the house for any errand requires a 2 hour nap.\n\nNow I am kind of concerned, is my blood work good because the prednisone is working? or is it good because its something else other than DM? Sorry you are in the club. I am the parent of a 4 year old who is in the club. I am also sorry I cannot answer your question. \n\nI find it odd that your family doctor diagnosed it. We had to see a  rheumatologist, who had us do an MRI and muscle biopsy. Even then she cannot say with 100% certainty that my son has DM. Basically by the looks of his rash on his hands, the indicators in his blood work, and the muscle degrading shown in his MRI, DM is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nI hope your meds work and it goes into remission. You can win this!\n\nYou might also check out r/autoimmune I have been referred to other specialists. But my family doctor \"said\" it was DM and started treatment with prednisone right away. I had the shawl rash, muscle weakness and it was likely triggered by a virus. I do not know what is required for an \"official\" diagnosis, but I am glad that some form of treatment started because just a few weeks ago, I could not stand for more than 30 seconds, or chew food. If the doctor had told me they did not know what was happening, or what they could do for it I do not know how I would have coped.\n Pred can help with blood work, but you really need to get seen by a rheumatologist as well. Specialists really do know their stuff. Sorry you are in the club, but diagnosis at least leads to treatment and getting better  Have you seen a rheumatologist? My rheumatologist added an immunosuppressant to my regimen and it has helped a lot with the rash on my chest. I still have the bright red knuckles. It would only show up on a chest X-ray if you had developed Interstitial lung disease. It is a slowly progressing lung disease that can happen with dermatomyositis. I do want to comment that not everyone has a positive muscle biopsy. A less common variant of dermatomyositis is amyopathic dermatomyositis (without muscle involvement). Some studies I read stated that for some people, it can take 10 or 20 years for the muscle involvement.  I am getting frustrated.\n\nI saw the specialist who is an internist not a rhumy or dermatologist. She did not \"see\" muscle weakness ( it was 5 weeks post prednisone when I first saw her.) So she thinks I am just experiencing a post viral thing. I hope she is right but I (and my family doctor) do not think so.\n\nAll she is doing is tapering me off the pred... she has not given me any thing to do in terms of regaining my strength, things to look for, or anything.\n\nI am still off work since the beginning of the year and am starting to get worried financially. (I am in Canada) and have no idea when I can expect a \"full\" recovery. My job is a very physical, fast paced, one and while I am well enough for shopping or puttering around the house, I still find carrying things, bending, stairs, and a few other things require much more energy and effort than I would have imagined.\n\nAs of my last blood test, my CK levels are Low, which I guess is also an indication that I have lost some muscle mass, and so are my Lymphocytes. My Neutrophils and Lactate Dehydrogenase are both high. I have no idea what all that means together *lol*\n\nI do not see the internist until April 10. Thanks for letting me vent here! I just want to be more involved in getting better and I am feeling really out of the process. \n\nI am also concerned with some of the other issues that DM can bring. There are a lot of cancers on my dad's side of the family and I worry this could be warning. I thought high class levels indicated muscle damage?", "Why Cell Realignment Machine can prevent inflammation of lungs  Fuck off", "Treatment experiences/options? Hi guys! I posted a while back on here to share my story and thank you all for the wonderful comments and the support! Knowing that there are other out there that can understand what I am going through really helped me a lot :) \n\nAfter my last post I continued to see my rheumatologist and my skin was getting progressively worse within every appointment that I had made with her. Eventually I started up to 5+ medications to try to get my skin rash under control(autoimmune suppressants and others). I found myself not taking my medicine very well and feeling really ill throughout the week even though I tried to take my \u2018bad\u2019 medicine during the weekend to be able to feel good enough to go to school and work during the week. I then decided to take time off from school because I was doing poorly and most of the time could not wake up in time to make it to class. I continued to work part-time but then noticed it was even hard for me to make it to work on time some days. I would work a shift at 1:30pm and sometimes sleep in to 2:00pm, I almost lost my job. I recently went on a trip with my friend and would be getting so sick every time I ate so I was so sick of feeling so ill all the time that I decided to go off my medicine during the trip so that I could enjoy my time there. This unfortunately continued after I got back home, I have had a pattern of going off my medicine in the past. However, I noticed a very big change in my skin rash but also my fatigue and general mental health. I was finally starting to wake up earlier on my own and my skin was clearing up and not blistering. I recently saw my rheumatologist again and told her about my experience on the medicine and that I had not taken it for a while and explained the changes I saw. \n\nI am just kind of frustrated because she basically told me to start over with the first autoimmune suppressant that I took a couple months after I was diagnosed. I guess that I was hoping to look at different treatment options that I could try, that would maybe be easier for me to take while still trying to function with my job. I also noticed some joint pain in my hands and a little bit of weakness too. I understand that is probably my fault for going off my medicine however I just could not take it anymore. I was so depressed and tired and had so much brain fog I felt like I was not myself anymore. \n\nI would love to hear the treatments that you all have tried and what has worked for you all the best in skin rashes or muscle/joint pain and muscle weakness. I feel like there is more options I could try but I am very limited to doctors I can see since I live in the middle of nowhere Wyoming \ud83d\ude1e Thank you all again, this thread is fantastic and so much help!! What medication caused you to feel like that? Did you start all 5 at once? We mainly think that methotrexate caused me to feel very gross. Did they talk to you about switching to a biologic? My doctor did not even mention that yet, could you kind of explain to me what that is? First, what country do you live in? Honestly starting back at square one is good idea if you have a confirmed diagnoses of dermatomyositis\n\nFor me first line was high dose prednisone, can make ya feel shitty or irritable, but is best to start getting under control (usually 4 weeks to begin immune suppression where labs begin to stabilize). I have been going on 2 years of prednisone myself\n\nThen usually a prednisone sparing immune suppressant is added (imuran, methotrexate, cellcept, etc) and prednisone is slowly scaled back. This period can take a long time as you may need to go up/down on the prednisone as you try to understand if other med is working\n\nIf no real results, the biologic like rituximab or something else\n\nHonestly, treating this disease is a marathon and you need to have patience (even though that is hard), none of these drugs really work quickly so it is often \u201cluck\u201d to get on right combo. Listening to your doctor is best, but also do not be afraid to advocate for yourself, a good doctor will always be open to other opinions\n\nAlso make sure to screen for cancers and keep an eye on lung and heart health Hi :) What was the initial treatment?", "\u202a18F hand rash that peristed for 2 mo. along with hive like neck rash and eyelid swelling. symptoms have gotten a lot better with time + steroids but rheum could not figure it out. dermatomyositis is the only rash i have seen that looks similar (rash extended more as stripes down the fingers)\u202c  Mine looked like that. PM me and I can show you some more pics of how my rash progressed. My rash looked like that on my chest, but not my hands.  I also had swelling on my eyelids and around my eyes.\n\nI am glad you have improved, and hopefully you keep getting better! :)", "How do you treat your rashes when they are painful? Hi, \n\nI have been reading about dermatomyositis and came to the conclusion I have been dealing with it since I was a kid. We thought it was just excessive allergies. In January, I developed a rash on my right hand, along the knuckles. Then it spread throughout my whole hand. And then onto my other hand -- same way. Knuckles, fingers, wrist. It is slowly going down my wrists. \n\nMy doctor gave me a cream without seeing me, because we assumed this was contact dermatitis (I am somewhat allergic to dogs, and adopted a dog the first week of January). It does not do anything (which, I assume now, is because this is not contact dermatitis -- the best way I can describe it is that it looks like a medication reaction rash, but its not, because I am not on any new medications). \n\nIt gets extremely painful and is downright excruciating. I have almost gone to the ER a few times this weekend. I assume it is going to take a few days for a doctor to take me seriously and start actually considering it (because I am sure they are skeptical of anyone who diagnoses themselves on the internet, as they rightfully should be).\n\nI have been using aquaphor on it, which it does more than the cream, but like, not by much. On the bad days, it burns too.  Is there anything you guys have done over-the-counter that has helped? \n\n(If your skeptical, I read the symptom list and just cried a lot. There is no way this is not it. My current rash looks like the girl who posted here a few weeks ago about being diagnosed. I have always had the heliographs on my eyelids that come and go. I have dysphonia. The red splotchy rashes and fevers as a kid -- everyone wrote it off as rosacea but they were flat and hot to the touch -- never bumpy. I remember one episode in my teens where I was in so much pain moving my arms and shoulders that I rather wake up at the crack of dawn with my mom, who would do my hair for me. I was waking up at 4am for a long period of time. There was a period where a doctor was monitoring me for arthritis. My whole childhood I was written off as lazy... this is honestly more upsetting to find out I was sick and no one bothered to look into it.) Try A&amp;D ointment for skin, but have you tried cutting out all gluten and all dairy to see if you can get your allergy load down? Trying it for a month might help take some pressure off of a stressed immune system and get your flare to back off. Go to a dermatologist, preferable one at a University clinic or someplace like Johns Hopkins or Mayo.  All it took was one look and a muscle test for them to tell.  I was immediately put on 180mg of prednisone.  There is nothing much to do for the rash since it is not an allergic reaction but is inflammation from your immune system attacking the capillaries.  Once the muscles start getting attacked, look for muscle pain and weakness.  Weight lose will follow as you start to lose muscle mass. Muscle pain was really bad today -- I did exercise a bit more than usual (I use my bike to get around and I was running all over the place) and it was excruciating. I could not even move today. It was not enough to cause that reaction on its own. It is funny because no amount of ibuprofen I took help and then suddenly it was like a weight lifted off, several hours later (or, comparatively anyway). \n\nI live on an Ivy League University campus with their medical hospital; my dermatologist is there. I hope he is on the up and up. The issue is I have a bit of a bad reputation I think because I have been seen *so many times* across the health system with so many specialists, doctors trying to figure out why I am so damn miserable. Maybe he will understand that this is why. I hope so. Oh, and I did the weight loss thing years ago. I randomly went from a size 12 or so to a 00. It was not a lot of weight, but no one knew why I lost so many sizes with only 15-20lbs.  I was around 20/21 so it was not a puberty thing. Maybe related to this? It got blamed on the Adderall I started the year before, but it was so gradual, not sudden as you would expect with adderall. Happened over the course of 10 months? or so. \n\nI have kind of been living this for awhile. I have even been seen for migraines with emergency injections to give myself because of how badly my blood vessels react - they were worried it could cause something like strokes. I am so light sensitive one boss knocked out the light bulb above my desk at work.\n\nI feel like we have been skirting around this my entire life. This made me laugh and question everything. I could not get a referral to a gastro doctor so I cut gluten for a few meals back in May to put my mind at ease, felt better, and have not had any since. I have the genes that code for Celiac and just assumed that was it. Maybe it was not... A lot of folks with autoimmune disease are not quite celiac or allergic to gluten/dairy/nightshades/etc, but there is a growing theory that \"load\" has something to do with triggering autoimmune response. Your immune system is suddenly in overdrive and things that normally do not bother you suddenly create an immune response. The idea of AIP is that cutting them out for a bit lets the body relax and take a breather from defense-mode. OK, you are a good candidate for AIP because you are clearly motivated. In addition to the other treatment, give AIP a whirl. It probably will not hurt; especially with allergy season upon us. PM me if you need resources! Best thing to do is be properly evaluated by a doc (rheumatologist) if you are concerned, especially simple blood tests for inflammation and CK protean (muscle damage)\n\n\n\nAlso I found creams like cerave rough and bumpy lotion were helpful on skin\n\nAs a side note, the symptoms (weakness, rashes etc) are often mostly bilateral (both sides), so if yours are not may be a good sign it is something else\n\nIt is a serious disease, but also incredibly rare, so best to do a process of elimination and not self diagnose. Also if you have juvenile variety (often comes with calcification lumps), it is very treatable", "Blistered rash  I have no idea how reddit works \ud83e\udd23 I got this rash a month before I was diagnosed with DM. It is completely different then my reddish/purple neck and arm rash. Has anybody else had a blistered rash like this? Left a deep scar and lasted about 4 days (blister healed in 2 weeks). It is so different from my other rash. At the time the Dr said it was shingles. I never had a rash like that, and that is an odd location for a DM rash. I did get shingles after having DM for a few months, which I later learned is common if you are on cellcept. That blister looks painful, hope it cleared up! It was probably shingles then-\nJust found this:\n\u201cPatients with DM or PM was significantly associated with increased risk of HZ than the subjects without DM or PM for both women and men\u201d\n\n", "Please look at photo, is this gottron papules??  Hi, this is on my first knuckle for about 2 weeks. It started off as small itchy bumps, then after a week or so it turned into a large red, scaly patch. Another knuckle also is feeling itchy and I think its going to appear there too. I have health anxiety and am worried sick! Please can someone reply. Thank you I just posted photos yesterday.  I am wondering about bumps on my thumb/finger knuckles, too.  I feel your pain.  I have been getting these things for almost 10 years now.  I decided to make an appointment with my GP to ask for autoimmune testing as I cannot stand not knowing.  Good luck to you! I will say, if anything, just go to your primary. Do you have any other symptoms? Any other aches and pains? At least ask for a blood test that can confirm autoimmuneand then work from there. As others said, see a doc. If you have muscle pain, in an arm hopefully, that is a good place for biopsy. Well not hopefully but better than taking a chunk of calf muscle.\n\nIt is hard to confirm DM positively without muscle damage. So the doctor said its just eczema....I dont know what to think... My hand looks very similar to yours. Went to a doctor and said it was just eczema/dermatitis as well. Any updates with you? Any pain anywhere?", "Looking for some opinions. I have a doc appt. scheduled, but in the meantime .. ", "Not me but my sister She (F68) was diagnosed a few months ago. \n \n  In 2016 she fell and broke her ankle and had several pins in her bones. She did not do any physical therapy. \n\nShe lived in her daughters finished basement for 8 months without much walking because of being non weight bearing on her leg. \nShe seemed to recover from this a year or so later. \n\nThen she started having trouble with her thyroid. She was very weak and could not step up one step. She lost hair and became weaker from muscle loss. \nFinally they diagnosed her with dermatomyositis.  Started her on steroids and a chemo pill to fight the auto immune disease. \nShe fell in her kitchen months before they diagnosed her with dermatomyositis. She had a broken pelvis. Surgery for the pelvic. So more bedrest. She developed blood clots in her lung and the bad leg. \n\nThey took care of that, so no more blood clots at this time. \nShe is in bed 90% of the time. \nShe developed pressure wounds that are healing some but not a lot. \nShe will not move her legs or move  herself in bed. She calls someone to move her. \n\nAs of now she is in a hospital specialty wound care place. \nShe has 2 daughters and a son, they and other family members have told her she needs to do physical therapy and get moving or she will be like this the rest of her life. \nIt just seems like no one can get her to understand this. She is refused therapy and will not get up in the chair because it hurts her pressure wounds, and the low back. She just started taking a pain pill (tramadol) \nbut does not like it because it makes her sleepy. Excuses for everything and always saying \u201cI cannot\u201d to most anything you ask her about moving her legs.

It is really up to her to want to live her life. You can tell her how much yet she has to live for but you cannot make her life. My wife at 46 suffers every day, but is still trying to make the most of her life.\n\nShe was diagnosed shortly after breaking her foot getting off the couch one day. And we are active, she was not heavy, this disease is no joke.\n\nShe just wants to experience as much as she can while she can.\n\nIs there something your sister has always wanted to see or do? Something you can motivate her with? Thank you so much. She use to like painting and cross stitch. \nI will think about the painting and cross scores stitch m.\nTy", "UNIFIED-RHEUM Study Invitation "]
