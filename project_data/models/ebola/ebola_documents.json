This suggests that the known new caseload has declined as well. Unless a larger proportion of all cases are unknown to investigators, which could only be logically explained if previously unaffected areas that are off-grid from investigators are getting hit very hard, then the decline in new cases (known and unknown) is likely genuine.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth.\n\n* Mali's high CFR does not inspire confidence. While Nigeria suffered a couple dozen confirmed cases, they quarantined many suspected cases. There successful response also meant the health ministry was generally a step ahead of new transmissions which allowed them to promptly deliver medical assistance for those exhibiting the earliest symptoms. Mali's CFR indicates posthumous or delayed discovery of someone infected, which means there was a lot more risk of further transmissions and it also indicates a contact tracing effort that is a step behind the spread.\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely. This scenario would mean that we will continue to see sustained rates of &gt;&gt;100 new cases per day until a vaccine, if found, is widely distributed, which likely will not be the case until late 15Q2 at the earliest.\n\n* The next 6 days will be important for Mali, which will likely be when and if any new cases resulted from those infected by the index patient from Guinea.\n\n* As expected, Sierra Leone's reported cumulative cases probably exceeded Liberia's by Dec 6th. Unofficially, there are thousands more unreported Sierra Leone cases compared to Liberia, and that can be deduced from the reported death figures alone.\n\n* After Dec 5th, it will have been 21 days since the last time Liberia reported a 4-day caseload exceeding 100 events. If Liberia continues to report =&lt;100 cases during the next 2 updates, it will likely stay that way unless a major relapse in public vigilance and contact tracing occurs.\n\n**Forecast:**\n\n* Steep drop in Sierra Leone cases will likely drive the next 4-day period rate down to 100-110/day.", "Going from school to school in DRC to raise awareness about Ebola | 01APR19 ", "Canadian doctor paints grim picture upon return from Ebola frontlines ", "Jan 5th-8th new cases: Liberia - 120, Sierra Leone - 177, Guinea - 20.

It has not yet been proven that the virus is the etiological agent of a novel bat disease, but healthy Schreiber's long-fingered bats were not found to contain traces of the viruses, thereby at least suggesting that the virus may be pathogenic for certain bats. Necropsies of dead bats did not reveal macroscopic pathology, but microscopic examination suggested viral pneumonia. Cueva del Lloviu is frequented by tourists, yet no human infections or disease has ever been observed, suggesting that LLOV is the second filovirus not pathogenic for humans (the first one being Reston virus (RESTV)).\n\n\n\nEbola Virus Disease (EVD)\n\n\n&gt;Results\nBat carcasses from Cueva del Lloviu, Asturias, Spain (5\u00b0 32\u2032 8.1\u2032 \u00b4 N and 43\u00b0 30\u2032 5.6\u2032 \u00b4 W) were collected for anatomical, microbiological and toxicological analyses.

BBC ", "If there was any reason, not political, for quarantining returning HCWs, then they would be quarantining HCWs here at home who are helping the sick, too... In their infinite wisdom, they implemented mandatory quarantine on people who were at as much risk as the HCWs back here at home who are treating Ebola patients.\n\nSo why have not they started to quarantine HCWs who assisted the sick back here at home? I guess it is easier to *sell* the quarantine of those who came back from far off lands. Not so easy to quarantine dozens of HCWs that assisted symptomatic patients (and maybe non-symptomatic, the public has seen it fit to have contacts of a non-symptomatic patient be quarantined already with regards to Texas and those who went bowling).\n\nThis maneuver is not founded on science, but was specifically crafted for election season. \n\nThe repercussions of doubling volunteer HCWs time commitment, and treating them without respect or consideration (as the case with the NJ nurse), is going to hurt the response effort over in West Africa. Heaven forbid the public find out that some people may have incubated a lot longer than 21 days. Heaven forbid the public find out someone is semen may be contagious for weeks or months afterwards. When you craft a policy not rooted in science or expert opinion, but in response to the irrational fears of the public, there is no saying how far politicians will go to appease the public.\n\nOf all the highly publicly known cases of Ebola that were exported, or among Western HCWs, most if not all became symptomatic before they were isolated, and none of them infected others prior to being at a stage where they were so ill they needed extensive assistance moving about (I am specifically referring to Ebola-does not-exist patient Sawyer who was vomiting and stooling on the plane, did not infect anyone on the plane, but infected those in the airport who had to be very physical with him to get him to the hospital, and the 2 nurses at Dallas). People need to be taught that someone who just became symptomatic has a viral-load that is 1000-100000x times less than someone who is more advanced.\n\nFurther, by imposing mandatory quarantine on those who may or may not need it, due to reasons that are political at best, you risk driving information underground. Travelers from West Africa may conceal information, and that also runs the risk of them not being informed of the things they should be doing, like running their temperature twice a day. Further, if someone lies to avoid mandatory quarantine, how willing will they be to reveal the obviousness of their lie if they do become symptomatic... Will they sit idly by hoping it is not Ebola? We have seen how the public turns on people who do not self-quarantine after exposure to even a suspected case, and the chatter from many authorities about prosecuting any kind of deception regarding this issue...\n\nAs it has been pointed out repeatedly, mandatory quarantine for returning HCWs will discourage many from going to West Africa to begin with, at a time when the response effort needs to be growing exponentially, and not getting halved. Trained and educated foreign HCWs are a major part of the response effort in West Africa, they disproportionately supervise the ETUs, train local volunteers, and command the logistics.\n\nIf the situation in West Africa is not contained, it is not just the negligible threat that a few isolated exported cases pose to the West, but the stability of a continent and the global economy. It will not just be a case every couple weeks that gets exported here, but dozens from all over Africa.  Close out Africa? They will just keep lying and keep coming in. What next, no more black people allowed? Quarantine does not work on the large scale, it is too easy to subvert. We need to be doing EVERYTHING we can do to stop the outbreak at the source, and not taking measures back at home that hurt that effort just to reduce our risk of a Western outbreak from nil to nil.\n\nWe should not be weighing what risk a few intimately involved persons to returning HCWs are put in, against the capacity of the response effort in West Africa where 100s are being infected each day... Especially when that risk has yet been shown to materialize among those in the early stages of the illness.\n\nIf these politicians take the next logical step to mandatory quarantine of returning HCWs and start quarantining HCWs here at home who assist the sick, it will not be long before hospitals reject Ebola patients or run out of willing and trained HCWs, especially if the frequency of exported cases continue to escalate. This policy has so many opportunities to blow up in our faces, all so that they can score political points at the expense of West Africa.\n\nWhen every expert is telling you that you are wrong, maybe you should reconsider your position.\n\nEdit: **Thanks for gold!**", "Ebola Zaire Vaccine Granted Conditional Approval in the European Union ", "Local &amp; North Carolina state news from Raleigh, NC ", "First case of ebola reported in Africa's most populous city Lagos ", "Ebola Outbreak: Mali Confirms First Case Of The Deadly Virus ", "EBOLA ", "U.S. Incentive Program May Alter the Challenging Economics of Ebola Vaccines ", "Yale study paints worrying picture of Ebola epidemic, Projects 90,000 deaths in Liberia by Mid-December ", "That is not good!

Rather, it reflects a deterioration in the ability of overwhelmed responders to record accurate epidemiological data. It is clear from field reports and first responders that EVD cases are being under-reported from several key locations, and laboratory data that have not yet been integrated into official estimates indicate an increase in the number of new cases in Liberia. There is **no evidence that the EVD epidemic in West Africa is being brought under control**, though **there is evidence of a decline in incidence in the districts of Lofa in Liberia, and Kailahun and Kenema in Sierra Leone**. - (\n\n* ( Interesting thing I recently noticed which supports the previous link: Sierra Leone's total bed capacity at their management and holding centers is very similar to the country's reported 4-day totals, which supports using occupied beds as a measurement of daily caseloads.

Health authorities announced on Mon \nthat a Spanish nurse at Madrid's Carlos III hospital who treated a\npatient repatriated from Sierra Leone had twice tested positive for\nEbola.\n\nHer husband had also been admitted to hospital and was in isolation,\nand a 2nd nurse from the same team that treated both repatriated Ebola\nvictims was also being tested. In this case, the nurse contacted the\nauthorities on Mon  complaining of a fever. She was in\nisolation in the Carlos III Hospital while authorities waited for the\ntest results, a spokesperson for the Madrid regional government said.\n\nStaff at the hospital told El Pais that the protective suits they were\ngiven did not meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards, which\nspecify that suits must be impermeable and include breathing\napparatus. Staff also pointed to latex gloves secured with adhesive\ntape as an example of how the suits were not impermeable and noted\nthat they did not have their own breathing equipment.\n\nThe nurse was part of a team attending to missionary MGV, 69, who died\n4 days after being brought to Carlos III hospital on 20 Sep 2014. The\nsame team, including the nurse, also treated missionary MP, 75, who\nwas repatriated from Liberia in August 2014 and died 5 days later.\nStaff at the hospital said waste from the rooms of both patients was\ncarried out in the same elevator used by all personnel and, in the\ncase of the 2nd patient, the hospital was not evacuated.\n\nThe European commission said on Tue  it had written to the\nSpanish health minister \"to obtain some clarification\" on how the\nnurse had become infected when all EU member states were supposed to\nhave taken measures to prevent transmission. There is obviously a\nproblem somewhere,\" the commission spokesman Frederic Vincent said.\n\nSpanish health authorities have said that professionals treating Ebola\npatients in Spain always follow WHO protocols. The nurse would have\nentered GV's room just twice, said Antonio Alemany, from the regional\ngovernment of Madrid, both times wearing protective equipment. \"We\ndo not know yet what failed,\" Alemany said. \"We are investigating the\nmechanism of infection.\"\n\nThe nurse was in a stable condition. She had alerted the ministry of a\nslight fever on 30 Sep 2014 and been checked into a hospital in\nAlcorcon, on the outskirts of Madrid, with a high fever on Mon [6 Oct\n2014]. The nurse, who is married with no children, was transferred to\nCarlos III hospital early on Tuesday morning . El Mundo\nreported that it was the nurse who asked to be tested for Ebola,\nhaving to insist repeatedly on being tested before it was done on\nMonday .\n\nWhile staff at the Alcorcon hospital were waiting for the test\nresults, the nurse remained in a bed in the emergency room, separated\nonly by curtains from other patients, hospital staff told El Mundo.\nTheir version of events clashes with that of health authorities, who\nhave said the patient was isolated from the 1st moment.\n\nThe woman was on holiday at an unknown location when she began showing\nsymptoms. \"We are drawing up a list of all the people she may have\nbeen in contact with, including with health professionals at the\nAlcorcon hospital,\" said Alemany, estimating that more than 30 people\nwere being monitored for any sign of symptoms.\n\nIn August 2014, Spain became the 1st European country in the current,\nfast-spreading outbreak to evacuate patients for treatment. The\ndecision prompted concern among health professionals, who said Spanish\nhospitals were not adequately equipped to handle Ebola.\n\n\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n--\nSpain: contacts quarantined\n-------------------------------------\n7 Oct 2014: (BBC) Three other people, including the nurse's husband,\nhave been quarantined. The nurse had twice gone into the room where\nMr. GV had been treated to be directly involved in his care and to\ndisinfect the room after his death. Both times, she was wearing\nprotective clothing. Madrid healthcare director Antonia Alemany told\nreporters that according to the information available: \"The nurse went\ninto the room wearing the individual protection gear, and there is no\nknowledge of an accidental exposure to risk.\"... The hospital was\nreported to have had extreme protective measures in place including 2\nsets of overalls, gloves and goggles. \n\nHowever, health workers told El Pais newspaper that the clothing did\nnot have level-4 biological security, which is fully waterproof and\nwith independent breathing apparatus. Instead, it was level 2, the\npaper says, as photographs provided by staff indicated that the\noveralls did not allow for ventilation, and the gloves were made of\nlatex and bound with adhesive tape.\n\nDoctors are also monitoring 22 people with whom the nurse had contact\nat Alcorcon hospital and 30 people working at Carlos III, according to\nhealth sources quoted by Spanish newspaper El Pais.

The news was\nreleased by the Norwegian Medicines Agency on Tue ,\naccording to NTB. Steinar Madsen, medical director of the Norwegian\nMedicines Agency, said to Dagens Medisin: \"It looks like we could get\nthe last available dose of ZMapp to Norway. The medicine is now in\nCanada.\"\n\nAccording to the professional medic's magazine, the agency has given\nOslo University hospital the authorisation to import Ebola medicines\nnot approved of in Norway. Madsen said: \"When there are patients with\nan acute need for medicine, we allow import of medicines that are not\napproved.\"\n\nWhile the medicine Avigan came to Norway already on Tue ,\nTKM-Ebola will arrive on Wed . Madsen reported that ZMapp\nhas been the most difficult to get. \"It must be said it is lucky that\nNorway will get the last dose of ZMapp. There are no more doses in the\nworld, and it takes a long time to produce. It is the hospital\npharmacy that gets the medicine through contact networks all over the\nworld, while the Norwegian Medicines Agency gives the necessary\napproval,\" said Madsen.\n\nMadsen explained further the medicine will be imported to the Ebola\npatient only. It has been tried on only a small number of patients,\nand the effect of the medicine is, therefore, not fully known. Madsen\nsaid: \"Of those who have taken ZMapp, the majority have survived.\nAnother person has survived with TKM-Ebola, but the medicines are used\non a small number of patients.\"\n\nIt has been revealed that at least 27 Norwegians are still currently\nworking in Ebola-ridden areas and include:\n- Medecins Sans Frontiers: Around 20 Norwegians take part in the Ebola\neffort in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.\n- Red Cross: 7 Norwegian employees in areas struck by Ebola.\n- NORCAP: A Norwegian health logistics worker will travel to Liberia\non Fri .

I am hoping to connect up with some people who are currently on the ground in the infected countries, or have been there in the last few months. \n\nPlease message me if you think you might be able to help!\n\nThanks!", "WHO to meet on Congo's Ebola outbreak as toll soars ", "Share this with your friends and on social media ", "Ebola airborne: A nightmare that could happen  ", "CDC Chief: Why I do not support a travel ban to combat Ebola outbreak ", "50,000 people mass quarantined in Monrovia ", "Battling Ebola: Tracking the Virus | BU Today | Boston University ", "I am looking for reasons why Ebola will not spread in New York or other big cities... but read this first. \n\n\nImagine a business man thinking he has the Flu - he is got some MAJOR contracts to work on for the next two days - he cannot be off. He takes medication that makes him feel a bit better, and continues working - and commuting to work on the subway trains. He sneezes on his hands - a nasty nasty habit that too many people tend to do. He holds the hand rails, and grips on the train, so do 50 people after him that day. Maybe he swaps handrails as more people get on, so BOTH handrails are coated in sneeze. \n\nGood luck tracing all THOSE contacts...\n\n\nThen there is people in America who do not get paid if they do not work- they tend to be in service jobs that work with the public. When Ebola is not in America (as far as anyone knows officially), they have every reason to assume it is Flu and not Ebola... also their rent depends on being in work - they have worked in the past with a high fever, \n\nImagine one such worker - a McDonalds employee in a very busy McDonalds in the heart of New York... they have two days of terrible symptoms before they are too ill to work. But they get pumped up on Pro-Plus, flu medication, paracetamol, and everything else they can find, and push through those two work days... sneezing, eyes watering, coughing, high fever, sweating... a friend on the same shift as them says they look shit, and to go home - they refuse - they need rent. Their friends nods sadly.\n\nThey sneeze into their hands through the day - as most people do. And continue passing Happy Meals to customers through their 8 hour shift.\n\nThose customers hold the boxes, which are smeared with sweat, saliva, and mucus (maybe an undetectable amount of blood) from the sick worker, they open the box, and pick up chips from their unwashed hands, the chips go directly to the mucus membranes of their mouth - together with Ebola virus.\n\nHow many patrons does an average New York McDonalds worker serve in a shift?\n\nWould not that be an R0 of 100?! More?\n\nThat is why I am scared of Ebola in cities - so many people forced to work when they are sick.\n\nThose two infected above - say they manage to infect ONLY 25 people each over both days - that is being VERY careful with the numbers.\n\nThat is 50 unknown infections walking New York. Many of them will be colleagues, who also commute, who also do not get paid for being sick.\n\nThose 50 people go on to infect 25 each..... that is ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY further infections.\n\nWhen does the CDC announce Ebola in New York? It will shut the ENTIRE CITY down.\n\n\nIk, so that is what is worrying me.\n\nCan anyone poke some holes in the scenario I give, and say \"Look, X wont happen because Y...\"?\n\n", "Decline of Ebola in Liberia Prompts Fears of Complacency ", "Most Maps of the New Ebola Outbreak Are Wrong (Cartographers are all using inaccurate and outdated GIS data) ", "Ebola death toll tops 5,000, steep rise in Sierra Leone cases: WHO ", "Passive immunization in treating ebola ", "22 Foods That Look Like The Ebola Virus ", "The most ridiculous Ebola \u2018products\u2019 people are trying sell on the Internet ", "Rapid Detection and Response Are Essential to Stopping Ebola | Tom Frieden, MD, MPH ", "Crossing Buffalo US Border into Canada via car - went through Ebola screening with customs Just found this interesting.

It is a quandary. We cannot provide BSL-4 level care in our community hospitals. If this continues, do we create sanitariums with limited high-tech care (lowered acuity of care with no more than IVs) to protect the staff?

Instead, it would involve temporarily suspending visas of hot zone nationals trying to enter the US.  Let us review the most popular arguments against such a ban:\n\n**People will just sneak in, and then we will not be able to track them.**  For a Liberian national (for example) to enter the US illegally he would have to 1) sneak across the closed border with Ivory Coast, 2) buy a non-Liberian passport on the black market, 3) somehow get the US to give him a visa for his black market passport, and 4) fly to the US, connecting through Europe.  Unless this guy is a Liberian James Bond, he is going to have a hard time doing this at all, much less doing it during the incubation period for Ebola.\n\n**Cutting off trade will make the local economies collapse.**  Since when does trade travel by passenger jet?  Most trade travels by cargo ship.  Keeping the crews of cargo ships from inadvertently spreading the virus is a big deal (and something no one has really talked about here), but that is a different policy discussion.  \n\n**Aid workers need to feel certain they will be able to get out of the country.**  Indeed, but surely the US military can handle moving aid workers into and out of the region.  \n\nAnd finally, here is my theory for why the Obama administration and the various aid agencies *really* do not want a travel ban: **it would damage their relationships with the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.**  The West African governments in question really do not want travel bans (unsurprisingly).  One can imagine a situation where MSF (for example) came out in favor of a travel ban and, as a result, faced blow back on their aid workers in the region.  We know that the Liberian government fought with Nigerian doctors over keeping Sawyer in quarantine.  (They wanted him to attend a conference, heaven help us.)  \n\nI know it sounds conspiracy theorist, but to me it is the most rational explanation: they need the cooperation of the West African governments to fight the virus, so they are reluctant to cross them.

All four share similar transmission patterns between animals and people.\n&gt; \n&gt; The potential hot spots they found include areas that have already experienced outbreaks, as well as some that have not usually been thought of as risk areas. For example, the group found that parts of Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Somalia, and South Sudan are highly susceptible to any of the four diseases. For Ebola and Marburg, the team predicted that areas around the Congo River in the CAR would be most at risk.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to the analysis, parts of West Africa rank highest as sources of widespread epidemics involving any of the four viruses, including Gueckedou province in Guinea, where West Africa's recent Ebola outbreak got its start.\n&gt; \n&gt; Simon Hay, DPhil, DSc, study coauthor and director of geospatial science at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle, said in an IHME press release that, as seen with West Africa, it is vital to prevent or stop epidemics at the earliest possible stage. \"This study's framework provides an important tool for pinpointing where local surveillance and pre-emptive countermeasures are most needed.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The authors also said national assessments can mask important subnational differences.\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter Piot, MD, PhD, another study coauthor and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said, \"By assessing pandemic potential at these different stages, we can begin to identify locations where different interventions or prevention measures could have the greatest impact. The various stages reflect important transitions in an outbreak and influence what interventions should be prioritized in which location.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; In an accompanying editorial in the same issue, two infectious disease experts said gaps and bias in surveillance limit the ability to predict zoonotic spillover, but the new risk estimates combine geographical information in index cases and viral detections in animals, relating the information to environmental drivers. They noted that the nations most vulnerable to secondary transmission are also ones that have political instability. The authors are Chikwe Ihekweazu, MD, MPH, with the Nigeria Center for Disease Control, and Ibrahim Abubakar, MBBS, PhD, with University College London.\n&gt; \n&gt; They said point out that the study authors say the work should inform investments at each epidemic stage, but they do not say where the support will come from or which institutions should receive the resources. The two said that, in the wake of the West Africa's Ebola outbreak, more emphasis has been placed on strengthening national public health institutes, rather than depending on the World Health Organization, which they said does not have the resources to respond to and manage all VHF threats in an area as vast as Africa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oct 11 Lancet (\n&gt; \n&gt; Oct 11 Lancet (\n&gt; \n&gt; Oct 11 IHME (\n\n^(Source: ", "Standing Among The Living: One Man\u2019s Journey Through the Ebola Crisis - BBC Africa Eye documentary ", "Ebola virus mutating, scientists say ", "Ebola Was Here ", "Rick Perry owes a public apology to health care workers.

Those of you who have to isolate for 21 days, tell reddit what you need to make it tolerable. From a scientific stand point, when you have early symptoms, there is only a very slim chance (but we cannot yet say a 0 chance) you could infect anyone (as far as we know), but why would you want to take the chance?  Particularly since we do not know if some people are more vulnerable than others (very young, very old, pregnant, immune compromised, co-infection, etc..).  We do not yet know if there is a \"most vulnerable population\" that we need to protect while, most every one else is safe.  We do not yet know that.  \n\nI deal with a lot of risk assessment and I understand about low risk but I also understand unknown and perceived risk.  I know a parents fear for the health of their child.  Ebola still has a lot of unknowns and that makes it both an unknown and perceived risk (which may, or may not, be high enough to merit control).  Most significantly,**the occurrence of two infected nurses where none were expected greatly damaged public trust and heightened perceived risk**.  This is why it was so intensely important to not have any unexpected cases.  We got that wrong and are paying the price for it.  Frieden's definitive (and clearly false) statements of how US hospitals were prepared, severely damaged public trust.  Right now, there is too much unknown and too little trust in the health authorities, and instead of winning back that trust, they seem determined to further erode it.    \n\nBut more than that, even if you are sure you will not make others sick, how do you justify harming someones business, just because you want to be out and about?  Even if no one gets sick, businesses can get damaged due to the perceived risk.   Why do you expect others to be obligated to accept that risk (and unknowingly)?  The thing to ask yourself is, would you subject your child or your child's business to that same low occurrence risk (but high consequence risk) you are asking others to take (and for no better reason than a chance to be out and about)?  \n\nMost people would rather take the risk bus without a probability than the one with a low probability, especially with their children.  \n\nAlso, maybe this is something that reddit could even help out with, by supporting those who are having to hole up for 21 days.  Reddit could likely come up with some suggestions to help out and make it less horrible. Maybe not all your wishes can come true, but I would not be surprised if something can be done to help you out, at least a bit.\n\n**Edit**:  I am not talking about trained people working with proper PPE and trained to do so in a controlled facility.  People working in west Africa not only are exposed while working under less than ideal conditions, they are also exposed to waiting rooms full of sick people, some of whom do have Ebola.  They are also potentially exposed while outside of work.  ie, they have exposure without PPE.  They are much higher risk than a trained person working in an appropriately equipped medical facility.  \n", "Risk of Ebola\u2018s spread from Congo now \u2018very high,\u2018 WHO says  Because of the nature of this subreddit, I could not make a text post but while the \"second wave\" of ebola in Beni seemed to be dying dying down recently things again look to be growing worse.

( Dated: November 2019\n\n( Dated: January 2020\n\n( Dated: February 2020\n\n(\n\n&gt;Ebola vaccines are vaccines either approved or in development to prevent Ebola. The first vaccine to be approved in the United States was rVSV-ZEBOV in December 2019. It had been used extensively in the Kivu Ebola epidemic under a compassionate use protocol. During the early 21st century, several vaccine candidates displayed efficacy to protect nonhuman primates (usually macaques) against lethal infection.\n&gt;\n&gt;Vaccines include replication-deficient adenovirus vectors, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis (VSV) and human parainfluenza (HPIV-3) vectors, and virus-like nanoparticle preparations. Conventional trials to study efficacy by exposure of humans to the pathogen after immunization are not ethical in this case. For such situations, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established the \"animal efficacy rule\" allowing licensure to be approved on the basis of animal model studies that replicate human disease, combined with evidence of safety and a potentially potent immune response (antibodies in the blood) from humans given the vaccine. Clinical trials involve the administration of the vaccine to healthy human subjects to evaluate the immune response, identify any side effects and determine the appropriate dosage. These vaccines are good, but the quote you mention is using traditional methods of producing a vaccine. With mRNA tech, alot of trial and error can be skipped in producing a vector to hold the viral epitopes. Instead, the epitopes can be easily coded in to a RNA sequence and tested right away to look for efficacy. If there is a silver lining to the pandemic, it is the emergence and use of this tech. At this point in the development of the SARS-CoV2 / COVID-19 vaccines, the mRNA technology still presents a number of unanswered questions. Some of them regarding, as of yet unknown side-effects.  Unknown because they have not existed long enough for the scientific and medical communities to completely understand.\n\nAnything introduced to the body with the stated ability to modify the cellular structure of the organism needs to be studied in close detail for a protracted period before declaring it safe for use on all people everywhere.

Until it threatens or hits a first-world country, we are probably not going to hear the talking heads on the news mention it. ####1^st World Countries &amp; Ebola:\n\nIn Liberia on the 15^th of September 2014, Thomas Eric Duncan became infected with ebola.  He arrived in Dallas, Texas 5 days later.  Became symptomatic on September 24^th and died on October 8^th, 2014. None of the six family members he lived with in Dallas apartment became infected.  \n\nModern sanitation utilities bringing fresh water into homes and carry waste away appear to be an effective deterrent against the spread of Ebola Virus Disease.  \n\nSuspect the actual reasons why this is not receiving media coverage is because of it is location.  This is one of the most remote regions of the planet. We are at the eleven month mark of the DRC outbreak and there have been 2,345 cases and 1,586 deaths. \n\nAt the eleven month mark of the west African outbreak, there were 23,573 cases and 9,556 deaths.  \n\nSimilarly at the 11^th month mark of the west African outbreak the global health community had not arrived at a consensus about caring for those infected and preliminary work on a vaccine had bit yet begun.  \n\nAt the beginning of the outbreak in DRC, began setting up ebola treatment units and used the protocols developed in west Africa to effectively treat patients. They also authorized use of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and will have vaccinated 150,000 by the end of today, the 4^th of July 2019.  Use of the Ring vaccination strategy has inhibited the spread of ebola. Abundantly clear by the numbers, both vaccine and strategy are effective. \n\nIf it were not for warfare in the area, this out break would be all but over. The progress of the epidemic remains nonlinear. It is not progressing as fast as the West African epidemic because of the vaccine and heightened international response early on.  In the West African epidemic the disease was allowed to spread unchecked for quite a long time.  This changes the early part of the nonlinear curve with temporally disproportionate results - delaying for months the extreme geometric progression without preventing it.\n\nThe environment of this one is different though. The migratory population, the conflict, even the seasons are relevant to containment.  This is a very difficult epidemiological environment. You wind up with smaller disease cells spread out over a much wider area and vastly larger population.  It makes containment much less manageable.\n\nMy preference leans toward a panic response.  I know that is not a permissible opinion in this sub, but I am not going to temper my beliefs to suit the sub's moderation.  Ebola is desperately serious.  The fatality rate of this outbreak is dire.  In this outbreak two people out of three who contract the disease die, and most of the rest have lifelong disabilities.  The recovered can be contagious for months in semen and other fluids.  Perhaps a year. The area is a conflict zone and there are warlords so bold as to charge humanitarian health efforts for access to the afflicted, to take arms against the effort to end the outbreak. There are indications that some are learning to exploit the survivors as combatants and perhaps even weaponize the contagion.\n\nThe relief money spent is becoming a funding source for the conflict.  That will not end well.\n\nIt is my belief that a moderate and measured response is prolonging the outbreak and increasing the global risk.  This is Ebola, a level 4 pathogen.  A visceral, overwhelming outraged global response can bring an end to the outbreak in a few months, and we can go back to worrying about when it will come up again.  We can put the fire out, now, and argue about the precise degree we overreacted later.  Or, we can do that a year from now with 10x the number dead.\n\nIt should be plain that the current plan is insufficient simply by the slope of this graph.  It is my belief that *no matter how long we let this progress, that panic response is **required** to bring an end to this outbreak.*. The question really is how many thousands of people have to die, how much risk of an uncontainable epidemic the world has to bear before we give that response.  \n\nThere are times when overreacting is the right thing to do.  This is one of those times.  We can argue about the dimensions of a perfect reaction after the outbreak is over.  Then we will have time. EBOLA is as much a cultural disease as it is a virus spreading...what do I mean...almost the entire continent of Africa depends on human-to-human contact unlike the westerner countries...Africans can share the same soup from the same bowl, sit next to each other in the same taxi, room together in large families...this respectable loving of humanity is beautiful but it also spread disease...added with a lack of infrastructure such as running water it poses an issue...I am speaking from someone who is trying to solve the issue please comment appropriately towards solutions.

Physicians and nurses are the primary target of the volunteer effort. They are training locals to serve in place of a tech. I believe this to be helpful, but I know that American EMTs can help.

Such reclassifications will escape my detection unless they shifted 100s of cases, and today's update may be a victim of a minor set of removals and I have no way of knowing and accounting for it like when I do when 100s of cases are instead added.

Changing the methodology of how this series reported figures would undermine previous reports. **However**, I am **considering** changing the methodology for the reporting of Liberia's numbers starting with the next period. Since so few new cases were reported this period compared to how many confirmed cases were just reported, the cumulative totals since mid-Nov for new cases vs new confirmed cases has come very close to eachother. That allows me to change the methodology without creating significant double counts.

Thanks for sharing information from what may have been a costly lesson. Hey, I just want to be clear... there is no ebola outside the congo. If you are not in the congo or a neighboring country and you have not been in contact with people who have recently come from there, you have not been exposed to ebola. It can be scary to deal with bodily fluids, but if you would like to look after your health your best bet is to get vaccinated for hepatitis, because unless you are in an extremely specific part of the world then you are likely never going to be at risk of contracting ebola. Handsoap can kill Ebola. It is a weak virus outside of the body. Chlorine is used for its cost and ease of use for large areas.

Unlike most previous outbreaks, which occurred in remote, localized spots, this one began in a border region where roads have been improved and people travel a lot. In this case, the disease was on the move before health officials even knew it had struck.\n\n&gt;Also, this part of Africa had never seen Ebola before. Health workers did not recognize it and had neither the training nor the equipment to avoid infecting themselves or other patients.

On the other hand, the ten patients who were hospitalized in this CTE were not affected and were transferred to other health facilities. Of these patients, four are confirmed carriers of the Ebola virus and have been transferred to the Butembo CTE. The six suspected patients were transferred to the Alima transit center in Katwa. \n\n* Butembo's mayor is urging the people of the country to work with Ebola response teams to stop the spread of the disease in the city. He also denounced the incivists whose intention is the destabilization of health experts.

This is the tenth   epidemic that the DRC knows. It is a very dangerous disease, \"he said, adding that he will deploy a large team for the elections. \"We ourselves have just received instructions that once the teams are in the field, they will be vaccinated and we will also follow all the advice of health professionals. \"These elections will involve all neighborhoods, even the neighborhoods where the Ebola outbreak continues,\" said Corneille Naanga. \n\n\n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since the start of vaccination on 8 August 2018, **83,517 people have been vaccinated** , including 21,357 in Katwa, 20,613 in Beni, 10,220 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 2,839 in Kalunguta, 2,581 in Goma, 2,317 in Komanda, 2,084 in Oicha, 1,813 to Mandima, 1,325 to Kyondo, 1,357 to Karisimbi, 1,283 to Kayina, 1,094 to Bunia, 1,064 to Vuhovi, 920 to Masereka, 772 to Mutwanga, 767 to Biena, 700 to Lubero, 590 to Rutshuru, 583 to Musienene, 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 426 in Rwampara (Ituri), 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 207 in Kirotshe, 141 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani . \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018 **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated February 25, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 875, of which 810 are confirmed and 65 are probable.

In discussion with the different partners involved in epidemiological surveillance, the decision was made to reclassify all cases in the health zone where they started the symptoms of the disease. Several questions arose as to the classification of some cases that had moved between two or even three health zones between the onset of symptoms and their death. In these particular cases, only thorough investigations can determine where the person has started to show signs of the disease, which may take several days. Pending the results of the investigations, some of these cases are tentatively classified in the health zone where they were detected. \n\n* These cases include the patient from Katwa who fled to Bunia with her family after falling ill in her area of \u200b\u200bresidence but whose body was found in Komanda. This patient was initially classified in Komanda but was reclassified to the Katwa Health Zone after completion of the in-depth investigation. \n\n* On Tuesday, February 26, 2019, Lubero District Chief Medical Officer said that a case of Ebola had been detected in the health zone of Lubero. This is a young woman from Katwa, who was known to be in contact with another confirmed case and who refused to be transferred to the Ebola Treatment Center when she became ill. She ran away from Katwa for Lubero. She died the next day at the Lubero General Referral Hospital from where the alert was launched.

This attack took place only three days after the arson attack of the Katwa CTE, the neighboring health zone. \n\n* At the time of the attack, 38 suspected patients and 12 confirmed patients were treated at the CTE. Of the suspected patients, 32 fled. And among the confirmed cases, 8 were found in their single rooms. Research is underway to find the 4 confirmed fugitives.

This workshop brought together all the national and international actors of the response, including all the health authorities of the different health zones of the region. \n\n* The purpose of the two-day workshop was to explain the PSR 3 to all local health authorities, senior staff of strategic coordination and sub-coordination as well as to gain ownership of the plan to ensure better Implementation. \n\n* This new plan focuses on three important areas:*\n\n * The anchoring of the response in the local health system : The leadership and the expertise of the response belong to the specialized teams while the optimization of the functioning of the health system is the responsibility of the actors of the local health system (Provincial Division of Health). Health, Health Zone and Health Area).\n\n * Establishment of an information management system : The information management mechanism has been strengthened to improve data collection and analysis at all levels.\n\n * The importance of accountability : An important addition in SRP 3 is the accountability framework for each stakeholder involved in the response, both local providers and international partners. This accountability framework clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of each organization in the response to assess their performance on the ground. \n\n\n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 August 2018, **84,094 persons have been vaccinated** , including 21,504 in Katwa, 20,679 in Beni, 10,486 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 2,839 in Kalunguta, 2,590 in Goma, 2,317 in Komanda, 2,084 in Oicha, 1,813 to Mandima, 1,357 to Karisimbi, 1,325 to Kyondo, 1,283 to Kayina, 1,094 to Bunia, 1,064 to Vuhovi, 920 to Masereka, 772 to Mutwanga, 769 to Lubero, 767 to Biena, 590 to Rutshuru, 583 to Musienene, 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 426 in Rwampara (Ituri), 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 207 in Kirotshe, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated February 27, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 885, of which 820 are confirmed and 65 are probable.

Comparing all the nurses who contracted Ebola from their patients. Regarding the nurses in Dallas and the one in Spain who were infected with Ebola while caring for their patients; A lot of people are questioning why the nurses in Dallas became infected, while the nurses who treated all the other Ebola patients in America did not. Did they break protocol?  Were they not trained well enough? Did they have inadequate gear?\n\nI think there may be another reason why the infection was passed from patient to the care givers.   \n\nFirst, let us look at how Ebola progresses in the patient. We all know that the patient is not contagious until they begin to show symptoms. As the virus replicates within the host, the symptoms get progressively worse. By the time the patient is at the end stage, the virus permeates all bodily fluids. As the host dies, the amount of virus in the body is at it is highest, and the patient at the most contagious stage. Every reservoir of bodily fluid is riddled with the virus. This includes the lungs.\n\nNow let us look at what the nurse from Spain had in common with the nurses form Dallas. There are two things that separate them from the other cases.\n\n1. Unlike the other cases, their patients entered the end stage of Ebola in a modern medical facility.\n\n2. Their patients, in what western medicine sees as a natural response in treatment for critical conditions, were intubated and placed on ventilators.\n\nIt is possible that the highly contagious fluids in the repertory system, during the end stage of the infection, may have been picked up by the ventilator and became aerosolized around the instrument.\n\nIt makes sense to me that there would be very little information about end stage Ebola and the use of mechanical life support.  After all, they could have never afforded or even be able to deploy a ventilator in western Africa.

In 2014, peacekeepers from France and Georgia were implicated in incidents of sexual violence against young children in the Central African Republic.

This is in line with the exponential graphs we have seen for some time.  It varies a little around this figure.\n\n2^33, less a bit, is the number of people on our planet.

The data was also seemingly dwindling in the days prior. I would think this is connected? Change in the data is due to the nature of the outbreak changing. Use of the phrase, *'seemingly dwindling'*, is not realistic. Changes in the WHO Sitreps were seen from time to time over the course of the 2014-2016 outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.   It took many months for the WHO to adopt stratified reporting criteria and a the format changed several times before developing a unified format. The has been seen from the DRC reports in the past three months.  \n\nThe DRC MoH relies on the Internet as its communicate vehicle for providing updates.

How it took command of the situation, established vaccination policies and procedures, setup and runs ETU's as well as how it gathers, reports and when warranted, corrects data.  This demonstrates the Congo is a responsible member of the world health community. As its citizens are suffering the outbreak, nothing less was expected.  Kudos to the good doctor and those working with him!\n\n Appears the problem was *'technical'* in nature and now resolved: \n\n&gt; #### ***/! \\ Due to technical issues, there was a delay in sending the Ebola newsletter on Tuesday, January 1, 2019. We apologize for this inconvenience.***\n&gt; \n&gt; #### (\n&gt; \n&gt; ####  **( ( the following, just to use a recent article elsewhere on the subreddit:\n\n\"The internet has been cut off in Congo this week in an apparent effort by the government to prevent social media speculation about the results, while the opposition and observers have reported multiple problems with the election. The internet outage also has affected Ebola response efforts, with Congo's health ministry on Wednesday citing \"technical problems\" for the delay in sending its daily update on the outbreak.\"\n\nFrom the perspective of the health ministry's reports it would be technical problems, but the actual reason/cause for the shutdowns are being reported as intentional by major news agencies even using neutral search terms. The government has a history of problems to say the least, and HRW has plenty of information on how the election has gone. To start with the quote implies, *'a week'* when in fact it was only, *'a day'*, with that day being January 1^st.  You conclude the comment attempting to stress, *'The government has a history of problems'*, when this can be said of every government on the planet. The term, *'history of problems'*, is cliche and applicable to all governments, as a function of governments is to, *take care of problems*.\n\n Thought you were implying an excuse with the italics of a technical problem, does that mean you believe this?\n\nI specifically referred to the Human Rights Watch as an example, you are free to check out their recent report on the elections. The only one saying it is \"technical issues\" that I can see is the explanation of why the report was late, not why the net was out, regardless. \n\nYou are delusional if you think that most governments have the problems, internal and external, than the DRC's. \n\nIf it is some widespread technical issue, fine, but no one seems to think that. If it was purposeful, it has implications nationwide.  Your point is moot.  The service was out for a single day. If interested in determining the details of the *'technical difficulty'*, suggest you contact those responsible for providing the service.  \n\nAs to your 'delusional' allegation. Adopting an accusatory and argumentative tone is not known as a successful tactic in discussions. \n\nSo you know, there is a 'what-if' genre in Reddit.  You might find it more open to pontificating on topics without having to use facts to substantiate thoughts. \n\n It went on for more than one day. It was not like the entire \"Internet\" was shut off for the whole country. All articles refer to outages \"this week\". Maybe the health ministry was only affected for a day.\n\nWe have this as per CNN linked below:\n\n&gt;Speaking to Reuters Tuesday, a senior adviser to DRC President Joseph Kabila, said internet and text messaging services were shut down to preserve public order after \"fictitious results\" were circulated on social media.\n\nReuters:\n\n&gt;Kabila\u2019s government cut access to the internet as well as Radio France Internationale (RFI) and some local media this week, saying it wanted to prevent fake results from circulating. \n\nVICE:\n\n&gt;The ban is set to remain in place until the official result is announced on January 6.\n\nThis was done intentionally, and *created* technical issues for the health ministry. It is a fact that disruption of communication does not lead to good results for people in general, nevermind in emergencies or crises. They shut down SMS - text messaging - and apps commonly used as an alternative. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This thread has deviated from being about Ebola. \n\n*/r/ebola is a subreddit for news, information and discussion about Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)*.\n\n  \n\n\n", "WHO announces death of Peter Salama, former Ebola response leader ", "Where Does Ebola Come From?

Was it understandable, information correct? \n\nSigns and Symptoms \n\nEbola has symptom similarities to other ailments such as typhoid, and malaria. The early onsets of symptoms are similar to the flu as well. It is wise to study and familiarize with the differences of these illnesses. Ebola virus starts out very non-specific so provided below are the outlines of basic symptoms and signs of the Ebola virus. \n\nSymptoms may appear in 2-21 after exposure. The average time is 8-10 days. Ebola runs the course from onset of symptoms in around a couple of weeks but that is not confirmed. \n\nThe first symptoms for Ebola include having a fever (Typically greater than 38.6\u00b0C or 101.5\u00b0F) along with fatigue, weakness and muscle pain. Then there will also be severe headaches, migraines, body sweats and general malaise. The symptom of a sore throat may be included as well but it is not well confirmed. \n\nThen there will be more symptoms that include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and rashes. Unexplained hemorrhaging (Hemorrhage may start to develop in the second week of infection but is not well confirmed), bleeding or bruising internal, externally or both is a major sign of the virus. Examples may include bleeding gums or blood in still but it is not limited to those. Possible signs and symptoms of multi-organ impairment may occur such as kidney and liver. According to recent laboratory findings, virus symptoms might include low white blood cell and platelet counts, and elevated liver enzymes. \n\nLastly the infected may exhibit, jumbled thoughts, confusion, shock, brain damage, and incoherence. \n\n*Author: Merry A.

It is a big country.  It is spread out.  Some people have 2 hour commutes to work.  On public transportation.  Others in just their cars.  People take Southwest Airlines two hours and go 1,000 miles to visit their parents on the weekend. \n\nFlu Season is right around the corner.

Possible exposure to 160 people on a flight from Cleveland.  Possible exposure to who knows how many people IN Cleveland.\n\nWhat if this trend keeps up?  You get a confirmed case in Cinnicinati.  Then a week later you get two in Ft. Lauderale.  The another one outside of Albany.  Not some catastrophic, apocalyptic outbreak.  But what if in two months, there is a smattering of cases, spread out in 9 or 10 cities, across the US?\n\nRight in the middle of flu season?\n\nEbola is deadly.  But it is also nasty.  The way it kills you is absolutely terrifying.  And like it or not, more and and more Americans over the next few weeks are going to start learning just how awful this disease is, and what it does to the people it kills.  \n\nPeople are going to have that knowledge, with a decent likleyhood of cases spreading to multiple cities in the US, right in the middle of flu season.\n\n\nSo this winter, when tens of thousands of people start to feel aches, chills, a low grade fever, and then hear on the news that the lastest Ebola patient went through SEA-TAC or JFK or were at the Kansas City Chiefs game the day before they were admitted to the hospital, what are those tens of thousands of people going to do?\n\nSit around and start waiting to vomit their guts up and for blood to start leaking from their eyes?\n\nDoubtful.\n\n\n", "Homeless man exposed in Dallas sought ", "Mali toughens anti-Ebola checks at borders ", "Should we be wearing gloves handling coins and bills?

Previous research has shown that within approximately 3 months of acute EVD, as many as 28% to 100% have Ebola RNA in semen, and sexual transmission of Ebola has taken place up to 6 months after infection. This was the first study to measure prevalence of Ebola RNA through the 2-year mark, when 11 of the men, or 8%, had detectable Ebola RNA in their semen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Volunteers were recruited in Monrovia, Liberia, and donated semen samples every 90 days for the duration of the study. The longest time from EVD onset to detectable Ebola in semen was 965 days. The men who had Ebola RNA in their semen the longest were on average older and more likely to report vision problems than men who cleared the RNA earlier.\n&gt; \n&gt; Currently, the World Health Organization recommends that men who have been diagnosed as having EVD practice abstinence or use condoms for 12 months after recovery.

This morning I had a thought, but I will admit I know very little about microbiology, so I am fielding this to you guys to learn more. My thought was that this seems to have been a remarkably tricky disease to contain, considering that some people who should have been exposed have stayed healthy, while those who claimed they followed protocol have been on the short list of those who are infected.\n\nI recall reading an article about a Liberian girl who is caring for her two brothers after her mother, father, younger sister all died of the illness, and their corpses were in the house for over a week... but she is ok (for now). Yet somehow, we have hospital workers who have gowns, masks, and all sorts of medical equipment who end up getting it.\n\nMy questions (and theory) is, is it possible ebola becomes super-ultra infectious when it is excreted in someone is feces? I think about all the people who were around the patient in Texas while he was puking, coughing, and everything else, and they seem to be ok. But when they put him in a hospital bed and had to move his urine and feces from a bed pan, people responsible for taking care of this are getting sick. Plus, of the countries in West Africa getting hit the hardest, Liberia is well known to have poor sewage systems (if you ever watch the Vice documentary when they go to West Point). Remember that Liberian girl I mentioned above? Her parents were likely changing the baby's diapers. And, if I recall correctly, the Spanish nurse who got sick was responsible for changing the bed pan of the missionary.\n\nAgain, without knowing a darn thing about viruses and infectious diseases, this is just an uneducated guy throwing something out there. Can certain illnesses be more contagious when in certain fluids than others? And I do not mean in the sense that they are more likely to be transferred, I mean could there be bacteria, cells, or other items in the feces that strengthens the virus or increases it is life span so when it becomes aerosolized, it can permeate more things or more opportunity to infect people?\n\nOr, is it possible that when the virus is excreted through certain fluids it comes out in a very weak form that allows those who come in contact to get a weak version of the illness, then have the antibodies to fight it off when they come in contact with the more virulent form later?

There is no vaccine to prevent us from contracting it, but there are drugs available to treat those who become infected.  \n\nBelow is a link to the 2020 announcement of the FDA approval for Ebanga to treat those infected with Zaire Ebolavirus. \n\n&gt;(\n&gt;\n&gt;MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP (\u201cRidgeback\u201d), a biotechnology company experienced in antiviral drug development, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) approved EbangaTM for the treatment of Ebola.

More on this topic may be found here, ( and as the last line of the Nature article states, \n\n&gt;*\"Understanding the triggers of Ebola emergence, the persistence of the virus in humans and the infection dynamics in its animal reservoirs is vital not only for the long-term care of survivors of this epidemic, but also for preventing the next one.\"*\n\nEbola Virus Disease will remain one of the many deadly infectious diseases we must be wary of for the foreseeable future.

These are only the reported confirmed/probable/suspected cases. In addition, the reported deaths exclude at least 3000 known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone**.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth. On the other hand, I reckon that unsafe burial ceremonies played a huge role in driving the exponential growth we saw in the earlier months, and the ceasing of such activities probably played a significant role in halting the exponential growth.\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely. Sierra Leone has ( a higher proportion of new cases coming from followed contacts, compared to Guinea, suggesting an increasing likelihood that Guinea will be the first and last country affected by the outbreak.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* Liberia reported what was *likely* the first confirmed case of Ebola transmitting sexually from an Ebola survivor.\n\n* Sierra Leone's occupancy rate is decreasing substantially and **suspected cases are making up almost all of the reported cases.** All of this suggests that daily reported figures may be overstating the prevalence of the disease by a lot.", "The Ebola Crisis in the West African Region: Should It Have Been So Severe?

I know it is not 21 days yet, but considering most symptoms show between 8 and 10 days, this is good news.\n* These individuals lived in a *2 bedroom apartment with someone who had Ebola.* The fact that they could avoid getting sick while being in such close conditions is a positive note.\n\nI know many were concerned about the Dallas hospital errors and the Spain hospital errors. The positive here is, these errors happened during isolated cases and will (hopefully) be great learning curves for healthcare worldwide.\n\nSo this brings me to talk about what I think will happen for the future.\n\n* If we reach the full 21 days and no family members end up sick, this is very positive news for first world countries. It will show that just like the CDC said, it is hard to transmit the virus to someone else. \n* Many will continue to die in West Africa for the foreseeable future.\n* We will continue to see isolated cases in the USA and around the world.\n* These isolated cases will eventually spark a much larger world wide response to West Africa.\n* It is not a scenario that will be fixed in a month, but it is a scenario that will be fixed eventually.\n\n\nEdit: I just want to clarify, I am not downplaying the current situation.

Obviously this raises questions about how the worker ended up getting infected.... my guess is that it was user error until the high pressure circumstances.

Haas Professor and Department head of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering at Drexel University, who was co-investigator of the study by Michigan University: Development of a Dynamic Cumulative Dose-Response Model - regarding pathogens, wrote a paper on the Quarantine periods for Ebola. It was posted on here about a month ago and got almost no exposure.\n\n\n(\n\nA few important things to note here:\n\n&gt;The current operative guidance on quarantine periods for Ebola (Zaire) virus is 21 days, based on WHO assessment that the incubation period is 2\u201321 days. A current review of previous outbreaks cites the same range . **The precise origin of this assessment is unclear, however it is possibly based on the study of the either the** ***1976 Zaire outbreak11 or 2000 Uganda outbreak*** **both of which reported (without detailed analysis) a maximum observed incubation time of 21 days.**\n\nOur 21 day guide line is either based off of an outbreak from 1976 or 2000, not the current outbreak. The current outbreak has show recorded confirmed and probable EVD case out past 30 days. ( Mapping of confirmed and probable cases from the New England Journal of Medince ( Those gray bars show cases with incubtaion being recorded well past 30 days and even a few just shy of 40.\n\n( plots the complementary cumulative distributions from the studies noted above.\n\n&gt;At a 21 day quarantine period, using the data sets other than the Congo analysis of Chowell, three Congo data analyses, the probability of exceedance is between 1.9 and 12%. In other words ***from 0.1 to 12% of the time, an individual case will have a greater incubation time than 21 days.*** The 0.1% stems from the 1976 Zaire outbreak, which has the fewest cases analyzed than any of the others in Figure 2.\n\n&gt; If the estimated incubation time distributions for the Congo outbreak (Figure 2) are used, **this would suggest a quarantine time of as high as 31 days.**\n\n\n(\n\n&gt;**Haas, who has extensive background in analyzing risk of transmitting biological pathogens**, explains that these quarantine periods must be determined by looking at the cost of enforcing the quarantine versus the cost of releasing exposed individuals. Looking at the potential tradeoff between costs and benefits as the quarantine time is extended should guide public health officials in determining the appropriate time. Obviously, with more contagious and potentially deadly diseases the cost of making a mistake on the short side when determining a quarantine is extremely high.\n\n(\n\n&gt;Haas looked at incubation times for the virus in previous outbreaks in Congo, Zaire and Uganda. **He found that \u201c12% of the time, an individual case will have a greater incubation time than 21 days\u201d \u2014 and said some models indicated a 31-day quarantine might be in order.** Indeed, data examined in the New England Journal of Medicine shows incubation times even longer than that.\n\n\n###Edit: (\n\nMore relevant quotes on the topic:\n\n&gt;Also unknown is whether the time between exposure to Ebola and the appearance of symptoms depends on which bodily fluids someone contacted. If it does, then someone exposed through, say, saliva rather than blood might incubate the virus for longer than the **21 days officials have repeatedly said is the outer limit of the incubation period.**\n\n&gt;**That was the longest incubation time during the 1976 Ebola outbreak, said Dr. C.J. Peters, a field virologist at UTMB. But \"I would guess that 5 percent of people\" can transmit the virus after incubating it for more than three weeks, said Peters**, whose battle against the Ebola outbreak in a monkey colony in Virginia was recounted in Richard Preston's 1994 book \"The Hot Zone.\"", "Mods pruning posts in this subreddit.

Everyone is so very concerned about banning flights from WA, maybe rightly so. But regardless of what is done to restrict travel ebola will be a constant and eternal threat to the entire world if it is not stopped at the source. We could ban flights from WA, but what happens when ebola inevitably gets to India? And it will if ebola is allowed to spread over the entire African continent, flights or no flights. Travel restrictions there would crash the global economy in a heartbeat, and it likely still would not contain the spread. If having free travel between the US/WA at the current time is helping in any way to fight the source outbreak it is to the entire world's benefit to keep it that way until the situation is absolutely 100% hopeless.\n\nSmaller countries that are not very involved in providing support should by all means cut off travel, there is no reason for them not to. But we who are in nations developed enough to provide income/people/resources need to suck it up and deal with the minor current threat in order that we might have a better chance of eliminating it before ebola makes it is way into any other nations without the infrastructure to stand a chance in the fight.

How are we keeping them safe? Hi all, I have never posted to Reddit before so forgive me if I make any mistakes. I have been following the Ebola epidemic closely all summer. I am not a healthcare worker, but I was at one point a biology student who volunteered in an enormous, nationally known county hospital in a major US city. Remember the TV show ER? Yeah, basically like that. Two summers ago, I participated in a research study there involving patient support over several months. I spent most of my time holding patient's hands during gynecological procedures. All of my patients were uninsured and deeply poor. There was also quite a bit of down time at the beginning of my volunteer shifts, so I was able to gain a relatively solid understanding of how the county health system works, at least in a large Midwestern city. \n\nI have some serious concerns about Ebola readiness here in the US, and I am wondering if anyone can shed light on some of the things I have been thinking about. \n\nHow is the the information about Ebola and the necessary protocol for dealing with it getting passed along to every level of hospital staff? Specifically, I am wondering about the people who ARE NOT MDs or RNs/LPNs, and how much they are being trained in these ~protocol~. It is my understanding that the \"nurse\" who caught Ebola virus in Spain was not actually a registered nurse, but the equivalent of what would be a CNA or medical assistant here--as in, 1-2 years of schooling followed by some sort of certificate. She was a nurse's aide. That is an incredibly important distinction, and one that alarms me. I cannot imagine that your run-of-the-mill CNA or medical assistant would have any idea what to do to protect themselves, yet in a county hospital where the doctors are outnumbered and overworked, they are often the people with the most direct patient contact. \n\nCleaning up vomit, changing bedpans and drawing blood do not generally fall to the MD or the RN on duty. In the unit where I volunteered, a typical day usually saw 1-2 physicians only come in for 45 minutes - 1 1/2 hours for the procedures, while a host of nurses, medical assistants, surgical assistants, CNAs and other supportive workers pretty much ran the show from 7am-~5:30pm. Many of them had full-time hours in other units of the hospital and were picking up these shifts for overtime pay. They were very tired and overworked (but dedicated). The hospital hired most of its non-MD employees via an outside agency. Occasionally we had medical students or nursing students in the procedure room as well. \n\nEven as a volunteer I helped to change garbage and assist with procedure room prep. I have NO medical training other than a CPR certification. I was regularly in close contact with sweat, tears, urine, vomit and blood. Blood was mopped in circles around the floor by a janitor every day that I was there. I was never sprayed with anything, but there was a very real chance of it. Obviously it was not a difficult task for me to throw a sheet over a table or help someone to a trash can to puke, and I do not think the hospital was in the wrong for allowing that. My point is simply that there are many, many people of various levels of education involved in efficiently running a large hospital. A large percentage of those people have not had any training in microbiology or infectious disease. Briefing the hospital administrators and doctors is one thing, but making sure every level of healthcare worker knows *exactly* what to do to protect against infection is quite another. In the final stages of Ebola virus infection (please correct me if I am wrong here), the viral load in every body fluid including saliva and sweat is incredibly high. Yet the CDC keeps emphasizing the necessity of \"direct contact.\" Well, to someone with only a few biology and anatomy courses under their belt, \"direct contact\" could mean a lot of things, and I am worried that explanation is woefully incomplete. I worry about the janitors cleaning up, the patient registrars, the people doing laundry, the diet techs receiving/sending food trays, the social workers. Many of the EDs here are staffed with EMT-Bs and CNAs; an EMT-B certification, at least in my state, requires only one semester of courses before sitting for the examination. \n\nSo, with that in mind, does anyone know if the CDC has set any guidelines for this? Are they briefing the janitors, the dialysis techs, the nursing assistants etc in this supposed protocol? How is the information and the training being passed along the hospital food chain (if at all), and if it is not, what are we going to do about it? I strongly suspect that it simply *is not* being passed along effectively, but please tell me I am wrong. After the debacle in Dallas (releasing an adult who just traveled from Liberia with 103+ fever!), I cannot say the US healthcare system has my vote of confidence. Is there anyone out there working in a hospital/healthcare setting who can offer their experience in this? I am especially curious to hear from non-MD and non-RN hospital employees, and what you have been told about Ebola virus. Thank you in advance.

In 2014, peacekeepers from France and Georgia were implicated in incidents of sexual violence against young children in the Central African Republic. In 2016, following investigations, the UN reported 41 cases of abuse involving peacekeepers from Burundi and Gabon, including eight paternity cases and six filed on behalf of minors.                                                                                                                         \n * This violence does not happen only when national forces are deployed as UN peacekeepers.

Sure, some people will find a way to travel, but the number would be greatly reduced. Additionally, we could theoretically make leaving possible so long as they consent to a voluntary, monitored 21 day quarantine prior to leaving and/or an additional quarantine once they have arrived at their destination. 21-42 days to leave a country sucks, but is better than risking increasing the spread of ebola. The additional is dependent upon how quarantine is handled. If it is solitary, 21 days is fine. If it is a ward, then if one patient shows symptoms, the 21 days start anew.\n\nMy biggest concerns with this is that it is likely to lead to some form of panic in the affected countries which self-quarantine.

The 46-year-old pastor traveled from Bukavu to Butembo via Goma on Thursday, July 4 for an evangelistic mission. During his stay in Butembo, the pastor preached in seven churches where he regularly laid hands on Christians, including the sick. His first symptoms appeared on 9 July when he was still in Butembo. He was treated at home by a nurse until he left by bus for Goma on Friday, 12 July.\n\nOn the route between Butembo and Goma, the bus passed through 3 health checkpoints, namely Kanyabayonga, Kiwanja and OPRP. During the checks, he did not seem to show signs of the disease. In addition, at each checkpoint, he has written different names and surnames on the lists of travelers, probably indicating his desire to hide his identity and state of health.\n\nAs soon as he arrived in Goma on Sunday morning, he went to a health center because he did not feel well and started having a fever. No other patients were in the health center, reducing the risk of nosocomial infections of others. Nurses and doctors at the health center who recognized the symptoms of Ebola immediately alerted the response teams in Goma who transferred him to the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC). Around 15:00, the result of the lab test confirmed that he was Ebola positive. If his state of health permits, the patient will be transferred by ambulance to the CTE of Butembo to continue his care as of Monday, as provided by the procedure of the contingency plan.\n\nIt is important for people to stay calm. Due to the speed with which the patient has been identified and isolated, as well as the identification of all bus passengers from Butembo, the risk of spreading to the rest of the city of Goma remains low. Caution is still required. In order to avoid the contamination of additional people in Goma, it is urgent to break the chain of transmission by carrying out the following actions:\n\n1. Decontaminate the health center in which the patient has passed;**\n\n1. Identify and vaccinate all contacts of the patient without exception;\n\n1. Track and limit contact movement for 21 days. \n\nSince November 2018, the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) have put in place an Ebola response planning and preparation system in the city of Goma due to the large influx of travelers from affected by the epidemic. Rapid detection of the patient by medical teams at the Goma Health Center proves the effectiveness of the city's preparedness activities in dealing with the importation of potential Ebola patients. As part of this preparation, more than 3,000 health workers in Goma have been vaccinated and trained in the detection and management of Ebola patients.\n\nIn addition, the transport company has shown great professionalism in having a passenger register and making this register available to response teams to identify all passengers on the bus. The bus driver and the 18 other passengers have been identified and their vaccination will begin on Monday, July 15, 2019.\n\nThe collaboration of the entire population is necessary to prevent the spread of the epidemic in Goma. Beyond the medical arsenal, the Ministry of Health recalls that the response against Ebola is above all community.\n\nAs a reminder, the ***recommendations of the Ministry of Health*** are as follows:\n\n1. Follow basic hygiene practices, including regular hand washing with soap and water or ashes;\n1. If an acquaintance from an epidemic area comes to visit you and is ill, do not touch her and call the North Kivu civil protection hotline directly;\n1. If you are identified as an Ebola patient contact, agree to be vaccinated and followed for 21 days;\n1. If a person dies because of Ebola, follow the rules for safe and dignified burials. It is simply a funeral method that respects funerary customs and traditions while protecting the family and community from Ebola contamination.\n1. For all health professionals, observe the hygiene measures in the health centers and declare any patient with symptoms of Ebola (fever, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, bleeding). \n\nIf all citizens comply with the health measures recommended by the Ministry of Health, it is possible to ensure that this case of Ebola detected in Goma is a sporadic case that does not cause a new outbreak.\n\n## **Security Situation**\n\n*Two response providers murdered at their home in Beni*\n\n* Two agents of the Ebola response in Beni, including a Community Relay (RECO) and a street leader, were murdered, each at their home on the night of 13-14 July 2019 in the Mukulia health area. the border to Butembo. Both agents were part of the local response team.\n\n* These two providers had been threatened since December 2018. The RECO, a woman from the neighborhood, had already been attacked a few times a few weeks ago but she was saved because she had given money to the attackers.\n\n* According to several sources, the attackers are people from the same neighborhood as the two victims who envied their neighbors because they had found a job in the response to Ebola. \n\n## **FIGURES OF THE RESPONSE**\n\n**161,400 Vaccinated persons**\n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n\n**74,703,211 Controlled people**\n\n* 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (PoC). \n\n**136 Contaminated health workers**\n\n* Two health workers, including one vaccinated, are among the new confirmed cases (1 in Mabalako and 1 in Beni).\n\n* The cumulative number of confirmed / probable cases among health workers is 136 (5% of all confirmed / probable cases), including 41 deaths.

This morning, the positive case, quickly identified and isolated, was repatriated to Butembo. Vaccination has been launched for all contacts. Since the beginning of this epidemic, we prepared with the WHO for the possibility of positive cases in Goma. The situation is therefore under control and is being managed, as we did a few weeks with the positive case reported in Uganda. By the way, as a reminder, Goma is not the first provincial capital to report a positive case. This was the case in Bunia there a few weeks and in Mbandaka during the ninth epidemic of Ebola Virus Disease\noccurring in the province of Ecuador from May 7 to July 24, 2018.\n\nThe risk factors of the current epidemic remain:\n\n- The density of the population;\n- the high mobility of the population;\n- The geographical area concerned covering 23 health zones spread over 2 provinces;\n- Part of the response is deployed in areas of military operation where armed groups and community militias;\n- The instrumentalisation of the epidemic by certain political actors during the period election.\n\n**The tenth Ebola outbreak is not a humanitarian crisis. It is a health crisis public service, which intervenes in an environment characterized by development and shortcomings of the health system .**\n\nThis crisis requires a technical public health response to break the chain of transmission of the virus by relying on the actors of the health system and its partners traditional.\n\nSeveral pillars are thus implemented to break the chain of transmission, whose vaccination. The Ministry of Health has invited the last 28 and 29 June in Kinshasa, the producers of the four most advanced vaccines to fight Ebola, as well as the experts national and international levels for a meeting of scientific exchanges on vaccination in\npart of the ongoing epidemic. It emerged from these exchanges that the vaccine produced by the Merck, currently used in this outbreak, is the only one that has demonstrated its efficacy for reactive vaccination in the case of the current response. The good news is that there are enough doses available of this vaccine. To avoid confusion and\namalgams in the difficult context of this epidemic, the Ministry of Health decided that no other vaccine trial would be implemented in the DRC until the tenth epidemic will be in progress.\n\nTo date, thanks to the commitment of all, sufficient funds have been mobilized for previous response plans. On behalf of the Congolese Government, I express my gratitude to all donors.\n\nIn developing the third strategic response plan (SRP3), covering the period of from February to July 2019, a special effort was made to put in place information for monitoring activities and expenditures to increase accountability\noperational than the financial accountability of all actors.\n\nThe process of developing the fourth strategic response plan (SRP4), which will cover the period from July to December 2019, ended this Friday, July 12, 2019 in Goma. The process was participatory and inclusive, and took into account lessons learned on an ongoing basis. The methodology for budgeting - bottom up - is part of the unit costs and the volume of the different activities to be implemented in each zone of health; these were then aggregated by sub-coordination.\n\nThe Government is grateful for the contribution of our various partners as well as donors. However, this support must be in the respect of the Government, and in partnership with institutions and not in parallel. Only the anchoring of the riposte in the health system and the strengthening of the actors of the Ministry of Health will\nto ensure the sustainability of all achievements of the response. All sectoral support plans for the response must be developed in the same spirit, in consultation with the ministries sector.\n\nPublic health actors want to make SRP4 a \" final push\" . To get there, we demand from all actors of discipline and accountability. In each pillar, in each sub-coordination, the Ministry of Health and the co-leaders accredit implementation agencies on the basis of five criteria to ensure accountability:\n\n- Have a demonstrated operational capacity with regard to the number and the expertise of human resources (not agencies in \" learning curve\" , recruiting on Linkedin for North Kivu);\n- Rationalize geographical deployment and ensure an effective presence on the field (not just attending meetings);\n- Commit to implementing the activities according to the validated protocols for the response; \n- Make a commitment to transmit the data to the General Coordination of the response, in respecting the reporting tools that allow the monitoring of the indicators of performance and produce dashboards;\n- Commit to adopting the scales and the Manual of Procedures for the Management of human resources developed by the Ministry of Health and the World Bank, which\n\nI would like to thank especially for his unfailing support for the Government since the beginning of this epidemic.\n\nOnly discipline and accountability will allow us to put an end to this epidemic, which has that too long.\n\nNow is the time to think about the post-Ebola era and start developing with others sectors, ambitious development plans that alone will be able to resolve fundamental problems of the population.\n\nThank you.\n\nDr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga ### EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF THE EBOLA EPIDEMIC IN THE PROVINCES OF NORTH KIVU AND ITURI\n\n**Tuesday, July 16, 2019**\n\nThe epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated July 15, 2019 :\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 2,512, 2,418 confirmed and 94 probable.

The ministry hopes that this decision is not the result of the many pressures from different stakeholder groups who wanted to use this statement as an opportunity to raise funds for humanitarian actors despite the potentially harmful and unforeseen consequences for the affected communities that depend on them. greatly from cross-border trade for their survival. \n\n* While the Government continues to openly share with partners and donors how it uses the funds received, we hope that there will be greater transparency and accountability of humanitarian actors in their use of funds to respond. to this Ebola outbreak. \n\n* The Ebola epidemic is above all a public health crisis that requires a response by actors with real technical expertise. However, the main difficulty is that this epidemic occurs in an environment characterized by problems of development and shortcomings of the health system. \n\n* Furthermore, we regret that after spending almost a year in this epidemic, certain groups of people in the community continue to adopt irresponsible behavior that causes the geographical spread of the virus. It is important to remember that in the cases of Goma and Uganda, the patients knew that they were at risk but refused to respect the health recommendations and deliberately traveled to another area. The Government will consider what steps need to be taken to prevent these high-risk groups from continuing to spread the epidemic in the region. \n\n*Follow-up of the situation of the pastor's contacts who traveled to Goma*\n\n* Vaccination around the confirmed Goma case continues at the Afia Himbi Health Center in the Goma Health Zone. All contacts in the city were found in less than 72 hours, including the motorcycle taxi driver that the pastor had used to get to the health center.

The patient is a Beni shopkeeper who went to the Mpondwe market in Kasese on Thursday, July 11 before returning to Beni on Friday, July 12. She was a regular at the Kasese market where she bought her goods, including fish.\n\n* To enter Uganda, she did not go through a formal entry point where there was a health check, which did not allow health teams to detect her. However, after her admission to the CTE of Beni, she informed the medical teams of her trip to Kasese and the teams then alerted the Ugandan authorities. During her visit to the market, she would have vomited four times, increasing the risk of contamination of people who had been in direct contact with her. For example, the Ugandan Ministry of Health and WHO launched the investigation in Kasese to identify all contacts and vaccinate them. \n\n*Point of entry surveillance*\n\n* From now on, the Port of Entry Monitoring Team will operate 24 hours a day at Goma International Airport.

Its Dangerously misleading and not supported by evidence Ebola is spreading in the US (to a few healthcare workers now) even though it should be contained.  One possibility is that personal protection gear is insufficient (doubtful).  A second possibility is that the healthcare facilities are not adequately controlling for transmission routes that are airborne via \"aerosolized microdroplets\"(AM) or \"airbone dessicated body fluid\" (ABDF) -which are basically dust particles.  \n\nI am pretty sick of hearing on the radio/tv, and now from people talking to me that \"ebola only spreads through bodily fluids\". Part of the reason I am sick of this is that it only took me a few minutes to find in scientific literature that Ebola can spread through saliva which means there is almost guaranteed certainty that it could spread through cough/sneeze in tight spaces. No study has been done that disproves a sneeze/cough transmisison route in a local area (such as room with a patient).\n\nI am not necessarily saying the policy on Ebola transmission is wrong but if healthcare workers are getting sick then we need to think about challenging what we know about Ebola transmission.   The continuous attitude of authorities and media is to first a) say that we know how ebola spreads (stressing not through air), and then b) saying they do not know how its spreading.  Whenever you rule out a hypothesis without evidence before you even start to try to solve the problem you are setting yourself up for failure.   It is also sending our citizens the wrong message: authorities' pride prevents them from admitting they do not know everything about ebola transmission so they just state 'policy'\n\nSo next time someone talks about how ebola \"only\" spreads through bodily fluids think of a sneeze like this one:\n\n\nThat fluid is EVERYWHERE and its in the AIR.  The primary component is SALIVA and according to the paper posted at the next URL~ 66% of saliva samples from patients with Ebola CONTAIN the virus and in these experiments ~ 10% of cell cultures exposed to saliva were infected.\n\n\nOf interest: Last and not least, this blog by Mark Ellis also draws a link between monkeys that were spreading Ebola in a lab potentially spreading by some airborne route.  He also writes about how evidence does not support ONLY focusing non-air bodily fluids and has some ideas you should read.\n\n\nThe CDC guidelines for health care professionals includes wearing a face mask, but how much and what type of filtering is going on is not clear to me.  I do not even know what they are wearing over in Dallas.\n\n\nThe long story short is that Ebola is highly virulent.  Touching a person can expose you the virions, possibly cough particles in air can expose you, dried blood droplets still contain the virus for days (what about dried, airborne particles?), what about dried saliva that is aerosolized?  Basically in several cases we just do not know.  \n\n", "WHO | Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo: Points of Entry | 05JUN18  I would love to see some on the ground interviews regarding this... it is one thing to see this in black and white and feel good about the progress various organizations are making but how is it affecting the locals and the economy? Freedom of movement is so important and having the Whites or the Elites lining people up at PoEs to test for fever could seem terrifying and make people avoid main ports. We learned in the last outbreak how terrifying someone in a mask or PPE can appear, making people pick up and hide to avoid their visits.\n\nAll speculation and of course totally different setting and even races of people, but all this well planned screening only works if people cooperate. IIRC people avoiding checkpoints and traveling to other villages to stay with family, or people hiding family members, was responsible for much contact with Ebola sufferers. &gt; *\"...test for fever...\"*\n\nThis has become a common practice during Avian Flu out breaks.  Port of entry screeners wearing N-95 face masks using hand held temperature scanners identifying people with above normal temperatures.  Possibly replaced by now by infrared cameras and algorithm.\n\n&gt; *\"...how terrifying...\"*\n\nChanneling to induce an emotional response?  Once the Ebola Treatment Units were up and running in west Africa, they became accepted as being places where lives were saved. Those thinking they would become infected traveled to them.  This does not discount thoughts of residents being concerned to the point of alarm when HCWs appear in their neighborhoods wearing PPEs but...  As is normal with the human psyche. Once terrified by a thing when first seen, once understood, it becomes a matter of far less concern when seen again.  Expect images of what occurred in west Africa to have been seen by a good number of people in DRC.  \n\nSpeculation is the playground of news organizations trying to sell advertising and those attempting to infuse emotion where logic is present. \n\nSpeculation serves no worthy purpose and why it is addressed as the closing element of r/Ebola's guidelines. \n\n *\"In reading the history of nations, we find that, like individuals, they have their whims and their peculiarities; their seasons of excitement and recklessness, when they care not what they do. We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first.\"* Charles MacKay \n\n*\"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\"* Charles MacKay \n____\n\nFor any who might be interested in reading/listening about popular delusions through history, Charles MacKay (1814-1889) published two volumes on the topic: \n\n* (\n* (\n\nThe above links are to Librivox.org where (free of charge, cost or obligation) audio book (MP3) chapter recordings may be listened to and/or downloaded.

Again with the disclaimer IIRC there were plenty of stories about the stigma surrounding aid organizations and many accounts of hiding sick relatives from them. I also acknowledged that this is a totally different group of people, but without talking to them I do not know what their general views are or what cultural practices could affect perception and actions taken (remember the difficulty of changing burial practice, that did not happen overnight with no effort).\n\nHow can we get ahead of the game without speculation? I am not trying to spread fear. The posted article is very clinical and says nothing about the intricacies of an outbreak in Liberia versus DRC. Fear misguided plenty of people in the 2014 outbreak and it would be silly to disregard the potential for that happening here as well as the consequences that come with it. Monitoring points of entry and exit exams do not address this. &gt;Once the Ebola Treatment Units were up and running in west Africa, they became accepted as being places where lives were saved. Those thinking they would become infected traveled to them\n\nThis is really an exceptionally optimistic take on things.  There was violent resistance and absconding from both quarantine and ETUs  for the entire length of the response in West Africa.  Did you work in the outbreak?\n\nI think jackal_kid makes a very important point. Many stories on this theme during the outbreak.  Choosing shamanic healing practices over clinic/hospital and unfamiliar doctor is a decision between following ancestral practices and the unknown.  One of the mixed stories long before the 2014-16 outbreak was of a much loved nurse working in an African hospital. She had contracted ebola while treating a patient.  As her condition worsened the African Doctors wanted to transfuse her with the blood of a patient who had recently survived ebola and was fully recovered. The European Doctors present vehemently opposed the idea as it did not follow acceptable modern medical practices.  After the European doctors had retired for the night, the African doctors performed the procedure. Hours later the nurses condition became better and days later she was in a weakened state but cured.\n\nThis is essentially the same procedure used (at Emory University) to treat repatriated health care workers Brantly and Writebol,  but not included in who is ( autodownload .PDF, *(   \n\n____\n\nPrioritizing 30 of the 115 PoE's addresses what they are able to mange. \n\n&gt; \"As of 18 May 2018, a total of 115 points of entry/traveller congregation points have been listed and mapped along cordon sanitaires in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, larger Equateur Province, and Kinshasa. Of these, some 30 points of entry have been prioritized for in-depth assessments and for implementing relevant prevention, detection and control measures. These include major ports and congregation points along the Congo river, as well as the two airports and the international port in Kinshasa. Areas of large gatherings such as markets are also being assessed. Along the Congo river there are many private smaller ports and points of congregation with a low volume of traffic. Proper screening cannot be conducted at all 115 points, and the efforts currently focus on the 30 prioritized points of entries/ traveller congregation points, as well as on risk communications activities and community engagement\". \n\n^(Source: \n\nGetting ahead of the game is making logical interpretation of information presented.  Determining between fact and fiction.  \n\n\n\n\n\n It is not optimism, it is history.  West Africans who thought they would become infected with EVD traveled to the treatment units of their own volition, because the ETU's were saving lives, Shamanistic medicine was not.  This gave good reason for those infected to under go treatment.  But it did not happen immediately.  Proof needs time to take root.  \n\nMore Ebola outbreaks have occurred n DRC than anywhere else.  They have first hand knowledge of the nature of this disease.  Considering differences in the size of effected counties and the populations.  Circumstances are similar but not anywhere close to being the the same.  That does not give me any info on what challenges they might expect this year in the DRC though unless many of the beliefs and practices are consistent between the two regions? There are a number of unanswered questions present.  As to the beliefs and practices, have you thought about looking for information sources?  \n\nShamanic healing is common in Africa.  As is reliance on tribe and family.  This is why, when becoming ill, the desire is to return to where their families are for help. \n\nAccessing the manner in which colonial and post-colonial administrations are viewed helps redefine concepts may considered as variables.  Colonial holdings gaining 'independence' after WWII have been rife with political upheaval.  Instability does little to affirm benefits of foreign involvement.    \n\n I have, there is not much relating it to the current outbreak, then you crapped on me pretty hard for bringing it up in the first place. :P I do not have the expertise to make the connections myself. All I know is once you are out of Kinshasa it is a different world, the Congolese definitely did not decide the border themselves so there is tons of different tribes and cultures there.\n\nI will start with trying to get info on the racial makeup of the provinces and cities mentioned and if I find anyone making commentary on social issues I will post in the sub for discussion.  ... Of course this would happen in one of the notorious \"No Data Available\" regions though so no promises. I am lazy and like to be fed my info by people smarter than me.

Despite this course, developments in recent weeks are positive although vigilance remains in place. Among the positive developments, we count:\n\n * **Slight improvement in the security situation :** The last armed attack on the teams and operations of the Ebola response, which cost the life of Dr. Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, dates back more than a month. Although threats against the response remain high, the reduction in targeted attacks has allowed teams to catch up with the spread of the epidemic. However, the security situation remains volatile and unpredictable. With respect to incidents of reluctance or community resistance, the majority of these incidents are resolved through the involvement of community leaders, sensitizers and psychosocial experts.\n\n * **Geographical Confinement of the Epidemic :** Despite the difficulties of the response teams in doing their job because of the security situation, the epidemic continues to be geographically contained, thus protecting the rest of the country and neighboring countries. To date, no cases of Ebola have crossed the borders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the epidemic has not spread to the most risky major urban centers, namely Goma, Bunia and Kisangani. However, the risk remains high given the significant movement of the population. In addition, since the beginning of the epidemic, 188 health areas in 22 health zones across the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri have recorded at least one case of Ebola. As of 2 June 2019, nine health zones, including 106 health areas (56% of the total), have spent more than 21 days without reporting new confirmed cases. The nine health zones concerned are Kyondo, Oicha, Kayna, Mutwanga, Komanda, Bunia, Rwampara, Nyankunde and Tchomia. \n\n* The main challenges to be met to end this epidemic are:\n\n * **Epidemiological surveillance :** In order to break the chain of transmission, all contacts of confirmed cases must be listed and followed for 21 days. Of the 911 new confirmed cases registered between January 1 and May 7, 2019, only 398 (44%) were registered as follow-up contacts. Thus, listing and follow-up of contacts needs to be strengthened by involving more the authorities and community leaders.\n\n * **Infection Prevention and Control (ICP) :** Infection prevention and control measures need to be strengthened in community health facilities to reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. Between 25 and 30% of infections occur in health facilities.\n\n * **Community deaths :** The community death rate remains high. Between 28 and 43% of deaths reported each week occur outside of an Ebola treatment center or transit center. These deaths occur either in private hospitals and clinics, in community health centers or at home. However, the contagiosity of a patient being maximum after his death, dignified and secure burials can limit the community spread of the virus. What is positive is that the majority of community deaths have a dignified and secure burial. \n\n* A comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the ongoing Ebola outbreak is available in a scientific article written by Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, Dr. Tedros A. Ghebreyesus and Dr. Matshidiso Moeti. \n\n## **Security Situation** \n\n* Nothing to report\n\n## **FIGURES OF THE RESPONSE**\n\n### Vaccination\n\n**129,596 Vaccinated persons**\n\n* 595 people vaccinated on 02/06/2019.\n\n* Of those vaccinated, 35,768 are high-risk contacts (CHR), 63,852 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 29,976 are front-line providers (PPL).\n\n* Persons vaccinated by health zone: 33,316 in Katwa, 25,663 in Beni, 17,257 in Butembo, 11,066 in Mabalako, 6,290 in Mandima, 4,573 in Kalunguta, 3,209 in Goma, 3,048 in Komanda, 2,640 in Musienene, 2,569 in Oicha, 2,241 in Masereka , 2,045 to Vuhovi, 1,998 to Lubero, 1,980 to Kayna, 1,837 to Kyondo, 1,487 to Bunia, 1,040 to Biena, 1,012 to Mutwanga, 690 to Rutshuru, 557 to Rwampara (Ituri), 527 to Nyankunde, 496 to Mangurujipa, 494 to Alimbongo, 420 to Mambasa, 355 to Tchomia, 342 to Kirotshe, 333 to Lolwa, 250 to Mweso, 245 to Kibirizi, 161 to Nyiragongo, 97 to Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 to Kisangani.\n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n\n### Sanitary Control Points \n\n* **62,968,354 Controlled people**\n\n* 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (PoC). \n\n### Contaminated Health Workers\n\n* **109 Contaminated health workers**\n\n* The cumulative number of confirmed / probable cases among health workers is 109 (5.4% of all confirmed / probable cases), including 37 deaths. **Tuesday, June 4, 2019**\n\n**The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated June 3, 2019 :**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 2,020, 1,926 confirmed and 94 probable.

His dignified and safe burial will be on Thursday, June 13, 2019 in Kasese, the district where he resided with his parents. .\n\n* Laboratory tests have confirmed that of the six family members who have crossed the border, two others are also infected with Ebola. This is the 50 year old grandmother and the 3 year old brother of the deceased boy. Of the six family members left in Kasindi and transferred to the Beni Ebola Treatment Center, five were tested positive. Around this family, about 50 contacts were listed in Kasese on the Ugandan side and 80 contacts in Kasindi on the Congolese side. Kasindi's vaccination ring was opened on Wednesday.\n\n* On Wednesday, June 12, 2019, the Congolese and Ugandan health authorities also held a meeting in Kasese, about 140 kilometers from Beni, to discuss mechanisms for cross-border collaboration. The Ugandan Minister of Health, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, led the Ugandan delegation while the Congolese side was led by Dr. Gaston Tshapenda, coordinator of Beni.\n\n* The main decisions taken are:\n * Strengthen surveillance at ports of entry, especially secondary roads;\n * Maintain continuous information sharing in real time between the two countries;\n * Start vaccinating the contacts as soon as possible. The DRC has already donated 400 doses of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine to Uganda. The DRC is willing to send vaccination teams to Uganda to vaccinate all contacts more quickly if needed;\n * Repatriate all family members in the DRC after obtaining their informed consent. Since the father of the deceased child was Ugandan, the family was free to choose the place of hospitalization. Living family members have all agreed to return to the DRC for further medical treatment and 21-day follow-up. The advantage of continuing medical treatment in the DRC is the possibility of benefiting from new therapeutic molecules that are not yet available in Uganda;\n * Finalize the Memorandum of Understanding between Uganda and the DRC that will define the procedures for in-depth health collaboration between the two countries. \n\n## **Security Situation** \n\n* Nothing to report\n\n## **FIGURES OF THE RESPONSE**\n\n### Vaccination\n\n* **132,679 Vaccinated persons**\n\n* 415 people vaccinated on 11/06/2019.\n\n* Of those vaccinated, 36,595 are high-risk contacts (CHRs), 65,944 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 30,140 are front-line providers (PPLs).\n* Persons vaccinated by health zone: 33,990 in Katwa, 25,890 in Beni, 18,234 in Butembo, 11,387 in Mabalako, 6,443 in Mandima, 4,619 in Kalunguta, 3,329 in Goma, 3,048 in Komanda, 2,835 in Musienene, 2,569 in Oicha, 2,351 in Masereka , 2,045 to Vuhovi, 1,998 to Lubero, 1,980 to Kayna, 1,888 to Kyondo, 1,487 to Bunia, 1,040 to Biena, 1,012 to Mutwanga, 690 to Rutshuru, 666 to Rwampara (Ituri), 596 to Mangurujipa, 527 to Nyankunde, 494 to Alimbongo, 420 to Mambasa, 355 to Tchomia, 342 to Kirotshe, 333 to Lolwa, 250 to Mweso, 245 to Kibirizi, 161 to Nyiragongo, 97 to Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 to Kisangani.\n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n\n### Sanitary Control Points\n\n* **65,448,742 Controlled people**\n\n* 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (PoC). \n\n### Contaminated Health Workers\n\n* **115 Contaminated health workers**\n\n* Two Mabalako health workers, unvaccinated, are among the new confirmed cases.

However, the response is beginning to face challenges related to community acceptance and security in areas such as Mabalako where the epidemic has resumed recently. On the other hand, the response continues to be limited by the lack of adequate funding and limited human resources.\n\n* The Committee commended the communication and collaboration between the DRC and Uganda that rapidly contained Ebola cases that crossed the border.

Antibodies to the virus were found in 15.3% of rural communities, whereas these people had never had haemorrhagic fever or other specific symptoms of the disease (such as severe diarrhoea or vomiting). IRD researchers and their partners recently discovered this large number of healthy carriers among Gabonese people, even in areas where there has never been an Ebola outbreak. The scientists consider that these people have somehow come into contact with the virus, probably present in fruit contaminated by saliva from Chiroptera (fruit bats).\"\n\n&gt;(\n\n&gt;&gt; \"A recent study conducted in rural Gabon has concluded that there may be some natural immunity people have acquired to combat Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) in areas where the disease is especially prevalent. The researchers tested 4,349 people from 220 randomly selected villages in Gabon using the ELISA method. Out of the people tested, 15.3 % tested positive for ZEBOV. This figure increased to almost 20% in especially forested areas. Individuals were tested using the Western blot which determined whether an individual had anti-ZEBOV IgG. IgG is an immunoglobin. Immunoglobins are proteins that make up antibodies. Also, researchers studied individuals\u2019 CD8 T cells and tested for an antibody response upon \u201cZEBOV stimulation.\u201d The results indicate that a significant portion of the population living in very rural areas of Gabon \u201chave both humoral and cellular immunity to ZEBOV.\u201d One theory as to why people in these rural areas exhibit higher levels of immunity suggests that many of the tropical fruits growing in rural Gabon have been contaminated by bat saliva. Fruit bats have been known to spread the disease so this theory is possible. While Ebola is not a serious problem in the United States, there are serious outbreaks that occur in Africa. In order to prevent future outbreaks or even eradicate the disease completely in Africa, is it possible to use these ZEBOV immune people\u2019s blood serum in the same way it was done with Lassa virus? In The Coming Plague, a missionary nurse, Ms. Pinneo, survived Lassa fever and anti- Lassa antibodies were present in her blood afterwards, though she suffered debilitating effects from the disease later on. Since, in the case of Ebola, there are only two strains Ebola-Zaire and Ebola-Sudan, I do not see why a vaccine could not be developed to prevent future outbreaks or at least \u201ca serum\u201d to help treat infected persons as was used to treat a researcher infected with Lassa fever in The Coming Plague. To be honest, this article was a little difficult for me to understand because of all the medical and biological jargon; however, the presence of Ebola immunity was news to me and I thought deserved attention.

The ongoing outbreak in West Africa is the largest Ebola virus outbreak ever recorded, with over 20,000 cases and over 8,000 deaths to date. Very little is known about the human cellular immune response to Ebola virus infection, and this lack of knowledge has hindered development of effective therapies and vaccines. In this study, we characterize the human immune response to Ebola virus infection in four patients. We define the kinetics of T- and B-cell activation, and determine which viral proteins are targets of the Ebola virus-specific T-cell response in humans.\n\n&gt;( in (\n&gt;&gt;Despite the high number of cases, the human immune response to Ebola virus has not been well studied, delaying the development of effective vaccines. The very limited availability of infrastructures, especially those equipped with the high containment level necessary for these studies, hinders progress in understanding the human immune response to the virus.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;However, a few days ago, a study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences *(referenced above)* described the immune responses of four EVD survivors who received care at a U.S. hospital. Rafi Ahmed, senior study author, said in a press release by Emory news center: *\u201cUntil now, detailed studies like this in acute Ebola virus disease were logistically challenging. Our work only became possible through a close collaboration with the CDC and use of its biosafety level 4 facilities.\u201d*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Results from the study (Human Ebola virus infection results in substantial immune activation) show that, in contrast to what previously believed, the four patients responded to the Ebola virus with immunoactivation. Combined results from several prior studies indicated, instead, that the virus may induce immunosuppression. Lead author Anita McElroy said in the press release: *\u201cOur findings counter the idea that Ebola virus infection is immunosuppressive, at least in the patients that we were able to study. They also demonstrate the value that supportive care may have in enabling the immune system to fight back against Ebola virus infection.\u201d*\n\n&gt;(\n\n&gt;&gt; *\"These are phenomenal women who have had a horrendous story to tell.

It appears that the recruitment of neutrophils via an activated endothelium has occurred, but the transmigration process is blocked by the anti-inflammatory effect of sGP .

Hello everyone my name is John, I am a nurse and a microbiology student and I am going to explain why us Americas should not be too concerned about Ebola in our country. \n\nNow first off I will explain something very simple, and that is that Ebola is not some sort of super contagious virus. To put this into perspective on your chances of getting it think about how often you get the flu, not that often right? Even without a vaccine you should not be getting the flu very often unless you never clean yourself. Now Ebola is less infectious than the flu because a lot more of the virus is needed in order to contract it than the flu. Not only that but the route of infection is different.\n\nEvery virus has a \"key\" and everyone of your cells has a \"lock\". The flu has the key to your upper respiratory cells. But your going to need a few thousand of those keys to get anything going. These keys only fit in the specific hole. So let us say I got a syringe and filled it with the flu and injected you with it somewhere other than you respiratory area. Will you get the flu? Probably not. But that does not mean the flu is hard to get now does it? No, because if someone sneezes in your mouth, it will go to your respiratory system therefore giving you a much higher chance of getting the flu. So what was the point in that little lesson? Well Ebola, which we already need more of to contract the illness, it is \"key\" fits into our capillaries. Hence why our capillary filled eyes and noses and rectum will bleed if we have Ebola. \"But that is a huge deal! We have capillaries everywhere!\" Is what the educated person would now be thinking. But do not fret. Because such a large amount of the virus is required, you will only be at a high risk of getting it by touching bodily fluids. The big three are feces, blood, and vomit. So let me ask you something, do you touch other people's blood and poop and vomit without protection? You better not, that is gross. Is this making sense to you all? So the odds are pretty low that you will get it. \"But why do those nurses have it then?\" Well I will tell you. \n\nThey did not wear PPE (personal protection equipment) correctly when caring for the patient, and i did read an article that they did not at all at one point. The hospital did not have their shit together which caused the nurses to not protect themselves appropriately. \"But why do so many people in Africa have it?\" Because they do not have health care like us. The family takes care of the ill and constantly come in direct contact with the blood, feces, and vomit. Here if our family begins vomiting and bleeding with bowel movements, most people take them right to the hospital. Breaking the chain of infection.\n\nSo calm down. Odds are highly in your favor. \n\nAny questions?\n\nEdit: with that said it is a big deal IF you get it. But as I have explained, it is highly unlikely that you will.

Either similar rate to 51/day or smaller for all earlier periods.\n\n**Notes:** \n\n* All affected countries are included in the totals for reported cases and deaths. These are only the reported confirmed/probable/suspected cases. In addition, the reported deaths exclude at least 3000 known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth. On the other hand, I reckon that unsafe burial ceremonies played a huge role in driving the exponential growth we saw in the earlier months, and maybe the ceasing of such activities played a significant role in halting the exponential growth.\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks, requiring at most 7 days to eclipse the largest outbreaks of the past. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* **Liberia's reported cumulative deaths appears to not only include confirmed cases, but also includes suspected and probable cases. In addition, it appears that the MoH does not bother testing deceased patients, or, at the very least, remove negative tested patients (dead or alive) from the database. I am starting to think that the outbreak in Liberia may in fact be a fraction of the reported size. The final datapoint that provides significant support for this relevation is the decreasing occupancy rate. With &lt;30 occupied beds throughout the country in ETUs, it simply cannot be the case that more than ~5 Ebola cases (tested and untested) are being admitted per day on average. Despite this, Liberia is reporting ~25 new cases per day on average, which is probably &gt;5x the maximum number of Ebola cases they are likely handling.**", "15 people have been tested for ebola in the Netherlands ", "Doctors Without Borders Quits a DRC Ebola Operation ", "By Ralph Ellis CNN Canada bans travelers from Ebola hot spots - Country will stop processing visa applications from foreign nationals who have visited West African nations ", "New details on the quarantine facility for Newark airport (EWR) ", "Cote d'Ivoire Starts Ebola Vaccination of Frontline Workers | 17AUG21 ", "Is there any hope?

Our text conversation was as follows:\n\nDad, \u201c2nd healthcare worker tests positive for Ebola...you know, the ones wearing hazmat suits.\u201d \nDad, \u201c77 additional hospital workers quarantined in Dallas...boyfriend of nurse infected showing symptoms.\u201d \nMe, \u201cThat is not cool.\u201d \nDad, \u201cNope\u2026\u201d Me, \u201cWish I could get out of Dallas for a while.\u201d \nDad, \u201cYep.\u201d \nDad, \u201cIf it starts spreading it will go everywhere.\u201d \nDad, \u201cWhat city did you fly from Monday evening?\u201d \nDad, \u201cThe nurse who has it was on a flight from Cleveland to Dallas Monday evening. Flight 1143.\u201d \n\nIcy dread seeps through my entire body. My hands start to shake. Me, \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d Is he screwing with me? How could he know the flight I was on Monday? \nDad, \u201cWhere did you fly from?\u201d\n\nI am now fully awake. Climbing out of bed, I shrug off any last vestiges of tiredness and call my dad. He answers immediately. \u201cYou were not on that flight were you?\u201d His voice is strained. \u201cDad, are you messing with me. This is not funny.\u201d \u201cI am not playing with you. I just read it in a CNN article.\u201d \u201cDamn. That was my flight.\u201d \u201c1143?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cShit. The CDC is saying that the nurse was asymptomatic while on the airplane, but she went to the hospital shortly after getting off. That is pretty close. I am sending you the article. You need to call the CDC.\u201d \u201cOkay. I am going to call my friend that was next to me on the plane. He is planning on driving to Houston today, but we need to make sure we are isolated.\u201d \u201cOkay. Call me back.\u201d\n\nEnding the call with my father, I dialed Taylor\u2019s number. I had just woken to one of the worst possible nightmare scenarios I could imagine.\nWe had both spent the last week in Ohio at a conference for our publishing company, Ellora\u2019s Cave. We are both romance novel cover models and authors. I just released my novel Primal Desire last week and Taylor has released several novels over the past three years.\nUpon arriving at the airport a week earlier we felt secure that there was a very low chance of contracting the Ebola virus. After all, everyone had been quarantined right?\n\nTaylor answered the phone. He is nearly always cheerful. \u201cYo what is up?!\u201d \u201cI have bad news.\u201d \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d \u201cA nurse that was taking care of Thomas Eric Duncan was on our flight from Cleveland to Ohio.\u201d \u201cNo way! Are you serious?\u201d \u201cYes. Flight 1143.\u201d \u201cHow could that happen?\u201d \u201cI do not know. I was under the impression that all 77 people that had been taking care of patient 0 had been quarantined.\u201d \u201cDamn. What the hell?\u201d \u201cI know. I am going to call the CDC and see what they want us to do, but I would keep yourself quarantined. Definitely do not go to Houston today. We are going to have to take the next 3 weeks off work.\u201d \u201cShit. Okay. Let me call my family and tell them not to come over.\u201d\nAfter getting off the phone with Taylor I called the CDC. They have a wait time of 81 minutes. I opted for them to call me back. I spent the next 2 hours in a panicked state, trying to piece together as much information as I could. Reading article after article and seeing pictures of what happens to those who contract Ebola\u2026 I finally broke down.\nI stepped away from my computer. Tears were pouring down my face. Just a few hours ago everything seemed fine. Now I am facing a hard fact that I may start to develop symptoms in the next 1-20 days. If that happens I stand a 10%-50% chance of survival. It is a very hard truth to think that I may not be here in just a few weeks or less.\nIt is not looking good for the passengers of flight 1143. Although I am reading lots of reports that it can only be spread through bodily contact, there is plenty of articles suggesting otherwise. In fact, it could be so easy as the nurse, now identified as Amber Vinson, rubbing a sweaty palm across the top of a seat. Walking through the narrow isle I could have placed my hand on that same seat as I make my way through the plane. Sitting down, I might have rubbed my sleepy eyes. BAM\u2014I could have just contracted Ebola.\nThat is the problem with this. No one knows how bad it is precisely, and it is insanely scary. The CDC is staunchly maintaining their stance that it can only be transferred through bodily fluids and those in close contact with someone showing symptoms. There are other reports suggesting it could be spread through saliva droplets in the air within a 3 foot span.\nSo who do I trust? The CDC that said Amber Vinson was asymptomatic boarding the airplane?\nA little later in the day I am hearing something different. Tom Frieden of the CDC said, the nurse \u201chad a slight fever of 99.5 degrees when she boarded Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 from Cleveland to Dallas/Fort Worth, but it did not register at the 100.4 degree \u2018fever threshold\u2019 that would have flagged her for an Ebola test,\u201d according to the Washington Examiner.\nThis is not helping my trust. What I want to know is why the CDC cleared that nurse to fly commercially? It is absolutely ludicrous.\nNow the CDC is trying to placate the situation. Frieden has since stated that \u201cother exposed healthcare workers will now be banned from taking public transportation until they clear the virus\u2019 incubation period.\u201d\nSeriously? Are you joking with me? NOW? Why were not they banned in the first place? This virus is terrible. Reading on how it affects the body and slowly tears it apart gives me nightmares. Now I just found out that, because of the CDC\u2019s ignorance, my friend and I have been exposed to it!!\nSo what am I going to do about it? Well the CDC finally called me back and took down my information and\u2014that is it. They said they would be in contact. I was given no extra information.\nThat is comforting. Not. It is not the CDC\u2019s responsibility to handle everything though. I am going to stick it out in a self-imposed quarantine the next 21 days. Why? Because I care about those around me and have a greater responsibility to the public.\nI have been heralding messages all day from my family and friends attempting to assure them I am okay. It is going to be hard. Hopefully I have not contracted Ebola, and hopefully this will blow over like nothing happened. Hopefully I will be able to pay my bills and everything will work out.\nWhat is not okay, is putting my friends and family in danger of myself. That is the most selfish thing I could do. So here is my question to you\u2014what would you do if you woke up and were told you had been exposed to one of the most deadly viruses on the planet?\nIf we want to ensure this does not happen to more people, then I say we band together as a country and take responsibility. I do not want to scare people. I do not want to start a frenzy. I want to be solution oriented. I just want this to stop. To do that, it is going to take every single person doing their part.\nAt this point, my part is going to be isolating myself. But ask yourself, what is your part? I do NOT want you going through this! I still have not been contacted further by the CDC and I am not very confident in their abilities.\nWhether it is private organizations or the government, everyone that has come in contact with someone that has Ebola should be quarantined. No questions. As a country this should be easy to raise enough money and find the manpower to provide for people that have possibly been infected.\nAnd why is it important to do this? Because if it goes further the country as a whole will not be able to support the number of infected. At that point there will be no stopping it.\nMy pen name is Axl Goode.

They have moved the production facility to Germany, but have been unable to secure the necessary validation for those plants that would allow production to proceed, Redfield told lawmakers.\"*\n\n*\"There is currently a global stockpile of about 145,000 doses of the vaccine, while roughly 130,000 here is currently a global stockpile of about 145,000 doses of the vaccine, while roughly 130,000 people in DRC have been vaccinated so far, \"*\n\n#### DRC SitReps report actual number vaccinated to be 130,711.\n\nBetween May 8^th and June 5^th over 18,00 vaccinations have been given in the DRC.  The low/high range of daily vaccinations fluctuate between the low of 215 (on 04JUN19) and the high of 1052 (on 15MAY19) through the 29 day period when the DRC began publishing the total vaccinations per day. (*Note:* DRC's vaccination program began on 01SEP18).  This averages 627 vaccinations per day.  \n\nUsing that as a guide, the current supply of vaccine will not be depleted until April of 2020. \n\nThe report fails to take into consideration that during the next ten (10) months, Merck will acquire the needed validation for the new German facility and will begin production to replenished the stockpile.   Major pharmaceutical manufacturers do not curtail operation in one facility without cause nor without a detailed plan for its operations to commence at another location. \n\nThough not knowing the reasons for the Pennsylvania plant closure, a wild guess is because the vaccine has now a proven efficacy, (not of the 85% quoted in the report, but near or above 95%). The new production facility will in all likelihood be able to produce more than the PA facility was able to, is thousands of miles closer to it is market in central Africa.  In short, the new facility will be able to meet immediate and future needs for the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine.\n\nDo not see the *Endgame* here as stopping the DRC outbreak, but to vaccinate any who might possibly become infected with Ebola Virus Disease in the future.  This means being able to vaccinate the entire population of sub-Saharan Africa.  Clearly a herculean task, but one affording a monumental step forward towards eliminating yet another infectious disease threatening the our planets population. This is very dangerous. If Ebola were to spread outside of Africa the lack of vaccine could be disastrous. The shortage in Africa is bad enough. Whoever is responsible needs to be fired and someone competent employed. The stockpile is actually quite a bit bigger than listed because they found that the doses manufactured were higher than those used in the vaccine trial.

As city sizes go in the Congo, Beni may be considered large at about 15 square miles in size.  Biakutu, located about 28 miles north north west of Beni and is about 1.5 square miles in size. \n\nEVD has been present in Beni since the beginning of the North Kivu outbreak and it is one of the areas where the DRC and the worelds health organizations are focusing their efforts. The CFR is standard for Ebola where treatment is available.  Historically, it has taken two thirds of those stricken. \n\nThe two locations being connected by road makes Biakutu an expected conduit for the disease to spread through.  \n\n( 28.0 miles \u2248 45.1 kilometres ^(1 mile = 1.6km)\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot.

I had no idea the CFR for ebola _with treatment_ was 68%, I thought that was about the untreated number.  I would imagine truly western hospital levels could bring that number down quite a bit, but what do I know.  \n\nIt would take two plane trips for a sick individual to make it to a truly major city (Kenshasha, Nairobi, etc).  They are simply too far bar car, rail, or ship to survive long enough to provide a global threat.  The eastern side of the DRC is a hell of a place I have been learning.  Please correct me if I am wrong. As is common when dealing with matters such as this, understanding requires many eyes on the topic.  *To know a matter, it has to be seen from all its aspects.* With the speed of life accelerated as it is, no one can know *all* there is to know about *any* topic.  \n\nA salient factor about Ebola Virus Disease in modern societies (where fresh water is brought into, and waste waters are removed from each domicile), is the opportunity for the spread of contagious disease is greatly reduced.Though ( was symptomatic with EVD, and there by infectious to others, none of the family members, living with him in the Dallas apartment, became infected.  Though two nurses treating him, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, contracted the disease.  Much was learned about Ebola in the closing months of 2014.  While unable to say the world sighed in relief, there was a noted reduction in the level of interest.  \n\nRegarding your thoughts about, *'...plane trips...'* and *'...survive long enough...'*.  It a traveler was symptomatic before departure or became symptomatic during travels, they would be by definition, contagious.  Flight crews, fellow passengers, mingling travelers and any others encountered would be at risk. *'Ring Vaccination'*, as demonstrated in the current and previous outbreak in western DRC, is an effective method of identifying, vaccinating and limiting disease spread. \n\nFrom what is been seen and read about Congolese Africans, they turn to their families, villages and healers for help when becoming ill. Medical treatment is not a swift ambulance ride away and is why reliance is placed on traditional healers. Though the healers have limited understanding of modern medicine, it does not mean they cannot become knowledgeable of ways to help stop the outbreak.  With more ebola outbreaks than in any other country, healers are on the front line and have a deeply vested interest in the matter. It is their family's, their friends and their neighbors who are at risk.  The healers, members of their communities and relatives form a collective self-supporting entity. \n\nBiggest obstacle in the fight against ebola has been burial practices as it causes the spread of the disease to a large number of people often coming from many different locations.  \n____\nThe following are somewhat ancillary to the topic but address how other governments have dealt with the same and similar public health concerns: \n\n* The response of the Nigerian government after an EVD infected traveler from west Africa managed to make their way to Lagos where were they sought treatment (before an effective ebola treatment protocol had been defined) ( Several people died during this incident, but wide spread infection did not occur in Nigeria though it is doubtful a full and complete report has ever been provided by the Nigerian government due to stigma involved.\n\n* When SARS, Avian and Swine Flu became a public health concerns in eastern Asia airport security measures expanded to body temperature screening.  All arrivals were individually screened before being allowed entry.  This lead to the deployment of ( in areas where people with higher than normal body temperatures can be identified.  As far as I know they remain in use as they are an effective means of protecting the public from potential health threats.   \n    * (\n\n* The city of Yumen in western China presented the national government with a public health concern in July 2014 when a local farmer died of bubonic plague, (  In a report the city of Yumen was described as a location where workers would regularly and routinely travel to, spend a few weeks working, then return home for rest.  China has a history with the plague, as indicated in the closing paragraph of the Smithsonian article. \n___\nIf looking to become more familiar with the who is estimate of the health profile of the worlds largest continent, a subscription to the ( will prove helpful.

It covers an area the size of Western Europe, but has only 1,250 miles of paved road. Naturally, one of the only ways to travel from place to place or to transport goods across the country is by air. Many of the most daring and dangerous pilots in the DRC are Russian.

They were first noticed in mid 2014 when the West African outbreak was out of control and accelerating towards horrid zenith. Simple addition mistakes were published and left uncorrected. \n\n####Similarly in the current North-Kivu outbreak, errors are present in 12 of the 57 WHO SitReps.

Usually a time span of seven to ten days.  Ample period for error checking. \n\n####The stated reason why the WHO was able to take over outbreak management from DRC's Ministry of Health, was the concept of them being able to do a better job.  On the reporting aspect, of the more than three hundred (300) epidemiological situations reports issued on a daily basis by DRC's Ministry of Health, *none contained any calculation errors.*  In contrast, of the fifty-seven (57) situation reports published by the WHO, more than 20% contain simple addition errors.  Early in the outbreak DRC's MoH acknowledged the possibility of errors occurring in the reports and stated, when error were found, they would be openly addressed corrected.  In the following months three (3) corrections in the form of *'Errata'* were issued.

I am not in the camp of people that thinks that all of civilization will be destroyed in 2015 by Ebola. We will probably see dozens to hundreds of cases in a few Western countries, and the Western death rate will be fairly low due to the better medical care we can get.\n\nWhat really worries me are the implications of the Ebola epidemic for how we see the world. We just do not care about Africa. We have seen Ebola as \"another African Problem\"--decades of civil wars, famines and minor diseases have completely desensitized us to problems in the region, which invariably happen to poor black people. I am not going to argue whether or not the West should always rush to help Africa or try to let Africans support themselves the best they can. \n\nRather, it is depressing to think that we live in such a self-centered, short-term orientated society that long-term, slow burning issues completely pass us by until it is too late. Ebola or climate change, it does not matter: we need to take action NOW, whilst we can predict what will happen in the future, and before the price of acting becomes so vast that nobody will ever be able to afford it. I do not think people appreciate just how interconnected our world is either: people can be in any part of the world within days, but countries still think in terms of national interests when it comes to global problems.\n\nI do not even know what the solution is. If world leaders try to act early and avert catastrophe they will likely be criticized by ignorant enemies or the common masses for wasting money, because paradoxically about the only way we can see if our money has been \"well spent\" is if something goes wrong and we can react to it. \n\nSure, I am scared of dying of Ebola, but I am also completely disheartened with the way our political and social system lets Africans die in their thousands before we care.

To examine whether these animals became infected with Ebola virus, we sampled 439 dogs and screened them by Ebola virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G assay, antigen detection, and viral polymerase chain reaction amplification. Seven (8.9%) of 79 samples from the 2 main towns, 15 (15.2%) of 99 samples from Mekambo, and 40 (25.2%) of 159 samples from villages in the Ebola virus-epidemic area had detectable Ebola virus-IgG, compared to only 2 (2%) of 102 samples from France. Among dogs from villages with both infected animal carcasses and human cases, seroprevalence was 31.8%. A significant positive direct association existed between seroprevalence and the distances to the Ebola virus-epidemic area. This study suggests that dogs can be infected by Ebola virus and that the putative infection is asymptomatic\n\nThese data are consistent with observations we made during the different Ebola outbreaks that occurred in Gabon and the Republic of Congo in recent years. We observed that some dogs ate fresh remains of Ebola virus\u2013infected dead animals brought back to the villages, and that others licked vomit from Ebola virus\u2013infected patients. Together, these findings strongly suggest that dogs can be infected by Ebola virus, and that some pet dogs living in affected villages were infected during the 2001\u20132002 human Ebola virus outbreak.\n\n\nThus, dogs appear to be the first animal species shown to be naturally and asymptomatically infected by Ebola virus. Asymptomatic Ebola infection in humans has also been observed during outbreaks (18) but is very rare. Although dogs can be asymptomatically infected, they may excrete infectious viral particles in urine, feces, and saliva for a short period before virus clearance, as observed experimentally in other animals. Given the frequency of contact between humans and domestic dogs, canine Ebola infection must be considered as a potential risk factor for human infection and virus spread. Human infection could occur through licking, biting, or grooming. Asymptomatically infected dogs could be a potential source of human Ebola outbreaks and of virus spread during human outbreaks, which could explain some epidemiologically unrelated human cases.

In addition, the reported deaths exclude at least 3000 known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth. **On the other hand, I reckon that unsafe burial ceremonies played a huge role in driving the exponential growth we saw in the earlier months, and maybe ceasing such activities played a significant role in halting the exponential growth.**\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks, requiring at most 7 days to eclipse the largest outbreaks of the past. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* The decline in cases in West Africa is backed up by the declining reported occupancy rates at the ETUs.\n\n* It is looking like the end of the outbreak could happen in Liberia before it happens even in Guinea. Only the Montserrado district has had active confirmed cases over the previous 24 days. Sierra Leone and Guinea has had active confirmed cases over the past 7 days all over the place. Of course this could change in the future, but, for whatever reason, it suggests that social education has been far more effective in Liberia than elsewhere. **Edit 4 days later: I will be removing this point from future updates as I have discovered that there are actually confirmed cases all over the country, but Liberia does not add them to the confirmed case list if the test result came back after the patient was already dead.**\n\n* The Ivory Coast is situated right next to one of the more recent active districts in Guinea, known as Lola.", "Les Roberts \u2013 \u201cDay 39: The plural of anecdote is not data\u201d | The Program on Forced Migration and Health at Columbia University ", "Ebola, Nurses, and Big Cities: Remember SARS? (\n\n(\n\nThis is well worth a read. There are a lot of lines in this report that we could compare/contrast to Ebola in a large city. Ebola is not known to be airborne, but it is known to be highly infectious and requires isolation as well. A couple things:\n\n**Course of the Outbreak**\n\n&gt;There were two distinct phases to the SARS outbreak in Toronto, each having a very different impact on nurses and patient care. Phase one was characterized by organized chaos as crisis management plans were implemented to contain and manage the disease while uncovering its origin and transmission. Fear and anxiety were the predominant emotions, but ones that were accompanied by a sense of success and pride as the number of new cases began to drop.\n\nWe already know Ebola's origin and transmission, mostly. It seems they are still working out the kinks, but we know where this disease comes from and how to reduce infection rates. We should be ahead of SARS, and we were, in a way. MSF and other organizations have been on the ground fighting the outbreak at the source and encouraging others to focus on the same.\n\n&gt;Phase two was experienced very differently. In part, this is because restrictions were lifted \u2013 in the eyes of nurses \u2013 far too soon. In phase two, nurses\u2019 warnings about ongoing and unrecognized transmission were not initially acted upon. Then, as more stringent precautions were implemented, they added to the burden of an already exhausted staff. The quarantine and illness of many, many nurses and the subsequent death of two nursing colleagues made the workplace risk even more tangible and frightening. Adding to this fear was the belief by many of an unspoken pact that the crisis needed to be over. Following the World Health Organization (WHO) advisory, issued on April 23rd that included Toronto in the **list of places \u201cnot to visit,\u201d** the official focus on SARS was significantly reduced. The **once daily government ads**, informing the public of \u201cSARS symptoms to be aware of\u201d essentially disappeared. Media attention switched from health care issues to economic recovery for the city and province. Nurses came through phase two feeling exhausted \u2013 physically and emotionally \u2013 and betrayed by a system that expects them to care but does not adequately protect them as they do so. \n\nWe are seeing the CDC make mistakes in restrictions on those who have had contact, we have nurses protesting against the PPE and procedures (and lack thereof), we have hospitals having extreme difficulty finding nurses to take care of Ebola patients, we have nurses themselves being quarantined, and blind optimism clouding public opinion. The second part is something we have not really seen yet: official public advisories and education. Travel advisories actually took the public focus off of the disease.\n\n**Healthcare Capacity**\n\n&gt;Nurses describe a system stretched beyond capacity as it struggled to deal with SARS... In addition to staffing shortages, this included the lack of respiratory isolation capability and the subsequent \u201cscrambling\u201d to purchase hepafilters and convert rooms to negative pressure . Also, there were simply not enough rooms in Emergency Departments to contain the spread of this type of disease and patients on several occasions were **cared for from behind curtains**. When an organization could no longer manage the volume of patients coming to their door, patients were transferred to other facilities. This contributed to the ongoing spread of disease. \n\nCanada has designated certain hospitals to handle Ebola cases. Although this helps with a lot of these issues, it also intensifies others: staffing availability, number of rooms, \"non-essential\" care services for the local area. All in all, though, it seems like a sound strategy. I do not think I have to explain how absurd it is to isolate a patient with an airborne virus behind curtains, either. It points out the desperation.\n\n&gt;During the SARS outbreak, admissions of patients to some facilities were stopped due to excessive workload and staff shortages. Hospital alternate level of care (ALC) patients were quickly transferred into available long term care beds to make space available for SARS patients. This in turn meant that community needs temporarily became secondary to the needs of acute care patients. The public health community did not have the surge capacity to respond to SARS without compromising existing public health services, particularly in areas serviced by nurses. Thus services were severely limited to important program areas... In summary, not one sector possessed the surge capacity to respond to SARS without significantly compromising other programs and providers.\n\nThis makes me question whether or not there is \"no precedent\" as people claim. It seems there is a lot to learn from this, and maybe there are other examples of procedures such as designating hospitals. This is all stressing that it is not about widespread infection, it is about how strenuous just a small number can be. We cannot defeat it without controlling it at the source, because we simply cannot handle the patient load while maintaining other standards.\n\nAnyone else have thoughts, highlights, knowledge of this?", "Come see me in free video chat.

South Africa would pose some particular challenges. \n\nSA has 6 cities with over a million people, several of which have very busy airports serving cities all over Africa. It is much more urbanized than West Africa, with vast slums.\n\nIt was speculated that Duncan, the Dallas Ebola victim, may have \"fled\" to the U.S. to seek emergency medical treatment out of desperation. SA could prove to be an attractive destination for Ebola refugees seeking treatment in First World hospitals in Johannesburg or Capetown or other cities, which happen to be much more accessible (both cost and logistics-wise) than the U.S. / Europe. \n\nAround 12% of South Africa's populace (~5,700,000 people) have HIV/AIDS. It is not hard to imagine that something like hemorrhagic fever could be devastating to someone with a weakened or suppressed immune system. \n\nTo me, the infection spreading to South Africa seems very possible and very dangerous, maybe one of the scarier scenarios for the reasons above. With that being said, I have never been to SA. What say the rest of you? Especially those who live there or have visited?

Let us say that the three or four current survivors have enough blood to treat 10 people. If those 10 survive, then there will be 13 donating enough blood to expand to 20 or 30 more people. If done early enough, by the the time an outbreak happens we could have stored enough donations to control it. If repeated, this could work faster that producing enough vaccines.\n\nEthically it is not worse than an early test for a vaccine.

During the first quarter, more than 6,000 health facility supervision reports were sent, half of them in March alone.\n\nIn addition, the mobile application enabled the GPS location of 1,100 health facilities providing immunization services, 100 Central Health Zone Offices (BCZS), and 500 refrigerators.\n\nThe national score for immunization activities **exceeded 50%** for the first time in March 2019, thanks to the performance of the provinces of Kinshasa, Ituri and Mongala.\n\n* (\n\n* (\n\n### 1. SUPERVISION\n\nAt the level of supervision, the total number of reports sent by the supervisors of the zones and health areas **almost doubled each month** to reach 2,900 in March 2019.\n\n* (\n\n   ^(Number of reports per user)\n\n   ^(Number of unique users)\n\n* (\n\n   ^(Supervised health training in ituri and supervision score)\n\n**More than half of Plan's health areas were supervised** in March 2019, spurred by the provinces of Ituri, Kinshasa and Mongala.\n\n### 2. VACCINATION SESSIONS\n\nThe percentage of health areas covered by the Mashako Plan that organize the **minimum number of immunization sessions** increases every month and reached 38% in March. The three provinces that stand out are still Ituri, Kinshasa and Mongala.\n\n* (\n\n* (\n\n\n### 3. FUNCTIONALITY OF THE COLD CHAIN\n\nThe **functionality of the cold chains** is increasing and reaches 85% in March 2019. The provinces with the best scores are Mongala, Haut-Katanga and Kwilu.\n\n* (\n\n* (\n\n### 4. AVAILABILITY OF VACCINES\n\nThe main challenge in the first quarter was the availability of vaccines due **to stockouts** at the central level. In March, vaccine availability remained low with 46% of refrigerators having one week of vaccines and inputs at the national level.\n\n* (\n\nIn March, 70% of the refrigerators in health centers visited lacked at least one vaccine.\n\n* (\n\n    ^(Availability of all antigens and children)\n\n    ^(Rupture of at least one antigen out input)\n\n\nDue to these stockouts, more than 4,200 children out of the 30,000 present (ie 14%) were not vaccinated during the 1,223 supervised sessions.\n\n* (\n\n    ^(Non-vaccinated children during vaccination sessions)\n\n    ^(1223 supervised immunization sessions in March)\n\n    ^(Break of at least one vaccine during half of these sessions &lt;621&gt;)\n\n    ^(4221 Break of at least one vaccine during half of these sessions &lt;14%&gt;)\n\n\n### PRIORITIES FOR SECOND QUARTER 2019\n\n1. Restore **vaccine stockpiles** for all antigens and inputs at the central level to facilitate distribution to the provinces;\n1. Improve **the delivery** of immunization antennas to ensure that all antennas in the country have at least one month of stock for at least 10 antigens and inputs;\n1.

Rather, it reflects a deterioration in the ability of overwhelmed responders to record accurate epidemiological data. It is clear from field reports and first responders that EVD cases are being under-reported from several key locations, and laboratory data that have not yet been integrated into official estimates indicate an increase in the number of new cases in Liberia.

This is despite efforts by local NHS trusts to source enough isolation beds for every confirmed and probable infection. 32% of confirmed cases are in health workers, including some GP\u2019s, first responders, a substantial number of hospital nurses, and administration staff.

In at least a minority of places, maybe training was not good enough, PPE was under stocked, momentary lapses of concentration occurred, some health workers flouted quarantines after suspected PPE breaches, or maybe some were not isolated quick enough after developing symptoms.

Osterholm's speech. Some eye-popping stuff. I left out parts that I did not find particularly interesting or relevant. There are sure to be some spelling and/or grammatical errors. I tried to add  when necessary for clarity. I encourage anyone interested to watch the entire symposium.\n\n\u201cI know a hell of a lot less about Ebola than I did 6 months ago.\u201d\n\u201cI am of the notion that we have a lot of unexpecteds ahead of us\u2026Do not expect that anything carved in stone today will not be blown up by some scientific or intellectual piece of dynamite; it might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I find very concerning today is the amount of hubris we have about what we know about ebola from the standpoint of what our history has been with Ebola virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had roughly 2400 cases of illness; that is in 40 years\u2026this virus has hardly pinged the human species until now and yet we have this sense that we know so much about it\u2026and maybe we do; but something has changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this the same Ebola outbreak as the past? No it is not. Is it the same virus in a different setting? It could be.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us acknowledge one thing: we are making this up as we go\u2026and in doing that we have to become more comfortable with uncertainty. I categorically reject the idea that you cannot tell people you do not know because you are afraid you will scare them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the worst enemies we can have today is dogma. Dogma should be, at the first instance, the thing we jettison immediately\u2026do not fall into the trap of dogma. I see far too many today doing that for the fact that they want to reassure the public about A,B or C and that is a dangerous path.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the piece I wrote in Politico\u2026I laid out three plans: plan A, plan B and plan C. And I started out by saying that we are failing miserably with plan A, and plan A was trying to stop Ebola dead in its tracks in the three affected countries using the techniques we had used so well for so many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine you have this incredible distance swimmer who can go 4 mph, hour after hour after hour, but you put him in a river where the current is going 6 mph downstream and you say \u2018swim upstream;\u2019 every hour he or she is 2 miles farther downstream than where they started.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn terms of plan A we have to accept the unpredictability of the epidemic. We are in uncharted waters over there; we do not know what we are really working with. We do not. We just have to acknowledge that.\u201d\n\n\u201c is another one of those areas where hubris could get us in trouble. My answer, which is really simple, is there is just going to be lots and lots and lots of cases and lots and lots and lots of deaths but we do not know what that number is going to be and we just have to accept that fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cProgress is painfully slow\u2026the virus  operating on virus time and all the rest of us  operating on bureaucracy time. And the virus  winning hands down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI commend the US Government\u2019s response. No other country in the world has put forward the same response that the US has,  the US response has been woefully inadequate, because it is up against virus time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to understand the health system in these three countries has collapsed completely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am ready to acknowledge, you know, I am swimming four miles per hour but the current\u2019s six miles per hour; it is not going to be enough. Let us not fool ourselves and let us not tell the world it is going to be enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to understand what is very likely to happen \u2026If we are worried about this infectious disease forest fire in Africa burning away and the sparks firing occasionally into Dallas or wherever, imagine that wind is drifting to the east right now. I do not know how it will not get into those other countries\u2026if West Africa was a can of gas waiting for a match to hit it, the rest of central Africa is a tanker truck waiting for a match to hit it, and we do not quite get that yet. And there is no plan B; there is no plan B. How would we fight this, if in fact, this were to suddenly flare up in one of these cities along the belt in equatorial Africa, what would we do? Would we fight it on two fronts? We cannot fight it on one front.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what is plan C? Plan C for me is the only hope we really have, and that is Vaccine. I am convinced of it. I believe this will be an endemic disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we really have to understand here is that we do not understand what is going on\u2026and that is why I think this is going to be an endemic situation and vaccine will be the answer. Having said that, I have got great concerns about the vaccine situation right now. I think we have got great candidate vaccines\u2026I do believe we can have an effective Ebola vaccine; I am convinced of that, I really believe we can, but there is a big disconnect between the time it takes to get us there and then getting it into somebody in Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urgently need an international research agenda; we have none. I understand in a time of dire humanitarian straits, it is hard to do research, but we are not doing research for research sake, we are doing research for prevention, because we have lots of major questions that we have got to get answered\u2026I think it is a travesty we are this far into this outbreak and we have a single set of viral isolates with genomic data from one location in Sierra Leone from May and we have got people making pronouncements about what this virus is doing; they do not know what the hell they are talking about. We do not know what is going on. We need to have that kind of agenda right now. We need to understand transmission better. What is happening there? Why is this different? Is it just the population or are there other things going on? And I do not know that there is and I surely do not people to walk away saying, \u2018well, that is scary,\u2019 but we have an obligation as scientists not to have another black swan event.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need much more data and clinical virology. I see evolutionary biologists and bioinformatics people commenting all the time about what is happening there  and we do not have a clue.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, the issue on risk communication: I just have to say right now, we have to do a better job\u2026we have a problem with the fact that we think we are going to scare people and so we are always couching things in certainty for which certainty does not exist, and we have to start being honest about that. That is different than being scary. We do not really understand  issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have personally heard from clinicians with a whole series of cases, where people did not ever present  for the entire time, from the admission at the treatment center until they died. There was never any documented 101.5 fever. They never did . Well now we have focused so heavily on fever for screening, in our clinics and so forth,  what if somebody presents that does not have a fever? What happens then, when the media gets all over that and says \u2018you told us there would be a fever but now this patient has been found to have Ebola but did not have a fever, you did not know what you were talking about\u2026\u2019 Now is the time to anticipate that and say, \u2018you know, most patients are going to have a fever\u2026but we do not know about this group and we are trying to learn more about it\u2026\u2019 Tell them what might happen\u2026then when it happens, and I believe it will happen, you do not have to feel like you did not tell  the complete truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAirborne in the immediate patient space\u2026we really have never been in a position to judge whether airborne transmission could happen because it is always been overwhelmed by the close contact transmission that is there. But aerosols are created, I have worked on too many outbreaks of Norovirus infection, where somebody like me up at the podium vomited, and I nailed the first seven rows here  over the next 48 rows with norovirus, even though no one ever touched the vomit. We have seen far too many things like that; we do not completely understand.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe never could quite study it .\u201d\n\n\u201c I raised the issue about the potential for airborne transmission  being a respiratory-transmitted agent\u2026I raise that because I have been talking to a number of Ebola virologists who are very concerned about it; they were concerned about it so that made me concerned about it. Some of them have spoken out and been cited in the media recently\u2026and it is not this great evolutionary mutation\u2026Carl Zimmer, who most people would say is a noted science writer,  in the NY Times this week that, \u2018the chances of an American getting Ebola are tiny. While viruses are known for mutating, Ebola itself is very unlikely to change so much that it could go from being fluid-borne to airborne. That is just fear. That is like saying you are afraid of wolves and you are really worried that one day wolves are going to be born with wings and are going to fly around and attack people and they will fly from Montana to New York. That is just not a realistic worry. Evolution does not work that way.\u2019 Well you know what, I was one of those people early on explaining why HIV was never going to be a respiratory pathogen: because we understood the physiology of the lungs, we understood which cells the virus was in and we understood that was not going to be an issue; that is different than this . Number one, we have had examples with sub-human primates where transmission of Ebola virus has occurred via the respiratory tract. We had one where pigs transmitted to sub-human primates\u2026I think the point being here is that some people are concerned because we do not know or understand why that virus passed the first time in those sub-human primates.\u201d\n\n \u201cToday I have been given permission  something I have known about for a few weeks that has concerned me greatly. Gary Kobinger and colleagues at Winnipeg Canadian National lab actually took one of the strains from Guinea and put it into Macaques a little over a month and a half ago. What they saw was remarkable. It was unlike any of the Ebola viruses they have seen in monkeys. It was much, much more severe; the pathology in the lungs was remarkable. As Gary said, who is one of the most prominent Ebola virologists in the world, \u2018 was very worrisome to me.\u2019 Maybe this is a different virus. Maybe there is that possibility that if you have that much virus in the lungs , maybe somebody might cough it up and maybe you might get a cycle. Now I am\u2019 not saying that here to scare people. Plan B; what the hell are we going to do if we suddenly see the potential for transmission that might be respiratory in nature. Do we have a plan?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if we had another black swan event, where now we really had a reason to be concerned about airplanes? I do not know what that chance is, but I want somebody to be thinking about it and I want a plan. And it is not based on just idle speculation.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me just conclude by saying: we all want certainty in this situation, I guarantee you we will not get it. Mother Nature will not allow us that. We have got to stop providing certainty. We can still provide good science, we can still provide very effective public health messages and we can still be in control of our destiny as it relates to how we respond.

Armchair speculation Disclaimer: This is just some commonsense speculation. I do not know shit about shit.\n\nOk, so let us start with the basics. Ebola is a virus disease. You get it by being exposed to virions. If you are exposed to sufficiently many (seems to be about 1-10 virions), you get Ebola. How contagious a person is, is therefore determined by the chance that the person exposes you to 10 virons. Now for a simple equation\n\nvirons exposed to = virons per unit fluid * units of fluid exposed to\n\nif that equals more than 10, you are screwed.\n\nAs the disease progresses, both those factors increase. The person gets higher and higher virus concentration. And starts puking and bleeding, which exposes you to more fluid.\n\nWe have been told that people are only contagious when they show symptoms. Let us consider why this is. A person shows symptoms because it has lots of viruses in their body. And lots of viruses means you are more contagious. So there is not like a magic switch that activates when you get a fever, or a headache or whatever. It just indicates that, well you have more virus in you now than you did a little while earlier.\n\nSo what the equation says is that the risk increases continuously. In the beginning a high amount of exposure is required, and it may be virtually impossible to catch. Someone who is in the beginning of incubation period will have low amount of virus. Someone at the end will have higher. Someone who just started showing symptoms will be slightly higher. And someone who had it for a few days will have very high amounts of virus. So basically \"asymptomatic=no risk\", is not a rule written in stone, it is just a convenient rule of thumb. I think it is unwise to hang up on exactly what minute someone got a headache, or felt more \"weak\" than normal.", "WHO | Latest Ebola outbreak over in Liberia; West Africa is at zero, but new flare-ups are likely to occur ", "Merck Obtains Rights to Experimental Ebola Vaccine.

The number doubled by ~10/1, or about 70 days later. \n\nIf Guinea is a baseline, we are likely to see 1,300+ infections by 3/1/2019. \n\nBUT, complications in DRC mean as total infected increase, r naught is also likely to increase, as vaccine implementation will probably increasingly fall short of what is needed -- which is why cases are again accelerating after the brief fall in November. If this does occur, the doubling time is more likely to rival what was seen in Liberia and Sierra Leone at ~600 cases (30 days doubling), which could result in a much higher case total as we enter late January and February. \n\nI would anticipate something like -- \n\n1/17/19: 900 (+264)\n2/17/19: 1,500 (+600)\n3/17/19: 3,500 (+2,000)\n\nIF we enter February with over 1,000 cases, it likely portends a worsening transmission rate and a probable jump to numbers more like SL / Liberia, or possibly even higher, considering we are already matching Guinea *with* containment efforts.

And now there is a new case of Ebola in the Congo. True, but the lesson on how to solve the problem has been well learned.  At this point, it is a matter of contract tracing and treatment.  EVD remains a deadly disease, but there is a treatment protocol with a high survival rate. I agree that the road forward is clear, there is a effective strategy, which is wonderful. Violence toward health workers had been an obstacle to getting things under control in eastern Congo. Are you suggesting this problem has been resolved? Resolved? No.  If anything, with the virus reservoirs in the body and immigration noa common. The problem has gained the possibility of appearing anywhere on the planet. Recognized early and addressed promptly, it will not gain the foothold needed to manifest a significant threat. I agree with you that the potential for prolonged widespread Ebola epidemics is now significantly reduced. I am just concerned about a very old story: local outbreaks that could otherwise be contained may be exacerbated by local politics and local breakdowns in authority. Especially concerned about that in eastern Congo, but has happened in many places. But there is much to celebrate in what has been accomplished over the last few years *\"... local politics and local breakdowns in authority...\",* or a failure with global supply chains, both present problems of importance.  With the former, as was recently witnessed in the North Kivu Ebola Outbreak, local militias added un-needed chaos to the problem. With the militias active across that area (DRC, Rwanda, and Uganda), the region is of much concern. \n\nAfter taking a hard look at that area of central Africa, and seeing the one million-plus people displaced by local warfare and now regulated to refuge camps as compounding the issue.

In addition, the reported deaths exclude at least 3000 known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth.\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks, requiring at most 5 days to eclipse the largest outbreaks of the past. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* The decline in cases in West Africa is backed up by the declining reported occupancy rates at the ETUs.", "UN worker dies of Ebola in German hospital ", "U.N.

These are only the reported confirmed/probable/suspected cases. In addition, the reported deaths exclude at least 3000 known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth.\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks, requiring at most 7 days to eclipse the largest outbreaks of the past. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* The decline in cases in West Africa is backed up by the declining reported occupancy rates at the ETUs.\n\n* It is looking like the end of the outbreak could happen in Liberia before it happens even in Guinea. **Only the Montserrado district has had active confirmed cases over the previous 21 days. Sierra Leone and Guinea has had active confirmed cases over the past 7 days all over the place.** Of course this could change in the future, but, for whatever reason, it suggests that social education has been far more effective in Liberia than elsewhere.\n\n* The Ivory Coast is situated right next to one of the more recent active districts in Guinea, known as Lola.", "Records chronicle how Ebola kills ", "Ebola will be airborne in London.

Would love advice on what other precautions I can take - is  vaccination available to the public? I think it is all about your level of risk avoidance.  Even without an active outbreak taking place, Fort Portal is pretty close to Bundibugyo, the namesake for the Ugandan strain of Ebola.  In other words, Ebola is endemic to where you will be staying.  Without more knowledge about what you are doing there (performing blood draws? working with Congolese migrants? opening up your own matooke stand?), it is hard to persuade or dissuade you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Btw: I have spend some time in Fort Portal... pretty nice, imho.) Vaccine is not available to public yet. You should be fine, provided you do not have close personal contact with a feverish person, wash any bodies for burial, or volunteer as a health care provider who will touch patients (although if you did that, then you could get the vaccine).

I am going as an educational researcher, collaborating with elementary schools just outside of fort portal. I had looked into the vaccine but have no idea how to find availability of it in the US. The organization I will work with is a smaller one and have said that on the Ugandan side, only health workers along the border have been offered the vaccine so it would be difficult to obtain in country. I have been reading the reports myself and at the moment feel more safe going knowing that Ugandan monitoring is highly controlled, but I think I would immediately leave if reports across the border occur. Malarone:  cheap, effective, no walking nightmares where you stab people I recommend the daily doxy, good for the skin, handles most other environmental issues you might encounter from food and water. I will second the no Mefloquine Monday, I never had an issue with it but the psychological effects are noteworthy in many people short term and I believe at this point I unknown in others long term. I have already picked up my malarone prescription but good to know doxy is just as effective! I have taken it in the past for another medical issue and did have some gastrointestinal side effects. Best part about doxy in Africa is it can easily be bought in almost any street corner pharmacy, no prescription needed obviously. And it is minimally counterfeited, and it is easy to test as if you take a bunch you will go to the bathroom a bunch (talking 200s daily), the skin clearing up is another good sign it is genuine. For malaria prophylaxis it is normally 100 daily. Also some malaria meds do not work worldwide but I believe doxy is effective worldwide *Not a doctor  It really does not factor into someone is risk profile that there was an Ebola outbreak there over a decade ago. It is been there more recently than a decade, and it is endemic to the area. What more do you want? When was there Ebola at Fort Portal more recently than the Bundibugyo outbreak. What I want is to understand how you think someone should factor in the Ebola history there. Ebola outbreaks happen less than once a year spread across many different countries.  It is not risky for VHF to go to Uganda if you are not touching dead bats or treating sick people. This persona is not working in medical facilities. Even if the DRC outbreak spills over into Uganda that would be extremely low risk for this person. Outbreaks years ago are totally meaningless for this person.

These are only the reported confirmed/probable/suspected cases. In addition, the reported deaths exclude thousands of known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone.\n\n* Recent declines in Liberia's reported new cases appear to be correlated with journal reports of a decline in admissions into ETUs. This suggests that the known new caseload has declined as well. Unless a larger proportion of all cases are unknown to investigators, which could only be logically explained if previously unaffected areas that are off-grid from investigators are getting hit very hard, then the decline in new cases (known and unknown) is likely genuine.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth.\n\n* Mali's high CFR does not inspire confidence. While Nigeria suffered a couple dozen confirmed cases, they quarantined many suspected cases. There successful response also meant the health ministry was generally a step ahead of new transmissions which allowed them to promptly deliver medical assistance for those exhibiting the earliest symptoms. Mali's CFR indicates posthumous or delayed discovery of someone infected, which means there was a lot more risk of further transmissions and it also indicates a contact tracing effort that is a step behind the spread.\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely. This scenario would mean that we will continue to see sustained rates of &gt;&gt;100 new cases per day until a vaccine, if found, is widely distributed, which likely will not be the case until late 15Q2 at the earliest.\n\n**Short-term forecast:**\n\n* ~150 cases/day for the next 4 days.", "Harvard Tightens Travel Restrictions as Ebola Outbreak Worsens - Affiliates Wishing To Travel to West Africa Must Now Obtain Provost\u2019s Approval ", "A walk through of our ETU in Liberia.

The four disease-causing viruses are Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest virus (TAFV), and one called, simply, Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly Zaire Ebola virus).\n\nEbola was  ( but ( and simply had gone unnoticed in the remote regions of Africa.\n\n\n\n**What type of the virus has caused this outbreak?**\n\nThis outbreak has been caused by an outbreak of the virus formerly known as Zaire Ebola Virus.  It is now referred to as EVD, or EVD-Zaire.  EVD-Zaire is the most deadly form of the Ebola Virus, causing severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates.\n\n\n\n**What are the symptoms of EVD?**\n\n(\n\nFirst symptoms are the sudden onset of fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.\n\nNote that the fever is typically high-grade, greater than 38.6\u00b0C or 101.5\u00b0F.  Also, not mentioned by the WHO page, (  Hiccups are associated with many hemorrhagic fevers, but especially with EVD.\n\n(\n\nAlso notable, this outbreak of EVD has a ( than past EVD outbreaks.\n\n\n**How is EVD spread?**\n\nEVD is spread through direct contact with body fluids from a symptomatic (showing symptoms) individual, including but not limited to urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen.  Direct contact means you have to just come into contact with the fluids, not necessarily the sick individual themselves.  Ebola has been shown to survive on surfaces for weeks in cold environments.  As with most viruses, it does not survive as well in warmer environments.\n\nAdditionally, EVD can be transferred by aerosolized body fluids.  While the virus is not truly an airborne (can survive outside of a liquid medium) virus like measles, it can and will survive in microscopic droplets of body fluids, and if those body fluids are inhaled or ingested, they can, and likely will, lead to infection.\n\n\n\n**Could the Ebola virus continue to evolve and become an airborne virus?**\n\nCould it?  Theoretically, yes.  However, there are no known examples of a human virus evolving a different mode of transmission.  It would be unprecedented and a totally new frontier for science and medicine for the virus to suddenly become a true airborne virus.\n\nEven in situations where viruses were genetically altered to develop a new mode of transmission, they have lost their lethality due to basic structural changes in their genetic material.  So if a virus did spontaneously evolve the ability to survive outside of liquids, odds are lethality would plunge from the current 70% to a considerably lower number.\n\nFor further reading on this topic, I highly advise reading ( a virologist at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.\n\n\n\n**Why are so many healthcare workers getting sick?**\n\nWhile EVD is a difficult disease to come into contact with due to such a limited mode of transmission, healthcare workers caring for a very sick infected individual are going to come into contact with their body fluids on a regular basis.  To prevent infection, they wear protective gear, or PPE.  However, if the PPE is not removed in an exact manner, which each layer being decontaminated with bleach/chlorine as it is removed, the virus can survive and end up finding its way into the body.  While it is difficult for your average person to come into contact with said body fluids, the disease is tremendously infectious, meaning that exposure to even a few virions (individual, complete virus organisms) can, and likely will, lead to full-blown EVD.\n\nAdditionally, an individual infected with EVD becomes more contagious as the virus proliferates in the body, so an individual with late-stage EVD is far, far more contagious than an individual who is just beginning to show symptoms.  Lastly, the body remains contagious until it is destroyed, as EVD can continue to invade and replicate in cells even after the body itself is dead.  The best way to prevent further spread after an individual has died is to cremate the body and all waste created from the first moment they became symptomatic.\n\nIf you want to know more about what exactly PPE is, and how to go about utilizing it safely, (\n\n\n\n**How fast is EVD spreading?**\n\nThe approximate rate of spread of EVD right now has the total number of cases doubling roughly every 21 days.  Each infected individual is (  In order for the outbreak to begin slowing down, ( needs to drop below one, so that every one infected individual is infecting less than one further individual.\n\n\n\n**How is EVD treated?**\n\nSince EVD has no cures nor vaccines ready for mass market consumption at this point, the treatment course of EVD focuses on symptom management.  Patients blood is tested to measure specific compounds in the blood (electrolytes), and then those compounds are managed to stay within a healthy range, via the use of intravenous treatments.  Oxygen levels and blood pressure are also monitored to ensure the patient's respiratory system remains functioning at healthy levels.  Management of EVD basically consists of supporting the body while the body creates antibodies to fight off the virus.\n\nIn Africa, since this kind of intense monitoring is not available, patients are directed to drink at least 4.5 liters of ( per day.  This is generally accepted as the best way to treat patients in a major outbreak like this where the afflicted nations are tremendously short-staffed and lacking in both beds and professionals to care for infected individuals.\n\n\n\n**Are there vaccines in development?**\n\nEVD has several vaccines under development, and I will just defer to (\n\n\n\n**How do we stop EVD?**\n\nThe best way to stop the spread of EVD is to identify all infected individuals and to place them into a controlled environment wherein individuals with the proper training can care for them and prevent them from spreading the disease further.  In order to do this, you need to have facilities and healthcare professionals large enough to contain at least 70% of infected individuals.\n\nWhy 70%?  A simple model, if R0 is 2.0, and you have 1000 infected individuals, you need beds for 700.  The remaining 300 individuals you are unable to quarantine will infect 600 people.  Since you have 700 beds, you can handle those 600 people and prevent further infection.\n\nPreferably you would have more than 70% capacity, because of the staggered rate of infections and death/survival.  Also an R0 of 2 is just an estimate, some individuals may infect nobody, while others may infect far more.\n\nFurther, after a patient is confirmed as infected with EVD, anybody he had contact with after the onset of symptoms needs to be found and placed into quarantine for 21 days.  21 days is the longest recorded incubation period of EVD in a human.  That is how past outbreaks have been controlled, and is why this one has, to this point, not been controlled.  This strategy is known as contact tracing.\n\n\n\n**How long is the incubation period?**\n\nThe incubation period for EVD can be anywhere from 2 to 21 days.  This outbreak seems to have an average incubation period of 7-10 days.\n\n\n\n**How exactly does EVD kill you?**\n\n(\n\n\n\n**How long does it take to die from EVD?**\n\nFrom onset of symptoms, it typically takes 5-7 days for a patient to die, however with developed-world standards of medical care, this can be far more drawn out.  Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian who came to the US and then became symptomatic, first showed symptoms on 9/24.  He died 10/8, 14 days later.\n\n\n\n**How long until survivors test negative for EVD?**\n\nSurvivors typically test negative for EVD 12-14 days after the onset of symptoms, but this can vary widely.  During this outbreak, patients are typically forced to wait until they have tested negative twice, and as such, are typically held out of the general population for 2-3 weeks.\n\nA negative test does not mean the patient is no longer able to transfer the disease, as semen can still contain transmittable Ebola virus for up to 7 weeks after recovery.  It simply means the virus is no longer active in detectable amounts in their circulatory system (blood).\n\n\n\n**What is the case fatality rate of this outbreak?**\n\nThe Case Fatality Rate, or CFR, represents the percentage of individuals who die as a result of EVD.  This outbreak appears to have a CFR of around 70%, consistent of past outbreaks of EVD-Zaire.\n\n\n\n**Why do the who is numbers show a fatality rate far lower than ~70%?**\n\nAs the disease spreads, more people are infected and have not yet had time to succumb to the disease.  The CFR looks at patients who have died or recovered and been discharged from the ETU's, while the who is numbers represent the entire spectrum of infected individuals.\n\n\n\n**Are survivors immune?**\n\nWhile not known for sure, ( that survivors have an immunity to EVD for for an unspecified time period after recovery, thought to be at least ten years.\n\nPer the CDC;\n\n(\n\n\nIf you have further questions, feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer them.", "Ebola and YOU!

Along the way we developed a better understanding of how to treat hemorrhagic fevers.  \n\nThen we had no idea on how do deal with the spread of infections from person to person. \n\nNow we know what needs to be done to deter the spread of Ebola from person to person and area to area. We have witnessed the virus appear in major cities in Africa, Europe and North America and seen it defeated on all fronts.  Akin to forest fires, raging across timbered lands.  Once it is brought under control, great care must be exercised to make sure soldering embers are not allowed to rekindle and start the blaze anew. When it happens, and it does happen, they are swiftly brought under control.  \n\nIn the 24 months since west Africa's health care workers started alerting the worlds of the problem.

Though able to do amazing things, it needs to remain vigilant and ready to respond to emerging health threats.\n\nThe nations of west Africa to had good reason to want to declare the outbreak over.  As it not only ravaged it is people, but seriously injured the regions economy.  As the outbreak dragged on month after month, the threat of political upheaval in the three nations was considered a possibility. It not happening in any of the nations stands a testament to the way people draw together and work within organized structures most of us are able to take for granted.

All organisms occasionally make errors, when they make new genetic material.   If the error is lethal, they die.  If the error gives them an advantage in reproduction, then they reproduce more than those without it.  If the error is neutral, nothing changes.\n\nIn large, slowly reproducing organisms (slow generation of new generations), this process can take a really, really long time.  In microorganisms, who go through many generations in a short period of time, this process can happen very quickly.  In fact, in microbiology we use this to make \"mutants\" that do something we want them to do. We subject them to things that damage their genetic material (like UV light), and then offer an environment that selects for the survival of only the ones that we want.\n\nSome organisms are more prone to making mistakes in their genetic material and when you make a lot of the organisms, and a lot of mistakes, you are bound to find something that is beneficial to reproduction.\n\nEbola makes mistakes in its genome, it is now in a lot of people, reproducing and transmitting.  Any error that gives any one of them an advantage to transmission is going to \"win\" the lottery and infect more people.  If some routes of transmission are blocked, then any strains that depend on that route are going to \"lose\" and no longer infect people.  \n\nThus, if some route is the only route available (or is the main one available), then those that can take advantage of that route are going to infect more (they \"win\").  If they make a further change that helps favor them even more, then those are now infecting even more.\n\nEbola will only develop airborne transmission, IF the selective pressure is there to do so and the right errors in replication happen.  This mean that if all other routes are blocked, and airborne is the only available route, then those that can make it through that path will infect others.\n\nThis means that if medical personnel are working under conditions where they are blocking all route EXCEPT airborne, and IF some of them manage to cross that divide, and those continue to be blocked in all other routes, THEN airborne transmission will be selected for, in that environment.   **This is why it is critical that anyone working with them must use complete protection to block all paths of transmission**.\n\nGiven that complete protection is not likely to be possible in the current conditions in Liberia, medical centers are counter productive. They are focal points for infection and risk applying selective pressure to develop airborne transmission.  \n\nIn something this large, self-isolation is the only possible solution.  All resources should be focused on supporting people to self-isolate by providing them with food and water so they can isolate their sick.  All this building of more support centers is counter productive for something on this scale.  There is no way they can build enough isolation beds to support it.  Trained medical personnel should be the ones traversing the city, not the sick. (Of course, they have to do it in a way that does not risk transmission, thus **trained** is key)\n\nWhat everyone should be thinking about and planning. is how they will self-isolate, if they needed to.  In a large outbreak, when isolation beds are filled, that will be their best bet to avoid getting infected (if they are not) in a medical center and to avoid infecting others (if they are).\n\nEdit: Wikipedia link for those who want more information:\n\n", "In Liberia, Gays under attack over Ebola ", "EBOLA IS A HOAX ", "Question about the safety of traveling in Dallas and Madrid.

Whether it will be effective in thwarting onset of infection, is to early to tell. \n\nThe body has amazing recuperative abilities.  As demonstrated by the sole survivor of Rabies.

With a significant increase in the number of infected persons, contact tracing and quarantine measures will become more difficult to implement. As far as I can tell, current studies do not take this into account at all but I am not an epidemiologist but I may be just may be missing it in the studies.\n\nThe calculated R0 in September according to PLOS and based on WHO statistics from Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leon and Nigeria was a 95% confidence interval of 1.5-1.9 with 1.78 being the best fit model. The most recent study I can find was published September 22 by the WHO Ebola Response Team with an estimated an R0 of 2.02 (1.79-2.26) for Sierra Leone from empirical data. They also provide estimates for Guinea, 1.71 (1.44-2.01), and Liberia, 1.83 (1.72-1.94). This study even makes the claim.\n\n&gt;After the early phases of exponential growth in case numbers, once infection has become established, the number of people at risk declines, so R0 fall from it is maximum value to a smaller net preoduction number\n\nI believe the R0 has been staying relatively consistent over the course of this epidemic so this seems a dubious. In Liberia right now, people are dying on the streets and being told to stay in their homes rather than seek help because the system simply cannot handle the massive number of current cases. I am wrong in thinking this could have an effect on transmissibility? In the later stages of the disease some get belligerent and disoriented and may be prone to walking out in public when viral shedding is near it maximum level. With no way to restrain them or prevent this from happening be much greater than having these people in an Ebola specific isolation unit? If anyone with a more in-depth understanding of the modelling can answer these questions that would be appreciated because I cannot find much discussion about this possibility in scientific journals. I only saw it mentioned as a limitation in the Sep 26 CDC report.\n\nThe 1976 outbreak had a 1.34 R0.

Either similar rate to 51/day or smaller for all earlier periods.\n\n**Notes:** \n\n* All affected countries are included in the totals for reported cases and deaths. These are only the reported confirmed/probable/suspected cases. In addition, the reported deaths exclude at least 3000 known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth. **On the other hand, I reckon that unsafe burial ceremonies played a huge role in driving the exponential growth we saw in the earlier months, and maybe ceasing such activities played a significant role in halting the exponential growth.**\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks, requiring at most 7 days to eclipse the largest outbreaks of the past. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* The decline in cases in West Africa is backed up by the declining reported occupancy rates at the ETUs.\n\n* **Guinea's outbreak seems to be more and more localized to the Conakry region, since only the western part of Guinea has reported a confirmed case over the past 7 days, with the exception of 1 in the Mali district. Given the proximity between Conakry and Freetown, it looks like the fate of the outbreak for Guinea and Sierra Leone are inextricably linked.**\n\n* **Liberia's confirmed caseload is very peculiar. Cumulative death totals are supposed to only contain cases that are either going to be tested or are confirmed positive. To be more accurate, those added to the cumulative death totals had to have been previously classified as suspected or probable and then tested positive, but that is not happening. The MoH counts maybe a couple confirmed cases (under the confirmed case category) per day from Montserrado while there are up to a dozen reported deaths daily throughout the country. This can only be explained if suspected or probable cases that die are not being tested, but are still being added to the cumulative death total. Now this is not all that problematic as long as the MoH assumes those untested deceased patients were Ebola-positive, but they are clearly PRing an entirely different message. Quite clearly on their Situation Reports they boldly show how Montserrado is the only district with confirmed cases over the past 4sh weeks, when the reality is that suspected/probable cases are dying all over the country without any followup tests. On the other hand, the reported occupancy totals of clinics outside of Montserrado are next to zilch, which begs the question of where are all those patients dying? There are a lot of problems with Liberia's numbers lately. I do not doubt that the outbreak has been significantly cut back in the country, but the numbers are very disjointed.**", "National Nurses Praise RN for Speaking Out on Hospital Lapses in Dallas ", "Trial confirms EBOLA vaccine candidate SAFE, equally immunogenic in Africa ", "This is how you know the ebola fear mongering is working ", "Officials hold press conference on latest Ebola case ", "Are people really panicking about Ebola?

This is the real X factor in the Ebola equation. These western African nations' economies are already stretched to the limit and, according to the vast majority of reports, the situation on the ground is getting exponentially worse.\n\n(\n\n\nFactoring in the economic devastation when there is so much human devastation seems crass, of course, but here is the reality-- modern civilization is, for better or worse, built on the foundation of stable economies.\n\nWithout a functioning economy, a state is rendered useless. And it seems we are rapidly approaching that point in Liberia.\n\n(\n\nWhat does this translate into? With a collapsed economy, we will most likely see the mass migration of poor, hungry Liberians who, with no other choice, will flee the country in search of jobs, food, and opportunity. Most of these refugees will not have ebola. Some most certainly will. And where do they go?\n\nGeographical proximity dictates that the poorest-- those unable to afford flights out-- will filter into surrounding nations; Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal, et cetera. Some might push further into South Western Europe. And while most could potentially be contained by a strict military cordoning *IF* put in place effectively, some will still slip through.\n\nThe ebola cases that we have seen in Spain and Dallas have shown that western medical systems are not as prepared for ebola patients as was previously thought. Multiple cases in any singular locale will most certainly stretch a hospital system to its limits. \n\nNigeria saw one ebola patient balloon into twenty cases. It was eventually snuffed out thankfully, but I think it is apparent at this point that their medical infrastructure could not reasonably handle 10 or 20 more cases like this. (( Now imagine hundreds of thousands of Liberian refugees pouring over the border, and its easy to see that Nigeria is looking down the barrel of a gun. \n\nIf the economies of Liberia, Guinea, or Sierra Leone collapse and we see a mass exodus, I think it is fair to expect to see this epidemic smolder like the Black Plague of the middle ages-- burning wide swathes through the impoverished areas of multiple countries over the course of years. I am not mentioning the Plague to be histrionic; I am just trying to establish the way it will look in posterity, historically speaking.\n\nThere are only two option for containment at this point, I believe:\n\n1. The creation of and effective dispersal of a vaccine.\n\n2. The world's most powerful nations must throw every possible resource-- medical, military and economic-- at these three nations to ensure their stability until this disease can be contained.\n\nBarring those two actions, I think we are going to witness a slow train wreck of historical proportions. \n", "Ebola scare raises its head in Mumbai, Delhi ", "Dr. Sacra hast NOT relapsed with Ebola; tested negative, is in stable condition and feeling better ", "Call from school...

Geneva.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ninety-three children under the age of 15 are among the deceased who had symptoms of fever and anemia.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dead were refugees who came from mid-February in Djugu territory and were received in Kandoyi, 350 km north of Bunia, in Ituri province, the report said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, the DRC informed the World Health Organization (WHO) this week of a possible outbreak of Ebola fever in the north-west of the country and counted about 30 suspected cases of the disease since April 4th. At least 17 people have died since some residents began to have symptoms resembling those of Ebola fever.\n\nTranslation site:  With all the violence breaking out recently amidst the Joseph Kabila issue I hope we see success with the vaccines. DRC is never stable especially in the northeast but ebola in a refugee camp would be beyond a nightmare. Do you know the location of refugee camps in DRC?  General assumption is they would be near larger population centers.  \n\nFurther complicating the matter is ( of January 30^th article where, *\"...alarmed by a recent surge in violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is driving large numbers of Congolese to flee eastwards to neighbouring Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda...\"*, is cited. \n\nIf the outbreak became active earlier, the countries to the east need to be encompassed in the medical response. \n\nAs mentioned a few times during who is May 11^th ( getting sufficient access to the area will be a major factor in this outbreak.  \n\n Thanks for the info. I did not mean that there are camps up there, just that that region has a lot of strife and potential for human movement and therefore spread of the disease. Thought you might have knowledge of them.  Further searching gave scope to the problem. Between refugees and displaced people there are more than 6,000,000 people at risk.  \n\nHard number to wrap the head around.  That is the population of many major metropolitan areas like: Madrid, Washington, D.C., Miami, Philadelphia, Berlin/Brandenburg, Toronto and Munich. \n It is a rabbit hole and directly tied to the surge of illegal immigration worldwide. Check out the situation of the Rohingya people fleeing Myanmar into tiny backwater Bangladesh. Where are they supposed to settle permanently? Many have been in camps for their entire childhood, for over a decade. What are they supposed to do with themselves the whole time? So they leave the camps and travel on foot and by boat across entire continents to boot, telling no one, traveling in groups, avoiding official crossings so we do not know who they are or how many, and also unlikely to seek healthcare along the way until they are in dire straits.\n\nSo an outbreak right when people are being forced out of their home and put on this path is terrifying. When rabbits are happy they can jump and twist. This is commonly called a \"binky.\" &gt; So an outbreak right when people are being forced out of their home and put on this path is terrifying.\n\nDo not take this as being argumentative, but let us not conflate the matter.  The section of southern/southeast Asia referenced is far more developed than central Africa. A system of roads exist between the countries and the cities in that part of Asia. In central Africa, rivers remain the primary method of transportation.  Unless classifying *'warfare'* as a religion in Africa, the sole point of commonality is before gaining independence, both were the colonial territories of various European nations. \n\nAddressing the two main points in your conclusion: \n\n* As stated by ( in the WHO media audio report (( *'hundreds of outbreaks...on any give year'* are cited.\n\n* This region of central Africa has been in turmoil since its nations gained independence from colonial control.  \n\nThe first factor indicates disease outbreaks are persistently occurring medical events.  The second, people fleeing regional warfare has also been a persistent event for more then half a century.  \n\nAm in full agreement with it being a terrifying situation.  Unfortunately, a common place occurrence in central Africa.  \n\n\n\n\n Thanks for the response. Clearly it is way too early and it would be a series of unfortunate events that put ebola in touch with actively fleeing refugees.\n\nI do not think the Rohingya plight is relevant in that aspect (although their camps are seeing things like cholera and TB popping up alarmingly due to the conditions) was more to point out the issue of displaced persons worldwide is enormous.\n\nBringing it back to DRC, it is more that a stark eruption of violence is simmering at the same time and approximate location to an outbreak of a very particularly deadly virus. Even in 2014 DRC saw ebola virus, just not the same one as in Sierra Leone et al. It is never been a peaceful country but it really is hitting a new boiling point right as this comes up.\n\nI hope we learned from that last big outbreak about the importance of early interception, because left to its own devices the virus crossed quite a big geographical area then and that was with ordinary movement for trade and work. Edit to add yes DRC is always in conflict but for the last 20 years has had a relatively stable government in the west at least with the same leader. Now he is being actively challenged and if the tide turns too far we will see more than skirmishes between various rebel groups and tribes. Will need to do more research into DRC's stability before commenting on that aspect. \n___\nCholera and TB are endemic with crowded camp life and are difficult to avoid.  Both spread rapidly given the correct \nenvironments which always seem to develop once refuge camps become crowded.\n___\nThere has been a noticeable change in the way WHO approaches infectious disease since the debacle of 2014 when they chose to ignore multiple red flag warnings from MSF's.  A mathematician could devise a method of determining the number of unnecessary deaths but no one will ever be held accountable. As that is not the way they do business.

The closest one to the area is the port of Soyo in the northwestern corner of Angola at the mouth of the Congo river. \n\n * The close proximity of capital cities of Brazzavile (RoC) and Kinshasa (DRC).

The authors also held focus groups with health sector members in Dallas and New York and brought together an expert group to discuss the findings and make recommendations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eric Toner, MD, senior associate at the Center for Health Security, said in a press release that one of the key findings was that the diversity of people who were involved in the response, many who never expected to. \"Therefore, many more stakeholders must participate in planning, and they are eager for firsthand information from others who have experienced a HCID event.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The report details challenges to common and unique problems the cities faced, focusing on the ones they did not expect. Some of the tough issues they faced included fear-based reactions, quarantine, monitoring, and waste management. Some of the healthcare-related issued include identifying treatment hospitals, triage, limitations on clinical services, and equipment decontamination.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the checklist, the authors define an HCID as a disease that is moderately to highly lethal, prompting significant public concern, such as smallpox, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), or H5N1 avian influenza. Resilience actions are grouped under seven checklist categories: planning and preparedness, leadership, creative flexibility, command structure, public trust, managing uncertainty, and crisis communication.\n&gt; \n&gt; The report also includes specific checklists for public health agencies, healthcare organizations, emergency medical services, and elected officials.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Burial impact, field research, media review**\n&gt; \n&gt;In the latest Ebola research developments, groups examined the impact of burial teams in helping curb Ebola transmission in West Africa's outbreak, discussed challenges of launching a clinical trial in Guinea during the outbreak, and compared how academic and lay press covered the epidemic.\n&gt; \n&gt;* Red Cross safe and dignified burial (SDB) activities in the three West African outbreak countries prevented from 1,411 to 10,452 secondary Ebola cases, according to an estimate from a Red Cross\u2013led research team, published yesterday in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. They based their findings on interviews with next of kin and community members who were involved with unsafe burials in six districts. They predicted that the SDBs may have reduced the epidemic by 4.9% to 36.5%. They concluded that the infections prevented were significant, but a greater impact could be achieved through early hospitalization of primary case-patients.\n&gt; \n&gt;* Fear, mistrust, protocol compliance, and lab problems were among the challenges in preparing and conducting a clinical trial in the field during the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, researchers reported yesterday in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. They described the experiences they had in conducting a phase 2 trial of the antiviral drug favipiravir. They emphasized the importance of collaboration between research teams, humanitarian medical groups, and local researchers, adding that though their observations are context-specific, they might be useful in future international medical emergencies.\n&gt; \n&gt;* Academic writers may need to take a more active role in communicating actionable items in their findings, according to researchers who compared Ebola information in the lay press with general review articles in the academic literature. Researchers based at the National Institutes of Health published their findings yesterday in PLoS One.

The Prime Minister inaugurated the site in the presence of the Minister of Public Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the Deputy Executive Director of Gavi, Ms. Anuradha Gupta, and the Deputy Representative of UNICEF in DRC, Dr. Tajudeen Oyewale.\n\nLocated in Kinkole, 40 kilometers from downtown Kinshasa, this modern warehouse is the largest ever built in Central Africa and the largest ever built in a Gavi-supported country. It will facilitate the storage of vaccines and strengthen the cold chain to make vaccines available throughout the country, particularly in the most remote and inaccessible health areas.\n\n\"Immunization is one of the best ways to save the lives of millions of children and allows the state and families to save on health costs. The modern Kinkole warehouse will enable the Democratic Republic of Congo to conduct quality immunization activities to control, eliminate and eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases, \"said the Minister of Public Health Dr Kinkole. Oly Ilunga Kalenga.\n\nThe construction of this warehouse was fully funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. It is part of a strategic partnership between the Government of the DRC, Gavi and UNICEF.\n\nMs. Anuradha Gupta, Deputy Executive Director of Gavi, emphasized that \"Immunization is the best investment we can make for children's health. It is also the keystone of access to primary health care. It is fundamental that all steps in the delivery of vaccines are respected so that all children, wherever they live, benefit. \"\n\nThis modern warehouse, whose work began in February 2016, is fully integrated into the country's innovative health system supply chain system for the distribution of vaccines, medicines and health products, and will facilitate also the introduction of new vaccines.\n\n\"The construction of this new warehouse will make it possible to stock better quantities of vaccines under the best conditions, thanks to the introduction of new vaccines, the continuous increase of the population and the need to reach all children and pregnant women living in the DRC, without exception, \"said UNICEF Deputy Representative in the DRC, Dr Tajudeen Oyewale.\n\nThis warehouse is composed of three parts; a part housing twelve cold rooms with a capacity of 5.760 m 3 for the storage of vaccines and thermolabile products; an administrative area of \u200b\u200b1300 m 2 with more than ten offices, two meeting rooms and dormitories; it also has a warehouse for dry inputs and medicines with a volume of 12,000 m 3 on an area of \u200b\u200b3,600 m\u00b2.\n\nThe Minister of Health thanked during the opening session of the warehouse, Gavi and UNICEF for the invaluable support given to the health system in general and to vaccination in particular. Strengthening the supply chain of the Expanded Program of Immunization as part of Gavi's funding also includes the construction of warehouses, the provision of trucks, vehicles, motorcycles, outboards, solar refrigerators and freezers .\n\nIn addition to the Kinkole warehouse, two more are under construction in Lubumbashi and Kisangani.\n_____\n\nFor further information, please contact :\nJessica Ilunga , Communication Manager, Ministry of Public Health  &lt;Phone &amp; Email redacted for privacy&gt;\nJames Fulker , Media Manager, Gavi, &lt;Phone &amp; Email redacted for privacy&gt;\nYves Willemot , Chief of Communication, UNICEF DRC, &lt;Phone &amp; Email redacted for privacy&gt;\n_____\n\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n \n(\n\n(\n", "Study: Ebola can not be contained even with 100% of Patients Traced and Hospitalized ", "NIH study finds no evidence of accelerated Ebola virus evolution in West Africa ", "Question about cases and deaths On the WHO website, it states that this outbreak has a 53% fatality rate.\n\nIs this actually true?

On the other hand, I reckon that unsafe burial ceremonies played a huge role in driving the exponential growth we saw in the earlier months, and the ceasing of such activities probably played a significant role in halting the exponential growth.\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections.

Many cases of Ebola virus disease are identified late, with many previous transits through unprepared health-care facilities, or are detected as community deaths. Most of the probable cases (death without laboratory confirmation) are not recorded. Research activities are following a parallel agenda, which often differs from timely intervention goals, with numerous data collections kept for exclusive scientific publications and to advance personal careers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Laboratory diagnosis is done at multiple sites by the Institut National de Recherches Biologiques. This achievement is tempered by an overconfidence in the capabilities of the laboratories, incomplete sharing of results with patient providers, low quality-control procedures, and unjustified fear of losing control. Rapid field molecular typing of the virus and bedside rapid diagnostic assays, both seen as a crucial support for the control of the 2014\u201316 west Africa outbreak, are not done to inform the response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Early in the outbreak, new therapeutics were made available first under a monitored emergency use of unregistered and investigational interventions (MEURI) protocol, then through a randomised controlled trial supported by the US National Institutes of Health, the Institut National de Recherches Biologiques, and the DRC Ministry of Health.3\n&gt; ,  4\n&gt; \n&gt; As of July 30, 2019, 682 patients were recruited under the MEURI and 621 patients under the randomised controlled trial protocol. Late admission of cases due to fear from the community or ineffective follow-up of contacts has complicated the use of therapeutics and vaccines and analyses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ring vaccination of contacts and contacts of contacts of confirmed Ebola cases using rVSV-ZEBOV was rapidly implemented. As of July 27, 2019, 178\u2008121 people have been vaccinated, 31\u2008016 of whom were frontline workers, the rest being contacts and contacts of contacts of Ebola cases.1\n&gt; \n&gt; The epidemiological data generated by the vaccination and the contact tracing teams are mostly not shared. As a result, daily field reports have noted at least 651 identified contacts of confirmed cases who were not vaccinated and became cases (among them 205 deaths) between Dec 31, 2018, and July 30, 2019. Vaccination coverage among health-care workers is high but incomplete.\n&gt; \n&gt; The initial response should be to generate, maintain, and constantly update the primary databases, then sharing them among all players. Parallel databases should not exist. Because of the field difficulties and the inadequate personnel resources, a single team staffed by the most experienced partners should oversee this task. During the autumn of 2014, a Conakry informal taskforce, consisting of one member from each main partner (Guinea Ministry of Health, WHO, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) met at least once a week, allowing real fact-based understanding and management of the Ebola situation. This approach needs to be replicated for this outbreak at each level.\n&gt; \n&gt; Laboratory support from national and external partners is needed and should provide timely support for clinical management of patients receiving experimental therapeutics or difficult epidemiological investigations, such as cases with multiple or unknown origins. As in the west African outbreak, point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests should be fielded, at least as an evaluation of community deaths.\n&gt; \n&gt; The existing vaccination strategy and implementation on the ground, should be drastically changed. A single combined team should follow and vaccinate contacts and contacts of contacts. This policy, combined with a rapid and complete inclusion of all high-risk contacts, should reduce, or at least improve the outcome of, secondary Ebola cases and affect the transmission curve.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if the infection prevention and control efforts have yielded some progress, the relatively large proportion of cases due to reuse of material (eg, syringes, needles, and perfusion tubes) is unacceptable. More emphasis on the multiple risks of this practice should be advertised among the care providers and the population.\n&gt; \n&gt; Helping the existing local health-care providers to regain the population's confidence is crucial. This should be done by introducing a comprehensive health system with actions that encompass the health-related problems encountered daily by the population\u2014eg, malaria, vaccine-preventable diseases, childbirth, and quality of care.\n&gt; Together with the presence of violence and insecurity, Ebola virus disease has a real chance of becoming endemic in this part of DRC. Only multiple and immediate changes, starting within the leadership and coordination of all the partners involved through inclusive, flexible, and unified response efforts, will be able to reverse the trend.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I declare no competing interests. \n&gt; \n&gt;#### References\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.

Thus, suspect cases with positive laboratory tests will be added to the confirmed category, while negative ones (non-cases) will be removed from the table.\n\nThe category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation. The investigations will determine whether these deaths are related to the epidemic or not. \n\n**News of the response**\n\nExactly one week after the declaration of the epidemic, vaccination could begin in North Kivu. On Wednesday, August 8, 2018, the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, visited the health area of \u200b\u200bMangina, the epicenter of the epidemic, located about 30 km from the city of Beni, in the province of North Kivu, to launch vaccination activities.\n\nThe provincial Minister of Health and the provincial coordinator of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) were the first two volunteers to be vaccinated. For the provincial Minister of Health, Dr. Martial Kambumbu Kayenga, this symbolic gesture was very important to reassure the inhabitants of this locality who had come in large numbers to attend the launching ceremony.\n\nOn the list of people to be vaccinated today were front-line health professionals from the Mangina Reference Health Center who had been in contact with confirmed cases and identified first contacts.\n\nImmunization activities were initiated by Congolese EPI vaccinators who had been trained by Guinean vaccinators during the previous outbreak in Equateur Province. However, several teams of Guinean experts will return to the Democratic Republic of Congo to provide support to local experts.\n\nThis is the second vaccination in response to an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo this year. The first belt vaccination campaign took place in Equateur province from May to June 2018. A total of 3,481 people were vaccinated and none of them developed the Ebola virus. \n\n\n**5 QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VACCINE AGAINST EBOLA**\n\n*1. Does the vaccine contain the Ebola virus?*\n\n* NO , the vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as VSV (Vesicular Stomatitis Virus) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain live Ebola virus and therefore it can not cause the disease.\n\n*2. What method will be used to administer the vaccine? Who will receive the vaccine?*\n\n* Belt vaccination is the recommended management strategy . The at-risk individuals selected to receive the vaccine in the Democratic Republic of Congo are:\n(i) Health professionals who are directly exposed to the confirmed case of Ebola in the affected health areas;\n(ii) People who have been in contact with confirmed cases of Ebola;\n(iii) Contacts of these contacts.\nAfter receiving the vaccine, all these people will be followed up for a specified period of up to 3 months.\n\n*3. Who authorized the use of the Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of Congo?*\n\n* In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the use of the Ebola vaccine has been authorized by the Department of Pharmacy and Drug and the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health of the University of Kinshasa. The vaccination protocol had been sent to the Ethics Committee for review by the Ministry of Health and WHO. The Ethics Committee estimated in a decision of 7 August 2018 that all conditions were met to use the Ebola vaccine as part of the response to the current outbreak.\n\n*4. Do you have to be vaccinated if you are identified as a confirmed case of Ebola?*\n\n* NO, participation in compassionate use of the Ebola vaccine is completely free and voluntary. Each eligible person may decide to participate or not and may withdraw at any time. Their consent must be informed. Their rights will be respected. Regardless of whether the eligible person chooses to participate or not, it will have no impact on their access to health services.\n\n*5. What are the possible side effects?*\n\n* Like any other vaccine introduced into the body, the Ebola vaccine can cause some minor side effects . These side effects include mild fever or cold symptoms, joint pain and sores in the arm. In the previous ring vaccination in Sierra Leone, no serious adverse events were reported. However, a follow-up of the vaccinated persons is necessary to ensure that they are well. As a follow-up, they will receive a home visit to check their health six times - days 3, 14, 21, 42, 63 and 84 after vaccination. \n\t\n(\n\n(", "Interview that Changes Everything: Nurse on staff at Dallas Hospital Speaks Out ", "Is Liberia trying to spin the Ebola numbers?

(There was a press report of this happening already: an aid-group official stuck in Morocco for over a day.)\n* aid workers and aid do not travel in a bunch.  Chartering flights would not be at all cost effective.\n* Cutting off trade would hurt the local economies more, and the local people have to be able to eat.

Do you now expand the travel ban to include Spain?\"\n* \"People determined to evade travel restrictions, particularly family members, would find ways to do so.

First, before you downvote, please at least read the whole thing. Let me start by saying, I know we are all sick and tired of the airborne or not airborne debate, I think we have all seen our fair share of those posts.\n\nSo I was looking around and found this: \n\n(\n\n&gt;Procedures that ***might generate aerosols***, such as ( should be avoided unless necessary for patient care...\n\n\nSo, in this instance the CDC acknowledges that THIS strain of Ebola virus disease *might* generate aerosols. That in itself is pretty big news, seeing as most outlets and the CDC only refer to:\n\n* a sick person's blood or body fluids (urine, saliva, feces, vomit, and semen)\n* objects (such as needles) that have been contaminated with infected body fluids\n* infected animals\n\nNow take all of this and remember it for a moment. \n\nYesterday /u/SarahC ( looked like it was modeled after a Norovirus documentation.\n\n(\n\nI have also seen some documents from the CDC saying to handled blood clean up as if it were Norovirus. (cannot find the link now! I will edit it in when found) So if we take that EVD acts like a Norovirus (it might not survive as long outside of the body as a Norovirus), then vomiting can generate aerosols. \n\n &gt;Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person and indirectly via contaminated water and food. They are extremely contagious, and fewer than twenty virus particles can cause an infection (some research suggests as few as five). **Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit**, and can be aerosolized by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; **infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up.** \n\nThere was a study about it:\n\n&gt;Vomiting, in particular, transmits infection effectively, and appears to allow airborne transmission**. In one incident, a person who vomited spread infection right across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit. 126 people were dining at six tables in December 1998; **one woman vomited onto the floor.** Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; **52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea.** The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: **more than 90% of the people at the same table as the sick woman later reported becoming ill.** There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick woman. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table on the other side of the restaurant, the attack rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.\n\n( \n\n\nSo we now have proof of vomit causing particles to aerosolized. If it can float 10 feet and then get  someone sick, ~~it does not matter if we are talking influenza style airborne, it IS airborne.~~ **This shows that if vomiting can produce an aerosol, it most cerintly can produce droplets that can move up to a meter or two through the air. (This does not mean airborne lingering around for hours)\n\nNow, there are scales of bad, the worst being lingering in the air for long periods of time like influenza, but as the vomiting and getting 52 people sick shows, that alone can be bad enough. It took 3 days for all of them to show signs, which means one of those 52 could be out somewhere else, throw up and get another 52 or 152 people sick... That is the implication. Norovirus affects 20 million in the US every year. Imagine if 80% of those died. It also kills 200,000 per year worldwide. That is the sort of thing we are talking about. It could be very very bad.\n\n~~**Speculation part**~~\n\n~~Which leads me to wonder WHY they are not telling these healthcare workers to wear Air Purifying Respirators!? The more times EVD transmits via aerosolized droplets from vomit, the more likely **( is to kick in and push this toward a strain that can last a little longer in the air.~~\n\n\n###EDIT:\n\nHere is the part where the CDC compares EVD to a norovirus:\n\n\n&gt;*How can I determine whether a particular EPA-registered hospital disinfectant is appropriate for use in the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus infection?*\n\n&gt; * Begin by looking at the product label or product insert or, if these are not available, search the EPA search engine for this information. Users should be aware that an 'enveloped' or 'non-enveloped virus' designation may not be included on the container label. Instead check the disinfectant's label for at least one of the common non-enveloped viruses (e.g., **norovirus**, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus).\n\n&gt;*How should spills of blood or other body substances be managed?*\n\n&gt; * An EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with label claims for non-enveloped viruses (e.g., **norovirus**, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus) and instructions for cleaning and decontaminating surfaces or objects soiled with blood or body fluids should be used according to those instructions.\n\n(\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMaybe I got my terminology mixed up, **I never meant to imply that airborne\" meant hanging in the air for long periods of time and getting you sick, I meant traveling through the air in droplets, which is different I suppose. What  I am trying to get across is that being in close proximity to someone who is vomiting can most likely get you infected if  you are withing 1 - 2 meters. \n\n&gt;The droplet nuclei and the air that surrounds them are correctly referred to as an aerosol, but so are lots of other things and this is where confusion grows. The term aerosol is used to refer to any collection of particles suspended in air, and particle sizes vary enormously. Spray paint from a can is produced in droplets a few hundred microns in diameter so as to quickly coat the intended surface rather than undesirably linger in the air. A can of fly spray on the other hand produces smaller droplets, because that aerosol should stay suspended for long enough to make contact with insects. \u2018Aerosol\u2019 is a confusing term, and its varied usage does not help when discussing risk of EBOV infection.\n\n&gt;The simplest definition for public understanding of infection risk is to use \u201cairborne\u201d to refer only to the droplet nuclei component.\n\n(\n\n(\n\nSo, if vomiting can cause aerosolization, which is the last step in terms of the EVD leaving the host and moving through the air, I would say it is safe to assume that we also get droplets from vomit. If you are within a few meters of someone throwing up I would say it is safe to be worried. Here is the real question: If someone with Ebola was throwing up 3 - 6 feet away from you, would you feel safe dressed as you are now, or would you want some sort of mask to protect against possible contraction of EVD?

And it appears that the fatality rate is actually getting higher, not lower. We should be far better off this time since we have a vaccine. Unfortunately, the data then is in far lower resolution than now, so it is difficult to compare. That curve shows no song of declining, it is probably related to the fighting that goes on in the area. The mortality rate seems to be holding steady, judging by eye. Are the dips in cumulative case counts due to corrections? I wonder if it can evolve. If Ebola became more contagious, that would be bad. It is already very lethal.

Below is a chart showing stages of the two outbreaks but they done represent trend as each outbreak has it is own characteristics.  Drawing a comparisons between the two does not provide a clear contrast.  Here is why.  \n\nThe west African outbreak (WAob) began in December of 2013 with the infection and death of a two year old boy.  By March 2014 when declared an outbreak it had spread into neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone, well on it is way to spreading across all three nations. At that time there was only one known treatment and it was not supported by the world medical organizations due to possible complications it could bring.  It took a considerable amount of time to develop the protocols now being used.  Longer for vaccine development. \n\nIn the North Kivu outbreak effective treatment protocols were put in place immediately and rVSV-ZEBOV vaccinations began 01 September 2018. Less than two (2) weeks after the outbreak was declared. As of 06 May 2019, more than 112,000 people have been vaccinated. \n\nComplicating the defeat of the outbreak are several factors. The remote nature of the outbreaks location, the populations general distrust of government, ritual traditions and reliance on shamanistic medical practices and dozens of armed militias warring in the region. \n\nThe outbreak will continue through 2019 well into 2020, possibly longer, but it will be brought under control, contained and extinguished.  No other outcome is acceptable.  DRC's Ministry of Health knows this and each time a problem presents, they address as best they can, recoup and continue onward.  As stated before, what we are witnessing in DRC is world class crisis management. \n\n|**Outbreak**|**status**|**date**|**cases**|**deaths**|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|**WAob**|Declared|23MAR14|49|29|\n|**WAob**|@ 8 Months|23NOV14|15933|5688|\n|**WAob**|End of OB|10JAN16|28141|11289|\n||||||\n|**DRC-NKivu**|Declared|04AUG18|43|33|\n|**DRC-NKivu**|@ 8 Months|04APR19|1107|695|\n|**DRC-NKivu**|End of OB|projected as being in 2020|unknown|unknown| Yep Mostly due to corrections but also some zombies  This *'spike'* analysis underscored by ( with probable cases increasing from 66 to 88 (first noteworthy increase since the end of February).  \n\nHowever, as can be confirmed by reflecting on predictions made in 2014, speculation on the unknown is often a ill-advised endeavor, leading to erroneous deductions and communication of misleading information^*.  As seen when the WHO convened to determine whether the DRC North Kivu, Ituri outbreak manifested an international crisis. Many thought the WHO would issue the declaration but failed to grasp, for it to be an international crisis required more than one country be involved. \n\nCaution against speculation is additionally supported by the fact of the four border areas (Lubero, Masereka, Mutwanga &amp; Tchomia) only two (Lubero &amp; Masereka) are, *\"areas with notifications to (in) the last 7 days'*, (zones ayant des notifications au curs des 7 derniers jour).

The impact of Ebola on one of our closest relatives. An evaluation of the interaction between Western Gorillas and Ebola Virus\n\nEbola Virus is a severe viral haemorrhagic disease that causes acute illness and, most commonly, death in infected individuals due to hypovolaemic shock. Humans and other primate species readily express clinical signs and it is thus unsurprising that human outbreaks have almost always been linked to increased ape mortalities and handling of infected carcasses (Leroy et al., 2004).  The mortality rate of Ebola virus in Western Gorillas is alarmingly high at 95% (Ebola Virus &amp; Western Gorillas, n.d.), even higher than that observed in humans.\n \nSince the first documented outbreak of Ebola Virus in 1976 and the subsequent discovery of an association to disease outbreaks in nearby ape populations there has been dispute over the primary means of disease dissemination through the Western Gorilla population. While it is likely a factor of both there are two main hypotheses to which researchers credit the devastating effects of Ebola Virus on Western Gorilla numbers. One states that gorillas are infected by exposure to an unknown host that is capable of carrying the virus with minimal to moderate disease expression. The other hypothesis proposes that disease outbreaks result from direct contact between an infected and susceptible gorilla (Vogel, 2006). While multiple studies have illustrated support for the theory that the interaction of Western gorillas with one or many reservoir hosts is the defining factor in outbreak severity (Leroy et al., 2005; Rouquet et al., 2005), the emerging evidence appears to indicate that the latter means of disease transmission is the more significant agent in Western Gorilla decimation (Bermejo et al., 2006). It has been difficult to elucidate this definitively however due to many facets of the disease process in Western Gorillas still remaining unknown. \n\nOne of the major areas of uncertainty that still revolves around Ebola Virus the identification of a certified reservoir host, evidence that the virus is capable of replicating and reaching high viral titres in fruit bats has been presented. These same studies also indicate that fruit bats may shed the virus via both respiratory and faecal-oral routes thus providing mechanisms of transmission to not only other individuals in the bat roost but to other animal species (Swanepoel et al., 1996). Further evidence for the fruit bat origin of Ebola Virus outbreaks in Western Gorillas can be observed in the epidemiological studies of earlier human outbreaks in 1976 and 1979 in which the index and primary cases were all found to be workers at a cotton factory heavily infested with Tadarida trevori fruit bats (WHO International Study Team, 1978; Baron et al., 1983). It would appear, given that the assumption of a fruit bat reservoir is correct, that disease transmission between Western Gorillas and fruit bats occurs most readily in times when contact between the two species is maximised, such as when competition for fruit resources is high. It is thus unsurprising that nearly every documented Ebola Virus outbreak in Western Gorillas has been preceded by a dry season (Leroy et al., 2005). It is this evidence coupled with the brief 3-4 day period in which a carcass remains infective (Leroy and Rollin, unpublished data) and the rarity of contact between gorillas of different social groups that some conservational researchers use to refute the proposal of ape-ape transmission as the primary source of Western Gorilla Ebola outbreaks.\n\nDespite the aforementioned strong evidence for the contrary, a consensus of agreement among Western Gorilla researchers appears to be emerging. Studies are appearing to corroborate that ape-ape transmission of Ebola is key to the World Conservation Union\u2019s estimate of a 60% decline in Western Gorilla populations in the last 20-25 years (Vogel, 2006). Research carried out in Lossi Sanctuary in Northwest Republic of Congo on seven distinct social groups comprising of 95 individuals witnessed a 95.8% mortality rate from October 2003 to January 2004. This study observed a progressive spread of Ebola from north to south within the sanctuary. Interestingly enough it was later found that the number of deaths within a social group could be predicted by the number of home ranges that separated that social group from the first group to be infected. This pattern of a wave-like ape-ape spread of the disease was further verified by data that indicated that social groups with adjacent home ranges had a time lag of infection that was very similar to the typical incubation period of Ebola Virus. Using comparisons of gorilla densities to areas of the sanctuary that had not been affected by Ebola virus the estimated death toll of this outbreak was about 5000 Western Gorillas (Bermejo et al., 2006). Additionally, genetic analyses of successive Ebola outbreaks have determined them to be epidemiologically linked, such that new outbreaks in previously Ebola free forests have been found to be ancestrally derived from nearby outbreak sites (Walsh et al., 2005). This supports the hypothesis of a wave-like spread of disease, as opposed to resident strains existing in reservoir species prior to the outbreak. Currently this front of Ebola virus spread is estimated to be progressing at a rate of 50km a year throughout Western Equatorial Africa; home to 80% of the world\u2019s gorillas. After the study carried out at Lossi Sanctuary researchers predicted that the epidemic appeared to be heading in the direction of Odzala National Park (Walsh et al., 2003), home of the highest recorded gorilla densities in the world. By 2005 the population of Western Gorillas in Odzala National Park had been devastated.\n\nWhile contact between individual gorillas and with reservoir hosts likely both play a part in the emergence of Ebola Virus as a serious threat to the feasibility of Western Gorilla populations, there still remain many unanswered questions in regards to comprehending the complex interactions between Western Gorillas and this deadly disease. Whether it can be halted by a concentrated vaccine campaign given the complications of safe and effective administration to wild animals is the focus of current research. Further attempts at slowing the spread using natural barriers such as rivers is a potential approach but is complicated by the high mobility of fruit bats as the potential reservoir hosts (Rizkalla et al., 2007). However, it should not be considered unachievable given the relative predictability of spread outlined in epidemiologic studies (Walsh et al., 2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\uf0a7\tBaron, R.C., McCormick, J.B., &amp; Zubeir, O.A.

Ebola needs to 'burn out' in the affected countries. To disambiguate: affected can loosely be defined as &gt; 50 know cases.\n\n* Station armed troops on the borders of affected countries to prevent spread by land travel which will be attempted after step 1 is put into action. Loudhailers transmitting a message in the local dialect should be used to inform people of what will happen should they attempt to leave the quarantined area... a shoot to kill policy. It will not come to that should these messages be heard and understood.\n\n* Devote current and future funding to regular and fairly spaced aid air drops in the affected countries. This needs further thought as localizing people will hasten the spread.\n\n* Cease the sending and reclaiming of medical aid workers to the affected countries. Set up quarantine areas where current medical staff need to wait out 50 days without infection before returning to their home countries.\n\n* Use the volunteers above that would have been sent into these countries to form a number of small, fully kitted out teams (level 3 PPE) with the sole purpose of handling one off cases outside of the affected countries. These teams should be stationed appropriately geographically. It is becoming evident that the virus is transmitted most easily at the point of near death, death or after death of an infected person. Domestic health care workers should not get involved past the point of isolating the patient and calling for the assistance of one of these teams.\n\n* RAPIDLY educate medical staff worldwide of the situation at hand and which patients should be kept in isolation until cleared. I spoke to my doctor (UK - who I consider intelligent) about this and she told me that we would all be OK in first world countries because we have soap.\n\nEbola is like a fire spreading in West Africa. The infected are like matches that are lit from the wrong end. Upon death they are likely to ignite other matches. Health care worker matches are being returned to their home countries just in time for their ignition ends to flare up infecting other health care worker matches in these countries. The fire can also still transmit before the end of the match is reached.\n\nFirst world countries MIGHT have a chance at containing and eradicating these initial outbreaks but third world countries with high population densities will not. More fires will start in these countries, increasing the probability of initial outbreaks in others. The teams outlined above will not be able to handle too many of these and if their occurrence becomes too frequent, this will lead to a global pandemic.\n\nAssumptions that should not be made (you know what they say about assumptions):\n \n* R0 is &lt; 1 for Ebola in most countries. \n* A cure or vaccination will present itself in time.\n\nIn a personal capacity, staying at home and avoiding contact might work to prevent personal infection for a while, but human interaction is the lubricant of the economy and without it the system begins to break down.\n\nThis message, although it may, is not intended to instill fear.

Ebola moves slowly and incapacitates its victims.\n\n* **Quarantine works.**\n\nEven if Ebola becomes airborne, quarantine of a few kilometers would keep it at bay. America at least is full of people with guns that can hit people a few hundred yards away, and they will use them. This means it is easy to erect a perimeter around any area to keep infection out.\n\n* **Current conditions are anomalous in Liberia.**\n\nThe disaster we are seeing unfold is happening in a country with no infrastructure or social order to speak of (sorry). The doctors who are getting infected are doing so because of this disorder in which there is not enough protected gear or staff to keep patients under control.\n\nSo... cheer up, do not panic.

I am pretty sure health authorities in West Africa have no way to monitor that many people already, and if we hit 10k cases per week (as WHO says we may), any manually-run contact tracing system will be entirely overwhelmed.\n\nWhat if you could give wristbands to everyone who was potentially exposed that could monitor their body temperatures?  If a fever is detected, the wristband will start broadcasting its GPS signal, and health officials can pick that person up the same day they start showing a fever.  If everyone who was exposed is picked up the same day they start showing a fever, the transmission rate will be greatly reduced because fever is one of the first symptoms, occurring before the patient starts shedding the virus in large quantities.  It also gives the greatest chance of a cure because the patient will start receiving care early.  Health officials cannot possibly follow up this many contacts, but machines can keep track of those numbers and send alerts when needed.   \n\n The wristbands would need the following features:\n1. Able to reliably determine if wearer has a fever\n2. Cheap\n3. Robust - waterproof and resistant to being dropped, etc.\n4. Not need a battery change for 6 months-1 year of operation\n5. Comfortable to wear\n6. Also be a watch or something useful so that people will actually wear it \n\nI would be happy to help out in building devices like this on the software end, but I have little idea of how to put together hardware.  I am putting this idea out there in hopes that someone who does can pick it up.  This project would be necessarily short-term since, hopefully, there will not be a need for it in a few months because they will have gotten the outbreak under control.  \n\nA few things that need to be considered: 1. Is this actually needed?  Seems useful to me, but perhaps contact tracing has already been abandoned since they do not have enough beds to treat everyone who comes to the hospitals anyway. 2. Can this be produced in large enough quantities fast enough to matter?  3.  Can fever reliably be determined by a thermometer on the wrist? 4. Funding? 5. It is creepy to be tracked like this so maybe people would refuse to wear the wristbands.  \n\nFor 1 and 2 above, if someone who knows can comment, that would be amazing.  For 3, we can maybe develop a technique where the device spends its first day getting a baseline set of readings and then will detect a change from baseline rather than measuring temperature directly, or the band could go around the upper thigh rather than the wrist--that would also address the issue of whether people would want to be seen wearing something like this, since it may advertise that they could be infected.  For 4, I think we can kick start it or maybe get funding from big charities.  We would give them away for free until we run out of money, and then sell them at cost. For 5, not sure, anybody have a sense of whether people in West Africa who would been exposed would be willing to wear a wristband like this? \n\nThoughts anyone?

Such a charity would not need to put any boots on the ground in any of the affected countries. No risk to their workers. All they would need to do is accept donations, query the hospitals and clinics by phone for supply levels, buy supplies in bulk, and ship the supplies to the hospitals and clinics. All of that could be done remotely, without going anywhere near west africa.\nWhy is not that happening?

Either similar rate to 51/day or smaller for all earlier periods.\n\n**Notes:** \n\n* All affected countries are included in the totals for reported cases and deaths. These are only the reported confirmed/probable/suspected cases. In addition, the reported deaths exclude at least 3000 known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth. On the other hand, I reckon that unsafe burial ceremonies played a huge role in driving the exponential growth we saw in the earlier months, and the ceasing of such activities probably played a significant role in halting the exponential growth.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* Liberia reported what was *likely* the first confirmed case of Ebola transmitting sexually from an Ebola survivor. A foreign doctor was diagnosed with Ebola within his eyes long after he was cleared. Regardless, outbreak may end before any prospective Ebola treatments can undergo a sufficiently sized efficacy study.\n\n* Sierra Leone's confirmed caseload is surging. I will continue to only report confirmed cases, and so this 4-day period has reported more confirmed cases then at any period since I began ignoring suspected/probable cases.

Earth is our place to live, the one place we share.  It is pretty amazing.\n\nToday human civilization is greater than it has ever been.  We have more people, more knowledge, trade, and progress than ever before.  For hundreds of years human life has gotten better, overall.  Yes, we have strife, and we have issues to tackle, but together we can and we will tackle them.  We face climate and ocean changes, crises in food, water and energy, our inequity, corruption and wars.  These are all things humans, with concerted effort, can solve together.\n\nBut now we have something different.  We have Ebola.  This is far more immediate, and far more threatening to our interconnected civilization than humans have experienced.  All other threats we face resolve when human actions change.  Ebola multiplies and lives now within humans, and it kills us. We have become prey on our own planet.\n\nThe last few months have shown a repeating response pattern: every step governments and health leaders take has been too late, too little.  It is well understood.  Human actions are late when compared with exponential growth, time factors that are very hard for the human mind to grasp.  We are in month ten of this outbreak. This delayed, ineffective response pattern continues even today.  Our hopes for containment of Ebola in West Africa are over.  While we still need to stop the disease there, we will not contain it.  Human civilization is facing a raging, uncontrolled pandemic that will break out across the globe in the next three-to-six months.  This coming global Ebola pandemic is no longer debatable as to whether it will happen, it is only a question of when, and how humanity will deal with it.  The continuation and success of current human civilization depends critically on what happens in the next few months.\n\nEvery country, every people on the planet need to become quickly educated about all aspects of this disease, the risks and how it keeps spreading.  We need overwhelming support for public health initiatives to slow and stop the disease spread everywhere it remains.  We need redoubled efforts for a vaccine. The disease in its current form will not bring down civilization, but the fear and disruption to global systems surely will without immediate and global preventative action.  These actions are not happening yet.\n\nNo nation, no political leader, no international or funding agency has yet treated the Ebola threat with the urgency it deserves.  We need to treat this like a fire burning in the living room of human civilization.  Quite simply, nations cannot act quickly.  Ebola does.  We have no reliable disease models that predict how Ebola will spread.  We have no social dynamic predictions to assess how broad and how disruptive the social chaos will become.\n\nPeople of Earth: take more action now.    Our future depends on it.\n\n\nReleased under (  October 10, 2014\n\n\n", "Adult Service For Sex!

It provides a rationale for volunteer basis, increased hazard pay, and quarantine of primary care providers of ebola patients. \n\n1. Care providers for ebola patients are at greatest risk of infection. The risk of an ebola patient treated in a hospital infecting others is **nonzero**.\n\n2. (\n\n3. Ebola is a highly deadly disease and as such, is a **controlled substance**. Simply put, citizens are not allowed access to these substances. If an ordinary citizen had a vial of ebola, it would be confiscated (at the very least). They would not be able to travel with it, (or take it bowling).\n\n4. Assuming probability of infection of primary care workers is 0.12, and that risk is equally distributed among 10 primary care workers per patient. There is a (0.12 x 100%) / 10 workers = **1.2% chance of each team member being infected**. \n\n5. Assume a chance of death at 0.3 per infected primary care worker, due to early and enhanced care, and being from a healthy population. Each primary care worker is at 1.2% x 0.3=**0.36% risk of death from ebola**. This is the basis of hazard pay.  \n\n6. Because individuals with patient contact are at infinitely (nearly) greater risk than the general population. As such, **different rules should apply** to them. \n\nConclusion: Individuals with direct patient contact should not be allowed to transport the disease, because it is a deadly substance. They should be quarantined until they are cleared of disease. It is anticipated that this quarantine will allow for early treatment, should signs of infection occur, increasing survival rates. They should receive hazard pay, and be recruited at a volunteer basis. \n\n*Edited a word &amp; then math &amp; logic.

The baby was born in Guinea and had no symptoms of Ebola virus 20 days after her birth.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The baby was diagnosed immediately after birth, and doctors treated her with a novel combination of three treatments: monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor, and a broad-spectrum antiviral.\n&gt; \n&gt; Five days before her birth, that baby's mother was diagnosed with Ebola and treated with favipiravir, an antiviral. The infant was born at 35-36 weeks gestation and appeared healthy, but suffered intermittent fevers through day 10. ZMapp was infused on days 2, 5, and 8 and the baby had reduced viral loads. On day 11 the baby got a buffy coat transfusion to boost her immune response to ZMapp. On Day 19, the broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 was administered (the first time it was used in a pediatric patient). By day 20 blood tests were negative for Ebola, and the baby went home on day 33.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pregnant woman and neonates suffered the highest mortality rates during the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, with 70% of pregnant women perishing from the disease and nearly 100% of Ebola-affected pregnancies ending in miscarriage of stillbirth.\n&gt; \n&gt; The authors concluded their report by suggesting a variety of factors may have helped saved the baby's life. \"Viral transmission might have occurred late in the pregnancy and been limited during the brief labor and delivery, resulting in the neonate having a low viral load at birth.

A team led by researchers from Sierra Leone and Public Health England reported its findings yesterday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.\n&gt; \n&gt; After validating the test in survivors from Kerry Town Ebola treatment center and in controls from unaffected communities, the investigators tested household contacts of survivors. Results showed that the test was highly specific (100%) and highly sensitive (95.9%) in survivors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of 481 household contacts, 47.6% had high-level exposure such as contact with a corpse or contact with the body fluids of a sick patient. The researchers also found that 12% of them had some symptoms during the outbreak but were never diagnosed as having Ebola.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Ebola-affected households, testing revealed asymptomatic infections in 2.3% of people and missed infections in 2.6%, suggesting that the levels of asymptomatic or missed illnesses are low.\n&gt; \n&gt; The team concluded that asymptomatic infections do not seem to be a major contributor to herd immunity and that the noninvasive and easy-to-use test might be helpful for future investigations.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a related commentary in the same issue, two researchers from the NIAID and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases said the findings of the carefully conducted, well-controlled study cast doubt on earlier serosurveys from the 1980s and 1990s that implied high seroprevalence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though a single study does not settle the subclinical infection issue definitively, it does show that such illnesses are not typical or widespread, the authors wrote. They added that the new swab-based test could be used to confirm or refute the earlier seroprevalence estimates.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feb 27 Lancet Infect Dis (\n&gt;\n&gt; Feb 27 Lancet Infect Dis (", "MGH has patient under investigation for possible Ebola ", "Ebola Situation Report - 12 August 2015 ", " Ebola in children: survival rates and immune system response.

And those patients tend to have a lot\n&gt; of inflammation, and it is very similar to patients who have a severe inflammatory disorder that\n&gt; has a really long and complicated name called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. We just call\n&gt; that HLH for short. And HLH is sort of inflammation gone wild.\n&gt;\n&gt; But inflammation is really an important part of the body\u2019s function. It is how your body\n&gt; recognizes infections. It tells you you have been infected, and that inflammation is immune cells\n&gt; and other immune factors that get sent to a site of infection. That is why when you have a cold,\n&gt; you might have swollen lymph nodes or a runny nose or nasal congestion. These are just\n&gt; symptoms that you experience as your body\u2019s fighting off infection. And that is good, right?\n&gt; That is a natural inflammatory process.\n&gt; \n&gt; But sometimes, the inflammation is a lot more than it should be, and that is when your body\n&gt; overreacts to an infection, or maybe your immune system just is not working correctly. And this\n&gt; can trigger a really dangerous type of inflammation that can be excessive. And we noticed that\n&gt; patients who have severe or fatal Ebola virus disease have some kind of clinical and laboratory\n&gt; similarities to patients with a severe inflammatory disease, like HLH. So, the whole reason to do\n&gt; the study was to try and understand if Ebola was triggering an inflammatory disease, and which\n&gt; types of inflammation were active during the Ebola infection.\n&gt; \n\nReference: \n\n* (\n\n______\n\nDr. McElroy's research will not lead to finding a *'cure'* for EVD, but to aid treating those who become infected and increase chances of survival.  \n\nAs is normal when we face with a problem, people not directly related to the problem find a point of commonality between the it and their area of expertise.

They added that real-time sequencing and rapid data sharing does not replace boots-on-the-ground case finding and contact tracing, but in setting such as West Africa where resources are limited, such measures can help speed the response by telling responders where to place contact tracers, treatment beds, quarantine, and other infection control measures.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Shifts in genetic response to infection**\n&gt; \n&gt; An unprecedented genetic analysis of blood samples taken daily after an Ebola patient was hospitalized revealed changes in antiviral and immune response at key points in disease progression, researchers reported Apr 12 in Science Translational Medicine.\n&gt; \n&gt; The patient was admitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center isolation unit on day 7 of infection for a 26-day hospitalization.\n&gt; \n&gt; He or she received supportive care, but no experimental treatments. The researchers' study goal was to explore how gene expression changes, including those linked to blood clotting problems and organ dysfunction, correlated with the patient's clinical condition.\n&gt; \n&gt; A marked decline in antiviral responses correlated with virus clearance from white blood cells, and host responses shifted rapidly from gene activation in cell damage and inflammation toward those that promote cellular and organ repair.

NIOSH requirements as shown on CDC website ( \n\n\u201cThe current NIOSH definition for an IDLH condition, as given in the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, is one that poses a threat of exposure to airborne contaminants when that exposure is likely to cause death or immediate or delayed permanent adverse health effects or prevent escape from such an environment . The purpose of establishing an IDLH value is (1) to ensure that the worker can escape from a given contaminated environment in the event of failure of the respiratory protection equipment and (2) is considered a maximum level above which only a highly reliable breathing apparatus providing maximum worker protection is permitted . In establishing the IDLH value, the following conditions must be assured:\nA. The ability to escape without loss of life or immediate or delayed irreversible health effects. (Thirty minutes is considered the maximum time for escape so as to provide some margin of safety in calculating an IDLH value.)\nB. The prevention of severe eye or respiratory irritation or other reactions that would hinder escape.\nThe NIOSH respirator decision logic uses an IDLH value as one of several respirator selection criteria. Under the NIOSH respirator decision logic, \"highly reliable\" respirators (i.e., the most protective respirators) would be selected for emergency situations, fire fighting, exposure to carcinogens, entry into oxygen-deficient atmospheres, entry into atmospheres that contain a substance at a concentration greater than 2,000 times the NIOSH REL or OSHA PEL, and for entry into immediately dangerous to life or health conditions. These \"highly reliable\" respirators include either a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) that has a full facepiece and is operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode, or a supplied-air respirator that has a full facepiece and is operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode in combination with an auxiliary SCBA operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode. \u201c\n\nA failure event of a PPE suit used by the medical staff in the Ebola Hospitals would clearly not allow safe exit and the environment of such a hospital is obviously dangerous to life.

The three primary countries will be ravaged, but there will be a global imperative to keep them going as functional states (it may become tyrannical in those countries for a while).  We have individuals living in the U.S. who make more than those entire countries, so between military personal and other measures, we can keep Liberia, Guinean and Sierra Leon from collapsing.  Meanwhile, pockets and clusters will spring up in other countries; but remember, even if a cluster runs rampant (which there is zero chance of in this new, more cautious, climate \u2013 people and governments have changed their behavior), it would take about six months for each pocket to hit several thousand people.  \n    Six months from now will be mid-April, and while there may be as many as four million cases (and lots of panic), those cases will not be persisting all at once.  Many will have died (other\u2019s will have healed and be valuable aid workers as we are already observing).  99.9% of these deaths will be in Africa which of course dose not lessen the tragedy, but this is only double the number that die there every year from infectious disease (it is also 0.4% of the continent\u2019s population), so it is hardly the end times.  We should note that ebola is in fact as hard to catch as has been said all along.  There seems to be few if any infected from our western cases.   \n    And then the **vaccines** start to come.  There are tons of companies working on these and even if some fail, others will be capable of churning out over a hundred million doses once they get going (and then more if necessary).  I am aware of the timelines: testing is starting now for some and later for others.  Six months is generally a worse-case scenario for when the big loads of vaccine start to come \u2013 other medicines will start to help a little bit before that time.  It will take a couple months to administer and inoculate the most essential demographic, but ebola will quickly be on the wane.

Either similar rate to 51/day or smaller for all earlier periods.\n\n**Notes:** \n\n* All affected countries are included in the totals for reported cases and deaths. These are only the reported confirmed/probable/suspected cases. In addition, the reported deaths exclude at least 3000 known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth.\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks, requiring at most 5 days to eclipse the largest outbreaks of the past. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* From the more extensive list of reported occupied beds in Sierra Leone, there appears to be fragmented but suggestive evidence that fewer beds are being used, which backs up the declining reported case rate in the country.\n\n**Forecast:**\n\n* Estimate of ~85 cases per day for the next 4 day period from figures released so far. Sierra Leone continues to report a decline, and Guinea reports comparatively very few cases. So far it looks like Liberia might be reporting another super-100 4-day period, which is supported by a modest increase in occupancy. **However**, Liberia is also reporting very, very, few positive test results and very few new confirmed cases. I am not at all convinced that this recent increase being reported out of Liberia is at all concerning or perhaps even real, until more convincing data comes out.", "WHO concerned as one Ebola case confirmed in urban area of Democratic Republic of the Congo | 17MAY18   What was the largest city involved the last time around?

Even though DRC and RoC lands both stretch to the Atlantic, neither have a ports on the coast.  The closest one to the area is the port of Soyo in the northwestern corner of Angola at the mouth of the Congo river. \n\n * The close proximity of capital cities of Brazzavile (RoC) and Kinshasa (DRC).

Just to be clear, though, Pham, Vinson, and Romero Ramos were infected in hospitals in the US and Spain where they treated individuals who later died of the disease, while the others were infected in west Africa.\n\nThe disease is clearly highly contagious in its final stages, but it is also clearly not particularly contagious early on - there was quite a bit of fuss at the time because Vinson and Spencer had casual contact with the general public while mildly symptomatic, but no additional cases surfaced.    Good point clarifying where and how they (Pham, Vinson &amp; Ramos) became infected.  \n\nRe: *\"...highly contagious in its final stages...\"*.  For the sake of accuracy: The disease continues to be contagious beyond the *'final stages'*.  Hence the modification of burial practices.    \n\n*Asymptomatic / Symptomatic* is the dividing line between being *infected* and being *contagious*.

However, large droplets (splashes or sprays) of respiratory or other secretions from a person who is sick with Ebola **could be** infectious, and therefore certain precautions (called standard, contact, and droplet precautions) are recommended for use in healthcare settings to prevent the transmission of Ebola from patients to healthcare personnel and other patients or family members.\n\n\n\n&gt; * **Is Ebola spread through droplets?**\n\n&gt; &gt; To get Ebola, you have to directly get body fluids (blood, diarrhea, sweat, vomit, urine, semen, breast milk) from someone who is sick with Ebola in your mouth, nose, eyes or through a break in your skin or through sexual contact. That can happen by being splashed with droplets, or through other direct contact, like touching infectious body fluids. Healthcare providers caring for Ebola patients and the family and friends in close contact with Ebola patients are at the highest risk of getting sick when they touch or are splashed by infectious blood or body fluids from a sick patient.\n\n&gt; * **DROPLET SPREAD**\n\n&gt; &gt;Droplet spread happens when fluids in large droplets from a sick person splash the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person or through a cut in the skin. Droplets **may cause** short-term environmental contamination, like a soiled bathroom surface or handrails, from which another person can pick up the infectious material.\n\n**Removed any mention of 3 or 6 foot contamination area**\n\n* **Change stance on droplet spread from \"Ebola is spread through droplets\" to \"Ebola might be spread through large droplets but only when a person is very sick.\"**\n\n&gt; * Germs like plague and meningitis can be spread through large droplets.

Perhaps there was double counting or exonerated suspected deaths.**\n\n* Recent declines in Liberia's reported new cases appear to be correlated with journal reports of a decline in admissions into ETUs. This suggests that the known new caseload has declined as well. Unless a larger proportion of all cases are unknown to investigators, which could only be logically explained if previously unaffected areas that are off-grid from investigators are getting hit very hard, then the decline in new cases (known and unknown) is likely genuine.\n\n* ( Interesting thing I recently noticed which supports the previous link: Sierra Leone's total bed capacity at their management and holding centers is very similar to the country's reported 4-day totals, which supports using occupied beds as a measurement of daily caseloads. **Update: Perhaps those uncounted admissions have now been retroactively added to a large degree from all the affected countries.**\n\n* Much of the previous period's increase was powered by a 170 caseload day reported from Montserrado on the 17th. It remains to be seen if that is the new normal or a backlog of a bunch of cases getting through the bureaucracy. However, clinic occupancy leaped back up to 388, from a low of 301, and so there is a possibility of a resurgence. **Update: Appears to be a backlog of tests getting through.**\n\n**Forecast:**\n\nOct 25th-28th is looking like it will report a 141-161/day rate, powered mostly be a tremendous surge in reported cases in Sierra Leone. \n\nHowever, I suspect that much of that excess could be rolled back into earlier periods, as what should be done for the previous 4 day period rate as well. This is supported by the fact that over the 25th-28th period there has not been a known increase in ETU capacity in Sierra Leone nor an observed increase in used spaces. \n\nOdds are that the 4-day daily rate for this period, the previous period, and next period, are all much closer to the usual 120-140/day range.\n\nThe longer Liberia continues to report no more than a linear increase in the cumulative total, the more likely previous estimates for under-reporting prevalence were vastly overstated.

This outbreak comes on the heels of the western DRC outbreak, so people and resources were already in place and responded quickly.

A requirement at the time when its spread was uncontrolled. \n\nWhen the author writes, \"The 64 percent mortality rate in treatment units...stemmed from the fact that many Ebola units were ill-equipped to provide even the most rudimentary resuscitative care like intravenous fluids.\"  This ignores how and why the ETU's came into being, the enormous struggle to get them created, functional and supplied as well as conditions in west Africa.  \n\nAdditionally, the staff of the ETU's were comprised of small core group of volunteer doctors and nurses and a larger number of lesser trained staff.  Until a degree of control over the diseases spread had been achieved, the environment within the units was more akin to a horror house than a treatment facility. They did not have the personal needed to provide 24 hour treatment. In the height of the epidemic ETU's were not staffed from dust till dawn. When the staff went back into the centers in the morning it was to clear out the dead and as best they could clean up the blood, vomit and excrement created over night. Not a sterile environment, not a place where \"rudimentary resuscitative care\" could be provided.  Tying the mortality rate to inadequate treatment in the ETU's, is disingenuous.\n\nWhere the article states, \"...even a person already sick with Ebola would be only marginally more  likely to survive by seeking what then passed for treatment in such a poorly staffed and stocked facility.\" They ignore the reason for the ETU's coming into existence.  It was to isolate the infected from the rest of the population.  As cruel as this may sound, with the close personal contact mandated by burial customs of the area, the ETU's were key to stopping the spread of Ebola.\n\nHere is a link to the Lancet article referenced in this matter: \n\n", "British military sent to West Africa.

This rumor having caused a risk of uprising of the population, the teams of the riposte had to limit their displacements in the city this Tuesday. However, at the end of the day, the president of ATAMOV, the bikers' association, denied this rumor. An accident did occur but the motorcycle taxi driver did not die and he continued to work during the day. Since the beginning of May, this is the fourth consecutive day in which the teams have not been able to carry out all the necessary response activities to Butembo. A meeting was held on Tuesday between the city's urban safety committee and motorcycle taxi drivers. The bikers confessed before the members of the urban security committee that they are infiltrated by enemies who commit incidents on their behalf and that some of their members are used by malicious people to destabilize the city. Among the decisions taken, there is notably the census of all true taximen today. The Urban Safety Committee warned motorcyclists who have been warned that if they are still at the base of security incidents impeding the response to Ebola, the committee will be forced to take tougher action against them. \n\n* The triage service of the Sainte Famille Mukuna hospital center in the health zone of Katwa was burned by incivists. As part of the Ebola outbreak, razors were constructed at the entrance of the city's main hospitals and health centers. The yards are structures through which patients wanting to go to the hospital must pass to disinfect their hands and shoes as well as take their temperature. In order to reduce the risk of hospitalization of confirmed patients and thus nosocomial infections in the health facilities of the city, it was important to sort the patients before they entered the hospital to be able to identify the patients suspected of being contaminated by Ebola and transfer them as quickly as possible to the transit center or Ebola treatment center to receive the appropriate treatment. \n\n\n**Vaccination**\n\n* Since the start of vaccination on August 8, 2018, **112,225 people have been vaccinated** , of which, 30,432 in Katwa, 23,681 in Beni, 13,803 in Butembo, 7,202 in Mabalako, 5,218 in Mandima, 3,608 in Kalunguta, 3,070 in Goma, 2,879 in Komanda, 2,569 at Oicha, 1,980 at Kayna, 1,930 at Masereka, 1,915 at Vuhovi, 1,748 at Kyondo, 1,487 at Bunia, 1,372 at Lubero, 1,357 at Karisimbi, 1,197 at Musienene, 1,025 at Biena, 1,012 at Mutwanga, 690 at Rutshuru, 557 in Rwampara (Ituri), 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 420 in Mambasa, 355 in Tchomia, 342 in Kirotshe, 333 in Lolwa, 254 in Alimbongo, 250 in Mweso, 245 in Kibirizi, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* On Tuesday, May 7, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) released several recommendations to adapt the Ebola vaccination strategy to address insecurity and community feedback. . These recommendations include expanding the targeted population by adding an additional experimental vaccine manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson, as well as the greater use of pop-up vaccination and targeted geographic vaccination. In addition, it was recommended that vaccine doses be adjusted to increase the number of people who can be vaccinated. \n\n* The targeted geographic immunization strategy is the strategy already used by Ministry of Health vaccinators in unsecured areas such as villages controlled by community militias (Mayi-Mayi). Targeted geographic vaccination, which is wider than vaccination in the belt, consists in vaccinating several houses around a confirmed case, or even an entire village or neighborhood, when the security conditions do not allow the necessary investigations to be made to establish the list of contacts. . \n\n* To date, the authorized Congolese authorities, namely the Scientific Committee, the Ethics Committee, the Expanded Program on Immunization and the Directorate of Pharmacy and Medicine (DPM), have not approved the use of another vaccine that the vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck. Congolese authorities have already received applications for the use of three other vaccines as part of the ongoing Ebola outbreak. The different requests are being analyzed. A comparative scientific analysis of these different vaccines is needed to determine which one will be most effective in limiting the number of Ebola victims in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. **Wednesday, May 8, 2019**\n\n**The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated May 7, 2019 :**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1,600, of which 1,534 are confirmed and 66 are probable.

Daniella was admitted to the CTE with her mother on April 11, 2019 when she was only 12 days old. Her mother, who arrived in a state of advanced coma, died at CTE the next day. Daniella was collected on April 12 and was positive. After 30 days of treatment with mAb 114, Daniella was cured. She survived thanks to the work of the health staff and the nannies who took turns at her bedside 24 hours a day but also because she was taken care of as soon as she became ill. Nannies are men and women cured of Ebola, and therefore immune to the virus, who care for sick children and babies during their hospitalization. \n\n**Medical management in Butembo and Katwa**\n\n* Since the departure of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) from the health zones of Butembo and Katwa following the deterioration of the security situation last February, the management of the two Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) in the city of Butembo has been taken over by the Ministry of Health in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF since March 2019. \n\n* Since this transfer of management, many changes have been made to the medical care of patients suffering from Ebola. These changes include:\n 1. Increased number of health providers in CTEs. The new managers continued to work with MSF-trained caregivers, but they also recruited more care providers to ensure better individual follow-up for each patient. Moreover, from now on, the whole of the medical staff is Congolese and has been recruited locally.\n 1. Improvement of the nutritional care of the patients which increases their chance of survival.\n 1. Creation of a team dedicated exclusively to admissions to reduce the waiting time for admission.\n 1. Involvement of the family from the beginning of the treatment of patients with the support of psychologists. \n \n* Two months after this transfer of management, it was important to conduct an analysis to assess the quality of medical care for Ebola patients. The main conclusions of this analysis are:\n 1. The average duration of hospitalization in CTEs has been reduced, allowing more patients to be treated for the same duration. At Butembo CTE, the average duration of hospitalization increased from 9 to 4 days. And at the Katwa CTE, the average length of stay was 7 to 5 days.\n 1. There was a reduction in the intra-CTE lethality rate and an increase in the survival rate. Without taking into account those who died less than 48 hours after admission to the CTE, the case-fatality rate for confirmed patients increased from 43.4% to 31.1% in the Butembo CTE and from 43.2% to 33.8%. % at Katwa CTE. As a corollary, Butembo's CTE survival rate increased from 56.6% to 68.9%. At the Katwa CTE, the survival rate increased from 56.8% to 66.2%. \n\n### (\n\n\n* These data come from the patient database compiled by the Ministry of Health and partners involved in medical care. These data are encouraging as they prove that local health workers are now able to properly care for Ebola patients. It is a great success to congratulate and encourage. \n\n\n**Decentralized operational approach**\n\n* The Ministry of Health invited MSF to present their \"decentralized operational approach\" project at a strategic meeting in Kinshasa this Thursday, May 9, 2019. In summary, the MSF project is structured around three axes: \n\n * *OPTION 1 :* If the patients accept it, they will be treated in the CTE which remain the reference places for the management of confirmed Ebola patients and who guarantee the best survival rate.\n * *OPTION 2 :* If patients do not wish to visit an ETC, they may go to a local health center or hospital that is prepared to accommodate them.\n * *OPTION 3 :* If patients do not wish to visit a CTE or a health center, they could be cared for at home with the support of the patient and the family with training in transmission reduction with equipment individual protection 'light' and in symptomatic treatment with supervision (if possible). \n\n* Many questions, suggestions and concerns were shared by the Ministry of Health and the technical and financial partners present at this meeting. These questions include:\n * How to ensure team safety in such a decentralized approach?\n * How to ensure strict compliance with prevention measures at the community health centers and at home?\n * What to answer to patients who would like to be cared for in traditional healer centers that are very popular?\n * How will families manage contaminated biological fluids for home treatment?\n * Can daily support for health centers or families be done remotely when response teams are unable to move about the city due to a security incident? \n\n* MSF was also asked to draw lessons learned from Beni and Mangina where the decentralized approach in the hospitals was used early in the response, prior to the construction of the CTEs. In both areas, this decentralized approach has led to a high rate of nosocomial infections and a high level of contamination among health care workers. A workshop will be organized in the coming weeks with the actors in the field to evaluate the relevance, the feasibility and the acceptability of this approach. Community dialogues will also be organized to involve communities in the choice of response strategies to use. \n\n## **Security situation**\n\n * Nothing to report\n\n## **FIGURES OF THE RESPONSE**\n\n* **114,067 Vaccinated persons**\n\n* 400 people vaccinated on 11/05/2019.\n\n* Of those vaccinated, 30,648 are high-risk contacts (CHR), 54,994 are contact contacts (CC), and 28,425 are front-line providers (PPL).\n* Persons vaccinated by health zone: 30,701 in Katwa, 23,918 in Beni, 13,896 in Butembo, 7,730 in Mabalako, 5,784 in Mandima, 3,608 in Kalunguta, 3,070 in Goma, 2,928 in Komanda, 2,569 in Oicha, 1,980 in Kayna, 1,930 in Masereka , 1,915 to Vuhovi, 1,748 to Kyondo, 1,472 to Lubero, 1,487 to Bunia, 1,357 to Karisimbi, 1,197 to Musienene, 1,025 to Biena, 1,012 to Mutwanga, 690 to Rutshuru, 557 to Rwampara (Ituri), 527 to Nyankunde, 496 to Mangurujipa, 420 in Mambasa, 355 in Tchomia, 342 in Kirotshe, 333 in Lolwa, 254 in Alimbongo, 250 in Mweso, 245 in Kibirizi, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani.\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n\n* **57,130,180 Controlled people**\n\n * 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (PoC).\n * 263.501 travelers passed the checkpoints and entry points on 11/05/2019.\n * 810 refused sanitary control (0.3%). \n\n* **99 Contaminated health workers**\n\n * Mangurujipa health worker, unvaccinated, among new confirmed cases\n\n * The cumulative number of confirmed / probable cases among health workers is 99 (5.9% of all confirmed / probable cases), including 34 deaths. \n\n_____\n\n^(***Mod Note:*** *In light of changes made to the format and content of the SitReps on 09MAY19.

The Minister of Health recalled that, from the point of view of public health, Ebola virus disease is not a particularly difficult disease to contain, especially since the country currently has a diagnostic, therapeutic medical arsenal and comprehensive preventive for the first time in the history of the virus. He recalled that to break the chain of transmission, it is enough to do a series of important activities around the confirmed cases, dead or alive, in particular the sensitization, the epidemiological investigations, the disinfection of the household, the vaccination and the follow-up of the contacts, and funerals worthy and secure. All these activities are available but teams are sometimes prevented from doing them because of insecurity or mistrust of the population. The Director of WHO emphasized that the Ebola epidemic in the DRC is still ongoing, not because the teams do not have the means or the skills but because they can not get regular access to the sick in the communities. If the security environment improves and access to communities is guaranteed, the response teams will be able to put an end to this epidemic. \n \n* While welcoming the work of the Congolese Government in containing the Ebola outbreak, the Director of WHO-AFRO presented the progress of regional preparedness in case the Ebola outbreak spreads outside the DRC. To date, no cases of Ebola have been detected in DRC's neighboring countries thanks to the efforts of the Government and partners, who have examined more than 50 million travelers at the various health checkpoints located east of the DRC. country. As part of the regional preparedness plan, the nine countries bordering the DRC now have an emergency plan, 16 Ebola treatment centers have been built in neighboring countries, 270 technical experts have been deployed to support the efforts of border countries, 400 national multidisciplinary teams were trained to carry out rapid response actions, more than 4,500 health workers were trained in the detection and management of Ebola cases, and more than 7,000 health workers in high-risk areas. risk have been vaccinated. \n\n# **Security Situation** \n\n* Nothing to report\n\n## **FIGURES OF THE RESPONSE**\n\n### Vaccination\n\n* **121,202 Vaccinated persons**\n\n* 564 people vaccinated on 20/05/2019.\n\n* Of those vaccinated, 33,118 are high-risk contacts (CHR), 59,281 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 28,803 are front-line providers (PPL).\n\n* Persons vaccinated by health zone: 32,126 in Katwa, 24,788 in Beni, 15,069 in Butembo, 9,208 in Mabalako, 6,021 in Mandima, 4,235 in Kalunguta, 3,070 in Goma, 3,048 in Komanda, 2,569 in Oicha, 1,980 in Kayna, 1,972 in Lubero , 1,945 to Masereka, 1,935 to Vuhovi, 1,817 to Kyondo, 1,487 to Bunia, 1,558 to Musienene, 1,357 to Karisimbi, 1,025 to Biena, 1,012 to Mutwanga, 690 to Rutshuru, 557 to Rwampara (Ituri), 527 to Nyankunde, 496 to Mangurujipa, 494 to Alimbongo, 420 to Mambasa, 355 to Tchomia, 342 to Kirotshe, 333 to Lolwa, 250 to Mweso, 245 to Kibirizi, 161 to Nyiragongo, 97 to Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 to Kisangani.\n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n\n### Sanitary Control Points ^* \n\n* **59,543,682 Controlled people**\n\n* 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (PoC). \n\n### Contaminated Health Workers\n\n* **104 Contaminated health workers**\n\n* One health worker in Masereka, vaccinated, is among the new confirmed cases.\n\n* The cumulative number of confirmed / probable cases among health workers is 104 (5.6% of all confirmed / probable cases), including 34 deaths. \n\n____\n\n^* ^(ModNote: Traveler PoE &amp; PoC details of those refusing screening and hand washing has not been reported since the 16MAY19 SitRep) **Wednesday, May 22, 2019**\n\n**The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated 21 May 2019 :**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1,866, of which 1,778 are confirmed and 88 are probable.

The Musienene nurses held an extraordinary meeting on Thursday, May 23, 2019 to evaluate their working conditions. They asked the politico-administrative authorities to get involved in putting an end to this phenomenon of violence against health workers because, if the threats do not stop, they plan to go on a dry strike. \n\n* Because of this targeted violence, several doctors and nurses in the Beni and Lubero territories had to move or temporarily leave their homes, forcing some health facilities to close their doors. This is especially the case in the Kyondo Health Zone where activities have been suspended at the Kyakumba Reference Health Center since Tuesday, May 21, 2019, since the attending physician and the nursing staff left the feared zone for their safety. . \n\n* Between 1 August 2018 and 20 May 2019, 132 attacks against health facilities were recorded as part of the Ebola outbreak, resulting in 4 deaths and 38 injuries among health workers and patients. As the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, recalled at the 72 nd World Health Assembly in Geneva, this violence against health workers must be condemned unreservedly and a clear distinction must be made between community involvement and targeted violence by armed militias.

After the courtesy of the mayor of the city , the two hosts visited different sites of the Ebola response, starting with a vaccination site. They also visited the CTE and the CTE nursery in Butembo. After all these visits, the Swedish Ambassador and the British Foreign Minister visited the Auberge, where Butembo co-ordinates, where they discussed with the teams the situation of the epidemic, the challenges and constraints of the riposte. They also had discussions with Butembo's women leaders and representatives of religious denominations, including representatives of Catholics, Muslims and Protestants. \n\n**Support for providers of the Mabalako sub-coordination**\n\n* The Ministry of Health warmly thanks all the local providers who are the main architects of the Ebola response despite the many risks and difficulties they face. All agents involved in the response are entitled to receive their bonus in accordance with the scale in effect since the beginning of this response. \n\n* The Ministry of Health was informed of the decision of some health workers in Mabalako to go on strike on Monday, May 27, 2019. The strike ended on Tuesday, May 28, 2019. These agents are demanding alleged Ebola unpaid premiums between the months of August and December 2018 by the Health System Development Program (HSDP). Based on information collected from the Ministry of Health and the PDSS, there are no Ebola premium arrears for the year 2018. \n\n* However, the situation of these providers needs to be clarified. In fact, after analyzing the lists of strike providers sent to the national coordination by Mangina's sub-coordinator, it appears that they are providers working at the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in Mabalako. As a reminder, the management of the CTE Mabalako was entrusted successively to two international NGOs who have ensured the organization of services and payment of Ebola premiums from providers since the beginning of the response. In the future, it will be important to clarify the contract transfer procedure of providers when an agency or agency leaves a health zone to avoid misunderstandings. \n\n* It is important to note that the Ministry of Health has developed, with the support of the World Bank, a manual of simplified human resource management procedures related to the response to the EVD epidemic. The manual states that bonuses are not cumulative and any case of fraud, or attempted fraud, will now be followed by sanctions or even disciplinary measures. The manual also provides several types of control for the payment of premiums. Monitoring missions are carried out every month in the different sub-coordinations to check the lists of providers and the evidence of service rendered (attendance lists). The last mission is from the beginning of May to validate the payment lists for the month of April 2019. However, during the various checks carried out since January 2019, the 40 Mabalako service providers who announced the strike do not appear at all on lists of staff to be supported by the PDSS. \n\n* Discussions continue with Mabalako's sub-coordination to determine the merits of these claims. In order to avoid such situations in the future and to ensure greater transparency in the management of human resources, all the agents involved in the response will have to sign standard contracts which will be included in a single database for all organizations involved in the response to Ebola. \n\n## **Security Situation** \n\n* Nothing to report\n\n## **FIGURES OF THE RESPONSE**\n\n### Vaccination\n\n* **126,084 Vaccinated persons**\n\n* 617 people vaccinated on 27/05/2019.\n\n* Of those vaccinated, 34,726 are high-risk contacts (CHR), 61,763 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 29,595 are front-line providers (PPL).\n\n* Persons vaccinated by health zone: 32,639 in Katwa, 25,294 in Beni, 16,391 in Butembo, 10,368 in Mabalako, 6,081 in Mandima, 4,513 in Kalunguta, 3,130 in Goma, 3,048 in Komanda, 2,569 in Oicha, 2,302 in Musienene, 2,155 in Masereka , 1.986 in Lubero, 1.980 in Kayna, 1.935 in Vuhovi, 1.817 in Kyondo, 1.487 in Bunia, 1.040 in Biena, 1.012 in Mutwanga, 690 in Rutshuru, 557 in Rwampara (Ituri), 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 494 in Alimbongo, 420 to Mambasa, 355 to Tchomia, 342 to Kirotshe, 333 to Lolwa, 250 to Mweso, 245 to Kibirizi, 161 to Nyiragongo, 97 to Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 to Kisangani.\n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n\n### Sanitary Control Points \n\n* **61,391,293 Controlled people**\n\n* 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (PoC). \n\n### Contaminated Health Workers\n\n* 106 Contaminated health workers\n\n* One health worker in Katwa, unvaccinated (refusal), is one of the new confirmed cases and one of the new deaths (community deaths).\n\n* The cumulative number of confirmed / probable cases among health workers is 106 (5.5% of all confirmed / probable cases), including 36 deaths. **Wednesday, May 29, 2019**\n**\nThe epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated May 28, 2019 :**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1,945, of which 1,851 are confirmed and 94 are probable.

The aim of the Symposium is to give the people of Butembo the opportunity to work together to find a lasting solution to get out of the crisis and recreate a bond of trust between the population, local authorities and the agents of the response. \n\n\n**Ebola Hackathon**\n\n* After a successful first edition in Kinshasa last March, the Ebola hackathon returns for a second edition in Goma. From Thursday, May 30 to Friday, May 31, 2016, 60 young students will work to develop new solutions using new technologies to help fight Ebola while also promoting the right to health. This second hackathon is organized in collaboration with Internews, Kinshasa Digital, Path, the DRC Information Media Association and the French Institute of Goma.\n\n* As a reminder, the first edition of the Ebola hackathon took place from March 2 to 3, 2019 in Kinshasa. The winning team of this first edition is called Lokole , a name inspired by the traditional drum. Their project was to develop a mobile application that allows community relays and people to share information in real time with the coordination of the Ebola response. Thanks to financial support from the World Bank and technical support from the Ministry of Health, the Lokole team is following an incubation program at Ingenious City where they will develop a prototype of the project which will then be tested with ground. \n \n## **Security Situation** \n\n* Nothing to report\n\n## **FIGURES OF THE RESPONSE**\n\n### Vaccination\n\n* **127,018 Vaccinated persons**\n\n* 453 people vaccinated on 29/05/2019.\n\n* Of those vaccinated, 34,962 are high-risk contacts (CHR), 62,197 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 29,859 are front-line providers (PPL).\n\n* Persons vaccinated by health zone: 32,739 in Katwa, 25,323 in Beni, 16,539 in Butembo, 10,584 in Mabalako, 6,111 in Mandima, 4,547 in Kalunguta, 3,170 in Goma, 3,048 in Komanda, 2,569 in Oicha, 2,529 in Musienene, 2,195 in Masereka , 2.005 to Vuhovi, 1.986 to Lubero, 1.980 to Kayna, 1.817 to Kyondo, 1.487 to Bunia, 1.040 to Biena, 1.012 to Mutwanga, 690 to Rutshuru, 557 to Rwampara (Ituri), 527 to Nyankunde, 496 to Mangurujipa, 494 to Alimbongo, 420 to Mambasa, 355 to Tchomia, 342 to Kirotshe, 333 to Lolwa, 250 to Mweso, 245 to Kibirizi, 161 to Nyiragongo, 97 to Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 to Kisangani.\n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n\n\n### Sanitary Control Points \n\n* **61,983,512 Controlled people**\n\n* 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (PoC). \n\n### Contaminated Health Workers\n\n* **108 Contaminated health workers**\n\n* The cumulative number of confirmed / probable cases among health workers is 108 (5.5% of all confirmed / probable cases), including 36 deaths. **Friday, May 31, 2019**\n\n**The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated May 30, 2019 :**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1,974, of which 1,880 are confirmed and 94 are probable.

Despite this course, developments in recent weeks are positive although vigilance remains in place. Among the positive developments, we count:\n\n * **Slight improvement in the security situation :** The last armed attack on the teams and operations of the Ebola response, which cost the life of Dr. Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, dates back more than a month. Although threats against the response remain high, the reduction in targeted attacks has allowed teams to catch up with the spread of the epidemic. However, the security situation remains volatile and unpredictable. With respect to incidents of reluctance or community resistance, the majority of these incidents are resolved through the involvement of community leaders, sensitizers and psychosocial experts.\n\n * **Geographical Confinement of the Epidemic :** Despite the difficulties of the response teams in doing their job because of the security situation, the epidemic continues to be geographically contained, thus protecting the rest of the country and neighboring countries. To date, no cases of Ebola have crossed the borders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the epidemic has not spread to the most risky major urban centers, namely Goma, Bunia and Kisangani. However, the risk remains high given the significant movement of the population. In addition, since the beginning of the epidemic, 188 health areas in 22 health zones across the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri have recorded at least one case of Ebola. As of 2 June 2019, nine health zones, including 106 health areas (56% of the total), have spent more than 21 days without reporting new confirmed cases. The nine health zones concerned are Kyondo, Oicha, Kayna, Mutwanga, Komanda, Bunia, Rwampara, Nyankunde and Tchomia. \n\n* The main challenges to be met to end this epidemic are:\n\n * **Epidemiological surveillance :** In order to break the chain of transmission, all contacts of confirmed cases must be listed and followed for 21 days. Of the 911 new confirmed cases registered between January 1 and May 7, 2019, only 398 (44%) were registered as follow-up contacts. Thus, listing and follow-up of contacts needs to be strengthened by involving more the authorities and community leaders.\n\n * **Infection Prevention and Control (ICP) :** Infection prevention and control measures need to be strengthened in community health facilities to reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. Between 25 and 30% of infections occur in health facilities.\n\n * **Community deaths :** The community death rate remains high. Between 28 and 43% of deaths reported each week occur outside of an Ebola treatment center or transit center. These deaths occur either in private hospitals and clinics, in community health centers or at home. However, the contagiosity of a patient being maximum after his death, dignified and secure burials can limit the community spread of the virus. What is positive is that the majority of community deaths have a dignified and secure burial. \n\n* A comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the ongoing Ebola outbreak is available in a scientific article written by Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, Dr. Tedros A. Ghebreyesus and Dr. Matshidiso Moeti. \n\n## **Security Situation** \n\n* Nothing to report\n\n## **FIGURES OF THE RESPONSE**\n\n### Vaccination\n\n**129,596 Vaccinated persons**\n\n* 595 people vaccinated on 02/06/2019.\n\n* Of those vaccinated, 35,768 are high-risk contacts (CHR), 63,852 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 29,976 are front-line providers (PPL).\n\n* Persons vaccinated by health zone: 33,316 in Katwa, 25,663 in Beni, 17,257 in Butembo, 11,066 in Mabalako, 6,290 in Mandima, 4,573 in Kalunguta, 3,209 in Goma, 3,048 in Komanda, 2,640 in Musienene, 2,569 in Oicha, 2,241 in Masereka , 2,045 to Vuhovi, 1,998 to Lubero, 1,980 to Kayna, 1,837 to Kyondo, 1,487 to Bunia, 1,040 to Biena, 1,012 to Mutwanga, 690 to Rutshuru, 557 to Rwampara (Ituri), 527 to Nyankunde, 496 to Mangurujipa, 494 to Alimbongo, 420 to Mambasa, 355 to Tchomia, 342 to Kirotshe, 333 to Lolwa, 250 to Mweso, 245 to Kibirizi, 161 to Nyiragongo, 97 to Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 to Kisangani.\n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n\n### Sanitary Control Points \n\n* **62,968,354 Controlled people**\n\n* 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (PoC). \n\n### Contaminated Health Workers\n\n* **109 Contaminated health workers**\n\n* The cumulative number of confirmed / probable cases among health workers is 109 (5.4% of all confirmed / probable cases), including 37 deaths.", " Ex-girlfriend fucks with everyone!

But i have been following this subreddit for more than a month now.  And i just have to get this out of my system.  (pardon my english)  \n\n  \nI want to address the disturbing issue of health workers contracting ebola despite having themselves 'adequately' protected.  This is disturbing news indeed.   Dr Ada Igonoh and the newly reported Spain nurse cases are on my mind.  \n\nBut they do have similarities, and this similarities should be a lesson to us if we are to prevent any similar cases from happening.   \n\nWhat are the similarities?  First, we must consider that Dr.  Ada Igonoh's parents are NOT infected despite her being in the house, symptomatic, for a couple days.  On the other hand, Dr Ada Igonoh got infected despite using protection and taking measures.  \n\nThe similarity that i found between the spain and dr Ada Igonoh cases is: they came in close with a dying/dead body.   Dr Ada igonoh is the one who check the pulse on the ebola patient.  And the nurse in spain also came in close with the dead body.  Also the US reporter who contracted ebola got it from cleaning the ambulance which an ebola patient died in.  \n\nSo what is my 2 cents?  Extra precautions should be taken when dealing with dead / dying patients.   The high viral load at the last stages is more potent than we thought.   It could prevail against any non-standard countermeasures.  \n  \n1.  No more proper burials.  Too many middle man, rites, families involved.  I do not know how things are in africa, but i suspect handling of the dead still is the primary mean of ebola spreading.  \n2.  Family of the deceased are not to handle the corpse.  They are not even to come close with the body bag.  \n3.  Better yet, cremate the dead immediately.  \n4.  There should be some kind of \"dead and dying management\".  Some special protocol.  Perhaps some automated sprinkler to spray bleach on dead patients before health care workers come in to handle them.

EBOV GP and RABV GP-specific antibody titers increased exponentially during the trial, with rates of increase for six orally vaccinated chimpanzees very similar to four intramuscularly vaccinated controls. Chimpanzee sera also showed robust neutralizing activity against RABV and pseudo-typed EBOV. Vaccination did not induce serious health complications. Blood chemistry, hematologic, and body mass correlates of psychological stress suggested that, although sedation induced acute stress, experimental housing conditions did not induce traumatic levels of chronic stress. Acute behavioral and physiological responses to sedation were strongly correlated with immune responses to vaccination. These results suggest that oral vaccination holds great promise as a tool for the conservation of apes and other endangered tropical wildlife. They also imply that vaccine and drug trials on other captive species need to better account for the effects of stress on immune response.\n Very interesting.", "First Ebola Case in U.S. ", "Up to 3 Ebola-infected travelers might fly each month ", "Why an Ebola Flight Ban Would not Work ", "Former FDA Top Scientist Says More Will Be Infected Now that Ebola is in Texas ", "Nigeria: Suspected Ebola Transmission in Anambra State ", "CDC commitment to safety 'inconsistent and insufficient,' report finds ", "Cuban doctor to be flown to Geneva for Ebola care: Swiss ", "Fear Still Lingers in Village Ravaged By Ebola in Bong County ", "Petition to close our borders for flights from West Africa \u2013 good idea?

The Prime Minister inaugurated the site in the presence of the Minister of Public Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the Deputy Executive Director of Gavi, Ms. Anuradha Gupta, and the Deputy Representative of UNICEF in DRC, Dr. Tajudeen Oyewale.\n\nLocated in Kinkole, 40 kilometers from downtown Kinshasa, this modern warehouse is the largest ever built in Central Africa and the largest ever built in a Gavi-supported country. It will facilitate the storage of vaccines and strengthen the cold chain to make vaccines available throughout the country, particularly in the most remote and inaccessible health areas.\n\n\"Immunization is one of the best ways to save the lives of millions of children and allows the state and families to save on health costs. The modern Kinkole warehouse will enable the Democratic Republic of Congo to conduct quality immunization activities to control, eliminate and eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases, \"said the Minister of Public Health Dr Kinkole. Oly Ilunga Kalenga.\n\nThe construction of this warehouse was fully funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. It is part of a strategic partnership between the Government of the DRC, Gavi and UNICEF.\n\nMs. Anuradha Gupta, Deputy Executive Director of Gavi, emphasized that \"Immunization is the best investment we can make for children's health. It is also the keystone of access to primary health care. It is fundamental that all steps in the delivery of vaccines are respected so that all children, wherever they live, benefit. \"\n\nThis modern warehouse, whose work began in February 2016, is fully integrated into the country's innovative health system supply chain system for the distribution of vaccines, medicines and health products, and will facilitate also the introduction of new vaccines.\n\n\"The construction of this new warehouse will make it possible to stock better quantities of vaccines under the best conditions, thanks to the introduction of new vaccines, the continuous increase of the population and the need to reach all children and pregnant women living in the DRC, without exception, \"said UNICEF Deputy Representative in the DRC, Dr Tajudeen Oyewale.\n\nThis warehouse is composed of three parts; a part housing twelve cold rooms with a capacity of 5.760 m 3 for the storage of vaccines and thermolabile products; an administrative area of \u200b\u200b1300 m 2 with more than ten offices, two meeting rooms and dormitories; it also has a warehouse for dry inputs and medicines with a volume of 12,000 m 3 on an area of \u200b\u200b3,600 m\u00b2.\n\nThe Minister of Health thanked during the opening session of the warehouse, Gavi and UNICEF for the invaluable support given to the health system in general and to vaccination in particular. Strengthening the supply chain of the Expanded Program of Immunization as part of Gavi's funding also includes the construction of warehouses, the provision of trucks, vehicles, motorcycles, outboards, solar refrigerators and freezers .\n\nIn addition to the Kinkole warehouse, two more are under construction in Lubumbashi and Kisangani.\n_____\n\nFor further information, please contact :\nJessica Ilunga , Communication Manager, Ministry of Public Health  &lt;Phone &amp; Email redacted for privacy&gt;\nJames Fulker , Media Manager, Gavi, &lt;Phone &amp; Email redacted for privacy&gt;\nYves Willemot , Chief of Communication, UNICEF DRC, &lt;Phone &amp; Email redacted for privacy&gt;\n_____\n\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n \n(\n\n(\n ", "Prognostic Indicators for Ebola Patient Survival ", "The \u201cSexy Ebola Containment Suit\u201d Halloween costume proves we are a civilization on the decline ", "Kaci Hickox planning on being in home quarantine \"for only the next day or so\" ", "Attkisson: CDC Not Telling Public About Possible Ebola Cases ", "Another report (in French) on new Mali case: a nurse died ", "Showing unreal things on camera!

It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections.

West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage.

So was some information from on the ground, but not a lot as Internet penetration in Africa was so low.\n\nI do not understand your comment that 'we encountered evola (sic) years before the West African outbreak' .... no-one has ever suggested otherwise. It was first identified in the 1970s and concerted efforts to contain it and develop a vaccine have been ongoing since then.\n\nDo you seriously think people are not doing all the can to eradicate/contain it? Sporadic incursions into human populations are eradicated. Unfortunately because the natural host is fruit bats,  without eradicating the fruitbat population  (which in turn would require eradicating the forests they live in - not a good idea) cases will periodically re-emerge.\n\nI am not going to say that there not might be more effort put in if it was a serious threat to more affluent parts of the world (hint - conspiracy theorists, that is a clue that it is not) but it is really not financially rewarding for anyone. \n\nThere are some very pertinent cultural issues involved in how the virus spreads - as the book you mentioned by Dr Youngblood covers, as do many others and many academic papers. But any mistakes made in 2014-15 they were genuine mistakes, not a conspiracy to keep Ebola endemic (which I think is ultimately what you are arguing).\n\nAnother difficultly is how do you contain disease spread without eradicating the culture that spreads it? Dr Youngblood's book uses the example of Western dining culture in which all diners have their own cutlery, bowls, glasses etc vs African culture in which it is more the norm to eat direct from a shared bowl. I completely agree that understanding that helps to understand why the disease spreads (ditto funeral/burial customs). But once that is understood, containment depends on modifying that culture - which has its own ethical issues - or on providing vaccination/better food hygiene/other modifications that might allow the basic cultural practice (sharing) to continue. Cf allowing the massaging of bodies to continue, but through body bags. This is not profiteering, it is developing a vaccine so people do not die of Ebola. \n\nYes, things were not ideal last time - and WHO gets that as much as anyone - but that is not a reason not to post WHO material here. By all means add to that accurate, verified information from on the ground.

Early studies had hinted at a possible drop-off in protection, and in one earlier phase 1 study, some study participants reported arthralgia after receiving the vaccine.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to the new findings that cover 360 days of data, the 2\u00d7 107 plaque-forming-unit dose used in the outbreak clinical setting appeared to be well tolerated; most adverse events were mild-to-moderate, occurred soon after vaccination, were of short duration, and were more common at the higher vaccine doses. Nineteen (4.5%) reported temporary joint pain that did not seem related to the dose, but did seem to be related to increased age. The group saw robust antibody responses that have been reported by other groups, and at all doses tested, neutralizing antibodies persisted for at least 1 year after immunization.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a related commentary, two infectious disease experts from the University of New Mexico said the study's strength is that it shows good persistence of antibody responses after vaccination, which could increase vaccine usefulness for healthcare workers and people in endemic areas who are likely to be exposed to Ebola over long periods. The authors are Elizabeth Clarke, PhD, and Steven Bradfute, PhD, both with infectious diseases division of the university's Center for Global Health.

Which one is it?\n\nNext, why is ebola reston airborne in primates when the others are not in humans?\n\nMore importantly, we know viruses can not mutate to change route of transmission but only to jump species. Ebola Zaire is not going to become airborne, but couldnt Ebola Reston mutate to infect humans? These links may help:\n\n* (\n\n* (\n\n* ( This may aid your understanding of the Reston virus. One note to make is that since Ebola is zoonotic, the mode of transmission could vary depending on the species. One article states that pigs ( are a potential amplifier of Ebola in Africa and Asia. \n\nI do not think it is confirmed that Ebola Reston is airborne. Correct me if I am wrong, but my assumption is that the scientists at the facility proposed airborne transmission because monkeys in other rooms became infected, but it is not out of the question that droplets were carried from personnel in the building. \n\nI am not a virologist so cannot answer your question about whether Reston could mutate to infect humans, although I think viruses are resilient and will do whatever they need to survive. Ebola is not nearly as transmissible as coronaviruses like COVID, however. And, I am not sure Reston is out circulating in the same way that Zaire is in places like DRC. \n\nJust my two cents! I dont know what to believe anymore. In Richard Prestons book The Hot Zone it clearly states USAMRIID scientists concluded that E. Reston was present in lung tissue samples and thus airborne.\n\nHogwash?  So these pigs infected monkeys with E. Ziare via the airborne route, they could obviously do so to humans as well correct?\n\nI have heard Anthony Fauci vaguely hinting at viral load and aerosols not being able to carry enough of the virus to spread infection, and since you say pigs generate far more aerosols than primates, could that be the answer they are the only species to have shown this ability?  Just because *The Hot Zone* is a work of fiction, does not mean the studies cited in the book are fictional.  The possibility of airborne Ebola transmission, either in its present form or in a future mutated form, is not to be dismissed.  Here is an excerpt regarding Ebola transmission from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota:\n\n(\n\n&gt;It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to and in direct contact with an infected case. To date, investigators have not identified respiratory spread (either via large droplets or small-particle aerosols) of Ebola viruses among humans. This could be because such transmission does not occur or because such transmission has not been recognized, since the number of studies that have carefully examined transmission patterns is small.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Despite the lack of supportive epidemiological data, a key additional question to ask is whether primary pulmonary infections and respiratory transmission of Ebola viruses could be a potential scenario for the future. A fair amount of evidence suggests that such transmission could be possible, even without dramatic evolution or genetic changes in Ebola viruses (although viral evolution over time could enhance this possibility). First, Ebola viruses can be isolated from saliva, and viral particles have been identified in pulmonary alveoli on human autopsies, suggesting that infectious aerosols could be emitted from the respiratory tract. Second, Ebola viruses can infect several cell types found in the respiratory tract, including macrophages and epithelial cells (( Third, cough can be a symptom of EVD, and coughing is known to generate aerosols, although prevalence of reported cough is variable in case series (ranging from \u201crare\u201d to 49%) (( ( ( Fourth, animal studies indicate that EBOV can be transmitted through aerosols and that respiratory infection with pneumonitis can occur following this route of inoculation. Fifth, experience with RESTV suggests that respiratory transmission of that species can occur between animals and possibly from animals to humans. Finally, people can generate and emit aerosols with particles of various sizes, including fine particles, which could enter the lower respiratory tract and infect susceptible cells; Ebola virus is in the respirable range (800 to 1,000\u00a0nm).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If aerosols containing Ebola virus were to enter the lungs of uninfected individuals, it is possible that primary pulmonary infections could occur (as shown in animal studies), which could then result in active viral shedding from the respiratory tract, thus potentially setting up a cycle of ongoing respiratory transmission in humans (( similar to what occurs during outbreaks of pneumonic plague.   Investigators of a nosocomial outbreak of Lassa fever virus, another African hemorrhagic fever virus that is usually spread via contact with rodents (especially rodent urine), postulated that transmission may have occurred through the respiratory route (( ( Similarly, investigators of a nosocomial cluster of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a vector-borne infection that occurs in Eastern Europe and Africa, identified probable aerosol transmission due to aerosol-generating medical procedures (( Experts in bioterrorism have long been concerned that hemorrhagic fever viruses, particularly filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus), could be used as potential agents of bioterrorism, with an aerosol being the most likely form of dissemination (( ( This concern has been grounded in uncertainty concerning the potential for aerosol transmission of such viruses. A strain of Marburg virus was weaponized by the Soviet Union, highlighting this risk (( The idea that the Ebola virus is \"too heavy\" to be transmitted by aerosols is laughable, and that idea has been strangely perpetuated by one of the moderators of this subreddit.   From the ( it states that the particle size required for aerosol transmission is 5 \u03bcm (micrometers) or smaller.   5 \u03bcm is equivalent to 5000 nanometers.   The average size of an Ebola virus is 800 to 1000 nanometers.", "Flood of refugees fleeing Congo raises fears of spreading Ebola  Well this is terrifying.

So I like analogies. I use them a lot in my own discipline (sociology and social network analysis). The way AIDS works is by destroying the parts of your body that help cure diseases. I make this analogy specifically for Ebola. It seems that Ebola at it is peak is just massively contagious, but at early stages, perhaps not so much. With such a small proportion of people in the United States truly versed in high level bio safety equipment and most of them having only learned it in training but never having to use it, it seems obvious that a tiny mistake is enough to get health care workers infected. It is part of the reason it is hurting the countries where it is currently running wild - health care workers are at extremely high risk.\n\nNow, the US may not be a breeding ground for Ebola, but the more cases we get, the more it tests our infrastructure. I can easily see lots of health care workers getting infected and this causing problems with management of the disease in the US. Ultimately though, I am of the opinion of plenty of other people... It will not spread nearly as easily here as elsewhere in the world.\n\nNonetheless, many other places in the world have a serious shortage of medical staff trained to handle these cases. If healthcare infrastructure collapses, then the disease can run wild.

When it hit one the main cities in West Africa, I started to get concerned. But I did not ever think the outbreak would become so severe and widespread as it has. Now that Ebola has touched the US, we are starting to have a very heated and interesting debate not just about Ebola, but about individual rights in the time of a global crisis.\n\nThe pro-quarantine and anti-quarantine debate raging right now is very fascinating to follow. I think the debate has little to do with the actual threat of Ebola and more to do with our political and philosophical differences. Before I delve into those differences, I will disclose that my opinion is very pro-quarantine, probably more radical than most here. I believe the federal government should force a quarantine on all travelers returning from the region who had contact with Ebola patients for at least 21 days, if not more. No self-monitoring or house quarantine. Federal monitors and housing. End rant.\n\nWhat I find most interesting about the debate is what is going on beneath the surface. The anti-quarantine group tends to focus most on ethos, or establishing the credibility of their claims by quoting scientists or studies. What is effective about this rhetorical strategy is that almost no one would argue against a scientific theory, especially on Reddit. Underneath this appeal to the credibility of science is much more obtuse perspective that has more to do with anti-authoritarianism than it does rationalism.\n\nThe pro-quarantine arguments can easily come across as knee-jerk fear mongering. This feels like guilt by association more than anything else. If Fox News proposes something, then the assumption is that the content of that argument must be false or not credible. What I find most interesting about the pro-quarantine arguments are their mildness. It does not seem like the pro camp is very passionate about their stance nor do they push the logic of their arguments very far. If Ebola is as truly as dangerous as we think it is, some could argue that completely isolating Western Africa would be just as rational as sending in health care workers. They could even argue that immediately killing people who become infected is the fastest way to prevent the disease from spreading. Not pretty arguments, but logical to some degree. \n\nThe undercurrent of both sides tends to get lost in the daily back and forth. The anti-quarantine camp is not saying that Ebola is a small problem. They fully accept Ebola is incredibly dangerous, but they are arguing that this should not make us lose sight of our deeper ideals, like personal liberty. The blind side to these arguments is the assumption that personal liberty is an ends and not a means. In other words, personal liberty is more important the possibility that the unchecked disease could kill many people. The pro-quarantine argument is more nebulous and weak, because I think people are pulling their punches. The blind side to the pro arguments is an underlying assumption that people are afraid to openly admit, that an individual's life and rights are less important than the safety of the group. Very few people on Reddit would admit to believing that.\n\nJust some thoughts, feel free to refute or discuss.", "Ebola virus disease \u2013 Democratic Republic of the Congo  Ebola's like \"My efforts must be acknowledged!\"", "CDC Investigating Sick Passenger For Possible Ebola At Newark Airport \"First Images\" ", "Ebola Situation Report - 29-April-2015 - 26312 cases/10899 deaths ", "Woman saves three relatives from Ebola ", "Observations about Ebola  &gt; \"A poor person in some rural is not going to be traveling across many countries in a short period of time.

Once symptomatic they become a conduit for the disease to spread to others.

When he fell ill, the disease passed to his sister, mother and grandmother.  All four dead in less than a month, but the disease survived. It had also been passed to others.  One of them being a health care worker.

You are supposed to be a moderator so I should not even be telling you this.  &gt; *\"The center for disease control with the link underneath literally states....\"*\n\nThe source of the r/nipah materials is a r/nipah moderator who happens to reside in Kerala, studying medicine at a local university and intimately familiar with the disease.  \n\nThe CDC is an American government organization and as such are limited to what they are allowed to state due to legal constraints.  \n\n&gt; *\"...intentionally ignoring the context...\"*\n\nPerhaps if you had cited the source of the information when stating, \n\n&gt; *\"That was before any treatment attempts even started. despite that 104 people died, not thousands.\"* \n\nreaders would be able to discern the meaning you intended to convey. \n\nAs Australia has a relatively small population, it can do some remarkable things.  The Wolbachia study implemented to examine the possibility of offsetting mosquito borne disease was exemplary and led to advancements.  While the island nation is able to conduct these types of studies, often they can not be duplicated in the rest of the world. \n____\n____\n\nAm going to refrain from comment on the balance of the body of your comment as to do so would be an exercise in futility.  \n____\n____\n\nRegarding you closing comments: \n\n&gt; *\"You might want to  reread r/Ebola rules.\"*\n\nFirst of all, they are not *'rules'*, but are clearly stated as being *'guidelines'*. \n\nAs I was actively involved in there creation and development, am somewhat familiar with what they state and mean. \n\nYou cite Guideline #5 (civil discourse) as an indication of your umbrage with my description of your discourse. \n\nI firmly believe it accurately describes the materials you have presented. From the some what disjointed opening, to the lack of punctuation and argumentative tone. Though I will not and do not fault you on the latter as it is common facet of discussion. \n\nIn future posts and comment I strongly suggest, if interested in attracting participants to the discussion, that you follow guidelines #1 &amp; #2 (quoted below) as both are key elements in the dissemination of reliable information.  Also suggest review of the guideline footnote: \n\n&gt; *\"Speculation does not further knowledge nor does it promote understanding.\"*\n\n____\n____\n\n&gt; 1. Fact Checking Please make sure linked articles are from reputable sources.\n&gt;\n&gt;2. Confirming &amp; Citing sources If quoting material, confirm the accuracy of the information before posting. If citing sources in comments, add the links you are working from so we all can learn.\n&gt;  &gt; Sources yourself?\n\n(\n\nr/ebola is not a standard sort of subreddit. It is original purpose is unknown, but a degree of 4Chan was present.  When revitalized in 2014, it was for the purpose of providing accurate and truthful information to dispel myth and mis-information being pandered at the time.  We have done a pretty good job in that regard. \n\nAt the end of the WAob r/ebola's role morphed into monitoring EVD related events.  Ebola related events, mainly medical and scientific advancements.  With each minor outbreak facts, as provided by the health community, were posted and updated. This practice is carried on with the current DRC ebola outbreak, anticipated to continue into 2021.  Each day available reliable data is examined and presented in a standard format reflecting its source.  \n\nWith journalism in transitional format between print and digital, negatives are often hyped, the underlying story skewed. This process of increasing clicks does not insure factual information is relayed.  It is one of the reasons national and international health organizations are preferred here.  More *'fact'* less *'the sky is falling'*.  \n\nAs for opinions on validity of sources, guideline #1 is guideline #1 for a reason. Doubt are of little concern. The Internet is a vast information pool, according to the windows each chose to look through, the view forms the basis for their understanding.  \n\nIn the mid 1800's Charles Mackay stated,\n\n&gt; *\"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\"*  \n\nThe internet promotes herding.  More so than ever before in history.  Eventually, (hopefully), people will be able to see, not the *stated* reality, but one stripped of deceptions. \n\nPS, /jk about Factbook.

An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or may extend over several countries. It may last for a few days or weeks, or for several years.*\n&gt;\n&gt;*A single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.* \n\n___\nWhen looking through the WHO list of topics for 'Epidemics', they suggest '( \n___\nThe (abbreviated) Wikipedia definition of ( is: \n\n&gt;An epidemic is the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time, usually two weeks or less.

To allow small planes to land in the area, officials are exploring the possibility of clearing an airstrip in Bikoro. The WHO estimates that the 3-month air bridge cost to be $2.4 million.\n&gt; \n&gt; Two more suspected cases have been reported, raising the outbreak total to 34, the WHO said today in an update. The number reflects 2 lab-confirmed, 14 suspected, and 18 probable cases.\n&gt; Large affected area\n&gt; \n&gt; Salama said the WHO is planning for all scenarios, including the worst case. Despite the remote location, one worrying sign is that the outbreak involves three separate locations that cover about 37 miles. Also, he noted that three healthcare workers have been sickened in the outbreak, one of them fatally, and that infections in healthcare workers can amplify the spread of the disease.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though the DRC has its own unique cultural practices, he said funeral rituals in the country that include washing and having contact with the dead body and the use of traditional healers, both of which played a superspreading role in in West Africa's 2014-16 outbreak, are similar to those in West Africa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pierre Formenty, DVM, MPH, a WHO Ebola expert, told reporters that investigators already know funeral transmission has been an issue in the current outbreak and that anthropology experts, who help navigate cultural issues in outbreak settings, are among the first wave of the surge of WHO experts responding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Health officials think the DRC Ebola outbreak may have begun sometime in April because of epidemiologic links with the most recently sick patients, but Salama downplayed suspicions that an illness cluster in January and February in an overlapping area near Bikoro might be related to the outbreak.\n&gt; \n&gt; He said the earlier event consisted of 15 cases and 8 deaths, and two samples from patients tested negative for Ebola. The last death in the cluster was reported in February, and so far investigators have not turned up an epidemiologic links between the previous and current outbreaks. Salama said confusion surrounding possible links between the two outbreaks may be stem from nonspecific symptoms of the disease.\n&gt; Response takes shape quickly\n&gt; \n&gt; The scaling up of the latest response has been much quicker and looks much different than that in West Africa's outbreak, Salama said. \"At all levels, this has been taken as the highest priority.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; A team from WHO and its partners is already on the ground, personal protective equipment has already been deployed, and a surge team of 20 to 40 WHO outbreak specialists is set to arrive. By this weekend, the first mobile lab at the outbreak site should be up and running, Salama said. Key partners, skilled in working in Ebola outbreak settings, have been mobilized, such as Doctors Without Borders, the WFP, UNICEF\u2014which helps with communication and sanitation activities\u2014and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which helps perform safe burials.\n&gt; \n&gt; In its update today, the WHO said there are 15 hospital beds in Bikoro, and MSF is establishing an isolation unit at the site and has deployed four more mobile isolation units, each containing five beds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Based on lessons learned in past outbreaks, the WHO has already produced some technical materials in the local language and sent them to the area, Salama said.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"We started well, and now we need to continue well, and we will need the support of the entire international community for this response,\" he said. In its update today, the WHO estimated the cost of a 3-month international response to be $18 million. The WHO has already released $1 million from its contingency fund, and Wellcome Trust and the UK government have pledged \u00a33 million ($4.1 million).\n&gt; Paving the way for vaccination\n&gt; \n&gt; The WHO is still waiting on approval from the DRC to use the experimental Ebola vaccine, but plans for deployment are already under way as officials wait for a formal decision from the country's health ministry. Salama said that, fortunately, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance has already agreed to pay for the vaccine, and the WHO has part of the stockpile in Geneva ready to deploy.\n&gt; \n&gt; He said, however, that there are many complications in using an experimental vaccine, and it is not a simple logistical effort. He said the vaccine must be maintained at \u201360\u00b0C to \u201380\u00b0C, but cold chain requirements have been mobilized and should be in place as early as the weekend. The WHO has reached out to experienced Ebola vaccinators from Guinea.\n&gt; \n&gt; The effort also requires a field epidemiology push to identify every case and every contact for vaccination, he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"This is a highly complex sophisticated operation in one of the most difficult terrains on earth,\" Salama said.\n&gt; \n&gt; The VSV-EBOV vaccine, developed in Canada and licensed by NewLink Genetics and Merck, was shown to be highly effective in a ring vaccination trial in Guinea during West Africa's outbreak.\n&gt; \n&gt; See also:\n&gt; \n&gt; May 11 WHO media briefing (\n&gt; \n&gt; May 11 (\n&gt; \n&gt; May 10 ( Regarding information relayed in the media's audio briefing.  \n\nThe regions remoteness was touched on several times.

It addresses similar events in the same area of DRC in January and February of this year. \n\nTom Miles of Reuters, in part, asked,  \n\n&gt; *\"...and if this has been around we think since January in the region, why was it not notified sooner...?\"* \n\nDr. Peter Salama (Deputy Director-General of Emergency Preparedness and Response) response;  \n\n&gt; *\"Important questions and and really for the record let me state very clearly, that the first lab confirmation, as I mentioned, of the Ebola outbreak, occurred on May the 8^th. So prior to that there has been no lab confirmed cases that we are aware of, of Ebola in the recent weeks to months.*  \n&gt; \n&gt; *Now as I mentioned earlier, we do suspect that for periods in April, there were cases that have now an epidemiological link to what we believe are confirmed cases.  So in all likelihood the outbreak was occurring unbeknownst to to the authorities during the course in April.*  \n&gt; \n&gt; *Now you refer as well to a report of a distinct outbreak that the ministry of health had discussed in a coordination meeting in the last couple of days in Kinshasa.*  \n&gt; \n&gt; *That was an outbreak that was of 15 patients including 8 deaths that occurred indeed in January and February, in a very similar overlapping geographical area of DRC.* \n&gt; \n&gt; *At this stage we have no information to suggest, and we believe there were two lab samples taken during the course of that investigation, that were negative for Ebola.  The confusion has occurred because some of the symptoms of that disease are non-specific.  Remembering that in DRC there are literally hundreds of outbreaks that have non-specific symptoms that can overlap with the clinical profile of ebola virus disease on any give year.* \n&gt; \n&gt; *So at this point we can not make any epidemiological link between the 15 cases that occurred in January and February, with the last death being in mid February, and this outbreak which was confirmed finally on May the 8th.*  \n&gt; \n&gt; *So at this point we can not make that link in that connection. and would advise you, until there is any further evidence not to create that linkage in the minds of the public because there is no evidence behind it.\"*\n\n\n\n\n", "The most disgusting thing I have seen this month, a community of ebola supporters.

In the health sector, in the absence of the ability to continue the long-term policies needed to strengthen the health system, recent months have been devoted to management of the various health crises in our country, including Ebola, which is the most complex epidemic in history, and the second most deadly after that of West Africa.\n\nAfter several attempts in this direction since February 2019, you took the decision on July 20, 2019 to place the Conducting the response to the Ebola Virus Epidemic (EVD) epidemic under your direct supervision, through the transition of a Technical Secretariat that has been given the task of coordinating all the activities of the response.\n\nI deplore that this Technical Secretariat of Multisectoral Committee of the Riposte to the EVD was set up by a decree of the Prime Minister antedate to 18 May 2019, and countersigned without my knowledge by the Minister assuring my interim, while I was the July 18, 2019 on a mission to oversee the response to Goma.\n\nThe composition of this Committee, whose members have taken initiatives in recent months that have led to interference in the conduct of the response, does not reflect the mutlisectoriality needed to manage the ongoing health crisis. Such a crisis involves several actors and contains issues at different levels on which I would like to attract Your particular attention.\n\nSince its declaration on August 1, 2018, it has been necessary to affirm the leadership of the Government in the management of this epidemic, as illustrated by the daily communication of the epidemiological situation by the Ministry of Health. This strategic communication reassured and demonstrated to the world that the epidemic was managed by the country, thus preserving its image and avoiding a negative socio-economic impact on the regions affected.\n\nThe ongoing Ebola crisis is not a humanitarian crisis. It is a public health crisis that occurs in an environment characterized by problems of security, development and the deficiencies of the health system. Since then weeks of pressure from all sides have tended to make it a humanitarian crisis. whose intervention logic devotes the establishment of a parallel system that never reinforces the existing health system. Thus, the government side will have to ensure that we do not tilt into a humanitarian response, demanding all actors involved in the response to operational and financial accountability.\n\nAnother major issue of this epidemic is the introduction of a new vaccine as part of this response. Here too, strong pressure has been exerted for several months for the implementation of a new experimentation in the DRC. The vaccine currently used in this epidemic is the only one that has proven effective and provides immune protection in 10 days. It would be illusory to believe that the new vaccine (administered twice at 56 days apart), by actors who have demonstrated a manifest lack of ethics by voluntarily hiding important information from the health authorities, may have a determining impact on the control of the ongoing epidemic.\n\nOn the various issues related to this epidemic, including the three mentioned above. it is imperative that the Government demonstrate leadership and coherence in the strategic dialogue with partners and options related to the response.\n\nAs in any war, because that is what it is about in this fight, the lines of command must be clearly identified and defined. There can not be more than one decision-making center at the risk of creating confusion and a cacophony that is detrimental to the response. The uniqueness in the management of such a response responds to the triple imperative of efficiency, coherence of decisions\ntaken and accountability.\n\nThus drawing the consequences of Your decision to place the conduct of the response to the EVD epidemic under Your direct supervision, and anticipating the cacophony prejudicial to the response that will inevitably result from this decision, I hereby present you my resignation of my duties as Minister of Health.\n\nPlease accept, Excellency, the President of the Republic, the expression of my patriotic sentiments.\n\nDr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga\n\n_____\n\n^(***French original transcribed from the .pdf file linked in the 21JUL19 SitRep:***)\n_____\n\n\n* Republique Democratique du Congo \n* Ministere de la Sante\n* Le Ministre\n\n.\n\n* Kinshasa, le 22 JUIL 2019\n* N 1250/CAB/MIN/S/0858 /JSK/JKI/TJI/2019\n* Transmis copie pour information a:\n* Son Excellence Monsierur le Primeier Ministre,\n* Chef du Gouvernrment\n* (Avec l'Assurance de ma tres haute consideration)\n* Hotel du Gouvernrment\n* a/KINSHAHA/GOMBE\n\n.\n\n* A Son Excellence Monsierur le President de la \n* Republique, chef de l'Etat\n* (Avec l'Assurance de mes hommages les plus deferents)\n* Palais de la Nation\n* a/KINSHAHA/GOMBE\n\nObjet: Ma demission\n\nExcellent Monsieur le President de la Republique.\n\nComme Vous le savez, le Gouvenrment est \ndemissionnnaire et en affaires courantes dupis que Son Excellence Monsierur le Primeier Ministre, Chef du Gouvernrment, Vous a depose sa demission le 20 mai 2019.  Dans le secteur de la sante, faute de pouvoir continuer a engager les politiques de long terme necessaires au renforcement du systeme de sante, ces derniers mois ont ete consacres a la gestion des differentes crises santaires qui sevissent dans notre pays, dont celle d'Ebola qui constitue l'epidemie la plus complexe de l'histoire, et la seconde plus meurtriere apres celle de l'Afrique de l'Ouest. \n\nApres plusieurs tentatives entreprises dans ce sens depuis le mois fevrier 2019, Vous avez pris la decision le 20 juillet 2019 de placer la conduite de la riposte a l'epidemie de la Maladie s Virus Ebola (MVE) sous Votre \nsupervision directe, par le trunchement d'un Secretariat Technique qui a recu la missoin de coordonner l'ensemble des activities de la riposte.\n\nJe deplore que ce Secretariat Technique de Comite Multisectoriel de la Riposte a la MVE ait ete mis en place par un Decret du Premier Ministre antidate au 18 mai 2019, et contresigne a mon insu par le Ministre assurant mon interim, alors que je me trouvais le 18 juillet 2019 en mission de supervision de la riposte a Goma. \n\nLa composition de ce Comite, dont les membres ont pris ces derniers mois des initiatives ayant suscite des interferences dans la conduite de la riposte, ne reflete pas la mutlisectorialite necessaire a la gestion de la crise santitaire en cours.  Une telle crise implique plusieurs acteurs et renferme des enjeux a differents niveaux sur lesquels j'aimerals attirer Votre attention particuliere. \n\nDpuis sa declaration le 1er aout 2018, il a fallu affirmer le leadership du Gouvernement dans la gestion de cette epidemie, ce quo s'est notamment illustre par la communication quotidienne de la situation epidemiologique par le Ministere de la Sante. Cette communication strategique a permis de rassurer et demontrer au monde que l'epidemie etait geree par le pays, preservant ainsi son image et evitant un impact socio-economique negatif sur les regions touchees.\n\nLa crise d'Ebola en cours n'est pas une crise humanitaire.  C'est une crise de sante publique qui intervient dans un environnement caracterise par des problemes de securite, de developpement et du carences du systeme de sante. Depuis queques semaines des pressions de toutes parts tendent a en faire une crise humanitaire.  dont le logiques d'intervention consacrent la mise en place d'un systeme parallele qui ne reforce jamais le systeme de sante existant. Ainsi, la partie gouvernmentale devra veiller a ce que nous ne basculions pas dans une riposte humanitaire, en exigeant de tous les acteurs impliques dans la riposte de la redevabilite operationnelle et financiere. \n\nUn autre enjue majeur de cette epidemie est l'introduction d'un nouveau vaccin dans la cadre de cette riposte. Ici aussi, de fortes pressions sont exercees dupuis plusieurs mois pour la mise en oeuvre d'une nouvelle experimentation en RDC. Le vaccin actuellement utilise dans la cadre de cette epidemie est le seul qui a demontre son efficacite et qui donne une protection immunitaire en dix jours. Il serait illusoire de croire que le ouveau vaccine (a deux doses administrees a 56 jours d'intervalle) purpose, par des acteurs qui ont fait preuve d'un manque d'ethique manifeste en cachant volontairement des informations importantes aux autorites sanitaires, puisse avoir une incidence determinante sur le controle de l'epidemie en cours. \n\nSur les differents enjeux lies a cetter epidemie, dont les trois repris ci-haut. il est indispensable que le Gouvernment fasse preuve de leadership et de coherence dans le dialogue strategique avec les partenaires et les options prises en rapport avec la riposte. \n\nComme dans toute guerre, car c'est bien de cela dont il s'agit dans cette lutte, les lignes de commandement doivent etre clairement identifiees et definies.

With us today is the deputy director of CDC's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases,  Stephan Monroe.  He will provide some opening remarks and then we will progress to your questions.\n\nSTEPHAN MONROE: Thank you, for the last few months, the CDC and World Health Organization and other partners have been actively engaged in response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa.  Since the first report surface in March, there have been more than 1,201 cases reported and unfortunately 672 deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  This is the largest Ebola outbreak in history and the first in West Africa.  It is a rapidly changing situation and we expect there will be more cases in these countries in the coming weeks and months. The response to this outbreak will be more of a marathon than a sprint.\n\nI want to underscore that Ebola poses little risk to the U.S. general population.  Transmission is through direct contact of bodily fluids of an infected person or exposure objects like needles that have been contaminated with infected secretions.  Individuals who are not symptomatic are not contagious. The mortality rate in some outbreaks can be as high as 90 percent, but in this outbreak, it is currently around 60 percent, indicating that some of our early treatment efforts may be having an impact.\n\nThe CDC has deployed several teams to the region since the outbreak began.  We currently have 12 staff deployed in Guinea (5), Sierra Leone (1), and Liberia (6) helping to coordinate  the response at the national level, providing health education and assisting with database management.  Our staff are also arranging and training teams of people who can do contact tracing- interviewing those who may have been in contact with ill patients to see if they have symptoms. We have partially activated our Emergency Operations Center to help coordinate Ebola technical assistance activities with our international and federal partners.  And CDC is in regular communication with our international partners- the World Health Organization and Doctors without Borders - regarding the outbreak, as well as the Ministries of Health in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nThis past Friday, the Nigerian Ministry of Health confirmed that a man in the country\u2019s capital, Lagos, died from Ebola infection. The man had been in isolation in the hospital since arriving at the Lagos airport from Liberia, where he apparently contracted the infection.  Health authorities are currently investigating whether passengers or crew on the plane or other people who had contact with the ill traveler are at risk for infection.  \n\nAs you may have also heard, two American healthcare workers at a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, have been infected with Ebola virus. One of the healthcare workers, a physician who worked with Ebola patients in the hospital, is symptomatic and in isolation.  The other health care worker developed fever but no other signs of illness. The physician\u2019s family had been living with him in Liberia. Thankfully, the family members had returned to the United States before the doctor got sick and therefore are not at risk for contracting Ebola or spreading it to anyone here. Out of an abundance of caution, the family is currently on a 21 day fever watch. I want to emphasize that Ebola is not contagious until symptoms appear.\n\nNo Ebola cases have been reported in the United States and the likelihood of this outbreak spreading outside of West Africa is very low. It is more likely that the countries surrounding Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone may see cases because of the wide geographic spread of this outbreak.\n\nWhile it is possible that someone could become infected with the Ebola virus in Africa and then get on a plane to the United States, it is very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers. The Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood, secretions, or other body fluids of ill people, and indirect contact \u2013 for example with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids. Most people who become infected with Ebola are those who live with and care for people who have already caught the disease and are showing symptoms.\n\nNevertheless, because people do travel between West Africa and the U.S., CDC needs to be prepared for the very remote possibility that one of those travelers could get Ebola and return to the U.S. while sick. We are actively working to educate American healthcare workers about how to isolate patients and how they can protect themselves from infection. Today, we are sending out a Health Alert Notice to remind U.S. healthcare workers of the importance of taking steps to prevent the spread of this virus.\n\n1.    Take good travel histories of their patients to identify any who have traveled to West Africa within the last three weeks.\n\n2.    Know the symptoms of Ebola -- fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain and lack of appetite and in some cases bleeding.\n\n3.    Know what to do if you have a patient who has Ebola symptoms:\n\n*     First, properly isolate the patient.\n*    Then, follow infection control precautions to prevent the spread of Ebola. Most importantly, avoid contact with blood and body fluids of infected people.\n\nCDC has issued a level 2 travel notice for these 3 countries. We recommend that travelers \u201cavoid contact with blood and body fluids of infected people to protect themselves.\u201d We have more detailed information on our Traveler\u2019s Health website, which is \n\nI would like to close by reminding everyone that global health security \u2013 keeping the U.S. and the world safe and secure from infectious disease threats \u2013 is achieved by preventing, detecting and responding to outbreaks as early and effectively as possible. \n\nOver the next five years the United States has committed to working with at least 30 partner countries (totaling at least 4 billion population) to improve their ability to prevent, detect, and effectively respond to infectious disease threats - whether naturally occurring or caused by accidental or intentional release of pathogens.\n\n*    Improving these capabilities for each nation improves health security for all nations. Stopping outbreaks where they occur is the most effective and least expensive way to protect people\u2019s health.\n*     The President\u2019s FY 2015 budget includes a request of $45 million to fund this global health security effort, The Global Health Security Agenda.\n\nThanks again for joining us today and now we will open the lines for questions.\n\nTOM SKINNER: Okay, Rebecca, I think we are ready for questions, please. \n\nOPERATOR: Thank you, we will begin the question and answer session.  If you would like ask a question, press star one and clearly record your name.  First, Caelainn Hogan from The Washington Post. \n\nCAELAINN HOGAN: How are the new infections affect foreign national staff working on the ground in West Africa or the international response of the epidemic? \n\nSTEPHAN MONROE: I am sorry, how do these infections affect staff? \n\nCAELAINN HOGAN: Yes, U.S. staff working on the ground in West Africa, are there protections in place or scale up for resources for doctors to protect themselves? \n\nSTEPHAN MONROE: Well CDC is working with other partners to try to make sure that all of the people providing direct care for Ebola patients in the region have the appropriate personal protective equipment and training in order to use that, to protect themselves. \n\nCAELAINN HOGAN: and as of yet there is no such travel restrictions in the region and just trying to prevent the spread of the virus? \n\nSTEPHAN MONROE: yes, so for right now we are issuing our level two alert which recommends that people in the region avoid any contact with infected persons and particularly with blood or other body secretions. \n\nTOM SKINNER: Next question, Rebecca? \n\nOPERATOR: Our next question, one moment.  Mike Stobbe with the Associated Press. \n\nMIKE STOBBE: Thank you, doctor could you talk about what a level two travel advisory is?  How many levels are there?  Is two just one above no advisory, or what does it mean exactly?  And I have a follow up. \n\nTOM SKINNER: This is Tom Skinner.  Marty Cetron has joined us, we will let him answer this. \n\nMARTY CETRON: I am the director for Global Migration and Quarantine where the traveler\u2019s health sits.  And Mike, level one is a watch which is practice usual precautions around outbreaks.  Level two is an alert which is enhanced precautions.  In this case, special recommendations either to populations at risk, such as health care workers or humanitarian aide workers or particular areas where the risk is high that goes beyond just a routine outbreak.  Level three is a warning which is to avoid nonessential travel if you do not have a reason to be there.  Those are the levels that we have. \n\nMIKE STOBBE: Thank you, the follow up, is anyone from the U.S. government or from other governments at the airports watching passengers to see if they are exhibiting symptoms before they get on a plane? \n\nMARTY CETRON: So right now there is a lot of discussion, there was an announcement from Liberia about scaling up a government response to include exit and entry screening and other measures.  And the idea of whether additional border based controls controlling entry and exist points so that the screening can be more effective is actively under discussion by the international response community. \n\nOPERATOR: Our next question comes from Maggie Fox with NBC News. \n\nMAGGIE FOX: Number one do to feel like the authorities in Nigeria are equipped to do all the contract tracing needed, and is the incubation period and the contagiousness for the disease.  There was one report about the guy whose sperm showed live virus for 61 days and I think there are still questions about people transferring the disease if they are asymptomatic. \n\nSTEPHAN MONROE: The second question has to do with the incubation period.  The average incubation period is eight to ten days from exposure to onset of symptoms.  The range is from two to 21 days.  That is why we recommend that contacts of an infected person go on a fever watch for 21 days.  We are aware of the report of the extended secretion of virus in semen, but in that case, there was no evidence of infectious in blood or other bodily fluids. So we are not as concerned about transmission from blood and body fluids -- we do recommend that people use condoms and other barrier cautions.  Use a condom for a follow up period after they have recovered.  To the first question of the contact tracing going on in Nigeria, the CDC has staff in Nigeria who were there for other reasons that have gone to Lagos to assist along with the Nigeria Administration of Health to set up that contact tracing. \n\nMAGGIE FOX: May I confirm who is speaking? \n\nSTEPHAN MONROE: Steve Monroe. \n\nMAGGIE FOX: thank you. \n\nOPERATOR: Our next question comes from Caleb Hellerman with CNN.\n\nCALEB HELLERMAN: Hi, thanks for taking the question.  I have a two parter.  I am curious, do you know how many or an approximate account of how many American health care and aide workers are responding to this outbreak.  I am also curious, you mentioned one of the patients only had fever and no other symptoms, how unusual is it to be that lightly symptomatic. \n\nSTEPHAN MONROE: We do not really have data on the number of U.S. nationals that are in these countries that are involved in humanitarian or other kinds of activities.  So the second question, I mean there is a range of symptoms that are seen with Ebola.  And the brain hemorrhage often associated with the illness in the popular media is seen in only roughly 50 percent of the cases.  Many of the cases do not present with bleeding.  So that makes the diagnosis more difficult at the early presentation because it can be easily confused with other diseases in the area like malaria and lassa fever and others. \n\nTOM SKINNER: do you have a follow up? \n\nCALEB HELLERMAN: no, thank you. \n\nTOM SKINNER: next question, Rebecca? \n\nOPERATOR: It comes from Jacob Ward with Al Jazeera America. \n\nJACOB WARD: There are reports of the passenger that turned himself in in Lagos and then passed away was experiencing diarrhea during the flight.  Given what you know of the disease, I am curious if it falls into the category of direct contact if he had diarrhea in the restroom on the airplane.  And also, the other workers were reported to have been following precautions and wearing the protective equipment, could you speculate or tell us about what the margin of error is that could cause someone to contract the disease even if they were wearing PPE?  Thanks. \n\nSTEPHAN MONROE: Steve Monroe speaking again.  The answer to both of your questions is basically we do not know.  To the first question, we have not heard directly of reports of what kind of symptoms a patient may have had on the airplane.  So we cannot comment on if there were direct exposures that occurred on the airplane.  As to the exposures that the two health care workers may have had, again what we know is that the physician was involved with direct patient care in the isolation wards and outside of the isolation ward.  We do not know at this point where his exposure may have occurred, but it certainly reinforces the need for everyone to maintain strict adherence. \n\nJACOB WARD: If I could follow up quick, the direct contact, if you could define direct contact.  That truly means you are physically touch it, not in the same room with it or with the bodily secretions or anything like that, it is having to touch it? \n\nSTEPHAN MONROE: Touching it and introducing it through some sort of mucus membrane or unbroken skin, a cut on the skin, something like that. \n\nJACOB WARD: great, thank you. \n\nOPERATOR: we have Alice Park with Time. \n\nALICE PARK: I wanted to follow up more on the airport screening.  Can you give us a sense of what they would involve, for example if they were to be instituted here in the United States, what would you be looking for?  Fever, could you clarify a little bit what that would be and how you would distinguish, you mentioned that, how would you distinguish them from other things you would not need to be as concerned about. \n\n\n...\nremainder of transcript here\n\n\n\n", "TEXAS EBOLA VICTIM, THOMAS E.

However if this is EVD then this is quite worrisome given the increase in likelihood of global spread. &gt;...understandable why they would want to hide these potential outbreak...\n\nIn the spring of 2014 the WHO learned the hard lesson of ignoring the alarms of MSF doctors about the pending outbreak.  Delaying meaningful response leads to spread of the disease.  Had the WHO acknowledged the outbreak when first notified, doubt it would have have lead to containment of the outbreak as people from all three of the nations involved, (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), already had citizens infected.  However, having acted 4-6 weeks earlier, the possibility of the outbreak being shortened can not be dismissed. The shorter the length of the outbreak, the less casualties incurred. \n\nLater on in the West African outbreak, these same country's provided the world examples of why ~~hiding~~ failing to disclose incidents is counter productive.  It delays immediate medical response and work on solving the larger problem is delayed.  It should be noted that the 2014-2016 outbreak lead to the development of the vaccines and medicines currently in use to effectively contain spread of the disease and cure those infected. \n\nThen there is the matter of professionalism in Tanzania's Ministry of Health.  Do not mistake the message sent by the WHO when they took over control and management of the Nord-Kivu outbreak.  It put every health department official on notice. Ignoring such matters is tantamount to professional suicide. \n\nWith diseases having brief time periods between symptoms appearing and fatality, response speed is of the utmost importance.

To date, 12 confirmed patients, temporarily hospitalized at the Katwa Transit Center, have already been admitted. transferred to the Butembo CTE. \n\n* The logistics teams have rehabilitated in a few days the main parts of the CTE to allow the proper and dignified care of confirmed patients. The Butembo CTE is now managed by the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF. All the caregivers and support staff who were already working at the ETC went back to work with a smile.

The theme for the hackathon was: \" **How can Ebola response agents better utilize new technologies to achieve their communication goals locally, nationally and internationally? \".** The objective of the event was to raise awareness among young people in Kinshasa, living several thousand kilometers from the epicenter of the epidemic, on the problem of Ebola. \n\n* For 24 hours, about fifty students worked as a team to develop innovative solutions that can help the response teams in their work. The thematic touching several areas, the students had been instructed to form multidisciplinary teams mixing students in computer science, communication / journalism and medicine. \n\n* The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, as well as Ministry of Health partners spent the hackathon in the afternoon of Saturday. They met with students who briefed them on the projects they were working on. All guests were particularly impressed by the quality and relevance of some projects designed by students who have never worked in an Ebola response. \n\n* This Sunday, March 3, 2019, the ten teams presented their project to a jury composed of representatives of the Ministry of Health, Path, Kinshasa Digital, Internews, Congolia, TMB, Viamo, and BlueSquare. The competition was tight and several projects stood out. Creativity and innovation were at the rendezvous. We were able to discover the idea of \u200b\u200ba mobile app to help healthcare providers identify suspicious patients or a connected bracelet that monitors the temperature of contacts during the follow-up period. \n\n* The winning team will be announced at Kinshasa Digital Week from April 12 to 13, 2019. She will receive three months of coaching and coaching at Congolia Incubator as well as a financial contribution from a bank. In addition, during the competition, the Ministry of Health identified some talents who could work part-time in the Ebola response, particularly at the level of the new information management system.

To date, **19 health zones** have reported at least one case of Ebola during the epidemic. Of these 19 areas, **11 did not register new confirmed cases for more than 21 days .** They are Biena, Kayna, Komanda, Mabalako, Manguredjipa, Masereka, Musienene, Mutwanga, Nyakunde, Oicha and Tchomia.

The **two health zones that continue to fuel this epidemic remain Butembo and Katwa,** which reported more than *86% of new confirmed cases* in the last 21 days. In the last 21 days, 80 new cases have been reported, including 48 in Katwa (60%) and 21 in Butembo (26.25%). \n\n  * (\n\n  * (\n\n\n**Community engagement in Butembo**\n\n* Following targeted attacks on Ebola treatment centers in Katwa and Butembo last week, the Ebola response team in Butembo and surrounding areas launched an action plan to end community incidents that disrupted its activities to defeat this epidemic. During his last visit, the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, asked the coordinator of the on-site response to launch a community dialogue to better understand the expectations of the population. \n\n* This plan was elaborated by Butembo's communication subcommittee on February 27, 2019. After its validation by Dr Jean-Christophe SHAKO, coordinator of the response in this city, this action plan is being implemented by the leaders of the sub-committee. -commission communication supported by UNICEF and WHO since 1 March 2019. On the one hand, they hold consultation sessions with community leaders in Butembo to discuss the issue of resistance and violence against the work of the response. On the other hand, the communication sub-committee would like, through these consultation sessions, to obtain the contribution of the Butembo and Katwa forces in order to define ways and means to put an end to the community incidents. It should be noted that religious leaders, politicians, women's associations and cell leaders from the Butembo and Katwa health areas, where more resistance has been recorded, have already been heard. They gave some way out of this community crisis, which is due to the fact that most members of the community tend to associate Ebola with death, the political problems of insecurity and postponement of elections in the community. region. \n\n* When the response teams arrived in Butembo in September 2018, they had already met with political and administrative authorities, economic operators, religious and political leaders, opinion leaders, lobbyists and social groups. civil. However, despite the involvement of several influential groups in society, part of the population did not feel that their concerns were sufficiently taken into account. Thus, all these sessions of community consultations scheduled for ten days will lead to the establishment of a permanent consultation framework between the response team and the community in order to establish a climate of trust between the community and the community. the teams to achieve true community involvement in the fight against Ebola. \n\n \n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since the start of vaccination on 8 August 2018, **85,375 people have been vaccinated**,  including 21,892 in Katwa, 20,740 in Beni, 10,628 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 2,869 in Kalunguta, 2,633 in Goma, 2,317 in Komanda, 2,084 in Oicha, 2,013 to Mandima, 1,357 to Karisimbi, 1,340 to Kayina, 1,340 to Kyondo, 1,254 to Bunia, 1,064 to Vuhovi, 920 to Masereka, 772 to Mutwanga, 769 to Lubero, 767 to Biena, 690 to Rutshuru, 625 to Musienene, 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 469 in Rwampara (Ituri), 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 207 in Kirotshe, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated March 4, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 900, of which 835 are confirmed and 65 are probable.

The press conference focused on three main points: the global evolution of the epidemic, the situation in Butembo and Katwa, the third strategic response plan. \n\n* The presentation made by the Minister of Health at the press conference is ( (French).\n\n* The Minister of Health also issued a ( (English) on the points raised at the press conference. \n\n**Community dialogue in Butembo**\n\n* Community dialogue continues between those responsible for the Butembo response and the communities in Butembo town and surrounding areas. After meeting with the neighborhood leaders of Butembo City, a hundred grassroots leaders and community leaders in Vuhovi, the response coordinators met with about 100 delegates from the Bashu Chiefdom community. As with all the meetings initiated as part of this community dialogue, the objective was to discuss the reasons for the attacks on the response teams in order to make concrete proposals for the resumption of response activities in a favorable climate. \n\n* Concerning the reasons for reluctance, some elements recur in most health zones. Often, at the beginning of the response, community leaders were informed and sensitized about Ebola and the work of the response teams, but these leaders did not always pass on this knowledge to their constituents. The fact that the response teams were accompanied by the police in less secure areas was perceived with suspicion. Some local health providers who were not directly involved in the response have intoxicated the community by spreading messages that are contrary to the messages of the response teams. Of course, the politicization of the epidemic because of the electoral context did not help. Finally, some communities also pointed to the lack of tact of some of the response agents who, due to the urgency, neglect to respect certain local customs and practices.  \n\n* Among the proposals, the participants recommended, among other things, to further involve local health workers in all pillars of the response, to raise awareness, to increase funds to restore security in the region, to involve unemployed youth in the response to minimize rumors and reluctance. \n\n \n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 August 2018, **85,698 people have been vaccinated** , including 21,953 in Katwa, 20,768 in Beni, 10,714 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 2,869 in Kalunguta, 2,633 in Goma, 2,317 in Komanda, 2,084 in Oicha, 2,093 to Mandima, 1,357 to Karisimbi, 1,350 to Kayina, 1,340 to Kyondo, 1,254 to Bunia, 1,064 to Vuhovi, 920 to Masereka, 772 to Mutwanga, 769 to Lubero, 767 to Biena, 690 to Rutshuru, 663 to Musienene, 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 489 in Rwampara (Ituri), 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 207 in Kirotshe, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n\n* **(\n\nIn most community dialogues, one of the demands of the community is that there be more local health workers recruited into the response.

She died at home on March 4, 2019, a day after her husband. Because of the reluctance of the family, the collection and burial dignified and secure could not be made for the woman but they were made for her husband the day before. The family being a member of the Evangelical Church of the African Rite (EERA), the coordination of the response contacted the Patriarch, and curator of customs, the Church to ask for his involvement. Touched by the story of this family, the Patriarch visited this community to raise awareness about Ebola and the importance of respecting the measures for dignified and safe burials. A good example of community involvement. \n\n**Vaccination**\n\n* Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 August 2018, **85,867 persons have been vaccinated** , including 21,953 in Katwa, 20,779 in Beni, 10,785 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 2,869 in Kalunguta, 2,633 in Goma, 2,317 in Komanda, 2,190 in Mandima, 2,084 in Oicha, 1,357 in Karisimbi, 1,340 in Kayina, 1,340 in Kyondo, 1,254 in Bunia, 1,064 in Vuhovi, 920 in Masereka, 772 in Mutwanga, 769 in Lubero, 767 in Biena, 690 in Rutshuru, 663 in Musienene, 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 489 in Rwampara (Ituri), 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 207 in Kirotshe, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated March 6, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 913, of which 848 are confirmed and 65 are probable.

Police and the military are not involved in Ebola response activities and their role has never been to force compliance with sanitary measures. \n\n* Given the numerous security incidents against the agents of the response but also against the families and members of the community who adhere to the response, the Ministry of Health asked the Ministry of the Interior to ensure the security of the goods and services. people in the area. It is unacceptable for health workers to be threatened and assaulted in the course of their work. Likewise, it is unacceptable that families are prevented from burying their relative in a dignified and secure manner because of groups of unseemly people. \n\n* As local health workers do not have the privilege of being exfiltrated when security conditions deteriorate, there is a need to increase security to ensure a successful response. In addition, since the arrival of the response teams in North Kivu in August 2018, the improvement of the security situation in the region is a permanent demand of the population. The return of security is, moreover, one of the conditions issued by MSF to return to Butembo and Katwa. \n\n\n**Arrival of the Director General of WHO in Kinshasa**\n\n* The Director General of WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, arrived this Thursday, March 7, 2019 in Kinshasa.

Administration, and Pierre Formenty, WHO expert on dangerous pathogens. \n\n* The Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, received the delegation to his Cabinet and thanked the WHO for its field work alongside the Congolese teams. He particularly emphasized the contribution of WHO to the rapid rehabilitation of Ebola Treatment Centers in Butembo and Katwa. The reopening of the Butembo CTE, just days after the attack by gunmen, sends a strong message to those trying to disrupt the Ebola response, which is that the agents will remain in office until the end of the war. epidemic. \n\n* The Director General of WHO congratulated the Minister and the Government of the Republic for their strong leadership. Although the epidemic is not yet fully under control, the efforts made have made it possible to contain the epidemic geographically in two provinces of the country. This result is remarkable considering the mobility of the population and the security context. However, the risk of spread in other provinces and neighboring countries remains present as long as the epidemic remains active. \n\n* During the exchanges, particular emphasis was placed on community engagement strategies. Community dialogue has shown that the public wants the Government and the partners not only to fight Ebola alone, but also to help them improve their general living conditions. The Ministry of Health initiated the design of a community development and recovery program to ensure economic and social recovery in the affected provinces after the end of the Ebola outbreak. \n\n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since vaccination began on August 8, 2018, **86,012 persons have been vaccinated** , including 21,960 in Katwa, 20,786 in Beni, 10,828 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 2,889 in Kalunguta, 2,633 in Goma, 2,317 in Komanda, 2,265 in Mandima, 2,084 in Oicha, 1,357 in Karisimbi, 1,340 in Kayina, 1,340 in Kyondo, 1,254 in Bunia, 1,064 in Vuhovi, 920 in Masereka, 772 in Mutwanga, 769 in Lubero, 767 in Biena, 690 in Rutshuru, 663 in Musienene, 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 489 in Rwampara (Ituri), 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 207 in Kirotshe, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated March 7, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 918, 853 confirmed and 65 probable.

The mission in this village was risky because it is surrounded by hills from which armed groups monitor any movement of vehicles and people. \n\n* The aim of the response team was to remove community reluctance against vaccination and household decontamination following the detection of a confirmed case and possible probable cases in the village. The confirmed case is a woman, a known but reluctant contact, who fled Butembo to seek refuge in Kighali. In order to limit the risk of spread of the virus in this village, it was important to carry out all the response activities around the case, namely the listing of contacts, vaccination, the decontamination of households and health facilities, the establishment of the 21-day tracking system, as well as food distribution for all contacts. \n\n* The day before, a team of three epidemiologists had entered the village to investigate. On site, they had met with fierce reluctance from the community and were seriously injured by the angry mob. On Monday, Dr. Shako managed to remove this reluctance thanks to the involvement of local leaders including the mwami, the group leader, the priest, the territory administrator and the zone chief medical officer. \n\n* A large crowd gathered to listen to the speeches of all the speakers. They spoke in turn about the importance of hosting response teams, not attacking them, being vaccinated and respecting all other preventive measures. These words seem to have convinced the population, in particular about sixty contacts who have quickly registered to benefit from the vaccination and start the 21-day follow-up program. A call has been made to other contacts who are still hidden. \n\n \n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since the start of vaccination on 8 August 2018, **86,951 persons have been vaccinated** , including 22,056 in Katwa, 20,817 in Beni, 10,902 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 2,889 in Kalunguta, 2,633 in Goma, 2,399 in Mandima, 2,317 in Komanda, 2,084 to Oicha, 1,357 to Karisimbi, 1,340 to Kayina, 1,340 to Kyondo, 1,285 to Bunia, 1,064 to Vuhovi, 1,057 to Masereka, 772 to Mutwanga, 769 to Lubero, 767 to Biena, 690 to Rutshuru, 682 to Musienene, 527 in Nyankunde, 519 in Rwampara (Ituri), 496 in Mangurujipa, 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 250 in Mweso, 207 in Kirotshe, 161 in Nyiragongo, 130 in Kibirizi, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated March 12, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 927, of which 862 are confirmed and 65 are probable.

In the Congolese health system, each health zone is divided into health areas. \n\n* Weaknesses in community engagement led to the decision to establish local Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) committees in each of the health areas that reported the highest number of community incidents. This approach had already borne fruit in the difficult health areas of Beni, especially the Ndindi district. \n\n* The process of setting up committees is under way in 3 health zones: Katwa, Butembo and Vuhovi. Two criteria were chosen for choosing the health areas to be targeted, namely the existence of pockets of resistance and reluctance as well as the presence of confirmed cases of Ebola. Based on these two criteria, 21 areas were selected, including 8 in Butembo, 7 in Katwa, and 6 in Vuhovi. \n\n* The local committee is responsible for strengthening community engagement by resolving reluctance and carrying out response interventions in the health area. In order to ensure unbiased and unbiased selection of members of this local committee, members are elected by community leaders and influencers at the cell or village assembly. The committee members will then be trained to carry out all response interventions in their health area (household decontamination, community-based surveillance, investigation, dignified and secure burials, etc.). \n\n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since the start of vaccination on 8 August 2018, **90,351 persons have been vaccinated** , including 22,547 in Katwa, 20,994 in Beni, 11,012 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 2,985 in Kalunguta, 2,833 in Mandima, 2,831 in Goma, 2,317 in Komanda, 2,147 to Oicha, 1,540 to Kayina, 1,419 to Masereka, 1,408 to Bunia, 1,389 to Kyondo, 1,357 to Karisimbi, 1,254 to Vuhovi, 1,021 to Lubero, 995 to Biena, 896 to Musienene, 772 to Mutwanga, 690 to Rutshuru, 557 in Rwampara (Ituri), 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 280 in Mambasa, 267 in Kirotshe, 254 in Alimbongo, 250 in Mweso, 245 in Kibirizi, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. \n **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated 21 March 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 993, of which 928 are confirmed and 65 are probable.

Behind these numbers are several hundred Congolese families directly affected by the virus and hundreds of orphans.\n\nTo date, 629 people have died. For the 321 healed people who had the chance to overcome this painful ordeal, returning home is not always easy. Already forced to live with the legacy of the disease, these Ebola winners also face stigma within their community.\n\nThe response, led under the leadership of the Ministry of Health and in collaboration with its partners, has limited the geographical spread of the epidemic for more than eight months. To date, the epidemic has not spread in the other provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo or in neighboring countries, although the risk remains.\n\nThe many scientific innovations included in the response strategy have greatly contributed to these results. Targeted vaccination has helped protect more than 91,000 people, including nearly 23,000 high-risk contacts who have been in direct contact with confirmed Ebola patients. Improving the quality of supportive care and the use of therapeutic molecules have increased the average survival rate in Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) to more than 60%. Thus, more than 6 in 10 people who are admitted to CTE survive.\n\nHowever, beyond medical advances, only community ownership of the Ebola response can lead to the ultimate end of the most deadly Ebola outbreak in our country's history. In all health zones where the Ebola response has been appropriate, such as Beni, Mabalako and Tchomia, transmission of the virus has been halted.\n\nThe community has a collective and individual responsibility to stop the spread of the virus and protect its members by not giving in to calls for violence, rumors and fake experts. Every member of the community, at his level, has a role to play in stopping the spread of the virus.\n\nThus, the first link in the Ebola response is not at the level of health workers in health facilities but in the community. The response begins at the level of the mother who brings her sick child to the health center and accepts that a sample is taken for the laboratory. It is also based on the head of the family, who accepts that all family members are vaccinated after one of them has been infected with Ebola.\n\nIf a reluctant ill person is enough to spread the epidemic into a new health zone, it is also enough for a person committed and responsible to protect an entire family, or an entire neighborhood, against Ebola.\n\nSince the beginning of the epidemic, the response teams have been reaching out to the community through regular community dialogues. The installation of local riposte committees led by district or village chiefs brings the citizens' action center closer together.\n\nWe invite those who have the privilege of being thought leaders to engage positively by sharing messages that support community buy-in to health measures.\n\nDr. Oly ILUNGA KALENGA\n\nHealth Minister  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated March 24, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1,016, 951 confirmed and 65 probable.

These three people were cared for in the same health facility in which seven confirmed patients were hospitalized since March 10, 2019, indicating a possible nosocomial transmission of the virus. However, no decontamination activity could be carried out after the notification of each new confirmed case because of the refusal of the surrounding community. \n\n* As explained in the newsletter of March 26, 2019, infection prevention and control (ICP) is an essential pillar to break the chain of transmission of the virus and stop the spread of the virus. Thus, when a person infected with Ebola is treated in a health center, outside the Ebola Treatment Center, decontamination of the center is important to prevent other patients from being infected later. \n\n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since the start of vaccination on August 8, 2018, **92,172 people have been vaccinated** , including 22,937 in Katwa, 21,125 in Beni, 11,219 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 3,130 in Mandima, 3,005 in Kalunguta, 2,871 in Goma, 2,317 in Komanda, 2,258 at Oicha, 1,630 at Kayina, 1,629 at Masereka, 1,409 at Bunia, 1,389 at Kyondo, 1,357 at Karisimbi, 1,353 at Vuhovi, 1,091 at Lubero, 1,025 at Biena, 936 at Musienene, 772 at Mutwanga, 690 at Rutshuru, 557 in Rwampara (Ituri), 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 342 in Kirotshe, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 250 in Mweso, 245 in Kibirizi, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated March 27, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1,044, of which 978 are confirmed and 66 are probable.

This mobility is the main cause of reactivation of the epidemic in areas of health where the transmission of the virus had already been stopped. \n\n* This is notably the case of Beni, which had no new confirmed cases between 21 February and 20 March 2019. Since 20 March, the Beni outbreak has been reactivated after a person infected with Ebola from Biakato Mine (Mandima) has moved to Beni for treatment. Preliminary investigations revealed that of the seven new confirmed persons notified to Beni since March 20, six are linked to a Biakato Mine transmission line and one was contaminated after attending the funeral of a confirmed case in Butembo. \n\n* The same is true for the last two new confirmed cases in Oicha. These are the family members of a confirmed case child from Biakato Mine who died in Oicha on March 20th. \n\n\n**Vaccination**  \n\nSince the start of vaccination on August 8, 2018, **92,502 persons have been vaccinated** , including 22,950 in Katwa, 21,172 in Beni, 11,288 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 3,226 in Mandima, 3,005 in Kalunguta, 2,901 in Goma, 2,317 in Komanda, 2.258 to Oicha, 1.630 to Kayina, 1.629 to Masereka, 1.426 to Bunia, 1.389 to Kyondo, 1.373 to Vuhovi, 1.357 to Karisimbi, 1.129 to Lubero, 1.025 to Biena, 936 to Musienene, 772 to Mutwanga, 690 to Rutshuru, 557 in Rwampara (Ituri), 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 342 in Kirotshe, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 250 in Mweso, 245 in Kibirizi, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\nThe only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated March 28, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1,059, 993 confirmed and 66 probable.

After the attacks of the two CTEs in Butembo town in late February, a general feeling of fear had invaded both the communities and the response teams. The coordination then initiated community dialogues to listen to the community and rebuild trust so that the communities would accept the interventions of the response (CTE referencing, household decontamination, vaccination, dignified and secure burials, etc.). \n\n* Following the new wave of positive cases from Masereka, Katwa and Vuhovi since mid-March 2019, the Butembo CTE was full and the reconstruction of the Katwa CTE was becoming a real priority. Thus, in consultation with the district leaders of Vighole, Rughenda and Katwa, the communication teams of the response and the socio-anthropologists worked on a plan to rebuild the CTE that would promote the ownership of the CTE by the community. \n\n* Neighborhood leaders were pleased with this initiative as community women were concerned about the future of Ebola-infected patients in the community in the absence of an appropriate care structure for their care. \n\n* Socio-anthropologists have played an important role in defining the practical modalities for rebuilding the CTE and ensuring community ownership. They recommended that neighborhood leaders organize community meetings to ensure transparency in the recruitment of local workers. Then they asked that the traditional chiefs carry out rituals of appeasement of spirits in the presence of the district chiefs and all the members of the community recruited before initiating the cleaning and reconstruction work of the CTE. It was also important to sensitize all workers and the community at large about the importance of seeing the CTE as a community property where all members of this community can entrust their patients so that the experts take care of them with respect. \n\n* Management of the Katwa CTE is now provided by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF. Dr Richard Kitenge, national coordinator of CTE and country leader in the management of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), welcomed the rapid reopening of the Katwa CTE to relieve the congestion of the Butembo CTE. He recalled that the CTE is fully operationalized by local health workers and native Butembo territory. He invited the population to refer to the CTE as soon as possible any patient suspected of having Ebola to increase their chances of survival. According to patient data, 80% of patients (8 out of 10 patients) who were treated less than 3 days after onset of symptoms survived. This demonstrates the importance for people who have been in contact with Ebola patients to respect the 21-day follow-up period and to collaborate with community-based surveillance teams. \n\n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since the beginning of the vaccination on August 8, 2018, **93,206 persons have been vaccinated** , including 23,047 in Katwa, 21,233 in Beni, 11,362 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 3,425 in Mandima, 3,005 in Kalunguta, 2,961 in Goma, 2,333 in Oicha, 2,317 to Komanda, 1,630 to Kayina, 1,629 to Masereka, 1,456 to Bunia, 1,413 to Vuhovi, 1,399 to Kyondo, 1,357 to Karisimbi, 1,187 to Lubero, 1,025 to Biena, 936 to Musienene, 772 to Mutwanga, 690 to Rutshuru, 557 in Rwampara (Ituri), 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 342 in Kirotshe, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 250 in Mweso, 245 in Kibirizi, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated March 30, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1,082, of which 1,016 confirmed and 66 probable.

Some of the communities' concerns can be realized in the immediate future while others will require more in-depth consultations with the technical and financial partners for their implementation. \n \n* The communities demanded that the Government and international partners also invest in improving the overall living conditions of the population, especially by improving sanitation facilities, increasing access to drinking water, improving the road network, to create jobs for young people and to build modern public markets. \n \n* In addition, the establishment of local response committees has already begun in several neighborhoods. These committees allowed the community to own and feel responsible for the success of the response activities in their neighborhood. \n \n* Finally, trust contracts were established between the community and the actors of the response in neighborhoods where the greatest number of attacks had been recorded. By signing this contract of trust, the communities commit themselves to facilitate the work of the teams of the response and to guarantee their safety when they carry out actions in their district. In return, the response teams are committed to always listening to communities and ensuring that response interventions respect community desires and local customs. Following the signing of these trust contracts in several districts of Butembo, the coordination agreed to reduce the use of law enforcement to secure the movement of the agents of the response, to bring the transit center closer to them and set up dignified and safe burial teams composed of influential young people from neighborhoods. \n\n**Vaccination**  \n\n* Since vaccination began on 8 August 2018, **93,613 people have been vaccinated** , including 23,206 in Katwa, 21,270 in Beni, 11,372 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, 3,498 in Mandima, 3,005 in Kalunguta, 2,970 in Goma, 2,333 in Oicha, 2,317 at Komanda, 1,630 at Kayina, 1,629 at Masereka, 1,499 at Vuhovi, 1,466 at Bunia, 1,413 at Kyondo, 1,357 at Karisimbi, 1,193 at Lubero, 1,025 at Biena, 936 at Musienene, 772 at Mutwanga, 690 at Rutshuru, 557 in Rwampara (Ituri), 527 in Nyankunde, 496 in Mangurujipa, 355 in Tchomia, 333 in Lolwa, 342 in Kirotshe, 280 in Mambasa, 254 in Alimbongo, 250 in Mweso, 245 in Kibirizi, 161 in Nyiragongo, 97 in Watsa (Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9) and 13 in Kisangani. \n\n* The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.  **The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated April 1, 2019**\n\n* **Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1,092, of which 1,026 are confirmed and 66 are probable.

Can Ebola pass through direct contact with normal, healthy skin like the palms of one's hands or the arms? Does it only enter the body via moist membranes like eyes, nose, lungs, or open wounds? \n\nThis question is aimed at clarification about just how nasty accidental contact with infectious body fluids from an infected person is.

Can an infected person's sweat which is accidentally brushed onto a stranger's arm infect that stranger through the skin of their arm? \n\nI think clarity about such details will help to calm folks down, because they will have a better idea about EXACTLY what is dangerous and what is not, which precautions to take, and which precautions are unnecessary.

It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely. Sierra Leone has ( a higher proportion of new cases coming from followed contacts, compared to Guinea, suggesting an increasing likelihood that Guinea will be the first and last country affected by the outbreak.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* Liberia reported what was *likely* the first confirmed case of Ebola transmitting sexually from an Ebola survivor.\n\n* Sierra Leone's occupancy rate is decreasing substantially and suspected cases are making up a very large portion of all reported cases.

However, the epidemic should not spread to other countries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the international spread, our model detects Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda as the countries with\n&gt; the highest risk of infection. Moreover, United Arab Emirates and Germany, which does not share boundary\n&gt; with DRC, also present a risk of EVD introduction due to the considered migratory flow. However, we note\n&gt; that Be-CoDiS simulations considering all those countries do not provide any distribution of the epidemic inside any country different from DR Congo. We point out that this forecast is consistent with the current\n&gt; alert of the WHO, that determines that the outbreak does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of\n&gt; International Concern (see ). In spite of this, the WHO recognizes a very high risk of regional spread.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, regarding the calibration presented in Section 3, we deduce that:\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022 The natural spread (i.e., without control measures) in DRC of this strain of the EVD seems quite\n&gt; similar to the one of 2014-16 West African EVD.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022 The current application of the control measures in DRC seems to be quite inefficient and, then, the\n&gt; epidemic spread remains uncontrolled. Despite the use of novel measures, such as the application of an\n&gt; experimental vaccine (see ) in the population at risk (e.g., healthcare workers), the control measures\n&gt; seem to be not enough efficiently applied. In fact, the WHO has recognized some difficulties in their\n&gt; application. The main reasons are the lack of trust of the population on the virus-response teams, the\n&gt; security issues and the difficulties for accessing some groups of the population.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022 The control measures seem to be applied since the beginning of the outbreak by the local authorities\n&gt; in order to reduce the EVD spread.\n&gt; \n&gt; The data from the last weeks that have been provided by the WHO and the DRC authorities show an\n&gt; important increment in the rate of growth of both the number of infections and deaths. According to the\n&gt; WHO, it can be due to the improved activities of detection and response of cases in access points that \n&gt; were previously inaccessible (this could imply that the reported data could be underestimating the real \n&gt; data, so far).

The objective of the study was to better understand if the vaccine was effective and help prevent the number of cases when used as part of the belt vaccination strategy. A more detailed analysis is being prepared and will be published in a scientific journal. \n&gt; \n&gt; * The researchers analyzed the data of those vaccinated between May 1, 2018 and March 25, 2019. ***According to the data collected, the effectiveness of the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine is estimated at 97.5%.*** These first results confirm previous observations on the very high efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP against Ebola vaccine to control the spread of the epidemic. The belt vaccination strategy has been shown to be effective because of the rapid protection of those vaccinated after a single injection and the high coverage achieved in the different vaccination belts (91%). \n&gt; \n&gt; * Of a sample of over 90,000 people vaccinated against Ebola, 71 developed the disease. Of these 71 people, 15 people developed the disease more than 10 days after vaccination, of which 7 were health workers. In this first group, no one died of Ebola. The other 56 people developed the first symptoms less than 10 days after being vaccinated, that is, before they could develop their immunity. It is estimated that the vaccine takes 10 days to offer maximum immune protection. In this second group, 9 people died. This indicates that the vaccine has reduced the overall mortality rate among the vaccinated people who developed the disease. \n&gt; \n\nShould also be noted that during the west African outbreak of 2014-2016, a certain portion of the African population have an immunity to the ebola virus, that it appeared to be passed from one generation to the next, but perhaps with less efficacy.", "The Jefferson Papers: The Epidemic of Fear by Captain Paul Watson ", "Health Care Worker Pleads With UN: Help Ebola Victims Dying \u2018Horrible, Undignified Death\u2019 ", "Liberia: 41 UN staffers under Ebola observation.

This is a problem for the government, as President Sirleaf recently said she sees signs of Ebola getting under control.\n\n**What immediately preceded the creation of the law:** Reporters wanted to cover a protest at Island Clinic by nurses who wanted better pay and better PPE. \n\n**What the Liberian government says:** Journalists are taking photos and selling them to international news organizations and making money off our people's suffering. The government minister in charge of announcing this said on the radio, \"You will report my statements, not what you see yourself.\"\n\n**What reporters think:** We are telling the stories so that the world knows what is going on and so that they donate. We see the destruction up close and personal, and we have also seen our colleague (or written ourselves) about how a LOT fewer donations are being given for this disaster than many other disasters, and that is a problem.\n\n**The effect on the news you receive:** We are unlikely to be able to give accurate numbers on the ground. We are unlikely to be able to tell the personal stories of people suffering from the disease, which is essential for triggering donations. The ability to speak to doctors who are in charge is essential because the WHO has verified that the Liberian government is giving out bogus numbers which they expect to be revised upward shortly. **Under this new law, if the government says there are ten cases, and a doctor knows there are 100, we cannot talk to him and find that out, without explicit government written permission.** \n\nI am in the airport waiting for my very very very very delayed flight to Casablanca-&gt;Monrovia right now and had some time to kill. I am not going there because it is a smart career move. I already have a career. I just got back from Ferguson. I do not need a career play. I am going because I believe in the need for the world to see what is happening and to send doctors and nurses and supplies. \n\nI sincerely doubt any reporters that are there are there for their career, because as a reporter, it is really hard to meet someone with Ebola, make friends with them, watch their treatment, then watch them die. You cannot help but be there to help people. I have not experienced this yet, but I have been told by multiple reporters that are there that I will experience this within days of landing.\n\nIn mid-August, government officials raided and shut down a national Liberian newspaper called the National Chronicle, broke down its front door, released teargas inside, seized two computers and roughed up and arrested every editor and journalist inside, after it published a series of articles critical of the president\u2019s son Fumba Sirleaf, who heads the National Security Agency.

What happened to the third Ebola patient at Emory?\" Many people are openly questioning the CDC's honesty in dealing with the Ebola crisis.  Whether by omission or downplay, the CDC's veracity is at stake with some.\n\nWhen being interviewed by Fox News, Dr. Frieden said:\n\n&gt;\u201cWe are going to tell you what happens, when it happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we do not know something, we will tell you that as well. **We level with people** because that is the most important way, that is the most effective way to get the information across and to get people to understand what we need to do.\u201d\n\nSo, here is a simple question: what happened to the third Ebola patient that arrived at Emory University Hospital on September 9th?  Citing confidentiality, no information regarding the status of the patient has been released.\n\nOn September 18th, it was reported that UK Ebola survivor William Pooley flew \"for an emergency transfusion to an Ebola patient in Atlanta.\"\n\nToday it was reported: \n\n&gt;Philip Hammond has praised William Pooley, the British health worker who recovered from the Ebola virus, after he was flown to the United States **to give blood in the hope that a cure can be found**.\n\n&gt;Mr Pooley, who was the first Briton to contract the deadly virus, travelled to the US earlier this week as efforts to create a vaccine intensify. **It is hoped that his blood may contain clues** as to why his body did not succumb to the illness.\n\nNo mention of the blood transfusion for the third patient.\n\nSo it is really pretty simple; if the CDC has been forthcoming regarding the Ebola virus they should be able to tell us (without violating privacy) what happened to that patient.  Is he still in the hospital, did he recover and go home or did he die?\n\nIn the future, please, tell us \"what happens, when it happens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedit: emphasis added.", "EBOLA Protection - DIY Homemade Medical Suit ", "Special statement by the Minister of Health on the evolution of the ninth Ebola outbreak in the DRC | 28JUN18 &gt; **Special statement by the Minister of Health on the evolution of the ninth Ebola outbreak in the DRC**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This Thursday, June 28, 2018, all people who have been in contact with the last confirmed case of Ebola have completed their 21-day follow-up period without showing signs of contamination. This is an important step in the response to the Ebola outbreak as it marks the beginning of the countdown to the announcement of the end of the ninth Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The end of the epidemic will be declared when the country has spent 42 days, two incubation periods, without notifying a new confirmed case of Ebola.\n&gt; \n&gt; This epidemic was the most complex and difficult epidemic the country had to deal with, mainly because it started in two rural areas at the same time and quickly reached a city of more than one million people. inhabitants directly connected to Kinshasa, our capital where more than 12 million Congolese live. However, thanks to rapid national and international mobilization and the Government's leadership in coordinating the response, we managed to control this high-risk epidemic in just seven weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a real achievement of which we must all be proud. The key to our success is, first and foremost, the effectiveness of the national and international monitoring teams on the ground who have done, and continue to do, outstanding work. They managed to identify and follow 1,706 contacts who were among the first to benefit from the new Ebola vaccine.\n&gt; \n&gt; The use of vaccination in this response to Ebola has undeniably helped to break the chain of transmission and contain the virus faster. Since the start of the immunization microplan on May 21, 3,330 people have been vaccinated and immunized against the Ebola virus. So far, the results of the vaccination have been conclusive because none of the vaccinated people developed the disease nor experienced major side effects.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although we are heading towards the end of the epidemic, the work of the Ministry of Health does not stop there. Our priority now is to improve the resilience of the health system by starting with the expansion of our emergency operations centers in Mbandaka and Kinshasa. As Ebola is a virus whose natural reservoir is located in the equatorial forest, we must prepare for the 10th epidemic. In addition, because of the increasing mobility of the population, it is likely that other epidemics will occur in urban areas in the future. Therefore, we need to learn from this response and strengthen our health system so that it can detect and respond even more efficiently to the next epidemic.\n&gt; END\n&gt;  \n&gt;____\n&gt; **Ebola outbreak in DRC**\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thursday 28th June 2018, all the people who have been in contact with the last confirmed Ebola case have passed the 21-day incubation period of any signs of an Ebola infection.

Either similar rate to 51/day or smaller for all earlier periods.\n\n**Notes:** \n\n* All affected countries are included in the totals for reported cases and deaths. These are only the reported confirmed/probable/suspected cases. In addition, the reported deaths exclude at least 3000 known events that took place outside hospitals, which is especially true with respect to the numbers from Sierra Leone.\n\n* It appears that projections based off the reported numbers may have been significantly skewed upwards due to the reality that the reported numbers better reflected the increase in the response effort, and not the increase in the outbreak growth. On the other hand, I reckon that unsafe burial ceremonies played a huge role in driving the exponential growth we saw in the earlier months, and maybe the ceasing of such activities played a significant role in halting the exponential growth.\n\n* Guinea's enduring caseload does not bode well for West Africa. It indicates that it is very difficult to actually eliminate the disease from an extensive region that has been thoroughly saturated with infections. The possibility of an endemic prevalence of Ebola until a vaccination is found, if found, does seem more and more likely.\n\n* The outbreak is still burning quite fiercely compared to historical outbreaks, requiring at most 7 days to eclipse the largest outbreaks of the past. West Africa does appear to be both containing and squeezing the magnitude of the outbreak, but the outbreak is still large enough to do significantly more damage. There is still no estimation of the on-going non-Ebola-related human cost due to the long-term collapse in medical services, slow down in the national economies, and strict isolation of numerous regions.\n\n* **Liberia's reported cumulative deaths appears to not only include confirmed cases, but also includes suspected and probable cases. In addition, it appears that the MoH does not bother testing deceased patients, or, at the very least, remove negative tested patients (dead or alive) from the database. I am starting to think that the outbreak in Liberia may in fact be a fraction of the reported size. The final datapoint that provides significant support for this relevation is the decreasing occupancy rate. With &lt;30 occupied beds throughout the country in ETUs, it simply cannot be the case that more than ~5 Ebola cases (tested and untested) are being admitted per day on average. Despite this, Liberia is reporting ~25 new cases per day on average, which is probably &gt;5x the maximum number of Ebola cases they are likely handling.**", "Rucka Rucka Ali \u2013 Ebola \u00bb ", "China military-linked firm eyes quick approval of drug to cure Ebola.
