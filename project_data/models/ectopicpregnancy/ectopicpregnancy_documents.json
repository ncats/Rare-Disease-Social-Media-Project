["Do ectopic symptoms get worse? I thought I was having ectopic symptoms but these past few days i have not had them as bad as they have been these past few weeks. Also, I was having pain on one side but now I am also having pain on the opposite side. I am getting a scan in a few days and just hoping the baby is in the right place but if you had ectopic did your symptoms stay the same or get worse? For mine, they definitely got worse. I went from thinking my pain was normal pregnancy pinching and pulling to knowing something was seriously wrong. I can only speak to my experience, I hope it helps! I hope your baby is where they should be and that you have a safe and smooth pregnancy \u2764\ufe0f They do get worse. I felt like I was having some mild gas pains the day before it ruptured, and during the day it ruptured. Then at night was when I started feeling nauseous and like I maybe had food poisoning, but it kept getting worse (vomiting offered no relief) until I could not stand straight at all. That is when I went in. Had lost more than 25% of the blood in my body. It is better safe than sorry IMO. Overall my symptoms got worse, but I did have periods of time when they would be better before getting worse. Most notably, the morning before my tube fully ruptured, I had severe abdominal pain that eventually subsided before coming back way worse the next day.  For the weeks before then, I had abdominal pain on and off that was not specific to the side of my ectopic. I hope everything turns out well for you! I just had really bad abdominal pain but I am pretty sure it was trapped wind as after letting most of it out I feel a lot better! So hoping it is not anything to do with ectopic but I am pretty sure it was trapped wind as I feel much better after letting most of it our Oh good! My personal experience is that it got worse, I had nagging pain on my right side and that is where my ectopic was. I had the same and it ended up not being ectopic. I was under the impression that it got increasingly worse over time to be ectopic does ectopic pain feels like a one sided pain in pelvic area? Yes. But it is not serve and it is the always in that spot. It went away for a day or so but woke up today and it back a little bit but it is hardly noticeable. Seems to be getting better? It got worse. When I found out it ruptured already. They had to remove my left tube. yeah looks like getting  better for you!. Ive had bleeding that feels like menstruation, but accompnied with pelvic pain that extends to the back of my legs. also negative pt and negative blood hcg test. what are the odds im ectopic? If you have negative pt and hCG then it is unlikely you are pregnant. I just got checked out and baby is in the right place and I have had one sided pain so if you are concerned about being pregnant and having an ectopic do not always think of worst scenario possible as it is not always the case! This just happened to me today :( worst pain in my life .", "Ectopic Can ectopic pregnancy be caused by bad genes of the men?", "Ectopic Looks like I am having an ectopic pregnancy. The baby is right next to my left ovary. Having a laparoscopy tomorrow morning to remove it. Anyone go this route and able to save tube and have a Successful pregnancy after? Took 17 months to get this positive that was so short lived. I am thankful for groups like this at times like this \u2764\ufe0f I am sorry for your loss. If you read past posts you will see many women experience ectopic pregnancies and go on to carry healthy babies!", "I Just had an ectopic pregnancy emergency surgery. Well first off hello ladies I am 31 year old and I am recent recovery from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. I was around 7weeks pregnant . This morning at 2:40ish my body woke me up with such pain in my stomach I felt like I had to puke and poop at the same time . I was sweating profusely. My sister in law had to rush me to the e.r . Because my fianc\u00e9 works night and about a 45 min drive from  where we live . Honestly ya\u2019ll I am loss for words and In shock . I was bleeding internally and the pain was so excruciating  \ud83d\ude16 I vomited and pass out from the pain . I was rushed into the ER at 3am and after they figured out what was happening I had emergency surgery at 4/5 am . I lost my baby and my tube and I am devastated. i was able to come home a while after surgery and the doctor said my other tube looks great so trying again should not be to hard . But honestly I feel discouraged from that right now. I do not have a lot of girl friends to talk to about this and I do not  know anyone who has gone through this. Just looking for support and positivity. Thank you in advance . So sorry you had to go through that.  Know that this groups all about support, answering questions, just here to listen. Finding this subreddit has helped me feel less alone after such a trauma. I hope you have a quick recovery and take the time to heal emotionally as well \ud83d\udc9c First off, I am so sorry for your loss. Sadly, all of us in this sub can relate to what you are going through. An ectopic pregnancy is traumatizing no matter what, but emergency surgery and losing a tube is another level (speaking from personal experience). This sub and r/ectopicsupportgroup have been great support and have answered many questions I had during my recovery that I did not want to bug my OB's office. If you ever need anything, we are all here \ud83d\udc9c Thank you so much . I keep crying on and off from pain and heartache . I am just taking a week off from work to rest and get emotionally stable again . I am so sorry you had to go through that. Your experience sounds similar to mine. I also suffered from internal bleeding and had to be rushed into emergency surgery. They were able to save my tube, however. Wishing you a speedy recovery! As hard as it is, your body needs the time to recover. Thank you so much I just added myself to the group . I appreciate your support I feel so lost and just defeated . But I pray this feeling will pass . Thank you very much ! Yea my fianc\u00e9 is a huge help right now . So kind of and gentle,  I could not do this without him \u2026 it is so crazy walking hurts, breathing hurts, back hurts , laying down hurts ugh \ud83d\ude23 I have  cramps on and off just a crappy situation and then the emotional side is whole other story.  This happened to me last month. I am so sorry for your loss and the pain that comes with it. Emergency surgery is traumatic. Losing a baby is traumatic. Give yourself time to grieve. I have gotten in touch with a therapist to help me through it because it is just so hard. We are here \u2764\ufe0f Yes it is so devastating.  I continue to cry out of disbelief that this actually happened and pain physical and emotionally .I am sorry you had to go through the same . It is so difficult . You really cannot understand unless you go through something like this . People keep telling me you can still try again and for some reason I hate hearing it and I also am discouraged at this point :( it is just all hard to process Everyone tells me it is still possible to get pregnant, and that is true. Yet it still does not feel real, so believing it is hard. I do not think they realize that once you have had an ectopic, everything is scary and unimaginable. When you have been blindsided by a rare pregnancy condition, no words of positivity are going to make you feel better. Only time can heal the trauma and only your own heart and head can decide when you are ready to believe in a second chance or hope again. I hear you \u2764\ufe0f Sending so many hugs. Thank your for his . Honestly your words made me feel better ! People truely do not understand unless they been through it . It is really hard for me now to be waited on . I am mom around the house I cook and clean and wash clothes and keep everything up and now my fianc\u00e9 has to and I feel horrible . Such a weird guilt to have but I have it :( I keep crying on and off when I start to re think about everything we went through the pain the emergence surgery . It is a lot to process . Thank you for the hugs I appreciate you taking the time to write me :) I see your post is almost a month old so hopefully you are doing better than you were when you first posted. I am literally going through the same exact thing. And when I say literally that is exactly what I mean. The pooping and throwing up thing, the 7 weeks thing, sweating, internal bleeding, the passing out. We lost the baby and I lost my right tube. This happened last Friday and the struggle has been really real. Crying on and off randomly. I know it is going to get better. Significant others being by your side is a huge help. They do not even know how great they are. Hello . Firstly I am so sorry for you loss . It pains me to know us women have to go through this . But I will say yes it does get better I am currently doing so much better mentally and physically:) I come to terms that it was not my turn and life a\nHad other plans for me . It honestly made me feel better knowing how many women do go on to have more beautiful healthy babies and when the time is right we will try again. \ud83d\udc95 I hope you doing okay ? Take it easy and rest up :) take your time to build your strength back up. I am here if you need to talk :) You are amazing. Just thought you should know.", "Recovery months after ectopic surgery  My first ovulation and period post op was definitely painful. I had the dull aches on both sides, even the side where my tube was removed. Basically when I told my Dr about it the next month, he said as long as the pain was not too much for me to handle, it was ok. However, I think he forgot I was the dumb person who worked all night throughout my ectopic rupture lol. The part that concerns me is your shoulder tip pain, since that was the warning sign for me that I would ruptured. Did to call your Dr? Thank you for your response!\n\nI have a list of my symptoms of every day from the day of surgery to today. When I mentioned this concern to my OB/surgeon, she suggested I take a covid test. Like what?!! \n\nSo then I reached out to my PCP, and she ran blood work and said I have low vitamin b12. That could possibly explain my tingling, but what about all my other symptoms during my period?\n\nI am just very frustrated with doctors now. I am not being taken seriously. I am in the proces of looking for another OB, but it is really hard since it is kind of trial and error. I definitely understand the frustration with Drs. My OB GYN I would seen for almost 20 years completely mishandled me with my ectopic. My HCG peaked at 3400 with nothing seen in my uterus, and she just had me coming back weekly for ultrasounds. I ended up rupturing, and had to have emergency surgery with a different OB. Honestly, it worked out for the best bc I ended up switching to that OB bc I no longer trust my old one. \n\nI think your symptoms can maybe be explained except for the shoulder tip pain. It seems like a lot of period on here have had more painful periods since their ectopics. Low b12 and tingling, ok. But the shoulder tip pain concerns me. Have you had labs done since your surgery to check you blood counts?", "Pregnancy after ectopic rupture Hi ladies. \nI just found out I am pregnant. I had a ruptured ectopic back in February. I was cool as a cucumber about it u til last night and now I am an anxious mess and symptom spotting everything. I have had loose stools all day, but know this could probably be due to the coffee I drank this morning. I have also had headaches. \n\nI go for my first blood draw today, and am feeling so nervous. What should I expect? Will they know pretty quickly if this is another ectopic?! Congrats!  Usually it takes a couple of blood draws to see what your HCG levels are doing - then depending on how far along you are, they would want to do an ultrasound to confirm that it is actually in the uterus this time, based on your previous ectopic pregnancy.  Be open with your doctor and make sure they check soon! I am going today, from what I am reading they should do every 48 hours? But that will be Saturday when they are closed... so I do not know how that is going to work. I will be four weeks tomorrow, and I believe they can typically see at 5 weeks? Yes, some labs do have hours on weekends - so check to see if that is available in your area.\n\nEarliest my ultrasound was around 5.5 weeks I believe.  I told them I wanted an early ultrasound to rule out another ectopic. I am sorry to hear about your rupture in february \nDid you get your hcg results?", "What were your ectopic pregnancy symptoms before your first missed period? If you have had an ectopic pregnancy, what symptoms were present before your first missed period? \n\nI have had a hormonal IUD for a year, and my cycle has been very irregular and unpredictable since insertion.  I am recently experiencing some symptoms that are abnormal and am worried that it could be an ectopic pregnancy. My last period was on April 29, and it was 4 days late (unusual because my period started early almost every month since insertion). My last period lasted for 7 days, which is about normal (usually my period lasts longer than that since I got my IUD). My ovulation occurred about a week ago, and I have had cramps and spotting almost every day since (which is abnormal for me to have it for that long during my mid-cycle). The cramps feel similar to the IUD and period cramps that I used to have when it was first inserted, but a bit different. Not as strong, but still bothering me. I have been feeling more weak and tired than usual over the past week, which is weird because I am currently on summer break for a week now and do not have any current stressors. Since yesterday, my cramps started to feel more like infrequent stabbing and localized pressure pains in certain areas, including my uterus, vagina, rectum, and abdomen. Last night, I was constipated and nauseated for about an hour, and had some stabbing pain in my stomach (which is unusual for me). I am also currently experiencing mild pain in my upper left thigh, which is common during my period. \n\nI have done some research and learned that most of those symptoms are common among ectopic pregnancies. My next period is supposed to start in one week. If I take a pregnancy test now, would the result be accurate or should I wait until a later day? I really hope that all those symptoms are only caused by my IUD, but I want to rule out the possibility that it could be an ectopic pregnancy. I will know for sure if I miss my next period. I am sorry you are worried and not feeling well! I do not know that this helpful at all, but I had no symptoms prior to my missed period. I know some pregnancy tests say they can detect pregnancy early, I have never had any luck with an early test. I would test as much as you want to feel comfortable though. I hope all turns out well! Maybe have a blood test done to check for pregnancy, they are more reliable then urine test. If that comes back negative then it is highly unlikely you might be pregnant. Wishing you all the best :) i kindof have irregular period cycle. and i just started using the femometer app recently to track my period and ovulation (OPK and BBT). I did not know that i have to take BBT same time everyday at first so once i learned that i deleted all my previous BBT.. then i affected my predicted period dates..\n\nMy last period was Feb.27 and initial predicted period is April 4th.. but after deleting all the BBT it changed to April 9th.. I cannot wait a week after the 9th, so i did PT April 3rd afternoon.. I got a really faint positive just around the 4mins time.. I was excited and happy! went to the dr 2days after to confirm, still faint positive.. and i was told that i was pregnant!! but unfortunately it ended up as ectopic..\n\nBefore my period I usually get cramping on my right side.. so i did not even expect anything, i thought i will just be getting my period again after few days..\n\nTaking PT will not do you any harm.. If i am on your shoes right now, i will definitely do it.. and if it comes out as positive, that way you can do something about it right away to avoid further complication.. ectopic could be really dangerous.. hoping the best for you!", "Methotrexate treatment failures after 7 days? Has anyone experienced an unsuccessful methotrexate treatment even after a successful decline on day 7?\n\nI am traveling internationally for three weeks this Saturday. Got methotrexate last Monday and my hCG levels dropped from 54 to 36 from day 4 to day 7. I am going in for a follow up measurement this Friday morning then flying out Saturday afternoon. \n\nI have called my doctor and they have not been super helpful in answering questions. I guess I am just looking for reassurance that I will get good news on Friday. About a year ago I had a failed methotrexate treatment, resulting in an emergency surgery- having my Fallopian tube removed. I posted here about it, also because I found very little out there on the internet that was at all helpful. I do not remember how low my hcg numbers got- but low enough that after a blood draw or two, the doctors seemed satisfied that all would be over. I felt no pain, no cramping, no blood or anything passed. So maybe that should have been a red flag I dunno. But when the tube ruptured, it was pretty bad pain. Like, hospital now pain. And dangerous of course. So I would definitely advise you to have a plan to get to a hospital no matter where you go. Take care, sorry this happened to you it sucks i know.", "Anxiety From Wait ", "Possible ectopic pregnancy on IUD - help!! I woke up this morning with intense, non-stop pain in my uterus. It hurt so much I cried. I have the Mirena IUD so I know what cramp pain or cyst pain usually feels like, and this was not that. I immediately went to see my gynecologist. He found multiple cysts but said there was one that looked like an egg (yolk) and when he pressed around my stomach to find the pain, it hurt around my tube on the right. He is usually very cautious and seemed very alarmed that I might have an ectopic pregnancy. \n\nHe was not sure if he should send me to the emergency room given COVID, so he had me do a blood test and told me to take a pregnancy test in the meantime. The pregnancy test came back negative so I am waiting for the blood tests results which should come in the morning.\n\nIf the test is negative, I am most likely not pregnant, right? I have been oddly emotional and restless the past week and having diarrhea, fatigue. No nausea. If the blood result is also negative, then should I assume that it is just cysts? I just do not want to not do the right steps and then actually have an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy. Not a doctor but my understanding of the blood tests for an ectopic pregnancy would be how much of the pregnancy hormone is in your system. Say you should be 6 weeks along, but the blood work is showing lower levels of the pregnancy hormone than normal at 6 weeks is a sign that it is an ectopic pregnancy. The blood test will be able to tell if there is any of the hormone at all, so if that is negative you do not need to worry about an ectopic.   \nThe pregnancy tests doctors offices use are total garbage, they require a lot of the hormone to get a positive. I went into my doctors at 5 weeks, it came up negative but all the at home tests I took said positive. The nurse told me to trust my at home tests and come back in a week. A week later I went back and their test finally showed positive, and at 7 weeks the ectopic pregnancy ruptured. I recommend buying a 10 dollar early detection pregnancy test from a drug store for extra piece of mind if you have to wait long for the blood work, but the blood work would confirm for sure. Hi dear, did the blood test come back negative ? What was the cause of the intense pain you felt. Thankfully it was a negative test \u2014 it was a really bad cyst apparently but looked like a yolk I guess.  Around what time did you take the blood test? Like how many days past your period or before? I am really scared I might be going through something similar.\n\nThanks ! I am so sorry to hear that! As soon as I had pain, I visited the doctor and that is when he mistakenly thought it was an ectopic pregnancy. I did blood work that day and received the results (negative) the following day. I had not had a missed period, I just had severe pain which caused me to see the doctor, who thought my cyst was an egg. I would recommend starting with a pregnancy test if you can. What other symptoms are you having?", "Pregnant after ectopic Hi all so I  am 4 weeks pregnant and it is been 6 months after my ectopic pregnancy. I am writing because I have dull pain where my ectopic was at. It was my left side and I had a tube removed. I just wondered if anyone has experienced this? Is the side the ectopic was on more sensitive? I went to urgent care already and I have Had an ultrasound done and it is too early to see anything. I am going to I same thinking it another ectopic. But would that mean it is on my ovary if my Left tube is gone? It is only the left side that is a dull ache. No bleeding. I did not have any bleeding with my other ectopic though. My hcg level is only 287 which is ok for where I am at and I have to go again tomorrow. HELP I have not had a healthy pregnancy as of yet, so I am not the best source on this, I am afraid. But, it is perfectly normal, as far as I am aware, to have discomfort after an ectopic at different points in your cycle. \n\nI have been unfortunate enough to experience 3 ectopic pregnancies, and I have had pretty consistent discomfort while ovulating. I believe this is due to a hormone shift issue. As your hormones are definitely busy due to your pregnancy, I would not assume it is another ectopic just because of a dull pain. Schedule another ultrasound for a few more weeks, and have some betas drawn. Those will give you a better idea of what is going on with your body. Good luck! I have been trying to conceive since February, good luck to you, I have similar pain every month when I am ovulating, or when my period is on. Honestly I think it is just ghost pain. I had my right tube removed and it hurts on the same side every month. Best of luck babe Hi Carly, just checking to see how you are doing?", "Has anyone had an HSG test post ectopic? I had one on the 28th &amp; curious how long it took to get results.  I got mine same day. Ughhhhh I am not sure what to do. My sister had hers same day as well. I still do not have mine. I sent a message to let them know I did it the day of but it was right before Memorial Day so I figured there would be a delay in response. They told me they would review and get back to me. Then told me they had to reach out to the radiologist &amp; would follow up. My Dr &amp; nurse are super amazing but I am starting to either think something is wrong or they forgot about me. Def check in again with them about your results. Yup, check in with them! At my hospital, it takes a maximum of two hours \u2013 I do not think it is a very complicated test. 100% check in. I also found out within a couple hrs at hospital.", "How to differentiate a vaginal bleeding from a regular period? Hello, I have been very confused these days...\nCould someone tell me what are the main differences between a vaginal bleeding from an ectopic pregnancy and a normal menstrual period?\n\nI think I got my period on the same day as usual (2 weeks ago) and it lasted an extra day. It came with the same cramps and back pain as always!\n\nBut last week I felt a very strong pain in my abdomen, like a pain of trapped gas (it got worse when I took deep breaths, lasted about 20 minutes and got better with medicine) and since then I have felt pelvic discomfort, it is not localized, it goes from one side to the other. Shoulder pain as well (this is what scares me the most)\nI am going to the gynecologist this week, but I am just worried.\n\nWould not it be too early to have the shoulder pain? I ovulated 4 weeks ago hi, from my experience my period bleeding consistentes of heavier bleeding &amp; cloths. vaginal bleeding from ectopic pregnancy was more like light bleeding, could wipe away but sometimes i did need to wear a pad. never really filled up more than 1 pad a day, bleeding continued for 3 weeks after my period.", "1 ectopic and 3 miscarriages Hello! I had an ectopic in May 2020 and it was treated with methotrexate. Second, a miscarriage in October 2020, but HCG (~300) levels went down to 0 by itself without needing any medical treatment. Third, miscarriage in February 2021. I had D&amp;C as my HCG levels(~2500) were not going down by themselves. Fourth, miscarriage in August 2021. Levels were 420 and had D&amp;C to treat it.\n\nI never passed 5 weeks in any of the pregnancies.\nI never heard my baby's heartbeat.\nDoctors never found sac or anything in the uterus or the tubes in any of the pregnancies.\nDoctors did all the possible tests on the planet and all of them returned perfectly normal results. Did not find anything wrong with any of the tests.\nI got pregnant in the first cycle every time we tried. \n\nI am 25 now, what do you all think of the situation? Has anyone had or heard of my situation? Doctors are very positive, but I am not. I get pregnant, but it does not stay.\n\nPlease respond! Love to hear any success stories. You have what sounds like recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Have you asked for a genetic panel previously? Often it is done as part of a third miscarriage when a D&amp;C is performed. Genetic panel, does that mean karyotype? I believe that a genetic analysis would look at specific DNA segments (markers is the word I think) that are known to be associated with miscarriage. A karyotype counts and compares the overall structure of the chromosomes (to rule out trisomies and other big structural problems with chromosomes) but does not look at the DNA itself to find specific issues. So genetic analysis would show different and \u201csmaller\u201d problems with DNA that cause loss than what a karyotype shows. I will check with my RE during next visit. I appreciate your comment. So sorry for your losses! :(\n\nI had a ruptured ectopic in Jan 2019 resulting in the loss of my right tube. This was followed by 3 very early miscarriages over a year and a half, none of which had very high hcg, all resolved without D&amp;C or methotrexate. My RE said she suspected they were all ectopic, even though we never could confirm that, and even though an HSG showed my remaining tube was open. The going theory is, whatever caused the first ectopic was starting to happen or had happened to the remaining tube. I also had several small uterine polyps which I got removed just in case they were preventing implantation.\n\nWe were told our only real option was IVF, and that is what we have done this year with success. Awesome! You got success finally. I am happy for you. My RE is going to prescribe clomid for our next ttc. I hope it works. Good luck!! I wish you the best, and hope clomid works for you! Thank you so much. We are really hoping for a miracle for us.\n\nI wish you all the best.", "Strange situation, could this be an ectopic pregnancy? Apologies in advance for all the TMI\u2026\n\nMy period was late by 3 weeks and I had MANY negative tests at home, so my dr prescribed a blood test, which came back as 3, so not pregnant. The next day after that blood test, I started what seemed like a normal period with quite a bit of clotting. I am never ever late, but I just chalked it up to hormonal weirdness (I have some mild thyroid issues) and my dr suspected that there may have been a very early miscarriage in there due to my thyroid. Ok\n\nThen about a week after my period, I start bleeding again. It is now been a week of this sort of light bleeding, and my periods are the all or nothing bleed you dry variety. I have never experienced anything like this. I then took another pregnancy test out of curiosity (I read about someone is experience of an ectopic pregnancy this morning and her symptoms sounded familiar) The test came back positive. \n\nSummary:\n3 weeks late - Negative test \nPeriod for 1 week\nNothing for 1 week\nBleeding for past week - positive test this am\n\nWhat on earth is going on?! I am waiting for the hcg blood test results from the test I took this morning. All the bleeding, the missed period, all of it makes me think that maybe it is ectopic? Maybe the negative tests bc my hcg levels were rising slowly?\n\nThanks for any insight. I am not a doctor so I am hesitant to make any diagnosis, but I can share what happened with my ectopic:\n\nWe were ttc so I was kind of obsessive about tracking things, and I had a positive cheapie pregnancy test a couple days before my missed period. The line always stayed pretty light, but I did not know then what I know now and never thought anything of it.\n\nA few days after what would have been the start of my period, I started spotting and then fully bleeding. I would had sex the night the bleeding started so I originally chalked up the spotting to that, but once I started passing clots I assumed it was a miscarriage. I went to my doctor to confirm; my first blood draw had an HCG of around 70, and two days later the level was around 86. So, rising but not doubling, that was the giant red flag, and then confirmed with what should have been a 6 week ultrasound that there was nothing in the uterus.\n\nI am so sorry you are going though this, it really sucks. If you begin to suffer excruciating pain on either side of your belly button, go to the ER right away! Sounds similar a little different to my ectopic I had a period that was odd then light bleeding and then I randomly took a test came back positive (had not missed my period yet) then I started bleeding a few days after my period would have started. \n\nOther than bleeding I had no pain or anything I had slight what I called twinges but they were not painful. My \u201cperiod\u201d I had was odd and then followed by a short period of spotting light bleeding (unusual for me) took a test but it was negative. Time went by and coming up on my period but still like 8 days early a friend suggested I take a test it came back positive. I started bleeding (had I not taken that test I would not have known) about a day or two after my period would have started. Hi. \nI know this is a little old, but wondering in outcome of the second test?\nI have a dr appt tomorrow for why I feel so horrible but basically same as you- 3 weeks all negative.", "has anyone else experienced this? My partner and I wanted to start trying for a baby, we got pregnant super fast, found out we were expecting but when I got to 8 weeks I started bleeding, had some scans and I was rushed in for emergency surgery due to our pregnancy being ectopic. It is been almost 4 weeks since my removal surgery but since then everything has just felt so different. I look at my partner and I just feel indifferent, I see him doing something like biting his nails and my brain just thinks how disgusting he is being. I do not know why this sudden change happened this was the man I wanted to spend my life with and now I cannot even stand him touching me and I just want to be alone all of the time, to the point where I have caught myself day dreaming about living alone and being single. \nIs it because of all the hormones? Or am I just falling out of love? \nI am so confused, if anyone has any advice or anything please help. I am so sorry for your loss. Today is actually exactly 4 weeks after my removal surgery and I feel like I am just starting to even acknowledge what has happened. Please do not be too hard on yourself, you are going through a very difficult time in your life and you do not need to label your feelings and thoughts at this moment. It could be hormones, it could be your mental health, it could be something else but the most important thing is that you do not torture yourself with trying to figure it all out now. I think at the end of the day only you know what you have been through, you were the pregnant one and you were the one on the operating table, no one else, even your closest people will completely understand what you went through, that could be the cause of the resentment you are feeling, but that is just my experience and I am not a health professional, maybe it would be beneficial to contact one? Take it one day at the time and please focus on your physical and mental recovery, we are all here for you if you need to cry or rant or whatever. However if after a (long) while you still feel the same about your husband then you know that these thoughts and feelings are real and are not coming from your emotional or hormonal state. Take care! I am sorry you are dealing with this. I suffer with depression and anxiety and the feelings of disgust you describe are usually the tell tale sign for me that my depression is not in check. That happened to me as well. Honestly it took a while for our relationship to get back to normal, but now we are stronger than ever. I know it was especially rough before my hcg hit zero. In my case, he and I both grieve differently. He deals with his emotions on his own and gets over things fairly quickly. I knew that the loss hurt him, but I think he was more relieved that I was okay than anything bc the doctor had told him how bad it was and how bad it could have potentially been. Obviously he was devastated about the baby but he could have lost me as well and I think that is what hit him the hardest. As for me I was a wreck. I remember laying there before surgery secretly hoping that I would die so that I could be with my baby. I was so devastated when I woke up. I was not looking at it from a place where I was grateful to be alive, I just wanted my baby. Add the hormonal shifts running through my body to that and it was like this horrible cocktail of feelings. My husband tried to be supportive to me and like act like things were normal so that we could get back into a routine and it just made me so mad. Like irrationally angry bc in my mind I did not understand how he could act like everything was okay when the baby we had been trying for for two years just died. I could not stand the sight of him bc he was trying to love me and be supportive and I just wanted him to hate me as much as I hated myself. I think the worst fight for us was around our anniversary, a month after my surgery. He wanted a bj and I told him I would give it to him and I just shut down in the middle of it. We got into this huge fight bc he did not understand why I said I would do it and then just stop. It honestly was kind of the turning point. I do not think he realized until that point how bad of a place I was in mentally. He knew my mental health was not good, but he did not know how bad it was. I accused him of not even caring about the baby and we had to have a conversation about how even though I was the one who went through it physically it was just as hard for him emotionally. It was his baby too and he loved it as much as I did. This sounds super normal, grief makes us feel weird things and it is only been a few weeks! I do not think you are falling out of love just having survived a trauma makes our bodies and minds feel all kinds of weird things. I have been feeling unexpected things too and have found discussing them with a councilor really helpful! I keep feeling this deep resentment that he is ok enough to do things like go to bar trivia with friends when I cannot get off the couch, but talking about it with my therapist was so great to vent in confidence and she also reminded me that everyone grieves differently and wanting to go out with friends is not any less legitimate than needing to be alone on the couch. Wanting to be alone in your sadness is not wrong, just do what you can to take care of yourself and give it much more time", "Ectopic in early 2020. Hi, Im currently 19 and i had an ectopic pregnancy when i was 17. When i found out i was pregnant, i was actually happy because even though i was so young my dream was always to have a family because mine was always absent during my childhood. Knowing i couldnt afford to raise a child, i had no choice but to opt for an abortion.. shortly after many blood test and ultra sounds i found out it was an ectopic pregnancy which made me so afraid and i felt so alone because i couldnt run to anyone.. even my parents. I had no choice but to tell my mum as being underage meant i had to get parents consent to get the methotrexate shot. My dad does not know about this and during my recovery i had to carry heavy things up stairs etc.. im really worried that this might have caused some internal damages that i may not know of and i may never be able to have kids:/ i know everyone on this forum is older and has much more knowledge compared to me .. this experience was so detrimental for my mental health especially not being able to share it with people i love. I am really afraid i might not be able to conceive again due to the ectopic pregnancy.. anyone have any advice for me ?:( appreciate all responses", "Anxiety From The Wait ", "Did most of you with ectopic pregnancy have an ultrasound without seeing anything? I took a positive pregnancy test 16 days ago, and I had an ultrasound today and they cannot find anything? Terrified it would be ectopic. Yes, I had scans for three days that only showed the internal bleeding. Through all of my ultrasounds they never saw anything. Depending on how far into your cycle you are and what your HCG is currently at that will tell you if you should have been able to see anything by now. My HCG is 274! So she thinks she should have saw something.\nShe is most likely thinking it is ectopic. I am going to go back tomorrow or Friday and get the medication, and hopefully that will help resolve things.\nI have a 9 month old, and now I am horrified of something going terribly wrong. The earlier you catch it the better. I am wishing you the absolute best and hoping for the best results. Mine was around 4000 and they could not see anything at all so it became an emergency Thank you! I am hoping so too. I am so glad everything went okay for you. \u2764\ufe0f I would not say it went well, but I also did not listen to my body when it was trying to tell me something was wrong. I made it to about 5/6 weeks before I realized something was off :/ Sorry I should say, I am glad you are alive and well now. \nThat is terrifying because I am currently 6 weeks. I am terrified of rupture. Most likely getting my tubes tied after this.   You are 274 at 6 weeks? Yes, so the doctor says. I had a transvaginal one at almost 6 weeks that they completely missed the one in my tube. Im still pissed about it. Yes. Ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound, they could not find anything until 5-6 weeks. Then they found a sac and internal bleeding in my tube. \n\nDepending on where you are in your pregnancy, it may just be too early. Yes they could not find anything on mine and diagnosed me with miscarriage. Had a D&amp;C and after bloodwork they realized I was still pregnant. I did Anyone that took methotrexate have bleeding an hour after? :/ They saw mine in the right tube when hcg was 2700", "methotrexate Hi,\nI have been diagnosed 2 days ago with ectopic pregrancy on the right tube.

Has anyone else  had such pain because of this drug.?i was told to expect period cramps ..", "Severe Anxiety I just had an ectopic pregnancy at 6 weeks and 5 days. I got a double dose of MTX in the emergency room on Nov 1st, and since then have been relatively okay. Obvious sadness, guilt, etc but what has come to a major head is the anxiety. I have this overwhelming sense of doom and fear of death. Is anxiety a common symptom or am I just spiraling? At this point I am going on day 2 of debilitating, all day anxiety and just want to feel okay again. While ectopics can trigger all sorts of negative thoughts and generally poor mental health, I think you should bring this up to your doctor or start exploring therapy. It sounds like you are experiencing awful stuff that is compromising your ability to live normally. That deserves help. I had 2 shots,10/28 &amp;11/1. In the days after, i too was spiraling. I was so afraid of the what if, and the could bes. I thought i was going to bleed to death, rupture, literally the worst case scenarios were playing in my head. I felt like i was not getting any straight answers from my Drs, and i felt very alone. Every single thing i felt sent me into orbit with anxiety. When I first started to bleed, i was in the bathroom every 15 minutes, to check my flow, o wiped so many times, i hurt myself. Every blood clot i passed, i took a picture of.  Untill a few days ago, when an er Dr that i had seen in the beginning, actually called to check on me. I was 100% honest with her, asked all my far out questions and presented her with all my scenarios, and she was super understanding, and helped out my mind at ease. I was told i can go down to weekly checks, as opposed to the every 3 day HCG monitoring. I am here for you to talk to if it helps ease your mind. Because i was  literally where you are now, and finding someone who felt like i did, was all i was looking for. Wow it sounds like we have been through a lot of the same things. I am writing from the office to get my blood checked right now. \nMy anxiety is definitely the same as yours! At this point I am mildly cramping which is normal but yesterday was one of the worst days of my life and I felt like I was just going to drop dead because of the cramping. \nAfter I made this post, I downloaded the Calm app and did some meditation and I actually feel significantly better today. Thank god because I do not know what I would have done without some relief from my brain. \nI am hoping that after this blood test, I can talk to my doctor again and ask the millions of questions that I have like you did! I did get a friends therapists phone number so I think I may try that route. I have always been an advocate for therapy so I just need to make myself make the call and take the steps to start feeling okay again. It is absolutely normal you went through trauma. If you are feeling you are in a dark place, definitely have a talk with your doctor and perhaps explore therapy/medication to help you over the hump. Remember your hormones are also dropping so that affects you A LOT. It is almost like a post Partum depression imo. I got severely anxious and depressed after each of my ectopics and even with my chemical. Medication and therapy helped me a lot.", "If you have an ectopic pregnancy would it take awhile to get a positive test? I got a positive test at 8dpo it was super faint. Anyway I am afraid I might have ectopic pregnancy bc I am having horrible lower left back pain and I can feel some pain on my left ovary it seems like. Have you gotten an hcg blood draw? I am tomorrow Your beta numbers will tell you a lot more! Make sure you do another one 48 hours later. At 8dpo you would be very early to have symptoms of an ectopic. The pain in your ovary is likely the corpus luteal cyst (after your egg is released this cyst sustains pregnancy until the placenta takes over) \n\nGood luck! Keep us posted. Thank you so much for this information \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc You are welcome good luck today!", "Ectopic pregnancy scare. Hi guys. So I am wondering have you guys ever taken a home pregnancy test and it came negative but you were actually pregnant ? I heard first response tests are very sensitive and can detect it but I am not sure. Heard ectopic pregnancy produce a lower hcg level. It would be extremely unlikely that you received a false negative pregnancy test. Home pregnancy tests are qualitative not quantitative meaning it is looking for any hcg in your system, not necessarily how much. \n\nWhile it could still be too early to detect (most accurate results are after a missed period) hcg will still show up if you have an ectopic pregnancy and generally is diagnosed by multiple beta draws with the hcg not doubling - not from the lack of it. I hope this helps! My first ectopic I got positive then negative then positive. Not really sure why cause my other 3 I got a positive test right away. \n\nIt is unlikely to get a false positive but it is possible. If you think you may be pregnant get a blood test to be sure. I took 5, FIVE high quality pregnancy tests.  All negative.  I thought I was pregnant,  I trusted the test especially when I had light bleeding.   I almost died from an erupted ectopic pregnancy.   Please do not take a chance and trust your instinct.  I did not and suffered 2 blood transfusions and an emergency surgey. I am so sorry for what you had to go through. Did you get a beta hcg blood test done ? If yes did it show up as positive and showed your hcg level ? No, i did not know I was pregnant until after rupture at hospital.  They finally ran blood work then. How did you know to go to the hospital? What were your symptoms ? This happened Thanksgiving evening after dinner.  First I was nauseous with Diarrhea..then vomiting.   I thought I had food poisoning.  Then I became extremely weak and could not stand or walk.  I passed out once.  I still did not know how serious it was and since I was in another state with family I wanted to avoid ER.  Mistake #1.  Then the pain started....worst pain of my entire life...way worse then child birth.  First it was localized pain in stomach on and off.  Still thought food poisoning from breakfast.  Did not go to ER.  Mistake #2.  Then the hours later the pain became so unbelievable I could not do anything but scream in pain.  My entire body hurt...everything...eyelids, fingernails, hair...EVERYTHING.   family drove me to hospital in a snowstorm (colorado mountains)...  every bump in road felt like my body was going to implode!  I thought ai might have a baby on the side of the road.  \nLuckily for me my BIL was a doctor and got me the best treatment.  The A team was called in.  Cat scan, bloodwork, Iv then Emergency surgery.   There was so much blood the doc did not know where bleeding was coming from.  Turns out it had implanted on my ovary...very rare.  Doc said I was 30min from death.  Sorry for being so graphic.  Always trust your body and never try to be the \"tough one\". How many weeks along were you? Any idea possibly 6weeks pregnant or 8? 7 I think, it has been a few years So sorry for everything you went through. It must have been so hard on you.", "Should I be worried? First time mommy so I do not know what to expect. I am about 5 weeks, I have not really had any symptoms. I am nauseous but cannot vomit. I have had really bad abdominal cramps for about 3 weeks, lower back pain and I have noticed I get a little dizzy/blurry vision. I have an appt. for the 21st but I do not want to wait that long. Has there been any blood? For me, I was bleeding for a week and half before I went to see a doctor. I thought it was my period initially and did not even know I was pregnant. If the pain is really terrible you should go to the ED where they can do an ultrasound to confirm whether or not the pregnancy is in the uterus. Just for some peace of mind. Good luck and I hope everything turns out okay for you \ud83d\ude4f I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you for your response. I have not seen any blood, not even implantation bleeding. I have seen where some people did not bleed. I do not want to bother the ER if there is nothing to worry about. I will probably go to an urgent care. Thank you for the well wishes! I do not want to scare you but I did not have bleeding at all and still had an ectopic pregnancy. I had a feeling something was wrong. If you think something is wrong, go to the hospital just to make sure. They can do an HCG blood test and ultrasound. Cramps can be normal and so can dizziness but if you are not sure, go to be safe. It is just a feeling! The father has health issues and was actually told he cannot have kids. Do you mind me asking what you experienced? You do not have to share. I appreciate you responding and I am so sorry for your loss. I got a dark line on a pregnancy test early on. I had bad lower back pain and period cramps on and off. I was not worried but then found out through a blood test that my HCG was fluctuating. Eventually the cramps subsided and I got dull cramps on one side. It changed sides periodically and was on and off. At 5 weeks they continued on the left side and they began radiating down my leg, but they were still pretty dull. I also had crazy pressure in my rectum and pelvis. I went to the ER Saturday and was told I was fine. I went back Monday and was diagnosed and went into surgery that night to remove my left tube. The doctor who diagnosed me was shocked I was not in more pain based on my ultrasound and fluid buildup. Hey there! Go get checked out immediately! Do not wait... even if your husband was told he cannot have kids, what if. I found out I was pregnant and started having really bad back cramps for a couple days. There was no blood, no spotting. I waited and tried to rest more (I am on my feet all day at work). After a week I started getting really dizzy and almost passed out. My husband took me to the hospital and they gave me the WORST news, my fallopian had ruptured from an ectopic pregnancy. They rushed me into surgery because I was bleeding internally. The doctor could have saved my Fallopian tube with an injection to stop the ectopic had I not waited. Do not wait. I do not have any kids... That was my little blessing that turned into one of the WORST day of my life. Listen to your body, better safe than sorry! Prayers for you! Please do not wait until the 21st to get checked over. It is better to be safe than sorry if you have any concerns. If it is an ectopic pregnancy (and I hope that it is not) then finding out earlier can lessen the risk of needing surgery or other complications. Good luck with everything. I cannot agree more, please go get checked out ASAP. Sounds like me. Thank you for sharing your story. I am going to go get checked out. I just seem silly \u201ccomplaining\u201d about things people say are normal. It does not seem like it should be this painful though. I am sorry for your loss! Is your other tube viable? That was the only time I could get in. I am going to go to an urgent care or something. Thank you ladies! Thank you for your sympathy. I had ovarian torsion but it was saved! That too was caught because I felt like the cramps were more than period cramps. Me and my husband are going to start fertility treatment this month! What may be normal for one person can be a bad sign for another. Maybe ask for a sooner appt or at least ask for the HCG test to be sure your numbers are looking good. They do not necessarily need to see you for an appt just to order the test. I really hope you are okay and not going through an ectopic pregnancy. \u2764\ufe0f Do not be afraid to get out checked out even with people saying it is normal. The only symptom I had was a sharp shooting cramp that would radiate down from my ovary to my leg. I felt that pain only twice and it went away when I laid down both times. Everyone told me it is normal but I still felt unsure. I listened to them and thought I was just being a new mom who is paranoid. At 9 weeks my tube ruptured, I had severe internal bleeding, and I nearly died. I kept my tube, but that experience of my tube rupturing could have been avoided. It was by far the worst thing I have gone through physically and I have had a lot of painful things happen to me, from getting run over to having my hand crushed by 150lbs to giving birth with no medication. Do not risk it.  Thank you for all the support love\ud83d\udc9c Sending you and your husband lots of prayers, luck and love! Thank you again for all your help.

How did you make out \ud83d\udc95", "Success through IVF after ectopic pregnancy I had a successful IVF frozen embryo transfer but 3 days ago during my first ultrasound at 6 weeks the doctor found that it was an ectopic pregnancy and I went to ER for laparoscopy surgery to remove my right fallopian tube.

Thank you.", "I hope I am allowed to ask this question: for those of you whose fallopian tubes were ruptured, do you remember what you were doing just before it ruptured?  I am not sure if this really answers your question because my surgeon thought I had a \u201cslow leak\u201d from my tube for a while prior to when I needed emergency surgery, but that day right before things got really bad I was just sitting at my counter doing some work. I had work the day before (retail) and was sorting my 3 kids out the day before (Tuesday). I started bleeding the early hrs of a Wednesday morning went to a&amp;e they told me to come back on the Saturday when I was 6weeks. I called in sick to work and stayed in bed for two days (my decision) Diagnosed it was ectopic and in surgery within the hour. Lost over a litre of blood so glad I stayed in bed those two days or I could have collapsed. I was at work all night when it ruptured (I am a nurse.) I ended up staying until my shift was over even though I felt awful. Honestly I did not know I had ruptured, as I was still able to do my job, and thought with an ectopic I would not be able to function. I did not end up having surgery until about 12 hours later. I ended up losing almost a liter of blood bc it had slowly leaked all day. My husband and I were eating dinner. I had a lobster Mac and Cheese and I cannot remember what he had. I was not done with my food when suddenly I had the urge to throw up and go number 2 at the same time. At this point I thought I had food poisoning. So while I was in the bathroom I randomly passed out. Luckily my husband was there to catch me. When I woke up I told my husband I just wanted to sleep because I was very tired but he wanted to call 911 but I did not listen and went back to bed. Two minutes later I felt nauseous and decided to go to the bathroom by myself and on the way I passed out again. When I woke up my husband said that I had hit our towel rack and sink counter (with my face of course). That is when he decided to call 911. \n\nThe ambulance took me to the ER because my blood pressure was 89/52! \nWhen I get to the Emergency Room they took a blood sample and told me I was pregnant. Then I went to take an ultrasound and they thought I was 4 weeks because it had not passed to the uterus yet. Then I tried to go to the bathroom again and passed out in front of the nurse. They took me back to my room. After that, a technician came in with a long tube thing and determined that I had an ectopic pregnancy. From there I do not remember anything until my anesthesiologist and my obgyn came in and told us that my tube ruptured and I went to emergency surgery. \n\nI woke up and was sent home. Later on I found out they took out 500 ml of blood and one tube out during surgery. \n\n\nWithout my husbands quick thinking I would not be here writing this. I was on my way to work. I knew I had an ectopic and was being treated with methotrexate. My fianc\u00e9 drives me to work (about an hour drive) and about 34 minutes into the ride I started experiencing really bad abdominal cramps so bad that I could not get out of the car. It really escalated quickly. We then went to the closet ER and learned that although my hcg levels dropped from 4300 to 1100 on the MXT, the tube ruptured. I was sitting in my office yesterday morning when I started experiencing intense stomach pains and got so light headed that I started losing my vision and hearing. After about 5 minutes the intense pain subsided to a more dull pain and my hearing/vision came back, but I had the chills while simultaneously was so warm. And it felt like I had to poop so bad but could not! \n\nI was questioning what was happening after reading so many accounts of \u201cunbearable\u201d pain\u2014I was certainly in pain, but was not writhing on the floor. But still I knew something just was not right. My co-worker convinced me that she needed to drive me to the ER, and thank god we went then. The pain started getting worse and worse, and they removed my left tube about 3 hours after I checked into the ER. I am SO GLAD I listened to my body. I know you asked this awhile ago but, I was sleeping. It woke me up. I found myself sleeping in a rather mangled position, idk if that at all couldve been a contributing factor (I had already gotten a methotrexate shot about 2 weeks prior to it rupturing that night)", "My period already?!  I am sorry you are going through this. It is not a typical period, your body is shedding all the lining that had built up in your uterus over the last few weeks. It can last up to 2 weeks.

Your body can ovulate again from around 14 days after surgery, but it might take longer, and so your first \u2018period\u2019 will appear approx two weeks after that ovulation.

She received her second dose of methotrexate last night as her hcg levels continued to rise after the first dose. Her hcg level was 1300 yesterday. She is 6 weeks pregnant. She has been vomiting the last few hours and has 4/10 pain in the area of her tube where the ectopic mass is. She is not bleeding however and her blood pressure is normal but she is in some pain. How do we tell if this is just a reaction to the methotrexate doing it is thing or if this is a sign that here tube is about to rupture? Is it likely that she would be bleeding a fair amount if her tube was about to rupture or already had? Any help would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude4f", "Had my tube removed ectopic 6/17. Still feel like rubbish . What was your experience?  Had my tube removed 5/26 still feel like rubbish but a little better. The first two days were intense. Two weeks felt better. At 3.5 weeks and I can finally go for a walk and do the dishes. I felt a lot better immediately, mainly bc I would had internal bleeding \ud83d\ude10 but post op I was definitely sore and in pain for the first 4-5 days. Felt better a week or so later, and more like myself within 3 weeks. I over did it the first week to take my mind off things which made my pain worse. Try to take it easy this week and rest. I am so sorry you are going through this too \ud83d\udc9c Oh no. Did you feel achy all over , or feel sore In Your abdomen? Yes. I did feel better as far as pelvic pain because they cleaned some of the blood that was leaking but I feel just like the worst hangover \ud83d\ude35 Head hurts . Aching, back hurts. I too think I over did it yesterday, but was trying to stay busy and from not having a breakdown emotionally . Ugh. This is so terrible . Looking forward to the next few weeks I totally understand. I cooked and helped with laundry my first full day home and my husband was like \"sit down!\" lol. I just needed to do something besides sit and wallow. But I did plenty of that when he went back to work and I was alone. Sometimes you do need to let it out though. It is been almost 3 months since mine and I still have bad days. It will build up and then I will be crying on and off all day. \n\nAlso, take your pain meds and try to relax (physically- I know mentally you cannot relax).  Get up and walk every so often to help with the gas pains from surgery- that was often what hurt more than my incisons. I hope you start physically feeling better soon! I think mine was my abdomen more than achy everywhere, but the first week I think everything hurt. Take it really easy and try to listen if your body needs rest and ice and water and all the pain meds and all the good things! I am definitely trying ! We are you bloated too for a while . When I eat my stomach looks so distended :( Yeah I did have bloating, I think that faded after two weeks. I also took stool softeners the first week. My surgery was on April 9. \nI felt better after four weeks. \n\nToday I am actually feeling a burning sensation across my abdomen about where my incisions are, two months after my laparoscopy. Has anyone else experienced this?? It could be nerve pain . I do hope that is all it is!  My PCP and OBGYN/surgeon are not much help. Mine are not either . You definitely have to be your own advocate . I had mine removed in September. I had internal bleeding with mine and lost a liter of blood. So that pain was so terrible. I was out of work for 2 weeks and felt pretty bad the whole time. Did not wear pants or underwear that whole time and for a while after I could not wear jeans. Back to wearing things as normally but took a while. Just lots of sweatpants or loose pants at work. Oh no ! How scary . I have not had my follow up yet , but was told she sucked out blood from my uterus and right after surgery I noticed that pelvic pressure went away . I just feel overall like crap. Emotionally\nAnd physically . I tire Easy and my stomach looks so bloated . I have some  deep aches near my incisions. I finally decided to take a hyrdocodone today and now I feel just weird and wired. I will not be taking that again . Yeah i took percocet and ibuprofen back and forth for the pain. I had a hard time sleeping bc of the traumatic experience and definitely emotionally I could not handle it all. I went to the ER twice after for the pain and then also thinking I had a DVT. Everything was clear but I still get a lot of anxiety when I get any type of abdominal pain. Yes, I think this is such a traumatic experience . I already have health anxiety . My husband does not understand at all. One minute your pregnant then your whisked away for emergency surgery . They did mine at 3 am . So it was not something that could wait. I almost went back to er a couple times , thinking I have internal bleeding or that they perforated an organ . I have the hugest bruise over one incision . It starting to go away but it is as big as my hand ! I also noticed my heart rate and blood pressure are lower than it usually is . My surgeon said if I am not in severe pain fever or chest pain just follow up 7 days post op. Can I ask what your pain felt like ? Was it localized pain? . Today I had a deep pain on side they took tube out it is more in my groin though. Not sure if it is normal or not ? It started with me feeling really faint and throwing up almost uncontrollably and sweating but was cold. My pants all of a sudden were hurting me so I took my pants off. Walking to the car to get into the house I almost fainted and could not feel like arms and legs and my vision was fuzzy. And from there the pain was all over my abdomen and up my shoulders into my neck when I tried to move or breath. Basically the blood was moving and hitting my nerves that run thru my diagphram. I have really high pain tolerance usually and this was an absolute 10/10. I was screaming in pain. It was like what I imagine a contraction to be. Oh my!! Did your dr. Say why your pain was so bad post operatively? He said since I had a lot of trauma to my insides it was fairly normal and since there was a lot of bloating from the surgery and the air they put in you for the procedure That makes sense . I just left my ob dr. She said same thing . I am just hoping to feel better soon. Tonight\u2019s first night I will be alone with my toddler and I am nervous \ud83d\ude2c", "Methotrexate So I had a ectopic pregnancy and my dr could not find where it was at.. she said I should just get the injection, I got my injection 6days ago and it was hell the first 4 days\u2026 now my bleeding seems to be so much lighter my appetite is back but I still have some gas pain, pelvic inflammation, constipation\u2026 I still have a  little achy spot on my lower right side of my pelvis close to the Pubic bone. I do not have a fever or anything that I feel I should go to the ER. So my question is, how long does it take for you to get better and your body heals from this? Are these still side affects from the injection? Has your doctor been doing blood draws and have your levels dropped? Yes it went from 4,100 down to 2,214 on the 4th day after injection, I went today to get another blood work and see if it is still going down. She told me I would not need a second injection because it dropped pretty good but tomorrow I will find out if it is still dropping or not. Okay, they should drop significantly by day 7! You already dropped significantly so I\u2019s say just trust your doctors and try to breathe. Usually peoples numbers go way up on day 4 and back down day 7 so you are already ahead of the game.

I had my second dose of methotrexate today after my hcg only fell from 5000 to 4560 so not even 10% feel really down about the while situation and starting to feel if the first dose did not work why would the second. Has anyone had success with the second shot to treat their ectopic ? Or does this mean I am more likely to have surgical intervention? I have heard many people have success with a second dose \ud83d\udc95 it is quite common. Just monitor your symptoms and have a low threshold to go to emerg. I know that is super disheartening when the first dose does not work :( Hopefully this one does it for you. It is important though to tell your doctor or go to the ER if you feel any one sided pain or fainting, or if you vomit. Good luck to you \u2764\ufe0f Thank you so much ! Hopefully it is works fingers crossed \u2665\ufe0f Thank you so much I appreciate it x Here is my hcg level treated with mtx for my first ectopic :\nIt started with 2342. Day 4 after mtx, it went up to 3042 then on day 7, it went down to 2633. This was deemed as unsuccessful so they gave me a second shot. \n\nAfter the second shot, hcg continued to go down until 0.3. It took 7 weeks for the hcg to go down to that since the first shot.\n\nSo yes, second shot can help. In fact, I have read a lot of stories where second shot is successful. However, do keep in mind that while hcg level continues to go down, there is always a risk of tube rupturing. So do pay attention to any pain and bleeding, and go to the emergency if you experience this. \n\nUnfortunately, the only time you are not at risk of rupturing is when your hcg level is at or near 0. Thank you so much. I am glad there is hope it will work I am just worried with my HCG being high. I am sorry it happened to you.

", "Might be ectopic ? It started at 6 weeks and 4 days. Cramping was very painful and bright red and some brown blood (no clots) that filled 3 pads in 5 hrs. With the cramps I had the urge to poop.. kind of like when you get your period - it helps to poop and cramps usually go away for me. I struggled to poop for an hour to the point where I got barely anything out and ended with watery stools. 2 hrs later pain subsided but bleeding continued. Next morning (today) more blood to fill 2 pads over the course of the day. Then middle of the day I had light cramping pain when I walked and my back was sore. Now I have a dull pain on my right side before bed. \n\nHere is the thing, pregnancy test was positive, urine test was positive, BBT is high indicating progesterone is still high, but I am bleeding like it is my period and cramping more than I would expect to if it was my actual period.  Think I will go to the hospital tomorrow, but in the meantime does anyone have any advice or thoughts? Am I having a medical emergency?

Hi everyone, \n\nI am having pelvic and back pain when I sit. I went to the hospital, they did the scan and the size is still there. I had two dose of mtx, my hcg level is low. The doctor said when the hcg level is 0. The ectopic pregnancy size will shrink. Please let me know, how long does it take for everyone not feeling the symptoms. Thank you. Hope you are okay I am so sorry this has happened. I had two doses of methotrexate my last dose was on the 20th of August and my first was 7 days before that. My HCG is still in its hundreds it went down really fast at first but now it is going down really slowly. I think it is different for everyone try not to worry it can take time and that is completely normal. X Thank you for your comment. Yup, hcg is going down slowly which inhibits me to do normal activities. Not to be the bearer of bad news, but my hcg was low after two doses of mtx and it ruptured maybe a week and a half after the second dose. It just depends. I am sorry you are going through this awful waiting game. I am sorry what happened to you. Hope you feel better now. I am scared and stressed everyday. I am scared to walk, eat, sleep and sit. This is the most painful experience in my life. Hey, I am sorry if I scared you. I know that it feels like you are carrying a ticking time bomb, but I promise you you will know if it ruptures - and hopefully/most likely it will not. \n\nI knew when the pain started to get so bad that I had a hard time standing (felt like centralized gas pains, but like food poisoning) it was time to book it to the hospital (which was 3 hours away from me). Even with the drive, my blood levels were totally fine. I would lost a lot of blood, but was not, like, near death when I got there. I was making jokes in the operating room haha. \n\nAnyway, I hope it gives you some peace to know that you will KNOW if it ruptures. Plus, no one will judge you for going to the ER or calling the doctor if something feels even slightly off. In fact, I think that is encouraged! Thanks for sharing. May I ask what size of your ectopic pregnancy and what was your hcg level at that time ? It was never higher than 3400, and was 909 the time of surgery.  The surgeon said it was 3-4 inches? But they had never been able to see it on the ultrasound. She said I was maybe 8\u201310 weeks? I am sorry for what happened. It sucks that we have ectopic pregnancy.", "Unique situation with lots of waiting I have had an ectopic before, likely in my tubes as it was not in the uterus but could not be found.  Was not trying to get pregnant but did and was sure it would be another ectopic in the tube.  Found out it was not, it is in fact in the uterus, to my utter shock.  However, of course, it is close to the cornual and there is a chance it could turn into an ectopic. It could grow up into the tube, causing tube/uterus to rupture.  It may grow into the top of the uterus, causing a uteran rupture.  It could grow into the uteran cavitiy as an angular pregnancy which has its own list of complications.  \n\nThis one is very scary.  If it grows into the first two areas it is extremely dangerous and I go back for my next ultra sound next Friday.  I was able to get it to that day by saying I need to know sooner than the two week wait they gave me, this would still be an 11 day wait.  I have seven to go after I sleep tonight.  \n\nInstructions were if I have bad pain or bleeding call right away or go to the ER.  Every single pain stops me abruptly as I wonder, is this it, is this the rupture starting.  I think about this all day.  I worry about it all day.  I am using the bathroom multiple times per day looking for any sign of blood.  It is taking over my life and I am scared and stressed all the time.  \n\nI feel like an absolute shit human being for saying this but I just want this to be over.  I think all the time that I should just end the pregnancy before it gets further along.  But I cannot unless I know for sure it is not viable. And so here I sit, waiting in agony for days to pass in order to find out what is happening.  \n\nIt is extremely hard to find this type of situation online as most ectopics start off tubular.  I had no idea a pregnancy could start in the uterus but could still turn ectopic until 3 days ago when my Dr was telling me this.   And not only become ectopic but the most dangerous type to add to the list of anxiety inducing things. \n\nI am scared, I am tired from lack of sleep, I cannot be intimate with my partner in ways I want to be because im on pelvic rest and answers are still days away.", "Endo and possible ectopic Hi! I am 5w 3d and have endometriosis. With endo I always have a dull ache left pelvic area. Now I just found out I was pregnant and the pain is still there. Has anyone else dealt with this? I am worried that it is a ectopic pregnancy. I do have right sided round ligament pain but I assume that is normal. First pregnancy and it took 8 months to conceive. My first doctors appointment is Friday December 17th. Any suggestions?", "I feel cheated. After 3 years of infertility and treatments, we found out we were pregnant, as I was rushed into surgery following a ruptured fallopian tube and internally bleeding 1.6 litres of blood. \nA family member has said things such as 'at least you know you can get pregnant now' 'mine was worse as I had to choose to terminate' and my favourite \"did you tell me so I would feel guilty for having children'\nI feel like she stole my opportunity to grieve naturally as I am told I am doing it wrong. I had this happen to me only two weeks ago, I feel like nothing anyone says can help me because I have wanted this for so long and then it turned out this way..... I feel so much for you I know the way it feels for this to happen I am so sorry \u2764\ufe0f and even though we know IT CAN HAPPEN NOW it did and this was what we where given .... I get you girl I am always here to chat if you need it I feel so alone no one understands \ud83d\ude14\n\nI was told \u201cat least you did not get to see the actual ultrasound\u201d NOTHING makes it easier for me some people just do not know the impact of what they are saying before they say it \ud83d\ude14 This comment sums up my response exactly. Since diagnosis three weeks ago, I have been told approx 9 times that \u2018at least you know you can get pregnant...\u2019 and unless I bite my tongue if this is said in the future my response will become \u2018...and so how does the concept of getting pregnant and the raised future possibility of it killing me/causing even further complications fill me with ease...?\u2019 I get that people mean it from a good place but whether an embryo is created or not, an ectopic pregnancy does not end up in a viable pregnancy and it is traumatic for the woman - especially during covid. I agree whole heartedly, I went to emergency for my first time on July 15th and was told my stomach pain was constipation, two days later I go back to ER with abdominal cramping so bad vomiting cannot walk and they tell me I am pregnant and that what I am feeling AGAIN was pain from constipation and that I will be fine and to go to my ultrasound for my month long pregnancy on July 20th just for \u201ccaution\u201d where I was having so much pain.\n\nThat Monday rolls around and of course I suffered through the pain from the excitement after so long waiting to be a mom was finally happening and go for my ultrasound and it was done hill from there, I had an ectopic that ruptured my right Fallopian tube and I had to have an emergency surgery because I was on the verge of hemorrhage.\n\nI feel bad that nothing I can say can make you feel better BUT I do know what you are going through and how you feel this was like a dream come true for me I just do not understand why it had to end up this way.... like I said im always here if you need someone", "Methotrexate Injection tomorrow! What should I expect? It was determined yesterday after a biopsy of my uterus confirmed no pregnancy cells there that I have an ectopic pregnancy. I am 6w4d today and will be seen tomorrow for the injection. I am really worried about what will come following the injection but know that it needs to happen. Can anyone give me any experiences with the injection or what are some things I could expect? Thank you all in advance! I felt pretty terrible after the shot, hard to say how much of it was from some anxiety. I had some chills/sweats and nausea the first night, the. Had food aversion or \u201csensitive stomach\u201d feeling after. I wish I had asked for an anti nausea med. after the first night I began to feel better but the extreme fatigue lasted a long time. It also came with more than expected emotional processing, sadness, etc . \nI chose to modify my diet which was also a constant reminder of the loss. I ate a low folic acid diet with as little enriched wheat flour as possible and def stop your prenatal vitamins. \n\nFor the shot itself, it is a big needle but I had one shot in each buttcheek and it did not hurt much differently than any other shot. One bruised slightly. The nurses have to gown up in a big production since it is a chemo med. I laid on my side and lowered pants/underwear and then did the other side. It was nice having my partner there to support me (February and still allowed) but the nurses were sweet and offered to hold my hand before he arrived. \nFind a good (or terrible!!) show and binge watch, helped me pass the time and I did not have much energy to leave the couch for a while. \nSending support and hugs. So sorry for your loss. Let us know how it goes. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Sorry that you have to go through this. I had methotrexate on June 30th and honestly I did not have any symptoms/ side effects- maybe I felt a little bit tired but not out of ordinary. Following the shots, I did not have any cramps or bleeding so I thought it did not work and was expecting to get another shot in my next appointment. I was surprised to know that my hcg levels went down to 1300 from 2100 in 5 days. I now have a bit of spotting and I am waiting for my second follow up on hcg levels which is next Monday. So, tbh symptoms can be differ from person to person so do not worry too much. I hope you will have trouble free experience. Thank you so much for sharing. Hoping for the best as far as side effects after but preparing for the worst.\n\nAlso huge thank you for heads up on the nurses. That would have caused a bit of panic if I was not prepared! Thank you for sharing and hoping for the same! So sorry you have to go through this! I had my shot back in the beginning of May. It was one treatment but they broke it up into two shots in my lower back. Now, I hate needles and shots so I was nervous going in but tried to not be tense. It hurt pretty badly, and I nearly passed out. But like I said, needles are a big fear of mine. After I left and got home, I did experience a loss of appetite, some pain in my lower back, and some cramping. It took about a week or so and then I began to bleed off and on for like 4 days at a time for about 5-6 weeks. I went for weekly blood draws after they noticed my levels were declining (at which they were checking my blood every 3 days until the saw a steady decline). By the end of June my levels finally went to 0 and I just finished my first period. \n\nIt felt like a long road to get to the point where my body returned to \u201cnormal\u201d and I am happy to have the experience behind me. My doctor said after about 3 months and having at least 2 cycles, my husband and I can try again. Hoping by the end of August, we can try like we were when I got pregnant the first time. \n\nBest of luck to you! It is scary, but you can do it! Thank you for you comments! I made it through the first part aka the shot. Moving onto recovery and staying positive! That is the goal at least. Just wanted to say this thread has been helpful", "Hi I am really scared can anyone please help ?!!! PLEASE Hi I am young and I have had chlamydia and a UTI I have got Medicine but I am not sure if it cleared up and my pee is still cloudy I am also scared I might be pregnant and I will have and ectopic I am so scared and freaking outttt please help why did you all experience ectopics ?? From what I have read UTIs are not a cause of ectopic pregnancies. Untreated chlamydia can cause scar tissue and increase your chances of ectopic. I have read your post history (sorry if that feels like an intrusion, I wanted to get more information to give you the best help) and I see you have a lot of anxiety around your health. So let us just take the emotions out of this (very hard I know, I also have anxiety) and take a logical look at what is going on with you. \n\nHave you missed a period? And if yes, have you taken a pregnancy test? I see you are young so you might not have easy access to one, but this is the best way to start the process. If you have, and the test was positive, what are the symptoms you have been feeling that are concerning you? And do you know how far along you are? \n\nIf you are pregnant it would be a good idea to see a doctor right away. With your history of having had chlamydia getting screened would be a very prudent move. The doctor will take a blood sample and test your hgc, or pregnancy hormone levels. They will test you again in day or two to see how much the levels have increased. If the doctor suspects an ectopic they may order an ultrasound to try and locate the pregnancy. If it is ectopic and you are not far along they will give you a shot of methotrexate to cause the pregnancy to end. You will be monitored until your hormone levels return to prepregnant levels which tells them the pregnancy is resolved. \n\nI hope this helps you. If you need more information or support we are here. Thankyou so much If you are scared about being pregnant, even if it is ectopic, a pregnancy test will come up positive. From there you can decide what to do if it is positive, and if it is negative then talk to your doctor. I am at the tail end of treatment for an ectopic pregnancy myself and I understand the anxiety all too well, but as scary as that test will be I promise it will give you peace of mind.", "Pregnancy after Ectopic Hi! Last month I found out I was pregnant very early (took a test 3 days before my missed period) within a week I had spotting, and after getting my hcg levels checked a few times they were suspecting ectopic. I had a biopsy of my uterine tissue to confirm since my levels were so low they would not have seen anything on an ultrasound. That same day I got the results that it was and was given a shot of MTX. Within a week my levels were negative and now my next appt is for an HSG test. \nThis whole time I have been so focused on making it through the ectopic and I feel so fortunate that it was found so early and I was able to avoid an emergency situation! But now that I am negative the grief and fear of future fertility problems is hitting me. I would love to hear or connect with women who have gone through this and hopeful who have went on to have a healthy viable pregnancy! \nIt is crazy how something you did not even know existed before it happens to you can wind up consuming you. Just looking for some hope and happiness during this horrible time! Thank you! Xx I actually just experienced this last night.  We have a long journey ahead, but I am believing that we will be great moms one day!", "Ectopic?? Constipation?? Hip pain?? Cyst?? First time pregnancy here so super nervous about everything!! I have having some pains on my right side. Some background. I have been constipated and get constipated during my period regularly and I have had similar pains there before. Also I am a former runner for 10 and a teacher and I regularly have hip pain! I do not have any bleeding. I have had ovarian cysts before so could it be that? I have not had blood drawn yet so do not know numbers. PT are fairly dark but nothing very dark and I could be between 13-15 dpo. Any insight?? Does the pain come and go or is it always there? I also have a history with cysts and thought my ectopic was a cyst but unlike my cysts, the pain would come and go and would be worse at night. Either way, I would *absolutely* get it checked out. Ectopic pregnancies are life-threatening situations so please, do not wait to find out. It does come and go but gets better as I walk around. Is that common with ectopic? It also never gets very sharp and it is not very low- more like in my intestines down to my hip. Hmmm. Mine was quite centralized to the \"ovary\" area most of time. The days leading up to the rupture, I had a terrible aching pain in my groin, too, but I have no idea if that is the case for everyone. Also, walking definitely did not help me feel less pain but I have  heard about things like shoulder pain being a common symptom and I did not have that at all, so you never really know.\n\nBut listen, if you are pregnant and having pain in your pelvic region, absolutely make an appointment with your OB/GYN! Best of luck, dear! \u2764\ufe0f Personally the gas-type pains, and the painful abdominal pressure, were a symptom of the tube rupture (ie internal bleeding), and this is also the cause of the classic shoulder pain. For me that all happened on 22DPO, which I understand is fairly early. \n\nThe cramping I had before the rupture just felt like very persistent one-sided menstrual cramping. Persistent as in, it did not go away at all, and it did not matter whether I walked, lay down, got into different positions etc. For me, bleeding began after the cramping. \n\nHaving said that, my intuition was screaming at me from the moment I got my positive test that something was very wrong, and my instinct said it was ectopic. I unfortunately could not get anyone to take me seriously. \n\nIf you feel like something might be wrong, just do what you need to do in order to get checked out, and hopefully get that much needed reassurance that everything is okay. Wishing you all the best. It is crazy that you say you had intuition from the moment you got your test, because I was the same way. It felt hard to bond with this pregnancy, and when I announced to my family I got this weird feeling like I was a phony or this was not real. My symptoms happened around the same time as yours too! My ectopic, I was for sure convinced I had appendicitis. I had excruciating lower right quadrant pain and it felt like I had knives going up my rectum. The pain came on quick and did not dissipate overnight, I tried different yoga positions, sat in the shower, nothing helped. I kept running to the bathroom feeling like I needed to poop or puke and neither happened. I had not even taken a pregnancy test because my period was not due for a few days so I did not find out about the pregnancy until I was in the ER for \"appendicitis\". So I am 85% sure it is a muscle strain! I tried stretching last night a sleeping with a pillow between my legs. This morning I woke up with no pain! I only get it when I put most of my pressure on my right leg! I am hyper-mobile and I think all the hormones are extra relaxing my already loose muscles and increasing my normal pain! I am still going to get checked out just to be extra sure! I do have upper abdominal pain but pretty sure that constipation - I have always struggled with that Same, I did not bond at all, instead I went into complete panic mode!", "Pregnancy unknown location suspected ectopic.. is it possible it was in my uterus all along??! Hi everyone, I have shared my story briefly here before. I have been reading a lot, and n\ufffcow I am wondering if it is possible that I had a regular intrauterine miscarriage even though I was diagnosed with PUL? My HCG was also tested at 4 different labs..so I am worried about inter-lab variability. Here is my extended story.\n\nOn June 26, about 14DPO, I got a positive test result. The test strips were getting darker and I want getting a dye stealer. So I went for blood tests:\n\n- HCG was 132 on June 30 from walk-in\n-84 on July 2 from walk-in. I started spotting that evening, dark brown.\n-181 on July 4 from ER. I also started bleeding heavy this day, lots of clots. They did an US intrauterine and transvaginal and found nothing (they said it is expected since HCG under 1000). Also I peed before my ultrasound so not sure if they were able to see anything. Here the ER doc diagnosed me with PUL and also indicated that it is a nonviable pregnancy due to the dip.\n-261 on July 6 from pregnancy clinic A\n-283 on July 8 from pregnancy clinic B (switched bc I did NOT like how they handled me at clinic A), and 303 from walk-in (went back to walk in to check levels in case of inter lab differences). I was administered methotrexate that day.\n-541 on July 12, 5 day follow up. Bleeding at this point stopped. \n\nIs it possible that I had a regular miscarriage bc I bled? Or do my HCG suggest ectopic? I am also wondering if I can ask my doctor for another ultrasound or transvaginal tomorrow (for my 7 days post methotrexate follow up), I am really curious as to whether my pregnancy was intrauterine all this time?! Your hcg suggests ectopic. The only sign that went with all 4 of my Ectopic\u2019s was brown blood and red blood off and on. Typically more brown/coffee ground like. You are supposed to pee before a transvaginal ultrasound, but have a full bladder for an abdominal one so they did that proper. \n\nThe bleeding comes with the ectopic resolving itself. You are shedding your lining because despite it not being found in your uterus, your hormones will still cause a thicker lining so bleeding is 100% expected.\n\nLab differences do happen but it is not typically by a huge amount.\n\nAlso - an ultrasound will not show anything most likely since you did already receive Mtx. You could definitely ask but I would not put myself through that personally.", "Could this be ectopic or something else? Since yesterday I have been experiencing abdominal pain and tenderness when I move in an odd way or take a deep breath. \n\nIt kind of feels like when you have bad gas and it will not come out (pressure and discomfort). I can hear gurgling and when I press/massage below my belly button it is tender but makes it feel slightly better. It is uncomfortable to empty my bladder as well. \n\nI have had light spotting that started as a light pink yesterday and today it is more of a brown color. There has not been any chunks or tissue with it. I only see it when I wipe. \n\nCould it just be trapped gas and spotting related to my pregnancy, a cyst or possibly ectopic? It is been over a day and it has not gotten worse.", "MTX dropping HCG I got MTX a week ago. In the ER at the time of ectopic diagnosis, my HCG was 801. On day 4, it dropped to 421. Day 7 lab dropped 380. The nurse who called me today to report the level did not seem bothered by it. But this is not meeting the 15% decrease that everyone talks about. It is more like 10%. All she said was it looked good and to come back in a week for another draw. Should I call back and demand another injection/blood draw sooner than a week? Does the 15% not matter as much since my initial drop was 50%?", "Ectopic pregnancy with Nexplanon implant For reference I am a 21y Female.\n\nI have had severe bloating feeling and hard lower abdomen, i started bleeding too (started off dark brown now red) for about 4 days now, started with groin pain which i brushed off since i started yoga last week and though i may of pushed myself with the stretches, but that didnt account for the bloating and pain in my abdomen mainly on the left side, for about 3 days i just dealt with it and 2 days ago i went to a small gathering where we smoked marijuana and i tried a little bit of mdma, but not enough to get a euphoric high. \nThe next day i went to the tanning salon and when i looked in the mirror my lower stomach looked really puffed out so after i went to boots to get constipation tablets and i saw the pregnancy tests and my intuition told me to buy one, so i did. \nI took the test, thinking nothing of it and the first one came back positive. I was shocked because I have had this implant in for almost 3 years, its supposed to expire in December. Before that I had one in for 3 years. \nI rushed to take another test about 30min later and it was negative, then a few hours later it was negative too. I did a lot of research and false positives are very rare but false negatives are really common.\nYesterday my partner took me to ER but there was only 1 doctor for the whole full department, I was seen after 20min and he made me pee in a tube but when i came back from the toilet the toilet i saw another patient in the room i was in and he was talking to him and getting his heartbeat so i sat down in the waiting room and ended up sitting there for 5 hours with the pee in my pocket and never being called back even after my partner went to ask reception about what to do next. So we ended up leaving because it was really uncomfortable sitting there for so long and id rather just lay down. \nYesterday I set up private healthcare, and tried to make an appointment for today but everyone we called said to go to ER. I felt really uncared for in the ER and dont want to go there just tot wait a ridiculous time again when i am in discomfort but i also dont want to call 999 because i feel guilty for using it when there could be someone dying that needs it more than me.\n\nThis morning i took another pregnancy test and it came back negative, so im really confused.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice, im really worried Is your GP able to order a blood test for pregnancy? Instead of going back to the ER? At least that way you could confirm if you are in fact pregnant. If so - with those symptoms I would go back to the ER", "Possible ectopic? I took 5 positive tests which all came back positive and went to the doctors who confirmed via a urine test that I was pregnant. Unfortunately when they did the vaginal ultrasound the sonographer said the pregnancy location was unknown. \n\nI have been having a dull lingering pain in my left lower abdomen (feels like it is under my pelvic bone). The doctor did some blood tests and said there is no haemorrhage so no immediate cause of concern but could not rule out an ectopic pregnancy. Only other symptom is sore boobs (although this seems to be subsiding). I am quite nervous, deflated and anxious about rupturing if it is an ectopic. Did anyone have similar symptoms? Is the pain quite unbearable if it is an ectopic (pre-rupture)? Any comments would be greatly appreciated!!! Did they do two HCG tests? Did it double? If they increase a little but do not double that is a red flag. If they decrease that is a sign of impending miscarriage. I had dull cramps in front and lower back and some dark red ish spotting. My doctor did not catch it until a week after rupture. If you are at all concerned, call back your doctor! Good luck! And be your own health advocate! I had a dull ache on my left lower abdomen on and off for hours, but no spotting like many other people have with ectopics. When I ruptured, I was lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out, and then had horrible shoulder pain (symptom of internal bleeding).  The pain was bad, but not unbearable, as I continued working until the end of my shift. If you have any of those symptoms, especially shoulder pain, go to the ER! I stupidly did not go bc I work at the hospital and know people there, and also did not want an ER bill if it was not anything serious. Honestly even if I would gone sooner, I would have probably still ruptured, but maybe not had as much internal bleeding. Hi,\n\nThey did the 2 HCGs and it nearly doubled from 1,400 to 2,600. I have been booked for a second scan in 2 weeks so fingers crossed they can locate a baby in the womb!\n\nThank you very much for your advice \ud83d\ude42 Oh my gosh that sounds awful! Thank you for sharing and hope you recovered well. I will most definitely keep an acute eye out for those symptoms. So far, only the dull ache in lower left abdomen (fingers crossed that is it) I was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy last week. I was supposed to be 7 weeks pregnant, but my hcg levels were dropping and they could not find anything on the ultrasound. I had a dull ache on my right side, but it was bearable enough to work through the day. I had some of the same fears and read some things about ectopic pregnancies. I ended up going to the hospital just because I was worried about it rupturing. I ended up having another ultrasound at the hospital and they found internal bleeding. Thankfully I had got there soon enough that I was not bleeding too bad. I had some spotting the week prior to my ER visit, but was very lucky I went when I did. They had to remove my right Fallopian tube. If you have any pain at all on one side do not wait for it to get worse. Please go to the doctor. Best of luck to you and hope you everything ends up being okay! :) Hello. My experience is as follows:\n\nAbout 2 months into my pregnancy after intercourse with my boyfriend I had slight bleeding with no cramping. It was alarming but did subside. About 2 weeks later I had sudden sharp pains and hot flashes followed by dizziness and cold flashes, also sweat covered my entire body even arms and lower legs. I then pooped and thought everything was all fine and I was just constipated. Fast forward about another week, my boyfriend and I went to church on Sunday morning. I was totally fine the whole time and we drove home after having a great service. The second we stepped in the door I started getting extreme pains that felt like a mixture of constipation and terrible food poisoning. The pains quickly worsened and I found myself naked on the toilet sweating and trying to push out a poop because I had no clue what else could have been happening. I almost lost consciousness two times. My boyfriend had to go to work and told me I should probably go into the ER if I dont start to feel better very soon. I laid down in excruciating pain, hardly able to move and definitely not able to lay on my side. Finally, I got up and looked in the mirror to find my lips were turning white. This is when I decided I needed help and became very concerned. I struggled to drive myself and walk into the ER. They asked me to pee in a cup once there, I could not even get one drop out as my whole body would tense up in pain before anything even attempted to come out. They did an ultrasound and I refused intravaginal ultrasound do to the pain. Everyone treated me like I was just there for a free ultrasound or something until the doctor got a look at the pictures.. all the sudden they put me in a room and told me to lie on the bed. I did so very painfully.. the doctor came in and said there was a large amount of blood in my abdomen. Another doc came in and said I was having an ectopic pregnancy that had ruptured and would need emergency surgery to save my life. They removed 600 ml of blood from my abdomen and bladder. The doctor said had I not come in that day I would not be here. The recovery process is very painful and lots of trouble breathing and moving at all. \n\n\n\nMoral of the story: TRUsT YOUR INSTINCTS. \n\nIf your doctors dont seem so concerned but you feel something is truly not right, demand they keep monitoring and testing you because you Do NOT want to experience the worst of it. It is absolutely terrible and life threatening and until you are pale white and bleeding out no one really seems to take you seriously. Take care and God bless you\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude4f Oh my gosh!!!! I am so sorry to hear about your experience!!!!! Glad that you trusted your instincts and pushed for help so they could save your life. It really is scary being pregnant. My family /friends encourage us to have a baby but no one explains the realities of how tough it can be. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a I feel like you are my identical twin. I am dealing with pregnancy with pregnancy of unknown location  and was given methotrexate four days ago. I am in my late 30s, and everyone has been telling me to get pregnant and how easy it is. I guess none of them have experienced miscarriage, this has been a traumatizing experience for me. \n\nThe only difference with me compared to you is that I actually bled quite a bit, but it was not a ruptured tube apparently. Nobody seems to know how to explain it. My hCG levels continue to rise. Also experiencing dull pain around my left ovary.. this sucks. Any updates on your end? Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that!! My HCG levels are rising as well but I am so scared of it not being viable too. \n\nI have an ultrasound scan this week as a follow up from the last pregnancy unknown location \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe it all goes well! \n\nDo you mind if I ask how many weeks you were when they advised taking methotrexate? I was 5w and a few days when I got my methotrexate. They advised me to take it as soon as my HCG levels were fluctuating. If you are arent you might be fine", "Wondering when you got a positive pregnancy test with ectopic? Hi ladies! For those who have suffered ectopic pregnancies, I am wondering when you got your BFP. Was it early like 8-10 DPO, or did it take longer like 14-16 DPO as hcg takes longer with ectopic? Appreciate your help!!! I tested positive like 9DPO I tested positive around 9/10 dpo with 3 of mine. The first one I am unsure because I did not realize I was pregnant for a couple months. \n\nHcg starts as soon as implantation happens so I guess it probably depends on when you implanted not necessarily if it is ectopic or a viable pregnancy but I could be wrong! Not all ectopics have slow or low hcg levels. \ud83d\udc9c for example 2 out of the 4 I had, my hcg rose and doubled perfectly. For the first one you were unsure you had ectopic? For how many months did it go undiagnosed? Did you take a pregnancy test then? No I had an ectopic I just did not realize I was pregnant (I was on birth control and was not tracking anything, we were not ttc) I was about 2 months pregnant when I took the test and pretty much right after I had mtx for ectopic as I ended up in hospital. I just did not know what dpo i would have gotten a positive had I been tracking. The other 3 were 9/10 dpo that I got positives. My first was in July 2018, second Jan 2020 (treated again with mtx), third was august 2020 and lost my left tube (hcg was rising appropriately) and then my fourth Jan 2021 (hcg also rising every 1.5 days) Did you take a urine test at home after two months or was a blood test drawn ? Here are my hcg results from my third and fourth ectopics.. if it is helpful at all.

Then went to hospital and was monitored for a week by taking daily blood draws and ultrasounds until they deemed it ectopic. Thank you so much for all your answers. Really helping me a lot Not a problem. I am sorry you are going through the worry. Are you having symptoms of ectopic? My entire story is on my profile if you needed any more info. Or you can always message me \ud83d\udc95 unfortunately I have become an expert on ectopics. Yes I think so. How bad was your stomach pain? Was it isolated to one side only or throughout the whole region? Did you experience any diharrea or dizziness ? My stomach pain with first one felt like really really bad indigestion. It would come and go and bring me to my knees. I also had rectal pain with that ones The second I thought I would ruptured cause I fell to my knees in serious pain at work (I have a high pain tolerance.) the third ectopic I did not have severe pain - less than my period cramps and more on one side (it felt like a cyst on my ovary almost) it would come and go day to day. Fourth I had some indigestion pain and really just light cramps that felt like my uterus was contracting. They have all been very different. The common symptom with all of them was brown spotting on and off and it would sometimes look like coffee grounds.\n\nWhat symptoms are you having? Did you have hcg checked yet or any ultrasounds?  By really bad indigestion, did you mean a rumbling stomach and gassy stomach ? Or was it heart burn or something else. It varies for people I guess. Thanks again More like severe heart burn. Honestly the pain was more generalized stomach rather than uterine or\nOvarian cramps. If that makes sense. Honestly I just want to say how amazing you are. You are so brave to share such a heartbreaking story and on top of that answer everyone is questions and concerns. Often times it can be hard for people to share their experiences, but I really appreciate your help. Means a lot \u2764\ufe0f Aw that means a lot.\nI just remember every single time how panicked I was and how much it helped to hear others experiences.  one good thing that came out of all this is the ability to help when needed. \ud83d\udc95 \nAny questions big or small dont hesitate to ask girl. I truly do not mind. I tested negative twice, the day I expected my period and a few days later. I had only a little spotting when my period was expected and then bleeding about 3 weeks later. I ended up 9.5 weeks pregnant and had a ruptured ectopic. Did you try to test after the two negative pregnancy tests? I did not and I wish I had! I did have my hcg checked about 4 weeks after unprotected sex, or 3 weeks after my first missed period, it was negative. I am going for blood work again next week since I did not get my period in April either. I really do not know what is going on \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d That is very strange! \nBlood tests can detect hcg at around 6-8 dpo compared to home tests so if it was negative it is not likely you were pregnant then. But now you have missed another period so yeah I would def get another test done \ud83d\udc95 you must be so anxious waiting for answers. Hugs. One more question \ud83d\ude2dI am so sorry I am asking a lot. When you took your pregnancy test two month after realizing you missed your period, was it a big fat positive, or was the line not so clear? I mean if it was two months, enough hcg would have been produced. I am not sure, thanks again ! No worries girl!! Ask away.\nMine was not super glaring. My levels were fluctuating around the 300-500 mark like going up and down. Weirdly enough the night I got the positive tests I did like 6 of them lol and some would be positive some negative. \n\nI was monitored in hospital for a week with that first one before they deemed it ectopics and I got methotrexate. So do you think you were pregnant for the whole two months ? Or was there a chance that you possibly had sex within the time frame of those two months which made you pregnant after? Definitely. I have very regular periods and honestly it just kind of \u201chit me\u201d that I had not had one. I was extremely tired and could not get out of bed while on vacation to visit my family and that is when I said to my sister \u201cshit I have not had my period in 2 months\u201d I did not test til I got back home to my province though. Hubby snd I were not trying at that time (2018) so I was not into the tracking like I was after that ectopic. \n\nMy doc just thinks my levels were rising super slow and going up and down so it did not cause issues until it finally did. I am also a nurse so I was probably brushing certain things off (stomach pain etc) cause I always do. Even when I was on the floor at work in pain I was like ohhhh nbd it is just gas and worked the rest of my 12 hour night shift before going to hospital in the morning.\n\nI remember my last period was on March 5 and I ended up in hospital end of June... so it was actually even longer than 2 months \ud83d\ude15 I was also on birth control but not good at taking it. Did you test early June ? I tested around June 15 Thanks for sharing your story ! I am currently pregnant with my second baby, and fearing I am about to be diagnosed ectopic for the first time, but hopeful I am just over reacting. I do not have pain during the day but at night if I roll onto my right side in my sleep the pain is excruciating (I also have a high pain tolerance). It is lower right quadrant pain, that I also at first was trying to pass off as indigestion. No spotting or bleeding yet though so praying I am wrong and it is something else. If I still had an appendix I would swear it was rupturing again every night in my sleep. I would definitely go get checked out, love! I have also got super high pain tolerance and there was nothing that compared to the weird pain I had with ectopics. Have you had your hcg checked? It def could be something completely unrelated like a corpus luteal cyst etc but worth getting looked at just incase \ud83d\udc96 My first checkup is tomorrow so I have been holding out for that! Hopefully she just sends me straight for an ultrasound to get it checked out. Sending you lots of good vibes and well wishes on your IVF journey ! Sending alllll the good thoughts and vibes to you as well, girl! \ud83d\udc96\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb How did you make out after?", "The cost of ectopic miscarriage I was 9 weeks pregnant. On Thursday I started bleeding and my OB advised I go to the ER. After some bloodwork and an ultrasound they confirmed my ectopic pregnancy. Today I returned to the ER as instructed and it was confirmed that my hormone levels had dropped. While I am emotionally devastated, Im also trying to see the silver lining - I am grateful I do not need surgery, because my body is protecting me with a miscarriage. But I am also recently out of work and worried about ER costs. I am reading online that it could cost upwards to $30k. I did not spend the night in the ER and did not need more than bloodwork and the ultrasound on day one, and bloodwork today. I am wondering how I should prepare myself emotionally for the bill. Beyond the emotional costs, would anyone be willing to share what it cost them to go to the ER? So I had surgery and ended up being admitted for the night, but my bill was $22,000. This was 7 years ago, but I would imagine your bill would not be this high since you did not get the surgery. \n\nI am not too familiar (so do not run with this)  but I think you can call the hospital billing department, explain your situation, and work out a smaller payment with a payment plan.\n\nIt really sucks you have to worry about that on top of everything else going on. My most expensive ER bill was from a couple weeks after my first ectopic. It turned out I was just having residual abdominal pain from the methotrexate, but I had an IV, morphine, and ultrasound, and consultation with the on call OB (who happened to be out of network) and my bill ended up being around $1600. When I went to the ER to have my second ectopic diagnosed, I had an ultrasound and bloodwork, consultation with an on call OB, and recommendation to follow up with my dr within days for treatment. That one ran closer to 600-700. I am sorry you are going through this and I am sorry our shitty healthcare system charges us so much to not take home a healthy baby, but I hope your bill does not end up being nearly as high as your research led you to believe! Salt in the wound indeed. I was charged $200 bc that is my hospital copay My insurance covered mine but it was close to 10000 when I looked at the bill...", "Methotrexate questions For those who have taken this medicine for ectopic pregnancy what were your hcg levels when you got it, how far along were you, and did it work for you? Any side effects?\n\nI am approx. 6 weeks along and my pregnancy is looking more and more like an ectopic. I have had bleeding on and off since week 4, low and barely doubling beta\u2019s, 2 ultrasounds so far showing an empty uterus. I have another ultrasound in 2 days to check again. My dr is recommending a D&amp;C to check for fetal cells in the uterus, if negative then will move on to methotrexate. Has anyone else had this recommended to them? I feel like we should just treat it as ectopic at this point since ultrasounds are showing an empty uterus. My HCG as of today is 950.", "current ectopic pregnancy HELP! My gyno wants to rule to ectopic but need one more test for HCG. I just starting spotting/bleeding today blood is very clotty that is coming out. How did you know you had internal bleeding ? What were your symptoms please help I do not want my tube to rupture but doctor wants me to wait till tomorrow I knew mine ruptured when I woke up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain and rushed to the er. At that point I had already been bleeding for around 5 weeks straight, including the heaviest flow and worst cramps I have ever had, and then one week no bleeding. I thought I had a freakishly long period and did not find out it was pregnancy until around a week before it ruptured. I was supposed to have a third hcg test the next day, but it ruptured before then. \n\nIf you are having internal bleeding, you will definitely be able to tell, it hurts real bad, but you can have vaginal bleeding, even for weeks before rupture, so that in itself does not mean a rupture is coming right away. The only imminent warning sign I did notice a few days before the rupture was a barely noticeable twinge near the site - one of those things where you cannot tell if you really felt it or imagined it. I had 2 or 3 of those in the days leading up to my rupture and that was the only warning sign that it might rupture soon When I ruptured it was very painful. It felt like I had intense food poisoning plus a sharp stabbing pain that only progressed in intensity as time went by. I also was sweating profusely, felt insanely thirsty (I have never felt thirst like that before or since), and was having light headed/ tunnel vision. \n\nOf course if you feel that something is off get it checked out. Even after my surgery I was scared my stitches were going to rupture (I did not lose my ruptured tube). This is such an anxiety filled experience and definitely err on the side of caution. I am sorry you are going through this. I went to the hospital because my doctor called in the script for methotrexate 6 hours later they decided they want to wait for one more HCG test. I am just worried mine is going to rupture before my results tomorrow. I have slight cramping on my left side near my ovaries What do you mean twinge near the site I started bleeding heavy red a week before my ectopic was diagnosed. It looked like a miscarriage that begin with brown spotting around 6 weeks. I never had pain on the side it was diagnosed either. I have started on the meds so have yet to see if it is decreasing. Doc said the bleeding was me shedding the lining in the uterus, not related to the ectopic from my understanding. From everything I have read and what the doctor has said, if you start feeling stabbing pain, are light headed, heart racing etc call 911 or go to the ER. Hang in there and just be aware of intense pain or those other red flag sensations. \u2764\ufe0f I started spotting very lightly 2 weeks before bleeding more heavily. None of the two gynecologisys I saw wanted to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy at 5 weeks, they told me to wait until week 8 and then see them. One night I started bleeding stronger with brighter blood, felt constant pain in my lower abdomen, felt weak and had an uneasy stomach so I went to the ER. They could not believe that doctors who saw me a couple days prior did not send me straight to the hospital. My tube had not rupture yet but it was very swollen and I was bleeding internally so they opted for emergency surgery. Literally just that, like a pain in that area that was gone so quick I wondered if I felt it or imagined it I was pregnant and started spotting - then it stopped but came back.  When it came back I thought I was headed for a miscarriage.  I went to the doc and they scheduled me for HCG testing.  After the blood test (that same day) I was home with such severe pain and pain on one side, ended up being rushed to the ER, it had ruptured and was in emergency surgery at 3am to remove the blood from my pelvis, stomach and to remove the tube.  I do remember the moment it ruptured the pain was so intense I thought I was going to pass out.  My mother happened to be there and said I turned white.  I honestly would not wait and call the doctor. Ended up having a miscarriage Where did you feel it on your body? ", "hi, how long after my surgery am i allowed to have sex again? ", "Hi! Possible ec?? Hi! So , years ago I was like 21 I had a suspected ectopic , I was in the ER w a kidney infection found out I was pregnant, they thought it was ectopic but I was young and stupid and went home.

We lost our baby and my right fallopian tube in May when I was 7 weeks pregnant. We had gone for the appointment to hear the heartbeat beat of our very loved little lentil. Instead, I was rushed to surgery with no time to process anything. During the salpingectomy, the surgeon realized I had endometriosis and it was BAD. So bad that he had to surgically release my left tube from all of the scar tissue that had twisted and \"strangled\" my only remaining hope for natural conception and use an anti-adhesion barrier to hopefully hold it in the correct anatomical position.\nAfter this experience, we decided to go to a fertility specialist and the months of tests and procedures began. In the end, we found out my remaining tube had \"potential\" but was not considered healthy, my uterus is shaped like a heart (which makes implantation difficult and can cause complications with early delivery), I have really low egg count for being only 31 and in addition to the endometriosis, my suspicions of PCOS was confirmed too. It feels like everything that could be wrong is wrong with me in regards to my reproductive system, has one issue or more. Because I do have one tube left, IUI is an option that was offered but I will have to take clomid to increase my egg count. If it results in another ectopic we will have to move forward with IVF in order to bypass my tube. I guess I am looking for anyone who can relate? Is there anyone else who has experienced all of this and were you able to carry a baby to term? I just need some hope. \n\nTLDR- 1 fallopian tube, endometriosis, PCOS, malformed uterus, low egg count, only 31 and desperately need some hope. Hey no one replied yet\u2014 your situation does sounds super challenging. You have not caught a break. When you say low egg count, does that mean low AMH? \nI know the folks at /r/Infertility run an intimidatingly structured community but there are many redditors there who also have combinations of tough diagnoses. Maybe not your exact combo, but they will understand the boulder you are under.\n\nPersonally I am sorry that you are not only swimming in the morass of infertility but also dealing with the trauma of ectopic. It is not fair. Thank you for your kind words. The low egg count was based off an ultrasound where they counted the follicles in each ovary, which was less than half of what is typical for my age. I will definitely check out that sub! Thank you!", "Could this be ectopic? Hello everyone! My period has been 10 days late and for days I have had severe cramping.

Since then, of course, this dream turned into a protracted nightmare of bleeding and pain, deep uncertainty, USs, scary covid-era doc visits, an ectopic diagnosis, MTX, meltdowns, obsession with folic acid, and now, what feels like an endless, extremely high-risk wait-and-see game. \n\nI was just watching the news this eve and a woman featured in one news story (about social-distancing thanksgiving celebrations) said that she and her husband are expecting their first child and are excited to tell their family on a thanksgiving zoom call.

My bleeding lasted another day and then on the third day was only spotting(my period usually lasts 5-7 days).

Most recently, we had an \u201c oops \u201c pregnancy  but that ended up being ectopic and required surgery to remove my last remaking tube . There definitely is hope after ectopic . As long as you have one good working tube . This gives me hope. I am a one-tube mama now and it is really getting me down.\n\nAlso, I am so sorry for all your losses. I am sure it was incredibly difficult to go through \u2764\ufe0f My mom\u2019s neighbor had a baby after an ectopic with tube surgery. My friend from college had a baby after MTX ectopic. I think success stories are hard to come by because people do not talk about their ectopics. Nobody told me about their ectopics til I opened up about mine on my Instagram. I am also always on the hunt for a success story after ectopic these days.\n\nHave you talked to your doc about doing an HSG dye test to see how your tube(s) are working? I plan on getting the test done on my remaining tube before TTC again. It also makes you more fertile for like 3 months after the dye test. No I never knew that. The only thing she told me was maybe trying genetic testing that you need blood drawn for that. I will look into that, I also have one tube left. But sadly  I had another ectopic and had mtx now just waiting to get my period soon. Ectopics suck so bad because they just make you doubt that your tube(s) could ever pull it together and just deposit the embryo where it is supposed to go\u2026 the HSG dye test is the only thing I have heard that can test the efficacy of your tubes, so maybe bring it up with your doctor? I feel like some doctors (like mine) do not give you all the info about trying again, unless you go to a fertility doctor or do your own research\u2026 Hi!\nI had a successful pregnancy after two ectopics (one in each side)!! I did have the dye test and exploratory surgery to confirm my tubes were clear tho. I highly recommend the dye test at the very least because sometimes if there is anything in your tubes it will clear it out. But at least this way you will know if your tubes are clear and it is just a fluke, or if there is something that will continue causing ectopics. It is absolutely possible! More people go on to have successful pregnancies after Ectopic\u2019s than not. \ud83d\udc97 I do not have a success story as I had 4 of the damn things but honestly that is not typical. Stay positive!! \n\nYour best bet is to do an hsg to check tubes as PP said. Wishing you all the best! ", "Struggling with depression 2 months post ectopic pregnancy ", "Advice please \ud83d\ude14 I ended up in A&amp;E recently as I had a bad chest infection and everytime I was coughing I was bleeding (vaginally) I had bloods and they said I was pregnant which was a big shock as I had my period 5 days before. My HCG levels on Thursday morning around 2am were 124 so I had more bloods today and the have only gone up to 197 after 48 hours so things are not very promising. They told me I am at increased risk of an ectopic now but to come back on Monday for more bloods. I feel devastated and want it all to be over I have pain in my left side near my pelvis and feel so sick. What will happen on Monday if my levels are just creeping up slightly? When can I expect to know for sure? It is making me feel so anxious I do not know what to do with myself. From my ovulation date I would be around 5 weeks and 2 days. Thank you so much. I am sorry you have to go through this. Being in limbo is so frustrating but the good thing is they are testing you early. Your hcg level will be monitored every 48hrs to see the pattern. If it is doubling, more likely it is a viable pregnancy. If it is rising slowly, there is a possibility that it is ectopic. Either way, they will want to do US but for many people, their hcg level has to be above 1500 to see anything. Thank you so much I am guessing I will not have a scan on Monday then. Like you say it is just frustrating and I wish I knew what was happening this is my second pregnancy and it is nothing like my first I am constantly trickling brown and pink discharge and the pain is strange too. I have a really bad feeling and just wish there was a quicker way to find out what is happening so I can accept it. They might still do US just to see if they can find the source of bleeding. I had my first one when my hcg was only 226. I hope your pregnancy end up being okay. Thank you. My bloods were 256 so still not rising right they did a scan but could not see my left side properly as they found a large blood filled cyst on my left ovary been told to rest and given pain killers and back again in 48 hours for more bloods", "Spotting for 6 days + HCG normal but on the low end. Possible ectopic? About 7 days ago I started spotting brown. 2 days later it turned rust-colored and then red. Occasionally I pass really tiny clots. My spotting has been going on for 7 days. I had my HCG level checked and based on my LMP and cycle length I should be around 8 weeks 4 days. 14k+ seems to be in the normal range but it is on the low end based on what I have read from other moms. I have had no other symptoms - no cramping or anything.  Am I looking at a possible ectopic? I have 1 year old that is still breastfeeding and I am afraid to take methotrexate. We also have a high deductible medical insurance and I am so afraid of having to go to the hospital for surgery. I would 100% go get an ultrasound done with these symptoms just to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy. \ud83d\udc97 I think ectopic should be very low on your list of concerns if bleeding is your only symptom. If you have been bleeding for a week though in any capacity you should definitely call your OB and see what they think should be done - I would expect that by 8.5weeks you would have an ultrasound soon anyway. I had only bleeding - my doctor told me not to worry. By the two week mark I took myself to the ER. I have had no pain, and my HCG was exactly where it should be for 6 weeks. They did an ultra that day and found a 3cm mass in my right tube. \n\nMy only symptom was light spotting.", "question for remission after ectopic Hi ladies !\n\nI had an ectopic a month ago, first pregnancy... I had no pain, just bleeding and we saw on the echo that there was blood near my stomach and concluded an ectopic pregnancy. I was early and so they treated me with Methotrexate. After 1 shot it lowered signifiantly  and I was officially cleared ( level of BHCG was at 1 ) last week but I still have to wait 2 cycle before trying again.  Now  I just had some lower belly pain and some bleeding when I wipe ( not much / almost nothing actually falling which is weird ) It seems so early to have my period already and i am worried it is something else... any thoughts ? This sounds normal. Your body is going through so many changes and trying to get back on track after all you went through. It is great you had no pain with the ectopic!

Dear all, i had a medical miscarriage at 12 weeks and an ultrasound confirmed no residual tissue. It has been 3 weeks since then and i have a constant pain in my lower abdomen/pelvic area (not severe but it can be felt constantly) i could get a doctor's appointment only as early as sept 2nd. I am curious if an ectopic pregnancy is possible especially so close to a miscarriage? We had unprotected sex a week before i was diagnosed with a miscarriage but none after that. Thank you! Is the pain on one specific side? Or is it more like period cramping where it is felt all over? My ectopic was in one side. However, if you are concerned, I would say go to the emergency room (as awful as that is during a pandemic) or a doctor, or at least ask for the beta blood tests to see if you have got any HCG. Good luck to you \ud83d\udc95 Thank you for the reply. I will get an hcg test done soon. The pain is mostly on the right side and quite unlike cramping.

The pain only lasts about 15-20 seconds but is at times debilitating. From what I have read online, this pain seems to be in line with ectopic but I cannot find any information about how long the abdominal pain lasts when it comes. \n\nI am hoping for any thoughts, opinions, or guidance on this and if this pain sounds like a possible ectopic. \n\nThank you so much The pains you are describing can absolutely be normal pregnancy pains. \n\nMy ectopic pains were absolutely stop what you are doing, lie down debilitating pains. It lasted 30 mins and then would be gone. I had that pain once a week for four weeks. I was spotting the whole time too. Sorry, but yes it could be. Mine was severe in waves then poof gone. Sudden jolts then nothing. Mild discomfort. Monday I was told to wait for my Thursday appointment. Thursday I had my ruptured tube removed. I hate to sound dramatic and scare you, but in hind sight I wish I would have advocated more for myself when the ER discharged me. I hope everything is fine. I am sorry you had to go through this, and I am so appreciative of you for sharing Thank you so much for sharing, and I am so sorry. Do you know how far along you were when this happened, and did you experience any spotting/bleeding?\nWishing you all the best The pain I had was just a dull ache that was not particularly constant..so yes, it could be ectopic (although I sincerely hope it is not) as not everybody has the same kind or intensity of pain. If you are concerned get checked out. Sending love and best wishes", "Got pregnant (ectopic) with an IUD and my mom told me (f/22) to have less sex and use a condom next time. Lol. This is the reality of women\u2019s healthcare. Even though ectopic pregnancies completely out of my control and I was using the IUD correctly, it still somehow became my fault. Sure, a condom would have made it 99.99% effective but I trusted the 99.9% odds.\n\nI have been posting a lot in this community to get some support and not feel so alone. My family has been nothing but judgmental since I told them and my mom even suggested lying to her friends so that they would not find it. It is ectopic for gods sake. I called her out and she started crying and acting like a victim or something. I just cannot anymore.\n\n(PS: parents have been gaslighting me since my childhood so this is not anything new, I am just venting.) I am so sorry your going through this. When and how soon did you find out your pregnant? I am so sorry you have to deal with that on top of what you have been through! I am so my most humble apology thee has't to deal with yond on top of what you have been through!\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` April 12th, I did not tell them because I was protecting my peace and did not need help dealing with the situation. Did not know it was ectopic until May 10th tho I am sorry for being a bit intrusive. But with an IUD in place can your partner still ejaculate inside you ? Does the IUD prevent the sperm from reaching the egg ? \n\nDid your partner and you have further preventive measures like using the pull out method as well ? The 99.9% effectiveness is true when your partner ejaculates inside of you. It took me about a year before I started letting my partner finish inside of me because I was so paranoid of getting pregnant. It took a few years of therapy to get comfortable trusting that statistic. At this time I was not using any other contraception but in the future I will likely use a spermicide and an IUD for safety", "Hi I am new... and I am in limbo. Waiting to see if my body will \"resolve\" my ectopic pregnancy... Hi there...  I just found out the day before yesterday I have what appears to be an ectopic pregnancy at 6 weeks into my very first pregnancy.\n\nSince this was/is my very first pregnancy,  I had no idea what to expect about first trimester symptoms...but on Monday when I began experiencing severe abdominal pain/pressure and violent vomiting with cold sweats... I knew this could not be \"normal.\"  I called my doc and asked for a sonogram asap to check things out because I was worried it could be an ectopic pregnancy... not really believing it actually would be because... what are the odds right?\n\nWell the odds were not in my favor apparently.  They did a sono that afternoon and saw loose fluid from my left fallopian tube, and could not locate the pregnancy in my uterus... so I got admitted to stay in the hospital overnight for observation and to wait and see if my hcg levels would go down on their own and also make sure I did not need emergency surgery.\n\n\\*\\* side note: Being checked into a hospital during this COVID crisis is NOT FUN. No visitors...my husband was kicked out and I had to receive scary/hard news alone without him.\n\nMy hcg levels increased a bit next day (yesterday) and I had another sono... still showing loose fluid around my left ovary and in the cul-de-sac.  The doc who did my sono (not my regular obygyn) seemed to be pushing that I should have a surgery done sooner than later to resolve this since there is loose fluid.  However my regular obgyn said we could wait a little more since I was not in pain anymore (it subsided Monday evening) and she does not think I am in imminent danger at this time.  She still thinks there is a chance my body will resolve the ectopic pregnancy on its own without needing intervention.\n\nSo here I am... still pregnant, but waiting to see if my body will \"resolve\" things on its own.  Never thought I would be in this situation where I am actively hoping my body terminates the pregnancy on its own to avoid a surgery or the shots.  I really hate this.  And I feel scared of trying again after all of this is over. I am so sorry you are going through this. I experienced an ectopic pregnancy 2 years ago. The pain was terrible and the bleeding lasted for weeks. I also had to wait for the pregnancy to pass on its own or however you want to phrase it. I had to go into my doctors office every few days to get my hcg levels tested until they were back to normal. I did not have to have surgery and I hope you do not either. Good luck while you go through this, I hope you have all the support you need &lt;3 Thank you! Yes this sucks but I am thankful for modern medicine and support from loved ones during this time. Hi. I am sorry you are going through this too. I am in a similar situation. This is my first pregnancy and it is ectopic as well. However, I have not had any fluid and I did not have any discussion about letting my body try to resolve it on it is own. However, I was a couple more weeks pregnant when I found out so that may make a difference. \n\nI had my first ultrasound last Thursday. It was a transvaginal ultrasound since I was just shy of being 8 weeks pregnant. My doctor told me they strongly suspected the pregnancy was ectopic because they could not find anything in my uterus. However, I was not experiencing any of the symptoms of ectopic pregnancy so they took my blood to monitor my hcg levels and we scheduled a follow up appointment for Monday.\n\nWell, I did not end up making it to Monday. Over the weekend I started experiencing pain in my left abdomen. At first it felt like a strong period cramp that would not go away, but it kept intensifying. I was worried it would rupture so I went to the ER. They ran another blood test and I had another ultrasound. The ultrasound hurt so much when it was angled towards my left abdomen. My blood test results came back and my hcg levels had decreased from 4000 on Thursday to 1900 on Saturday. Luckily, I did not rupture and they gave me the shot of methotrexate. For me it was two shots, one above each butt cheek. The shots did not hurt. It was just a slight pinch similar to when you are getting your blood drawn. \n\nAlso, since I have a negative blood type they gave me a shot of rhogam. Since this was my first pregnancy I was unfamiliar with it. From my understanding you typically receive it at 28 weeks and again when you are closer to giving birth. However, they also give it with methotrexate so that for future pregnancies your negative blood type cells are prevented from competing with the baby\u2019s cells. It sounded like it would not be an issue if the father also has a negative blood type, but if he has a positive blood type then it can cause your cells to compete with the baby\u2019s. I am not sure if that made sense, but that is how I understood it when they were explaining it to me. Anyways, that shot did hurt. Hopefully you will not have to get that one.\n\nSo far I am 4 days out from receiving the shot. It seems like I feel fine in the morning and then am extremely fatigued in the afternoon. I have still been experiencing abdominal pain, but it is been mostly tolerable. The second day was by far the worst in terms of abdominal pain, but it is getting better. I did not start bleeding until the second day. It was light bleeding at first, then got heavier on the second day of bleeding, and now it is light again. I have not experienced any nausea. \n\nI went in today to get my blood drawn and I go again on Saturday (seventh day after the shot). From there the doctor will look to see if my hcg levels are still dropping and determine if I need a second shot. Hopefully, I will not need the second shot. \n\nAnd I agree this is absolutely terrible with the COVID-19 outbreak. In the days leading up to my first appointment I kept receiving calls of no visitors/patients only, we will be asking screening questions, and we will be taking your temperature. So since my husband was not able to come with me to my first appointment, I had to receive the news of the ectopic pregnancy alone and then deliver it to him myself. Luckily, he was able to come with me to the ER. I was worried they would not let him, but we figured we would try and if they said no, then they said no. \n\nOn a positive and hopeful note my doctor did say that plenty of women who have ectopic pregnancies go on to have healthy babies. \n\nI hope this post helps you and I am sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing \u2014 it is a sucky situation but helps to know I am not alone I send each of you my support. I did the methotrexate Feb 29 and my numbers initially went up but have recently been down but my doc called off the second methotrexate shot as we were driving to receive it. It is such a scary time waiting and wondering. I am so sorry with COVID it is making it more isolating. I am glad you found this support group. It helped me get through some of my questions and made some of my wild symptoms feel more normal. Fatigue, nasty sx after MTX (get anti nausea pills if you are prone to that, I wish I had them) and I was so so tired for weeks and emotional/tearful randomly. I also ended up telling my mom and some close friends who have been incredibly supportive and understanding and got me through this. They even delivered food low in folic acid \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f. Hang in there!! Thanks u/PurpleStrawberry2020 for sharing.  I am glad I found this support group... thank God for the internet/reddit during this time. I am glad you got to the hospital right just on time. I was hospitalized 3 days 1 month ago, it was really annoying that although I entered into the maternity area, my boyfriend could not accompany me as I would have liked, and always with the constant fear of getting covid. :/", "Advice for supporting friend with ectopic pregnancy One of my best friends had an ectopic pregnancy and the doctors had to remove her Fallopian tubes. She is devastated and in all kinds of pain. She lives in a few hundred miles away and I want to send her a care package. What things did you all find useful? I am thinking candle, heating pad...? I feel like there is nothing that can be said or done other than supporting her through this, but just want to get her things too. My friend got me a basket with a candle face mask candy body scrub &amp; another friend sent me flowers \u2014it was the thought that counted more than anything and I really appreciated it Snacks, face masks, peppermint tea (it helps the pain from bloating from surgery), heating pad, a book if she reads, magazines? Those are the suggestions I have got :) My sister sent me a few books and I loved it. Took my mind somewhere elsewhere. That and food delivery since I didnt feel like cooking at first. Very kind and thoughtful of you. So, this happened to me. I lost my Fallopian tube as well. I was devastated and felt so alone! My friend hundreds of miles away did not find out until weeks later because I could not bring myself to call her... for her to share this with you shows that you are so special to her because the only one I shared it with was my husband and sister. I remember being constipated and in pain. My sister brought some paints over and we painted quietly together which was so therapeutic. I have never had a child but just hearing my child existed and is in heaven (me being an angel mama) helped so much... Not everyone is the same but that\u2019a a small piece of my story. Also! Latham Thomas: Own your Glow .... this was a book my sister also got me, audio and hard cover. Blankets and pillows are always wonderful! I remember being so painful every time I coughed or sneezed. That is so thoughtful of you. I went through a very traumatic ruptured ectopic and I SO appreciated anything anyone did to show they cared. Checking in, condolences, flowers, a box of a bunch of different types of See\u2019s Candies from a friend who knows my sweet tooth (could not eat it for a while, but a nice thought!), and groceries/meals-maybe you could set up a grocery delivery for her? Something else I would have found useful would be a journal and a nice pen. First I just needed to keep track a lot of medical info, but later found writing about my experience to be very helpful (that is probably why I always write too much in my responses here-apologies!).  Lastly, I will say that continuing to check in once in a while for the next several months is a great idea, too. Best wishes to your friend. Body scrub what a good idea! Thank you so much Thank you! Waiting to hear back if she has a heating pad and will get some peppermint tea :) Food delivery is such a good idea. Thank you! Thanks for sharing this with me :) she loves to paint and I was wondering about the pain and bloating what helps, blankets will be super comforting. Thanks so much!  Thank you I appreciate your thoughtful response :) &gt;:)\n\n:)", "Pregnant after ectopic that ended in right tube removal Hey I just had my right tube removed due to an ectopic pregnancy on July 1. I just found out that I am pregnant again a couple days ago. My anxiety has been through the roof. I am just wondering if there is anything I can watch out for or any testing I can ask my doctor for? Thank you Still very new to all this myself but make sure you alert your doctor as soon as you possibly can so they know and can help inform you of the next steps to take as well! I hope this time goes much smoother! Much love and luck! \ud83c\udf40 Crossing my fingers for you! My doctor wanted me to call as soon as I had a positive home test. She ran a few blood draws right away to make sure HCG levels were doubling appropriately every 48 hours. Unfortunately, they cannot always see much on ultrasound until closer to 6/7 weeks. Having the blood draws helped lower my anxiety but having the early ultrasound at 7 weeks was reassuring. Thank you! I went for a blood test yesterday so I got a base marker to go off of. Just waiting for my doctor to call me back with the results I already checked it online but I would like the testing done every few days and a ultrasound once it is a suitable time. Thanks for replying I have been so up and down with anxiety over it. My doctor also wanted me to call immediately as soon as I got a positive test so that I could come in and they could do some ultrasounds to locate where the pregnancy was. Definitely call your OB if you have not already.", "Possible Ectopic I started to have brown spotting last Thursday, by Sunday it was red and getting heavier. By Monday morning it was pretty apparent I was having a miscarriage. I went to the doctor for an ultrasound but they could not find anything. I would have been about 7 weeks 3 days at that point. They said either I would passed everything or it could be ectopic, but they could not verify an ectopic with the ultrasound that day. They checked my HCG levels (1025 mIU/ML), too high to rule out ectopic. I go back tomorrow for another blood draw, and Thursday for another ultrasound. The bleeding has slowed and it is lighter. I do not have any significant pain. Yesterday felt like a \u201cnormal\u201d miscarriage. (My 3rd loss) I have a weird feeling on my right side. It is not painful, I can press on it and it does not hurt. But it is a weird abnormal feeling. \n\nIf the ultrasound is inconclusive again and my HCG levels have not dropped significantly what happens next? Everything I read sounds like women just keep getting sent home until they are in agonizing pain and/or their tube has ruptured. WTH? I am also really nervous because my husband is out of town and my nearest family is 10+ hours away. I am all alone here if anything happens. \n\nFor those of you who took methotrexate, were you able to keep working through treatment? I am reading stories on here of some of you feeling miserable for weeks. I am an accountant so I am already getting hate for missing 2 days of work right now. \n\nDid anyone just opt for surgery to get it over with? How long is the recovery with that? \n\nSorry for all the questions. I hate the uncertainty and it seems like I may have weeks of it ahead. I had methotrexate because mine could not be found. My betas kept bouncing around as well.  Although I was tired/had some side effects and was upset by what was happening, it did not knock me down completely. I was able to still do light chores and things around the house. Other then focus and attention issues (my anxiety was awful during this time), if I had been working an office job, I could have physically done it.They just told me to not do heavy lifting or anything strenuous. Thanks so much for replying! Were you very fatigued by the treatment?   \n\nI think the focus and attention issues due to anxiety are my concern. I took today off just to have one day post miscarriage to be sad, and have felt guilty stressed all day about that. Then I got the call that my HCG was high and I needed to come back. My job is in no way physically strenuous, I am working from home right now. But I am in a very high stress/pressure situation on an assignment and I know I will not be able to give it the level of focus I usually do. I have been working 12-15 hour days and weekends. Honestly, I thought that was why I was miscarrying. I did have a lot of fatigue. I was sleepy all the time. My focus was done. I could not handle a lot of mental work. \n\n If it were me in your shoes, I would have a talk with my supervisor that this is likely going to be a short term, but extremely stressful medical issue that is taking up all of my focus. This is a time for some self care for sure.  I burned myself out and ended up mentally paying for it, tbh.  My husband ended up telling his boss that he would be taking time to go with me to the appointments. Since it is not super common, and very personal, they gave him no pushback and were extremely nice to him. I am sorry you are going through this. \nTypically ectopics are diagnosed by hcg doubling times either plateauing, going up and down or slow rising.\n\nBeta hcg every 48 hours until you reach 1500-2000 hcg.\n\nRepeat ultrasounds once that threshold is reached. If they still see nothing they will diagnose you as PUL. They likely will offer treatment at this time. On the ultrasound they will look for any adnexal masses or free fluid.  \n\n2/4 of my ectopics were not located on ultrasound but my gyne was amazing and admitted me if they could not find them as they took this at face value that it is a medical emergency and did not mess around. I spent a total of 5 days ish each time attempting to locate the pregnancies. And my doctors would not let me leave the hospital after receiving the mtx unless someone was with me 24/7. \n\nSurgery is much much easier. I found my first two was a terrible recovery snd you are not allowed to lift (I am a nurse so I could not work til hcg reaches 0) I was terrified the entire time being treated with mtx that I would rupture and die at any second. It was also super painful and I was exhausted for weeks even though the medication only stays in your system it depletes your body of folate and folate is so important for energy. You also need to wait 3 months after you reach 0 to ttc again as\nYou need to start taking folic acid again once you reach 0 to prevent neural tube defects etc. \n\nSurgery was quick and easy. It sucked cause I lost both tubes from 4 ectopics but after my second time with mtx I said I would NEVER do it again and opt for surgery.\n\nThat being said - if this is your first ectopic I would opt for mtx cause it is likely a fluke. Then get an hsg once you are recovered to check your tubes. \n\nSorry for the long post but if you have any questions feel free to ask them. I am a book of knowledge on these terrible things. I was able to work through treatment. After the first couple weeks, I took some half days off due to fatigue, but I did not have to take any significant period of time off. The only side effect I had was fatigue, and it was not severe or long-lasting.\n\nETA: I would say the emotional/mental impact was far greater than the physical impact in my case. You may very well need time off and space to process this, even if you physically can keep working. So do prioritize your mental and emotional health. For me, it helped to keep myself busy the first couple weeks and to share what was going on for the sake of support, but then I did need *some* time to just take care of myself. Thanks again for sharing, this was really helpful. Sorry you experienced this. Thank you for sharing! I am so sorry you have had this happen four times, that is awful! \n\nI am extra nervous because I do not love my medical provider and I have no real support system here. My work environment is toxic. I wish I was back home with my old doctors. Thanks so much. I think the emotional side of it is the biggest thing and right now the uncertainty. It is distracting. I can stop thinking about it and googling. Thank you, it is okay.. just one of the super unlucky ones with these things. \n\nPerhaps after all this you should look for a provider you really trust.\n\nIt is very hard without a support system, I live in newfoundland and my whole family is in New Brunswick so I only see them once a year. It is rough especially when things like this are going on. Is there a way for you to take time off work and get to your family and old doctor somehow?? Same thing is happening with me currently. I went yesterday for an ultrasound and they found nothing (would be 6 weeks tomorrow). Hcg was 3800 on the 4th and 1400 on March 23. Doc is saying he is not sure what is happening other than the pregnancy is not viable due to my slow increase in levels. I am to go tomorrow for another hcg test and Friday for another ultrasound. I am a mix of emotions right now and am so paranoid about any little cramp or twinge. I had spotting for about a week which is why I called. It went from pink to bright red and brown then red again. The unknown is so Scarey. My husband works night shift so it is usually just me and my 3 year old. I have had a headache since yesterday (I think from crying and stress) but no pain that I think is abnormal. I am so sorry you are also going through this. \n\nI am happy to share my personal experiences because there are not many who go through this, and it is just not talked about. I hope you are able to get some answers soon. Sorry you are going through this too! The uncertainty of it all drives you nuts. I went back for another HCG and an ultrasound. They did not see anything on the ultrasound and my HCG levels dropped down to 198. That is a good sign mine was \u201cjust\u201d a miscarriage. Glad it is looking like it is not ectopic. I go back in 10 days for another HCG and hopefully I am done. I hope you get some answers soon! At the very least hopefully yours is not ectopic.", "Could I potentially be having an ectopic pregnancy? I have an iud, and dont have much of a period because of it. Some light spotting here and there. A little over a month ago I started the very light spotting and only this time it lasted 2-3 weeks which does not seem normal.. I have since not had any spotting but instead since then have had cramps every single day. I think maybe 2-3 weeks of cramping. The cramps feel more localized on my right side.\n\nI took a pregnancy test today, and it was negative. But I heard sometimes they will not show up positive if it is ectopic.\n\nThe cramps are pretty mild, I am able to go about my daily activities, it is just an annoyance. I have noticed some lower back pain as well. I had not think much of the cramps because I tend to get them often around and during my \"period\" only started noticing something was off and my cramps have not really gone away like I feel like they should..\n\nOnly other thing I can think it could be is my iud and something is wrong there. I plan on making an appt with my gyno to get things checked out, but I am just worrying a bit. \n\nI do not have health insurance either so I really cannot afford this visit in the first place. \n\nI know no one will be able to diagnose me but am more asking if anyone went through something similar to what I am experiencing, and if they think it potentially could be an ectopic pregnancy? Sorry you are worried. Hoping to provide some comfort. If you are testing negative on a pregnancy test, and IF an ectopic was developing it would not be big enough to cause more harm until it got larger to cause a rupture/damage at which point it would be positive on the tests. I had low Hcg levels during my ectopic but still had positive tests. I hope your doc can provide you with more answers. Good luck! Did you ever find out? Going through the exact same symptoms right now. Going To call my doctor in the morning. Didst thee ev'r findeth out? going through the exact same symptoms even but now.

The excitement grew bigger and that it was a good way to destress as I was at the time carrying a baby. I had one ultrasound and heard it was probably to early and that is normal.\u00a0 levels were perfect! tripling every 48 hours as expected sometimes even more. the only thing that threw me off with the whole thing is I did not have any symptoms. Only breast tenderness. on February 14th (happy valentines day) my husband had to take me to invermere due to extreme cramping they only had a Belly ultrasound and seen nothing. advised me that pregnancy and hormones cause constipation. it did not feel right but he is the doctor and only had limited resources. the next day.. the 15th about 5pm I was screaming in pain it just got worst. we then decided to go to the next biggest facility (Cranbrook) they got me settled in a room checking my hemoglobin and blood type even my HCG to tell me it tripled again from my last test on the 11th. GOODNEWS right. As time progressed I could not even breathe while laying on my back. SHOULDER TIP PAIN is a thing. \nthey wheel up an ultrasound machine checking everything. They announced to me I have internal bleeding but no sight of baby and at those numbers they should see something and was calling the radiologist in to do a formal TVUS. 4 hours of waiting and 2 IVS later I finally went. I can see in the reflection of the lady's eye goggles a baby.. Even a heart beat my heart jumped with joy thinking the best. they wheel me back to the room and come in and the gynecologist surgeon comes in and I could see concern. his lips were moving but I just could not concentrate. \"your baby is in your right tube we have to remove it. your measurements are 8+6 heart beat at 147 and if you do not it will kill you. 3pm yesterday February 16th I had to say goodbye to my baby after 8 years of trying and say good bye to my Tube. i had 4 cups of blood internal bleeding and it burst while operating damaging my other tube. \n\nThe point of this post is not to scare. but to educate if something feel off. listen and ask questions.

I made an appointment with my ob-gyn and I was not able to get there because I started bleeding last week. I had an appointment that Friday (11.13) however, I went to the hospital on Tuesday (11.10).\n\n I started bleeding and immediately thought I was having a miscarriage because it was dark red.  They did a few tests and considered my pregnancy a \"threatened\" one. The hCG levels last week was 18. Since I am early, they could not see anything on the ultrasound. I bled from Tuesday (11.10)-Friday(11.13).\n\nI get my blood yesterday, and my level is 280. This is 6 days later. My last period was 10.04. So I should be around 7 weeks and my level is nowhere near 7k. Could I be having an ectopic pregnancy? Or, is there a glimmer of hope? I have to go back next week to check out my blood level and the wait is going to kill me. I had two miscarriages prior to what I am waiting for now so it is very depressing. Just sending you love, friend. I cannot comment on the medical details, but I know how excruciating the waiting game is. thanks! my close friend is pregnant and will be due 3 weeks before me-- so its like hard to even think about right now...", "When should I start trying? post ectopic Hii all! I am new here so bear with me! I found out I was pregnant mid October and quickly realized something was wrong when I started spotting a day after finding out I am pregnant, my OBGYN was sure it was a chemical pregnancy but my bHCG levels kept going up but not doubling in numbers. Realized it was an ectopic and got the MTX shot and thankfully within a few weeks my numbers were back to 0. I am three month post the MTX shot and I really want to start trying again but my dr recommended I wait 6 months before trying again and take 5mg of folic acid in April (5 months post MTX). I have been reading everyone is experience and everyone seems to have conflicting information...I am eager to start trying again but I am worried about any risks.. I would listen to your doctor but I got pregnant about 5 to 6 months after my ectopic. My doctor said it was safe for us to start trying again about two or three months after my surgery, once I had gotten the dye test done (forgot the name of it). 3 months after levels hit 0 and start taking prenatals when you hit 0. Mtx depletes your folate and you need to build that up because it is very important for fetal development (lack of folate can cause neural tube defects) \n\nThis site has been my go to! \n\n thank you so much! appreciate it! thank you for the reply! I know ill end up waiting the full 6 months just to feel safe It is usually least  recommended after 3 months but better to follow your OB to avoid risk.", "Potential ectopic pregnancy ", "Ectopic pregnanc guilt ??? Wow, this is not easy. \nI was not wanting a child, which makes me feel even more guilty for being upset over it. I am mortified. \nI thought I was upset when I found out I was pregnant. (Debilitating mental health issues currently) \nand it almost feels like because I was so unhappy about it, this happened instead. \nAnd I also feel like I do not have the right to be upset. \nBut I do, I feel horrible. I did not even know what surgery I was having because i dissociated so bad, until after it had been done. \n it all happened so fast, as soon as they confirmed what it was, I was admitted. \nIt had not ruptured, luckily. \nI have been compulsively obsessing with post surgery stuff, getting overtly stressed, mostly because I have not informed myself properly because informing myself makes me cringe. My discharge papers make me uncomfortable. \nThe thought that somethings been removed from my body, makes me feel shit. \nIt is harder because I was having a hard time before, or whatever. Then this happens. \n(I have pcos and had existential crisis vibes a month or so ago, thinking like imma die alone, fertility seems pretty poor) and so to find out im pregnant felt like a cruel joke. Or the universe thinking it was doing the right thing, even though I did not want proof like that I could have them. \nJust for it to be removed and one of my tubes too. \nI feel like it is my fault because I did not want it, when I should of been grateful given the anxiety I had about life and such, before realising I was pregnant. \n\nI know that is completely illogical but my faulty wonk brains rusty cogs continue to do their thing. \nJust wanted to vent about it. \nI do not really have a mother or anyone close I can just express these stupid thought loops / anxieties to. I should be grateful for my health but I am not. I screamed when I found out I was pregnant. \nBut somehow this feels more wrong than that did. \nHopefully the new medication for my head wonk that I started probably around the time I got pregnant, will actually start to work abit now. \n/wowlifeisreallytedious Im not a woman but my wife and I went through an ectopic a few months ago. So I cannot relate to exactly what it is that your feeling but my wife had A LOT of the same feelings you have described. It is kind of a mind fuck to go through so I would not be too hard on yourself in how you think you are \u201csupposed\u201d to feel. It can be a traumatic thing to go through even if pregnancy was not the goal. Be kind with yourself and accept any feelings/emotions that may arise. Do not tell yourself that you have to feel any kind of way. Just like the grieving process you do not get to choose what order you go through those stages. Though you may not feel like you are grieving you still are experiencing a loss. Could hurt to take a look at those seven stages. I hope you feel better. Idk if you had the methotrexate shot but if so it may take some time before you feel 100%. Rest is key! Hope this helps even it the smallest way. \u2764\ufe0f It is ok to have a million contradictory feelings. You can be scared that you even were pregnant in the first place and devastated that you lost the pregnancy. It is ok to feel both and it does not dishonor your loss to acknowledge that the pregnancy was not wanted or anticipated. Ectopic is a frightening process that chews you up and spits you out. I have found that talking about it with friends even though they do not understand first-hand has been the thing that as helped the most. surgery, removal of the tube. Unfortunately\nI have been harassing my health services because every small post op thing has been a surprise to me and something to obsess and go loopy over..because of my own avoidance of informing myself of what post surgery entails. Big brain time. Lol \nseriously though thank you for taking the time to respond to this, it is greatly appreciated. \u2665\ufe0f Lol big brain time. I hope you have a speedy recovery and it is my pleasure! I love to help people in anyway that I can. I have been through a lot with the mental health stuff in my life so I like to offer any kind of comfort for someone who going through it. Thank you for reading through it. It is exhausting, especially with a mind that loves to overthink more than it likes to do useful things, like absorb knowledge \ud83d\ude05 validating to hear \u2018\u2019chew you up and spit you out\u2019\u2019 because that is genuinely how I feel and I guess it is hard not having anyone in person saying things that really speak to me, regarding the situation, but I appreciate and can see the people I am close to are trying regardless. \n thanks for your time, it is much appreciated \u2665\ufe0f I am so sorry you are going through this and that your thoughts are so painful right now. The guilt sucks. My therapist and I have been working on my \u201cmagical thinking\u201d (like thinking: \u201cI was nervous to be pregnant and that made me lose my pregnancy\u201d or \u201cI was so gleeful about being pregnant that I took it for granted and lost the pregnancy\u201d). Those are not true, but my brain makes them up. I am trying to see those thoughts and just identify them, let them onto the bus (my brain) but not let them drive the bus, if that makes sense. It is hard not to just want to scream into the universe, \u201cWHAT WAS THE EFFING POINT OF ALL THIS!?\u201d \n\nWishing you some peace. It is okay to not be okay right now though. This is just plain awful. Sending hugs \u2764\ufe0f", "Diagnosed with an ectopic today and told to watch and wait? Hello,\nI was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy today at the emergency room via ultrasound. My husband and I had been undergoing fertility treatments for over 5 years. We have spent our last penny (over 100k) on a third round a of IVF and it finally worked! To find out at 8 weeks it is ectopic has been the saddest experience of my life. On top of grieving, I am concerned on the medical side- the ER doctor advised I do nothing and come back Wednesday for an HCG and second US. They said there is a very good chance of it reabsorbing without methotrexate or surgery. It seems so risky to me to just leave an ectopic alone. Has anyone successfully reabsorbed an ectopic? Or tried? Thanks for an your support. I am so desperately sad and scared today. I am so sorry. I would definitely say do surgery over all else. I started with methotrexate and it was horrible. Inevitably had to do surgery. I was 6 weeks pregnant. I would definitely get a second opinion. You are in my prayers and thoughts. I just recently went through an ectopic at around 4-6 weeks pregnant and did the methotrexate. I had a day or two of cramping but overall it was not so bad..  I would still prefer it much more over surgery.. it is also less risky in terms of damaging your tubes. I did wait until they were absolutely sure it was non viable but was eager to get it as I was so scared of it growing and rupturing. I am currently at 27 HGC so hoping it gets to zero soon so we can try again in a few months. Good luck to you.. it is definitely been a hard road. That just sounds crazy to me because tubes often burst between 6-8 weeks. I went in for brown spotting after a positive test and was told my tube had started to burst and tear and I had significant internal bleeding. I was only 6 weeks... Definitely get a second opinion. I am so sorry that happened to you. The ER doctor at my hospital said tubes rarely burst before 12-14 weeks, but I am not sure he knew what he was doing. Thankfully, he was wrong and I was having a miscarriage, but not an ectopic. I saw my reproductive endocrinologist the day after I made this post. The reproductive endocrinologist said the thing on my right ovary the ER doc saw was a corpus luteum cyst, not an ectopic pregnancy. He did a D&amp;C and my HCG started dropping. So I did have an intrauterine pregnancy/regular miscarriage. I am so thankful I did not take the methotrexate! I am so sorry you are going through this. I ended up waiting 3 days after they suspected ectopic just to be sure it was before we made any decisions because it was a desired pregnancy. Three days later I returned to the Dr and they confirmed my HCG was decreasing so deemed it a non viable pregnancy either way and I went to the hospital for the methotrexate. I was paranoid the entire time but my dr assured me that being I was so close to emergency care if needed, and being I was not that far along, and that I obviously knew if there was an emergency what it was, and it was worth the risk of waiting a few days to be sure it was non viable. I ended up w no rupture (thank god!) and felt like my normal self again (physically anyways) after about 3 days post methotrexate. The shot was not bad either. Wishing best of luck to you during this very hard time!", "First hand experience of ectopic pregnancy? Hey all, so background is my last period was 5-6-2020, I tested positive on 6-22-2020. I had pregnancy symptoms such as mild nausea and tender breasts but Thursday of the first week I tested positive I began feeling.. like something was not right. And all my pregnancy symptoms decreased to now.. nothing. I have previously been pregnant so I tried to compare this to that. But overall I kept feeling like something was not right. Then I began cramping in the abdominals and lower back pretty significantly mostly left sided, major bloating, lightheadedness. So I called the midwife and got in for an emergency visit for this past Thursday. I go in and they find nothing on the ultrasound. No heartbeat, no gestational sac. Nothing in my ovaries. But I have this constantly level 4/5 pressure in my left ovary area. I told the midwife this and she ordered bloodwork, more on Monday and Tuesday I should have answers.\nBut this has made me spiral in fear for my health. The midwife said it could be on of three things. 1. Chemical pregnancy 2. Too early to tell 3. Ectopic \nMy question is, those that have experienced ectopic pregnancy, can you share you symptoms and experience you had? Any insight?\nThank you Hey I am sorry you are going through this.\nI got my positive test at 28days pregnant. Then at 5weeks and 4days I had severe abdominal pain that reached to my shoulder. I also started bleeding heavily, I went to A and E (U.K.) and they said to wait it out till 6weeks which was a Saturday. I had a scan and they could not find the sac in my womb and realised it was ectopic. I went for surgery the same morning they removed my right tube, baby and 2 pints of blood. They said I should have collapsed due to the loss of blood but I called in sick and stayed in bed from the Wednesday to Saturday so not much chance.\nI had all the symptoms and did not even know it was ectopic. \nI was released from hospital the next day and collapsed at home to be readmitted for three days. Hey there! I am so sorry you are going through this. When I went through my ectopic pregnancy, it started as really bad cramping which felt like period cramps but worse. I had really bad pain in my abdomen and even in my butt, which I had never really experienced before. I was told to get blood work which my doctor monitored for a week. After a week went by I was told my levels were not rising like they should and I began to bleed. I bled all weekend and when I went to the doctor office, the ultrasound determined that nothing ever made it to my uterus. \n\nSo my first symptom was the severe cramping, sometimes even more on the left side like where my Fallopian tube/ovary was, which then resulted in bleeding a week later. \n\nI ended up getting a methotrexate shot in my back to help my body pass it and while it hurt really bad and made me bleed on and off for 5 or so weeks, my treatment was successful so I did not need surgery and I am back at normal levels. Here in a couple months, my husband and I can try again. \n\nThis is probably the worst thing I have ever experienced in life, but now that I am coming out on the other side, I am doing a lot better and believe that my baby is in Heaven waiting for me. \n\nEither way it goes, you will be okay! I do not say that to diminish your pain because I know how emotionally painful this situation is. I say this to give you hope it will get better, and you are not alone. I will pray for you, friend \u2764\ufe0f I am sorry you are in limbo- not knowing what is happening in your own body is such a disconcerting feeling. Have you had bloodwork done to check your betas? Knowing your HCG levels would be helpful, especially to compare how much it is increasing and if it is low for how far along you are. If your HCG is under 1500, an ultrasound usually cannot pick anything up.\n\nFor me, the earliest warning signs was low hcg. While it ended up doubling, it was overall low for how far along I was (3400 when I ruptured at 6.5 weeks). Other symptoms were spotting that came and went- I actually did not have any the day or two leading up to the rupture. I also had pain in my left ovary, which would switch from dull ache to more sharp stabbing pain. This stated around 6 weeks.\n\n When my pregnancy ruptured, the main difference was radiating pain/pain in other areas of my body. Honestly, I thought I was having terrible gas pain at first... The pain eventually went into my shoulders and made breathing hard, as well as made shooting pains in my butt (all linked to internal bleeding). The other main indicator was being lightheaded, and then later passing out.\n\nI would advocate for getting your HCG monitored and another ultrasound when levels are high enough to visualize the pregnancy. Fingers crossed you are able to get some answers and all is well! Oh goodness, that is a journey you went through. By the doctors count I should be 7-8 weeks but ultrasound showed nooothing,  not even in my ovary. Pregnancy tests are still positive.\nI do have dull intermittent pain in my lower left abdominal up to my rib. Occasionally sharp, no bleeding unless I have sex then it is mild. I just want answers. Monday is more blood work and I should have results on Tuesday. \nThank you for your words! My last period started May 4, and I was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy on Friday, June 26 (at 7 weeks, 4 days). My only symptom was spotting that began on Monday of that week and suddenly increased on that Friday, which is the day I went in for an ultrasound. My hCG level was tested first, and it was over 10,500, which was too high to tell whether anything was wrong. So the ultrasound sealed the deal for me because there was nothing in my uterus (just as you described), but they did see a mass in my right Fallopian tube. They said based on my hCG level, they should be able to detect something in the uterus if anything was there.\n\nSince they did not find anything on the ultrasound for you, the hCG level may be key. If your hCG is low, that could be why they could not see anything clearly on the ultrasound.\n\nAs for treatment, I received a methotrexate injection on Friday, 6/26. I have hardly experienced side effects, and my hCG has been dropping rapidly (which means it is working). I was down to ~3,200 within 7 days. So I am hopeful that this will resolve without a rupture or surgery. It is been more of an emotional challenge for me. I pray that you get the answers you need and the appropriate care soon. Do you know about how far along you were when you first started bleeding? I think I was about 5 weeks or so Thank you I was asking because I am currently 5 weeks and I am experiencing an on and off twing/mild cramp on my left side around where my ovary is for about the last 4 days and it has me extremely scared and losing sleep I totally understand the feeling! I am sorry you are experiencing these things. My best advice, try not to worry until you know more. I am praying for you \u2764\ufe0f", "My Ovarian Ectopic Story I thought I would share my story here both for support and it is therapeutic to get it out.\n\nOn September 8th, cycle day 17, I got a DARK positive pregnancy test. I was confused both based on the timing of the positive and the darkness of the test line. I called my OBGYN office and they said yeah it is weird but let us check your HCG. I went the next day and it was over 1700. Weird, but I was not cramping, bleeding, or having any issues, so they said keep an eye out, we will see you in three weeks. \n\nCut to September 21st, I was becoming impatient for my appointment and I called and asked for another HCG test to see if my levels were rising. I took the test, got my result back and my HCG was at 8,854. Good, it is going up. While this should have eased my fears, I knew in my gut something was not right. Yes, it could be twins, triplets even, but I am not having any symptoms of pregnancy other than sore boobs. So I put it in the back of my mind and hoped this was just a story I would tell years later when I had two or three happy babies.\n\nSeptember 29th came, I went to the bathroom and had the tiniest specks or dark brown discharge. I wiped, no red blood, and I did not see anymore discharge that day. I was alarmed but though, well could be my uterus stretching and old lining may be in there. I forgot about it that day and just thought maybe it was a one time thing. \n\nNext day, September 30th, I went to the bathroom and I had bright red, bloody discharge. Panic set it. I did not have cramping and I was not in pain but I knew something was not right. I made a call to my doctor and the said to go to the ER. I made my way to the ER and explained my situation. The took urine, blood and ordered an ultrasound. When the tech came in, he did the ultrasound but it took forever. I thought to myself oh maybe he is just looking at multiple babies. He left the room and the dr came in. He used the speculum to look at my cervix, and said, will the bleeding is gone, could have been irritation, but I am going to wait for the ultrasound report. \n\n2 hours later, I was greeted by my OBGYN. I had not seen him in almost 2 years and I was shocked that he was in my room. He said, \u201cWell how are you feeling?\u201d. I told him I felt fine but I had a little blood and was concerned so I came down. \n\nThat was when he delivered the heartbreaking news, \u201cIt looks like you had a pregnancy that implanted right outside your right ovary, we are going to take you in for emergency surgery before it ruptures. You may lose an ovary or tube but we got to take you back, it is life and death if it bursts.\u201d \n\nI fell to my bed I was on crying. I had to ask for a minute. I was shocked and broken. How could this be happening. What are the chances. Why me? Will I make it through surgery? Was there a heartbeat? What can I do?\n\nAfter some comfort from the ER doctor that the did not see a heartbeat, and a large dose of Ativan, they wheeled me into emergency surgery. When I came to after surgery he said it went well. I lost half of my right ovary, but I had plenty of eggs. I made it out alive. \n\nThis was one week ago today. I am healing physically, but the emotional healing is going to take longer. Each day is a struggle of why me but I have to have faith in God\u2019s plan. I want any other women out there struggling to know, my thoughts, prayers, and positive vibes are with you. You are not alone. I am so sorry for your loss. \u2764\ufe0f Thank you for sharing your story. I am being monitored for suspicion of ectopic because of bleeding and a small cyst on my ovary. Reading this helps reassure me that even if I do end up needing surgery to deal with it, that I will be okay.", "Can you tell how likely an ectopic is from these HCG levels? I am currently 5w4d and my HCG has been low and slow rising the whole time. After 3 very early miscarriages I have presumed this one is going the same way since my HCG is not rising properly but my clinic is now very concerned it is ectopic based on my blood results. \n\nI am trying not to freak myself out but also want to be prepared. I have a bit of cramping at times and sometime the odd stabbing pain when I go for a walk but no bleeding. I know it is not viable but do the following bloods give any strong indication one way or the other if it is likely to be ectopic?  I have been told once my HCG gets to 1000 they can give me an ultrasound. The limbo is torturous. \n\n3w5d - 29\n4w - 47\n4w2d - 100\n4w5d - 370\n5w2d - 650\n5w4d - 880 I am so sorry for your previous losses and what you are going through now. The not knowing is the worst. Only the doctor will be able to tell you for sure if it is ectopic and likely with the ultrasound and more bloodwork. Make sure to call them and tell them about the odd stabbing pain and keep them informed with any new symptoms. If you have more stabbing pain, light headed, heart racing, go to ER. \n\nMy ectopic was not visible on ultrasound until 6w4d. This is now my third loss. Sending you a hug. It is so hard\u2026 I just went through something very similar. My 48 hours doubling rate was around 35% and my doctor was also concerned about ectopic. I monitored my HCG levels for about 2 weeks and suddenly it started to drop and I miscarried naturally. It was not ectopic and I never got to a point where I could do a scan. My last hcg test, a few days ago, was 35 and the doctor said I do not need any more testing. I do not think you can tell based on hcg only, it can go either way.I am sorry you are going through this. Thanks for your response, had it confirmed this morning that it is not ectopic so hopefully will just drop soon like yours did. Thanks for the advice, the not knowing has been awful but confirmed as not ectopic today so looks like will miscarry soon. I am deeply sorry to hear this. There is no good way to find out you are losing a pregnancy, but I am glad you have answers and your health is not at risk with an ectopic. Wishing you a healing path forward. What ever happened with you? Did you end up having an ectopic? I am currently going through something similar and so scared!!! So sorry to hear you are going through this, it is so awful. My HCG stalled at about 1700 at around 7w then dropped away to a natural miscarriage so was not an ectopic. Oh wow! Sorry for your loss. My HCG draws started at 3,  6, 11, 38. But I started bleeding the day I got the reading of 11. Today is somewhere around 15-17dpo and I got the 38 number today. Ugh! It is such an awful and agonising wait! I hope you get some kind of resolution either way soon. Take care of yourself, it is an incredibly hard time.", "Period returning after surgery How long did it take for your period to return after surgery?

HCG levels of 500 hence the chemical treatment. Today my HCG levels are 35. \n\nHowever when having number two I can feel a little a bit of pain or pressure in my pelvic area. It feels almost like my uterus or tubes are still a bit sensitive and when pushing I can sense little bit of pressure. Otherwise I feel ok occasionally some pain here and there in my abdomen but nothing too serious. At least I hope so. \n\nHave one of you had similar experience? \n\nHow long have you felt the pain in abdomen or pelvis area  after the Methotrexate shot?\n\nThank you very much (this has been really tough and unexpected week) I had my shot exactly three weeks ago and have been having the same issue with strong cramping pain in the pelvic area and radiating into abdomen. I was checked out a few days ago and they could not find anything wrong and said it was my body just reacting to the medicine absorbing probably. My levels were at 142 when I went in. Yes - I have been getting these pains and a trapped wind kind of pain. For me these pains have been quite severe, but my levels were as high as 3900 at one point, now down to 2300. Like you I have been checked for ruptures and nothing showing, the doctor said the drug attacks your bowel too because there are fast reproducing cells there, so this is likely why we get the pain here. I had the same experience and when I told them they ignored me. Make sure they scan you again. I actually was ruptured and bleeding internally. The gas pain was the first sign I had. Omg this is what is happening to me.. I am on day 7, bleeding is light now no more blood clots but still have the gas pain, like I have pelvic inflammation still bad constipation that I can feel it to my lower back.. I just want this to be over. Hello, I was bleeding for quite a while maybe 2 weeks. When I stopped bleeding the pressure or gas pain disappeared. Its pretty tough to go through this. Anyways I hope you will feel better soon. Keep strong", "Almost Died from Interstitial Ectopic Pregnancy Hello All - This is my first time posting anywhere on Reddit. Am back at home recovering in bed and wanted to share my story in case it helps anyone in a similar position. \n\nMy partner and I had been trying to conceive since October. We have one daughter \u2013 3.5 years old \u2013 who is amazing, and thought it would be best to try for a second before I turned 39 this summer. In early May, I tested positive with a couple of home pregnancy tests the week I was expecting my period. I then set an appointment with the OB/GYN for what I assumed would be at the 7-week mark to date the pregnancy and assess viability. The transvaginal ultrasound, however, showed very little \u2013 just a tiny bubble that looked a lot smaller than what the gestational sac should have looked like, with a thick uterine lining. My HCG levels that day were 1500. A follow up appointment was set for 10 days later (at my urging, because the office wanted to do it 14 days later). That weekend, however, I had what I assumed was a typical miscarriage \u2013 I had a lot of cramping and passed a lot of blood, including a large empty sac-looking thing (approx. 2 inches by 1.5 inches). I informed my OB/GYN and then four days later went in for a follow up. \n\nAt this follow up a regular abdominal sonogram was done, which showed a thin uterine lining and empty uterus. There was a cyst on my ovary that they thought was normal due to recent ovulation, but nothing else was seen that raised cause for suspicion. The next day, I found out my HCG levels were even higher \u2013 1800 \u2013 but my follow up appointment was set for a week later to monitor (Thursday morning).\n\nTuesday night, however \u2013 around 11:30 pm \u2013 I started experiencing a lot of pain in the abdomen. At first it felt more like horrible gas/cramps, and I thought it was in reaction to something I ate. It reminded me of bad pain I had when I had gone to central America years prior and drank unpasteurized milk\u2026so I decided to stay home for while to see if it would go away. My husband was working out of state and I had no one to watch my daughter, which also added to my hesitancy to going to the ER unnecessarily. The pain then subsided a bit and I was able to rest for a while\u2026but a few hours later it worsened and started to spread into my chest and shoulders when I would breathe. I called my primary care physician to leave a message with the 24 hour emergency line \u2013 when they called me back a few moments later, they urged me to call the OB/GYN when that office opened at 8 am \u2013 due to the recent miscarriage - or go to the ER if the pain became unbearable. \n\nWe finally went to the ER in the morning, after my mother drove in from 3 hours away to help with my daughter.  I was extremely faint and dizzy, not able to stand up without blacking out a few minute later. We decided not to call an ambulance and instead she drove me to the hospital (Mt Sinai on UES in NYC) associated with all my doctors as I figured having access to my pre-existing information would be helpful. \n\nAfter arriving at the ER I explained my history and they were concerned by both the pain, recent HCG levels, and the fact that my heart rate was high (approx. 110) and blood pressure was low (82/50). I was sent for an ultrasound, but could not lay down due to the pain, so sent back out to the ER floor for pain meds. After not being seen for 50 minutes, and starting to cry in desperation from the pain and difficulty breathing, I flagged down a nurse to demand the meds, leading to a morphine shot. Felt slightly better and was sent back to get an X ray and then ultrasound. Still could not lay down for the ultrasound, so they did what they could at an angle, and then I was sent back out to the ER floor. Within about an hour, an OB/GYN doctor and PA found me to have me \u2018re-tell\u2019 from my POV all my history and symptoms so they could confirm what was going on. They then informed me that due to what they saw on imaging, they were rather certain it was an ectopic pregnancy that had ruptured \u2013 including the fact that there was large amount of fluid in my abdomen. Within 20 mins I was being whisked to the OR, signed papers consenting to everything, including the knowledge they would most likely have to remove a fallopian tube and ovary. \n\nThe worst part was having to transfer myself to the OR table with pain level at 9, and then having lay back flat while not just in pain, but crying that I could not breathe, as with every breath I took I felt my chest and throat seize. Finally just tried to focus to take small breaths so I could pass out \u2013 and woke up 2 hours later post-operation in the recovery room. \n\nPost-operation, I was able to speak to the doctors who did the surgery and they said I had an interstitial ectopic pregnancy that ruptured \u2013 the rarest kind with most severe complications. The left fallopian tube and ovary was removed, which mirrored what they had seen in the ultrasound (they went in thinking it would be the right side). They removed 1.5 liters of blood from my abdominal cavity and \u2013 in their words \u2013 \u2018saved my life\u2019. It is possible that if a few more hours had gone by, I would not be here, or would at least have had to go to the ICU. Instead, I just required a blood transfusion and stayed in the hospital for one night for monitoring. \n\nThe pain was bad in the first hours post-operation, but after getting oxycodone and other meds throughout the night, was able to keep it under control. I was released the next day in the early afternoon \u2013 that was yesterday. Came home and took a 3 hour nap, and then slept 10 hours at night. Today (Friday), I am in bed recovering with alternating high doses of Tylenol and Advil. I have a follow up appointment on Tuesday to make sure everything is healing as it should.\n\nMoral of story \u2013 if you have any inclination at all that you could be experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, do not hesitate to demand frequent follow up. The doctors said that due to the type of ectopic pregnancy I had (interstitial) , the chances of being able to see anything on the sonogram was low in my earlier appointments \u2013 nevertheless, considering the fact that my HCG levels were increasing and not decreasing, with no visible embryo, I should have had some more frequent monitoring. I also did not do enough to take my own pain seriously when it first started at night \u2013 the severity of it, combined with the horrible dizziness was certainly a sign that something was not right. I probably should have gone to the hospital right away instead of trying to wait it out at home. \n\nWill keep the post updated once I hear more at my follow up next week, in case any one is interested. I am still trying to wrestle with everything that happened \u2013 physically and emotionally \u2013 including the trauma that is realizing I was a few hours away from much more severe implications. I will never forget saying a prayer while being wheeled into the OR, hoping to say alive for my beautiful daughter. I wish that experience on no one. I am so sorry for what you went through! I had a very similar ruptured ectopic last July. A few things that might be helpful to know from my experience: my recovery took much longer than expected and my pain during recovery was much worse than expected. Go easy on yourself and take pain meds on schedule. I was also severely anemic for about 3 months afterwards and needed an iron supplement (and stool softener-sorry if that is tmi!). My periods changed a lot and my hormones every month are much different than before. I did a lot more processing of emotions after I felt better physically, and it is been a very rough road.  This group has been very helpful for me!  Our experiences were so similar, feel free to message me if you ever want to talk more. Wishing you a smooth recovery! Thanks so much for the reply. It was helpful to have a place to dump all this detail while its still fresh in my memory. I am someone who is notorious for not taking vacation and sick time..and so am planning on taking the full week off next week to give myself time needed to recover. Will message you with more questions.... My experience was similar. Life-saving surgery and a lot of blood removed from my abdomen. What a trip! Thank god for science. Rest up! Where was your partner during all of this and is he going to be OK watching your three-year-old solo if and when your mom has to return home? Expect to be in recovery for a little while! My partner was out of state working approx. 9 hours away. He feels horrible about not being here when it happened, but he wouldnt have been able to accompany me to the hospital anyway due to COVID. He is back home now and should be ok with our daughter...he is planning on taking some days off from work next week to support as needed. \n\nCan I ask - what are the follow up appointment like? What do they check for? My appointment is Tuesday afternoon, with a follow up blood draw on Wednesday for HCG levels. \n\nI suppose some good news is that HCG yesterday was 500, down from 1300 prior to surgery. \n\nAny advice anyone has for recovery is welcome! I had just joined a gym and was looking forward to working out a lot this summer....I guess that is on hold for a while :-/ I had a ruptured tubal ectopic about 3 weeks ago. I experienced the same kind of seizing chest pain and not being able to lie down (for a ct scan) both before and after the surgery and I am glad to hear it was not just me cause the doctors were telling me it was normal and second guessing me when I asked for more pain meds and monitoring. \n\nI had about half a liter of internal blood loss and lost my right tube. They discharged me 2.5 hours after waking up from surgery as I was coming down off a second dose of fentanyl. I took the oxy and Tylenol they had given me when I got home, but still had to come back in an ambulance only a few hours later because my chest was still seizing up. \n\nPost surgery I had a difficult time getting up or bending over - to the point where I could not get fully dressed by myself till about 5 days after. I still have a big bruise on my stomach 3 weeks later, and the surgical glue has almost peeled all the way off. I am back to work now. (Bakery job so lots of lifting and standing 9 hours a day). I came back to work 2 weeks to the day after my surgery and I am still a lot slower than I used to be. \n\nAlso, It took me about a week and a half till I was off pain meds completely. Hope this helps. Feel better soon! Wow... that is very intense and I just went through something similar. I only lost 600ml of blood and had to undergo emergency surgery, but the pain was so unbearable I was hyperventilating and squealing by the time I got to the Operating room any time I had to move. This was one of the worst if not the worst experience of my life and I am just glad it is all over. What will remain is the \"why God\" why couldnt I have a normal pregnancy? Was it because I didnt take care of myself well enough, does God not see me fit to have a child.. etc. I wish this on no one and I think it should be a more widely covered topic in all aspects of life because they told me that had I not come in that day that I too, would have lost my life at age 25. I almost did not go in because I thought maybe it was just a miscarriage, constipation or food poisoning. Had I known about ectopic pregnancies I would have been much more concerned.. prayers for you and I am glad you are still here and sharing your story. \ud83d\udc95 Us women really deal with so much.\n\nEDIT: I did not take my phone with me and drove myself to ER despite almost passing out 2 times. Luckily I know my dads cell by heart(really only number I have memorized,) and he talked to me the entire time while I waited to be wheeled back for surgery. Had he not done this I think my panic attacks would have been much worse and probably more blood loss. During recovery I was ecstatic to see my boyfriend enter my room wearing his serving uniform. He walked 5 plus miles to me once he heard the news after work. Had I not had him and my dad I would have been very very miserable. You are a strong woman for going through this alone and also losing substantially more blood than I experienced. God bless you.", "Urgent Input! So as previously stated my wife had an ectopic almost a year ago to date (HCG at time of rupture was approximately 1700). \n\nLast Wednesday she had an HCG of 1689 (and it had been doubling accordingly and on track) but could not find the gestational sac. \n\nHowever, last Friday, it only jumped 33 points to 1,722 so we immediately suspected ectopic. Had blood work drawn today and it jumped up to close to 3,400. Based on conversations with our doctors (and my wife bleeding and her history and not seeing the gestational sac on Friday) we came to the ER. \n\nWe were told they still cannot see anything and it is a pregnancy of unknown location. So they are sending us home. \n\nWe are obviously terrified of another rupture somewhere. I am curious if any of you had experience with something like this. \n\nFrom our understanding a sac should be seen at this point. And we obviously do not want to administer methotrexate prematurely. We are just looking for any information that may help us moving forward while we discuss and strategize with our doctors. Go to another Doctor How did your wife and you make out after? I hope everything turned out okay. Thank you for checking. Unfortunately it was a second ectopic. Due to having been through it before we were very in tune to her body and how things were progressing and very aggressive with monitoring. \n\nLong story short. After a bad experience in the ER in which they sent us home. The very next day out Reproductive Endocrinologist found the ectopic in her one good tube. Resulting in methotrexate treatment. \n\nGlad we avoided surgery, obviously devastated with the outcome. Based on her history the most likely result is a birth defect that has impacted the function of the cilia within the fallopian tube. Therefore from here on out IVF is our only option. \n\nWe know it does not completely Eliminate the possibility of another ectopic, but hoping it is successful. \n\nBeen a very hard few weeks considering today is the one year anniversary of our first ectopic. I am so sorry for what you both are going through. The cause for all 4 of my ectopics were never really \u201cfigured out\u201d but basically the same thing - likely a problem with cilia. \n\nI am also awaiting ivf treatment (first appointment in less than a week!) after my final tube removal in January, so I am sending all the good thoughts your way. It is so sad you guys are going through this exactly a year apart and my heart breaks for you. \n\nYou guys are so strong and will get through this.", "Maybe telling my story will be therapeutic This week has been the cherry on top of one hell of a year. After suffering a blighted ovum in August, I didnt expect this. \n\nSo Saturday night I get the darkest BFP ever. Strange because its too early this cycle but I had a feeling about the light spotting. Sunday night hubby and I start feeling maybe we got food poisoning. He just has a bit of an upset stomach, Im vomitting and shivering all night with a lower right abdominal pain. First thing the next morning I run to my OBs office but she isnt in yet. Her staff assures me nausea and some light cramp with spotting can be normal. Do a urine test and congratulated me on my positive test. By this time my pain is just slight discomfort and they book the soonest apt on Thursday. I go home and feel like crap for a few hours. The right side pain comes back and I just run to the ER. Mri, ultrasounds, blood work. Rulled out appendicitis and gallbladder. They see a small mass by my right ovary not sure what it is. No sign of baby in uterus. Based on hcg 639 they say its too early to see any sign of baby. Since my pain isnt too bad now they say I should follow up with blood and ultrasound in 48 hours.\n\n40 hours later, (and my 32nd birthday) I leave work early and go straight to the hospital. Get blood and ultrasound again. Now hcg is 905. Again the same convo. Doc isnt sure if its ectopic or little baby is too small to detect and the thing by ovary could possibly be something else. They bring their on call OBGYN to talk to me. She says she doesnt want to give me too much hope. But she has seen viable pregnancies from slow rising hcg. And the fact that I didnt wait full 48 hours cant say for sure if it would have doubled. The docs call my OBGYN to consult. I dont hear the convo. Then the hospital OB pushed around my tummy and I did not have severe pain. She asked family history then decided to not do the pelvic exam she had planned on since I had an appointment with my OB the next day. \n\nThe next morning I wake up feeling fine. Maybe 40 minutes later a wave of nausea and now my discomfort is more like a period cramp and in the center and tender to the touch. I call my OB office and ask for an earlier apt. They say if I come in they will try to see me sooner. As I prepare to leave I first walk my dogs. I make it 30 feet before I feel like Im going to black out. I quickly drag them back inside where I collapse. I call my husband and tell him he needs to drive me because I cant now. We get the the office, I pee in the cup and as I am walking to the exam room I faint again. Now my doctor is checking me and tells me to go straight to the ER where shes calling ahead for her tests. An hour later Im in the operating room have my ruptured tube removed along with over a litre of blood removed from my abdomen. My OB met me at the hospital and performed the surgery. She said she couldnt believe the amount of blood, hours away from possibly being fatal. She also said she couldnt believe the ER the night before discharged me. Apparently when they called her, she suggested keeping me in and giving me the methotrexate shot to stop the developing pregnancy. How could they not tell me?!?\n\nI am distraught. I am in pain. Physically and more so emotionally. 2 trips to the ER where I said I think its ectopic. But Im just a hairstylist, not a doctor. I trusted them. \n\nEarly Monday morning pain almost killed me Thursday. I feel broken. I cannot stop crying. I feel like this is a bad dream that I cant wake from. My husband is being so positive and hopeful for the future. I cant even form a complete sentence about \"future plans.\" No one knew we were even trying. Let alone already had a previous miscarriage. I know this happens. But I feel like damaged goods and honestly too scared to try again. Please tell me it gets easier.\n\n(I am considering counseling)\n\nI send my love to all of you ladies that have gone through this. I am so sorry this happened to you. It is so frustrating when you do not feel heard about your own body by \u201cthe experts\u201d. I feel like there needs to be more education on handling patients\u2019 concerns. \n\nI am not sure if I have an ectopic pregnancy yet, but I am also worried about \u201cfuture plans\u201d. \n\nWishing you the best and hope writing your story was therapeutic. I am sorry you had to go through this. It sounds traumatic to say the least so it is ok to be scared. This was a big thing made worse by the fact that even though you saw doctors etc they did not act soon enough. Sending you love all the way the from the UK. Its going to take time before you feel ready again. I am not sure when I will. And finding someone to talk to about things cannot be a bad idea. X Telling your story helped me understand what a horrible thing this is to go through. My son &amp; his fiance learned she was pregnant on December 6th. She saw the OB today 12/31. She has been going through a rough few weeks since the 6th. We were hoping to hear what the due date would be today. Instead we got a call within an hour of her appointment that it is an ectopic pregnancy &amp; she requires emergency surgery today.  He said her fallopian tube ruptured while removing it.  She could have died if she had not gotten in today.\n\nWe had 25 days of joy, looking forward to this new little one.  Now we end the year with such sorrow.\n\nI hope you are beginning to feel stronger. Wishing you a good future filled with happiness. Sending the same love right back your way. I hope telling your story was as meaningful as it was reading it. \nI had a miscarriage in my early 20s and years later (30) had an ectopic. I can relate to the feelings of \"damaged goods\". \nYou are GOODS tho, regardless of our parts or pristine functioning. People who lose limbs and persevere (Purdy for example) motivate me, because I swear, even tho I was so early along, sometimes I feel like I lost something so important to me and doubt my own abilities to function... \nI do not want what I say to contribute any pain in your life or how you are feeling or worried about feeling later. I am just speaking from the heart. I appreciate you posting your story, it is like someone else out there in the world gets it.\n\nI am in counseling, and have been off and on for a while. Graduated with a Masters, happy with my life. Still battle depression, etc, but I rarely feel \"hopeless\". When I do, I make appointments. Our brains are amazing, sometimes good sometimes not. Hope you have a good support team, &amp; if you are worried about not having the right support, counseling is a good idea. Sometimes it is hard to get an unbiased space to air out feelings..friends and family can only give so much, after that i think it is totally ok to use a professional or support group (Reddit FTW) Kudos for researching what she is going through. I hope more MIL's do this, and I think it is fair for you to feel a sense of loss, and want to talk about it here too. Wishing your family a future of joy I am sending you all the love \u2764\ufe0f My story is similar, but I had almost no pain (similar to period cramps, but I have very painfull sometimes) but very much bleeding. In the beginning I thought that I had my period, but then the symptoms started and I did a test (+hundred more). I called my health clinic and they just assured me that there can be bleeding and I did not get an early ultrasound. I knew that I should have gotten one.\n\nBleeding was on and off through the weeks and when it got worse I called again and got to see a doctor who sent me to a womans clinic (these are Finnish places and procedures so the terms might be confysing, sorry!). I got my ultasound appointment and two days before the apptmt I started bleeding heavily. I was already sure that everything was not right (from the beginning!!!!) and they had me waiting all these weeks... I was devastated that I had to now also wait two days to my ultrasound appointment. (So they would not let me cone to the womens clinic bc my apptmt wa in two days)\n\nWhe my appointment came I got ultrasound. The doctor looked and then called a specialist. Then she looked and looked. \"There is nothing living here\" they said first. Then more looking. \"This might be an ectopic pregnancy\" but they said might? They tell me the treatment (surgery or medicine if hcg is lower) and send me to bloodtest to check my hcg (I had already been earlier so they had something to compare with). I get home and then they call me: \"Yout hcg is rising, come first thing in the morning, we are going to operate you\"\n\nI was dying inside from the moment they ultrasounded me. I was devastated and half the things they said I did not remember. When they called me, I did nothing. My whole body went in shock.\n\nTo add to the story I had to wait my surgery the whole day (9am to 1am) and then they told me: the surgery is tomorrow. By this time I had been in the hospital without food and water over 24h. And alone. I got to eat at night and then the next day they operated. They told me that often they would have to take the tube as well. So they had to take mine also.\n\nThis happened to me in october. I was so lost, sad and alone after that. I told my closest friends and family and was off from work for two months.\n\nI looked for support groups but there is not one. This was my seccond miscarriage as I had one also last june. In Finland there are no support groups for miscarriages either. I was so in need one.\n\nReading your story helped.\n\nNow I am pregnant (3rd time in 9months) again and I am totally traumatized. I cannot think anything but these past events. This is my personal hell and if I (and the baby) survive this, that is all I need. I cannot tell anyone. Only my sister and husband knows. And you.\n\nI got help and support and life was easier after my surgery. Time healed and everything was easier. So you get there with time (such a cliche but it is true). But this new pregnancy took me back, but this propably does not happen to everybody.\n\nI do not know if this helped but I can relate to all what you wrote. Thank you for your support, and I am sorry this happened to you as well. It gives me hope knowing you were able to get pregnant again.  I wish you the best with this pregnancy. Thank you! There is always hope they say, but I know that can feel lost sometimes. It took me some time to get to hope. My doctors told me that one lost tube should not affect falling pregnant again, so there is that!", "Ectopic Pregnancy, causes, symptoms, and treatment Every women should read this once to know about Ectopic Pregnancy. Becoz now a days most of the womens are passing through this problem..!!Click - ", "Referred to ER to assess for ectopic; confusing feedback I am nearly 5 weeks pregnant (my second pregnancy, the first was uncomplicated and my son was born healthy). I went to urgent care 2 days ago for right side abdominal pain. No bleeding, though when they asked I mentioned that a week before I had very minor spotting which I assume was implantation bleeding. Urinalysis and bloodwork came back normal so they told me to go to the emergency room, which I did. \n\nThis is where it gets confusing - had a transvaginal ultrasound which revealed \u201cintrauterine\u201d pregnancy. Hcg levels at about 4,000. They also noticed 2 subchorionic hemorrhages. The doctor said it looked like the sac was implanted in the uterus but they still wanted me to come back in 2 days to check rising hcg. They also said they could not rule out ectopic which does not make sense to me if it is intrauterine? He mentioned they could not tell me where the pain is coming from though they did see 2 cysts, one on each side. It seems like they are saying ectopic cannot be ruled out bc of unknown cause of pain, but if it is intrauterine then it is not ectopic...? \n\nWould appreciate feedback. Unfortunately it is possible to have an intrauterine pregnancy AND an ectopic pregnancy at the same time - it is called a heterotopic pregnancy although it is very rare. It sounds good if your hcg is rising as expected and they have found the pregnancy. It is quite normal to have follow up checks if you are experiencing pain and sounds like they would rather play it safe which is also good. I hope your next checks show a healthy developing pregnancy. Have everything crossed for you! Ectopic survivor here:) I am sorry you are dealing with this. It must be frustrating and hard to deal with. \n\nTo give you some background because I empathize with the unknowing aspect of this: I know that with my ectopic it was also confusing. The doctors did not know what was actually going on with me and literally told me they were \u201chaving meetings about what to do with me\u201d a week after going into the ER after they saw the ectopic in my right tube. They initially said methotrexate shots would dissolve the pregnancy. Unfortunately for me it did not. Basically what the doctors finally told me was \u201cectopics are tricky. One is never like the other\u201d I ended up having my right tube removed as my levels continued to rise and the ectopic began to burst.\n\nGo with your gut, your intuition. Leave no stone unturned. Good luck and I hope you health, and that you have a healthy pregnancy.", "Why did this happen? I am on day 4 of recovery from my ectopic pregnancy surgery. The DR. removed my right fallopian tube during the surgery. I was estimated to be about 5 weeks pregnant. I had just found out that I was pregnant that same day.

I am trying so hard to keep it together, but none of my friends, family, or boyfriend really understand how I am feeling. I feel as if they do not realize how major it was. The world does not stop just because you are in pain and complete sadness has taken over your life. I feel like most people do not really care if it is not happening to them. I am not okay, and I have no one to talk to about this sadness that I am feeling.

I am currently 5+2 along and had my HCG level drawn on 7/28 and it was 556 and then again on the 7/30 and it rose to 1656!!! I was thrilled. But I still have this constant worry and pit in my stomach. I have cramping and some pain on both sides (kind of like ovary pain) but of course am so worried it is an ectopic pregnancy. I have NO spotting or bleeding. Idk if it is round ligament pain or ectopic pain. I have my first ultrasound in two days!\n\nAny thoughts??? Thank you in advance!  Did you had Ivf ? The chances are so low since you dont use tube in IVF.  Your HCG numbers dont look like it is ectopic. Pain can be just because of ovarian stimulation and trigger hormones you may have taken. Minor pain is not an issue, see if it is increasing as time goes on. Good luck and hope you feel better. \ud83d\ude42 Nope no IVF! My first day of my LMP was June 27th.

I am currently about 4/5 weeks pregnant and I have been getting cramps on my left side of my abdomen. My hCG and progesterone levels are normal so far but I am still concerned as I have also noticed a few other things. I am currently very constipated at the moment and I have noticed that the same side that hurts is much more bloated than my right side. I have never had this before.. did anyone else have one side more bloated than the other side when they had an ectopic pregnancy? Or if you did not have an ectopic, what was it? I have my first scan next week to see if the baby is in my womb but I am giving up hope due to all my symptoms. People sometimes experience cramps on one side due to the corpus luteum cyst that forms when you ovulated from that side. If your HCG levels are doubling every 48 hours then I would not be super concerned just yet, however if the pain becomes unbearable or if you start bleeding heavily that would be cause for concern. Wishing you all the best! Yes i was extremely constipated.  Ive been pregnant several times and i never had such constipation so early so i knew something was off. You should never have any kind of dull pain on one side of your pelvis either in a normal pregnancy. I wouldnt even wait for your appt i would go to the ER today I was also extremely bloated. I went to the ER and demanded an ultrasound as i was convinced i was having an ectopic and i was right. Going in when i did saved my life or at least me having to have surgery. I got the methotrexate shot The pain is not bad at all and I have had no bleeding that is why I am not as worried. I cannot have a scan straight away as I did a few days ago and they could not see anything because I am so early. My hCG and progesterone are normal so far, what was yours like? My pain wasnt bad either. Very dull and would come and go. Idk what my hcg was before bc i actually went in to get a termination when i was 6 weeks. I asked them to make sure i didnt have an ectopic and the ultrasound tech didnt see anything but she seemed kind of new so i think she missed it. I had a heterotrophic ectopic meaning one in tube and 1 in uterus so regardless i was going to have to have a termination.  Anyway she only saw the one in the uterus. So i took the pills  and bled like normal but 2 and a half/ 3 weeks later when i went to get my hcg tested  it had gone up instead of going down and at that point it was like 2650 i think. They wanted me to get an ultrasound the following weel but i knew something was not right and there is no way i had retained tissue i wasnt even bleeding anymore like i knew it had to be an ectopic. So i went to the ER and made them give me an ultrasound.  I WAS RIGHT . You should be able to go to the hospital and get one. Just tell them you think you are having an ectopic. Better safe than sorry.  The ER doctor told me i was lucky i came when i did Seconding what Particular said above. Pain was not bad until my tube actually ruptured. Also was on and off for me. No idea if a low hCG is normal for *everyone* with an ectopic but when I went to the ER, my hCG was in the 6000s. Cannot testify to the doubling pattern as I did not know I was pregnant until I went to the ER but it was certainly quite high. Wish I had made an appointment when I first started feeling pain because it cost me one of my fallopian tubes (I had ovarian cysts on numerous occasions prior to my ectopic and assumed it was another cyst, tho cysts pain does not really come and go but I did not know that at that time). I definitely recommend getting it checked ASAP! When you was bloated was it your whole belly or just one side? For me it was like my whole abdominal area. I looked huge. It was painful bloating too. Like so bad. If in doubt go have them check . Yes I was very bloated. It was just a cyst in the end. 7 weeks pregnant currently and everything\u2019s going well! Awe I am so So glad \ud83d\udc95congratulations:)", "Is this ectopic or normal pregnancy? I am not due to go in for my first checkup for a little while longer. However, I \"knew\" I was pregnant almost immediately, with symptoms showing up at least a week before my missed period. I also had what I am assuming was implantation pain, a week before my period was due, radiating from my pelvis to my back, which felt similar to the bad pain I experienced before during my (unfortunate) miscarriage.\n\nI am about five weeks now, and I have had constant moderate lower back pain the entire time (more on the right side), have mild tenderness in my right ovary that comes and goes (though it is been gone more lately), pretty bad dizziness (I am anemic but was not dizzy before this), and will feel fine fine fine all day until suddenly I feel like my blood pressure has dropped and I get waves of nausea. While I do struggle with constipation normally, I do also feel like there is some extra pressure that makes me feel like I need to go. But I am already struggling 'going'.\n\nThis is my first, so I am unsure what is considered normal. Hi. I think if you are concerned then you should get checked out sooner rather than later. I do not know where you are based..possibly US? I guess urgent care/acute care rather than A+E  (unless you also have pain in your shoulder tips: the point where your arm meets your shoulder in which case go straight to A+E). I do not want to say your symptoms are consistent with an ectopic pregnancy and unnecessarily scare or painc you but they COULD be. I sincerely hope that they are not. Sending you love and best wishes x Just wanted to add: i had a  constant slight ache at one side and slight bleeding at 5 weeks which progressed to heavier bleeding at 6 weeks and a diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy but no other symptoms so it does not always follow that everyone has every symptom. If you have any concerns at any point PLEASE PLEASE GET CHECKED OUT. I I have not had any bleeding, but I know not everyone experiences it. I have an appointment for when I am 6 weeks - would that be considered too late? I do not have shoulder tip pain, but for the first week I did have a strange pain/soreness in my right shoulder where it meets my chest. Felt like nothing I would experienced before. It is gone away now though, which I am assuming would not be the case if something was severely wrong? I had pain that radiated from my left lower pelvic area down my hip that came and went during my ectopic. I felt it only twice and it went away after resting. Besides that, I had no symptoms until I ruptured at 9 weeks. I only had shoulder pain hours after I ruptured. I am telling you this so you know it might not be a constant pain and you might not feel shoulder pain until you have already ruptured (which at that point you would probably be experiencing severe abdominal pain). If you have questions get it checked out. The alternative is wait and it ends up you are having an ectopic pregnancy and your life is at risk. I hope you are not, but it is better to get checked out than wait and see. Have you had your hcg checked? Not yet. That should happen at my 6 week appointment, I think. It does seem like it fluctuates a lot though, just based on how I feel mentally/physically? I had an ectopic in November that resulted in a tube loss and am currently pregnant again. And I will say that early in this pregnancy I had pain/tenderness, dizziness etc.. I thought for sure that I was going through it again (slight ptsd for sure) and it turned out to be a large cyst on my ovary, likely from ovulation. \n\nI was fortunate that I got to have a very early scan which confirmed placement and I was able to see the cyst. If your nervous get seen. And if anything gets worse, go to the ER, but know this could be completely normal.. so try not to worry (even though it is easier said than done) best of luck! I would ask for an hcg blood draw. Typically doctors do two of them at the time you find out you are pregnant to ensure the number is doubling. How are you making out? \ud83d\udc95 Thanks for checking in!\n\nI still do not have my appointment for another week yet. Overall I have been okay, although my back is still constantly achy, particularly the lower right quadrant. I did have a weird episode the other day however where my back hurt pretty bad for an hour, my stomach seized up as if all my abdominals were tightened, and I got very out of it - walking as if in a daze, unable to finish complete sentences. My body - stomach especially - also felt numb to the touch. I also cannot walk up stairs without being unable to speak/breathe afterward.\n\nWe will see what the doctor says. I am not sure if those are ectopic symptoms at all, but they are definitely not normal. Girl! With those symptoms I would go into emerg or get your doctor to up your appointment time. Whether ectopic or not those symptoms sound not good. You do not want to risk this especially if it ends up ectopic as it is such a medical emergency. \ud83d\udc95 not trying to scare you but as a nurse - please go seek out medical help Edit to add it could also be symptoms of something completely unrelated to pregnancy. Just should be checked with what has been going on. \ud83d\udc95 at the very least get your hcg checked before 6 weeks. The nurse in me is just concerned hearing this. Not to sound pushy and mom like haha. I do know I have mild anemia, but I cannot imagine it would get so bad so fast? Most women I talk to do not start iron until much later. I do not know but although I am only a nurse I am no doctor  - those symptoms you are describing really should be checked out in hospital or by your family doctor as soon as you can my love. Do not put yourself at risk. It could be nothing but it could be everything.", "Diagnosed today Hi.. so today I should be 6 weeks pregnant but after bleeding started on Sunday and begging my doctor to refer me to an early pregnancy assessment unit (I am in the UK), because I thought I was having a miscarriage, I was diagnosed this afternoon with an ectopic pregnancy. Honestly..I feel...relieved. I know there are a whole lot of scary implications but I am just taking it one step at a time but I feel relieved this was never a viable pregnancy. I have not lost a baby because this was never going to be a baby. I am relieved that we have found it early so I am now under the care of the hospital so my chances of a rupture and needing surgery are reduced. I am sad. I am desperately sad. But also feeling like everything might be ok. Eventually. I just wanted to post and see if anyone else had this mix of emotions? I have had a blood test today and need to go back in 48 hours for more blood test to see if it is resolving naturally before taking methotrexate if required. Sending love to everyone. Because this is big. And scary. But maybe..everything will be ok. Eventually. I feel the same way you do. Once you get a diagnosis, it is much easier mentally to make your plan and to know that you have things in place as far as treatment goes. I am also desperately sad at the loss of possibility that came with finding out we had a pregnancy of unknown location (mine has never been visable), but on the flip side, I also have never felt like I lost a baby.  This was our last embryo transfer before we move into a childfree life, so I am feeling with that too. Among that grief there is a small relief that at least I have my answer. \n\nIts really hard because I have good days and bad days. Sometimes I have hours where I feel down, then I feel a bit better later. You are not alone in your feelings and you are not alone in what is happening. \ud83d\udc9c  Taking it one appointment and day at a time helps. Thanks. Sorry to hear your situation, too. Jeez it sucks does not it? \n\nMy best friend AND my sister in law are currently pregnant so I am going to have to negotiate those feelings too. I do not feel jealous of them or angry or anything but it is just going to make me feel sad. All. The  Time. While I have to pretend to be happy. Uurgh. And it is christmas. What a kick in the teeth. Honestly..2020 can just do one because it has been a sucky year. \n\nTake care xx You are very fortunate to be diagnosed early. I am glad you are safe and getting treatment. I just went through my own but unfortunately my doctors never officially diagnosed me and I ruptured. I just posted my own story.\n\nAs for the pregnancies around you, I know how hard it is. It kills me to see their progress. I just have to remind myself negativity wont help anything. Easier said than done, I know. I have just read your story and yes, I am fortunate that it has been found early. Especially as I was not getting all of the symptoms.\n\nAnd you are right about other people's pregnancies. There is not point being angry or jealous. I am sad though. But I think its ok to be sad. It is a sad thing which is happening. Sending you love x", "Ectopic Pregnancy Yo, I recently went through surgery for a VERY unexpected ectopic pregnancy and am feeling pretty out of whack in the midst of all of this. I am not so much grieving a loss, but more so feeling like an emotional wreck and am wondering what is going on with me physiologically and if anyone with a similar experience has any advice and whatnot. TYIA. hi! when it comes to your emotions, i totally feel you. its definitely difficult. i was a wreck after finding out i had an ectopic pregnancy, as it was also veryy unexpected. in terms of advice all i can really advise is that you take good care of your self. its a lot to go through. its always good to take some time for yourself to heal, whether it be w a nice bath, meditation, or taking a short walk. sending you lots of love. itll get better. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc97 It had so many emotions for me and took a while to process and move forward: Hormonally, mentally, emotionally, and with my partner.

My period is pretty predictable and usually comes between the 25-27 of each month, which is why I was surprised to see the blood. I continued to get my daughters ready for school, but continued to feel spotting/trickling in my underwear. I went to check on things again in the bathroom and had some spotting in my underwear as well as drops of blood in the toilet and on the toilet paper. I was also feeling lightheaded and had a headache. By the time I dropped my girls off I was feeling a little concerned, about a potential ectopic pregnancy. Kind of far fetched I know- but in my gut that is all I could think about (I had a tubal ligation with my c/s from 2019)... so I grabbed a pregnancy test on the way home, took it and it was negative. This does not surprise me, because I am still 7-10 days away from expecting my period to begin with... As the afternoon progresses I am still spotting, and have a slight cramping sensation on the left side of my belly about a hands width down from my belly button and a slight urge to poop, but nothing comes out. I am still lightheaded and have some neck stiffness as well. I have a phone call in to my obgyn, but thought I would see if any of you have any past experience? Why else would I have spotting? If it helps, my lmp was Jan 24th through 27th ish and my husband and I last had sex 1/29. IF it were an EP, would this be too soon to be having symptoms anyway? Thanks for any input! I am not a doctor. But I have had 3 ectopic pregnancies and am reasonably well versed in how/when pregnancies occur and under what circumstances. \n\nTo me, in my experience, if your cycle is regular and predictable, I would say yes it is definitely too early to be seeing any symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy. Still, if you are worried, call your doctor and ask to have your blood tested for beta hcg. \n\nBest of luck, &amp; take care!

I am scheduled for an ultrasound tomorrow, and I have no other severe symptoms other than a bit of pain on my right side by my hip.

I am not bleeding.\n\nCould this be ectopic shoulder pain, or likely unrelated?\n\nThank you I hope your ultrasound goes well! For me, the shoulder pain was more stabbing than feeling like a muscle pull, but that is just my experience. I also had a lot of bleeding. This certainly does not rule out the possibility though. Hope this helps and that everything turns out okay for you \u2764\ufe0f Do not ever feel bad for asking a question! It is nice to get information from people who have gone through these things and there is no judgement. My shoulder pain hurt when I turned my head, and it hurt to laugh or move too much. It did kind of feel like a pulled muscle :/ I also had no bleeding, and had dull achy pain on my left hip. \n\nIf you feel the pain is getting worse, I would suggest going to the ER. I waited until the next morning to call my OB bc I did not want to waste money on an ER visit (ended up going to the ER anyway after my OB visit).

I just thought, I would have liked a little more information about what I was going through, when I was going through it, so I hope this helps someone. \n\nOk, so I was ttc for about 2 months, taking prenatal but no ovulation calendar or anything. (I am 32 years old and recently married.) I discovered some spotting and blood in my urine so I took a pregnancy test and it came back positive. I had no pain at this time. As I began planning for the pregnancy I kept noticing more bleeding/spotting/blood in urine than I could abide. I went to the clinic with a possible early miscarriage. They did some trans vaginal ultrasounds, but it was just too early to tell. \n\nA couple of weeks later, I returned. Still, I was experiencing the blood in urine, bleeding, and now, pelvic pressure. I was sure I was miscarrying. They did another ultrasound and confirmed that there was no baby in the uterus. My hgc levels were rising normally, and they saw a mass in my overy area and sent me to the emergency room. \n\nAt the emergency room they did another ultrasound and confirmed the ectopic pregnancy. They then injected me with methotrexate and sent me home with a couple of pain killers. I was told that because it was an early case, (less than 5 weeks) the fetus may be reabsorbed into my body and that I might not notice anything too out of the ordinary. \n\nSo here is the part I want any lady going though this to hear: \nI did not feel anything out of the ordinary. I felt my body go back to normal with no pain, no passing of blood/clumps/anything and I felt myself go back to normal. \n\nEvery week after this injection I went back to measure my hgc levels. They went down accordingly, until I was only at 40 hgc. At that point my obgyn told me I was ok to begin my prenatal vitamins again and resume life. So I did. \n\nFor a week. To the hour, a week after I resumed prenatal vitamins, I had a sudden horrible pain in my abdomen which I can only describe as cramping, but filling with fluid, and 10/10 pain. My ectopic had ruptured. I went back to the emergency room (alone, my husband was not allowed because of the covid) and discovered that the methotrexate had not worked, unfortunately. \n\nMy obgyn came and removed my ectopic, along with my left Fallopian tube, and saved my life. I am grateful that she was there and everyone did their part. \n\nI want women to read stories about these things, because I scoured the internet for them. I wanted a longer list of examples and came up pitifully short. I do not know if they would have helped me, but they could not have hurt. So here is mine. Please, ladies, share your stories I am so sorry that happened, but thank you for sharing your story. I had a rupture just hours after getting my MTX shots, which seemed like awful timing to me. I cannot imagine going weeks thinking you are in the clear, to then have it still to rupture. I hope your recovery is going more smoothly! That sounds so awful and I am so sorry you went through that! I received my methotrexate shots and got weekly blood draws and just two days I finally got down to &lt;1 hcg in my blood. However, I am surprised your OB told you it was okay to resume prenatals before you reached normal hcg levels. I wonder if that helped to contribute to your shot not being successful? I am not sure, just curious. \n\nBefore all of this happened to me, I never knew how they handled an ectopic pregnancy. While the shots I endured were very painful, I am glad I was able to return to normal levels, so it seemed to work for me. Again, I am so sorry about what you endured. I pray your recovery is quick, and you are not alone in how you are feeling \u2764\ufe0f Sorry to hear these stories. I am going through an ectopic pregnancy at the moment and I am having anxiety. I have been in and out the clinic every three days. I am curious to see how many methotrexate shots did they have to give you in order for your levels to go down ? They just gave me my first one this Friday and they called me yesterday to tell me my numbers are not going down. I received \u201cone treatment\u201d which involved two shots in my lower back. I remember that I had to get my levels taken every few days initially and after 3 times of getting my blood drawn, they started to see the decrease they needed to see. All in all, it took me 6-7 weeks for my levels to be back to normal, where if I took a pregnancy test now it would be negative. \n\nI would wait until at least a week after your treatment to worry about your levels going down. I am not a professional by any means but just do your best to listen to the doctors advice. It is hard to be patient, but it is the name of the game in this situation unfortunately :( Thanks so much for the prompt response. I have never heard of an ectopic pregnancy until now and I have been having so much anxiety I totally get it, I did too. It is a very scary situation. I am in therapy so I was able to talk to my therapist about all of this while it was happening. It might be a good idea to talk to a professional about how you are feeling. But I will also say a prayer for you! Please let me know if/when you hear more about your situation. So sweet of you \ud83d\udc9e I appreciate it and I will keep you posted Thank you so much for your comment. This was my first ever post, and I am not sure how to update it, but I just finished my follow up appointment with my obgyn and would like to just point out to anyone who read it, that my story was extremely, extremely rare. That was why I was not able to find examples posted online, and why I was just unable to prepare for such an outcome. \nI think you are exactly right, that resuming the prenatal vitamins escalated the rupture. It is a learning lesson for me, and my doctors and nurses too, probably. I do not know if it caused the shot to fail, but if I could do it over, I would have insisted that I get blood draws until it was down to &lt;1, and maybe even an ultrasound at the end to be sure. It is a shame how very limited we all are to reproductive research and technology so far, but I am accepting that this has all happened, everyone tried their best to help me, and am at peace. \nI am hoping that my post does not scare anyone who is anxious after getting the methotrexate shot. My case was so rare, with levels returning to near normal at the expected rate. But it did happen, and I am just grateful that this subreddit has allowed me to share, get support, heal, and maybe help someone in some way Either way, it seems that you are doing as well as expected given the unfortunate circumstances.

It was really rough on my husband and I bc he was trying to be supportive but he did not understand how dark of a place I was in mentally so I would lash out on him bc he had moved on and went back to normal but I just was not ready for that yet. I really really struggled. I think I finally started to be somewhat okay once my hcg went back to normal. That took about a month. My surgery was April 1st. We had planned on telling our families on mothers day so that day was really hard for me. I still have days where I get really sad about it. My anxiety has gotten substantially worse since to the point that my doctor is going to add another med to help take the edge off. Other than that I am doing okay all things considered. I am so sorry you are going through this too. My ectopic was in March, and I lost my left tube and a lot of blood. The whole experience was pretty traumatic. Physically, I felt better about a week post op, though still sore at times and then tired from the blood loss. Emotionally though, I am still not 100%. The first few weeks were rough- I cried everyday. It does get better with time, but I still have days where I just think of how unfair this is and break down. If it will make you feel better to talk about your loss, find a trusted friend or family member. And this sub and r/miscarriage have been great support. And honestly, during this time you do not need to worry about anyone else- you need to focus on yourself. If you need to tell them to leave you alone for a while, do it. This experience is hard enough to go through without dealing with everyone else. I had the same thing happen. I feel the same way and I also feel so disconnected from everything like I am in my own turned upside down world. I hope it gets easier for us to process these emotions as we heal. Hugs take care", "First Christmas post ectopic pregnancy and MTX ", "Serious pain when having period cramps Hey all. I had an ectopic pregnancy and my right tube removed July 23rd of this year. Every period since, I have intense and sharp pain on that right side on what feels like the site where the tube was removed. Has anyone else had this? I am confused by it. I have pains there frequently, but it is almost unbearable when I am on my period. To be honest, I would go on to the OB to talk about it, but I literally have not been able to bring myself to go to any appointments because of all the emotional and physical trauma that I associate with being there. Thanks for reading this far and thank you all for your experiences in advance. This seriously sucks.", "Mod Reminder - Rule #2: Do Not Come Here for Medical Advice I am seeing many posts asking \"could this be ectopic?\", \"am I having an EP?\". \n\nDo not come here for medical advice. Ectopic Pregnancies are a life-threatening emergency. **If you even suspect you might be having an ectopic pregnancy, contact your doctor right away.**", "Regulating after ectopic Hi! I had a ectopic pregnancy back in mid November which resulted in the removal of one of my tubes. My question is for those of you who also lost a tube.. how long did it take for your cycle to go back to normal? I am having all kinds of emotional and physical side effects of pmsing/menstruating but no flow.", "Ectopic Pregnancy is fatal Ectopic \\[regnancy is dangerous to mothers  so it is better to understand all its aspects\n\n(", "Almost a week post-op Hi All, after learning I was pregnant I went to the doctor for my first visit (appx 7 weeks). My HCG level was ~1900 but they were not able to see a pregnancy with a vaginal sonogram. We figured it may be too early, so my doctor had me wait a week to return and try again. 2nd visit and they were still unable to locate the pregnancy. My obgyn determined it was too risky to continue the pregnancy (My hcg level that day was 4300)I was sent directly to the hospital and we agreed to move forward with Methotrexate to treat what we all assumed was an ectopic pregnancy. This was a whirlwind of emotions in itself! \n\nThe treatment was rough on me physically, I felt tired all the time and the non-folate diet was incredibly hard to follow. Emotionally, I was heartbroken - My fianc\u00e9 and I were looking forward to starting a family and was beginning to worry that we may need fertility treatments. \n\nFast forward a week after my second dose of methotrexate, I woke up with the worst cramps ever. We rushed to the ER and discovered that although the treatment was working and my hcg was now at 1100, my Fallopian tube ruptured and they had to immediately remove the tube. At this point they were still not able to locate it so they would have to go into both tubes with a camera to find it (later learned it was in the left tube near opening by the ovaries). \n\nNow, here I am 5 days post-op and physically and emotionally I am a wreck. The pain has subsided and able to walk around and do things like cook and some light cleaning, but I am experiencing diarrhea and gas. I do not know if this is due to the surgery or the methotrexate but it is very uncomfortable and wondering if anyone had a similar experience and how long did it last? \n\nMy anxiety has been off the roof. I have a hard time sleeping, I cry anytime my fianc\u00e9 has to run to the store and immediately want to rush back to the ER with any new symptom. I really hope time will help me regain some sanity :( Ugh\u2026 it all sucks so much. Check in with your ob\u2019s nurse line as often as you need with new symptoms. The emotions are the worst part. Lean on your partner if possible and know that many other women have been in your shoes! Thank you. I knew very little about ectopic pregnancies prior to this experience. I definitely encourage women to share their experiences. I am so sorry. Ectopics are such a different kind of hell and I am really sorry you are going through this. \n\nI found mtx made me extremely tired and miserable both times I had it. Try taking some fiber to bulk things up perhaps? It might help. When I had my second surgery I was SO panicked to be alone. I actually had a full blown panic attack thinking I was having a heart attack the moment I got home after a week stay on the maternity floor waiting for surgery to take my last tube. If you are having severe anxiety like that definitely speak to your doctor about perhaps getting something to take short term like an anti anxiety medication. \n\nYou have been through a serious trauma, it is expected to feel the way you feel. You also have a million hormones dropping on top of it all. \n\nI had 4 ectopics (3 within 12 months and both tubes removed within 6 months of eachothdr.) I wrote out my experience if you check on my page. It is not a happy ending (yet) but we just started our ivf cycle this week and hopefully will finally get our miracle.\n\nYou are not alone \ud83d\udc9c hugs Thanks for sharing. Every day is a little better than the last and I am grateful. I am also so sorry you have experienced this. Wishing you all the best and strength during your Ivf cycles. Thank you! \ud83d\udc96", "Sitting in the ER. Just got diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy (after trying for 1.5yrs). I am told they want to remove my Fallopian tube. And possibly my ovary. How did you deal with so much horrible news?  I am really sorry for what you are going through. It took them nearly 3 weeks to diagnose me and get it was a complete shock. It is now just over 3 weeks ago that I had the surgery. I am recovering physically very well. My stitches have come out and my bruises have all more or less faded. I had those absorbable ones that would have fallen on the outside.\nThe day after surgery I thought I would have needed to get a wheelchair to move. I now laugh at that. I have got counselling in the pipeline as I still have processed much however.\nI was coming from a previous miscarriage that was devastating (about a year ago), so I think my brain is taking a little longer to protect itself and does not want to jump to the same spot.\nThe possibilities of conceiving are still there, but if you can, a few weeks after I would recommend to book an appointment just to have a few checks done (a follow up for me was not necessary if a test after 2 weeks stated I was no longer pregnant).\nYou can do it. You will come out from the bright side. I am so very sorry but your body is strong. It will recover, probably sooner than your mind. But your brain is also a superhero. Have faith in yourself, ask for help when you need it. I had the same thing happen tried for two yrs and in feb of this year I was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy they took my right tube and it hurt mentally and physically. The best thing to do I just lay down for a week of so after. We are currently ttc 7 months later but no luck so far. I feel your pain am I am sorry for your loss. Take time to recover. \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f When they told me right before surgery that I was going to need surgery because the baby had a heartbeat, I lost it. I sobbed. I was heartbroken. I did lose my tube too. Thank you for your responses.  It has been a hard couple day recovering physically. Emotionally I am on a roller coaster of feeling ok to being so sad for the loss of my baby.  I am letting time heal both.  With my husband/families support I feel stronger.  I appreciate the time. Thank you.", "How does it feel I was trying to figure out how an ectopic pregnancy feels. How would your body feel? I am freaking out I am 5 weeks and my lower right side of my stomach feels weird. It is not like a sharp pain. It is hard to explain. I had brown discharge the other day. It only lasted a day and did not feel up a panty linear. Maybe I am having slight cramping because I am not drinking enough water. Can you guys explain? I am so sorry that you are feeling scared. My experience is that my pain was not bad, until it was BAD. I was 6-7 weeks and had spotted a little bit, but then it changed so I decided to make an appointment with a doctor on Thursday. She ordered and HCG test and said we would schedule an ultrasound the following week. Throughout the weekend I spotted a little, nothing crazy and not very heavy.. I woke up in the wee hours of the morning that following Monday and I knew something was wrong. It was indescribable. I ended up going to the ER and was in for emergency surgery a few hours later and told it was good I came in because my tube was cracked but not yet ruptured.\n\nThe hardest part about pregnancy is that if you google it is either perfectly normal or something is wrong not a ton of nuance. If you feel like something is off, make an appointment. It is better to be safe than sorry. I hope all is normal for you and everything is okay \u2764\ufe0f Mine felt like some of the worst period cramps I would ever had, akin to the feeling I had right before I had to have my appendix removed. It was in the lower left side of my abdomen. If you are concerned, book an appointment with your doc. It is not worth risking your health to wait it out. Sending love \u2764\ufe0f I remember the pain I had before I had to get my appendix removed. It is nothing like that at all. It just feels weird I literally cannot explain it. My first one felt like pretty intense period cramps that would come and go at intervals of minutes. I also had a lot of brown spotting/bleeding with it. With my second one, I had a sharp pinching pain down near my uterus, but to the left (the tube where the embryo was stuck) for a night and most of a day before I started to bleed bright red like a period. At that point I went to the ER (it was the weekend) and go my diagnosis. If you start having a lot of pain and bleeding or if your symptoms get worse, do not hesitate to get to the ER. If it is ectopic and you rupture, it can become life threatening very quickly. In any case, I would def push to follow up with the dr ASAP. I am sorry you are having some concerning symptoms and I very much hope it is nothing. Sending hugs. Thank you so much I am thinking it is constipation I do not have any spotting today the weird feeling left after multiple bowel movements I go to the doctor Monday. Did you have morning sickness, nausea, sensitive to smell of foods and any dysgeusia? Possible trigger warning: mention of current pregnancy. That early, I probably only started feeling a bit more tired. I do remember throwing up the night before going to the ER, but that was more from pain than anything else. I have been pregnant several times and never really had intense early symptoms. Even in my current one (I am almost 24 weeks and everything is good and normal so far) I did not start having too intense of symptoms until about week 7 or 8. And I never had very bad morning sickness or nausea. What I am getting at is that I have not noticed a marked difference in symptoms in myself between all of my failed pregnancies and this one (meaning up until the point of obvious miscarriage). 5 weeks may also just be a little early to be feeling much yet. Early pregnancy is a scary time though and it is rough when it seems like every sensation your body goes through could be pregnancy related for better or worse, but is more frequently just gas or something. Hopefully your dr will be able to help you figure out what is going on difinitively and give some reassurance. Fingers crossed for you and hoping everything's good! Thank you so muchhhhh it is well needed and congratsssss A week ago I had some pelvic pain similar to having a kidney infection or UTI. There was pressure when I pee and when I poop. Husband is a doctor and immediately prescribed me UTI medication and pain meds. Felt a little bette for a few days and 3 days later I forgot to bring my pain meds. I thought i was getting my period since I am due in 2 days. I started driving to the nearest CVS to get some pain meds. I got there and the pain became so excruciating, stabbing and I could not even step on the gas. I realized that this is something that pain med cannot cure so I decided to go to urgent care. Urine test can back, negative on UTI, positive on pregnancy. I told the doctor I never had this pain during the first one so they had to transfer me to the ER to get ultrasound. They found out that I have ectopic pregnancy and inside my left Fallopian tube. This was around 8 pm and I had my surgery at 4 am.  \n\nI say, trust your instincts. I had no idea I was pregnant. No bleeding. Just stabbing pain and pain during intercourse. I honestly blame the weed I have been smoking or the edibles I have been eating. I do not know how this happened. I still feel sad that I could not do anything and there was no way to save what could have have been my 2nd baby. \n\nTake care and sending you hugs and prayers.", "Cramping, pain after sex, no period. Plz help! \nSo for the last few months my periods have been irregular. Last month I had one on the 31st then again on the 15th. Before that it was around the 6-9th every month. But how long they were varied. I have also been cramping in-between every period. Last week my cramps started and I also had breast tenderness and was very emotional. I took 2 pregnancy tests and both were negative. Last night my hubby and I got frisky and it was a bit painful  but not bad. I have had sex right before my period and it was tender so I did not think anything of it. After about 10 mins when we were finished I got extremely horrible cramps that came in waves of pain centered right above my pubic bone. It lasted for about 30 mins then subsided to a dull ache. I am still experiencing dull pain and am dizzy and fatigued. I am going to the doctor today but I am so stressed out about what it could be! Has anyone experienced symptoms like this? What did it turn out to be? I know everyone is different but I am really just looking for similar experiences so I can calm my nerves... I am glad you are going to the doctor to get help. Sorry you are feeling poorly and sound anxious. \nHave you previously had ectopic? If you are testing negative for pregnancy, it is unlikely what you are experiencing is an ectopic pregnancy. \nI did have pain after my ectopic, random pains esp during pre-period or period times, and usually on my R side where I had the ectopic.

Also sharp stabbing pains after I eat a meal in my left lower abdomen.", "What to expect after Hi ladies, so Thursday I had a laparoscopy to remove an ectopic pregnancy. After surgery my doctor informed me that he is not positive it was ectopic, that it may have been intrauterine but was not doing well. He suctioned out my uterus and my left ovary had a large cyst he drained. He flushed the tubes and there were no blockages. Anywho, 2 days following I had some dark red spotting only when wiping. Today has started to be bright red reminding me more of a period. I cannot remember what they told me as far as what to expect. They did say as long as there is no large clots or blood filling a pad in less than an hour but I am wanting to know some of your experiences and how long bleeding and cramping lasted after. Thanks so much Hey there. I am so sorry you have to be going through this. I had the same surgery on this last Friday. They had to take my tube out as well. For all of Friday and Saturday I really just had dark spotting, but today there is a lot more blood and it is all bright red. It is still happening right now so I cannot speak to the length of will last, but I understand what you are going through. Stay strong \u2764\ufe0f Just wanting to see if it is normal per say. I can call the doctor but they are closed so sometimes it is easier to ask here. I am sorry you went through this as well and I am especially sorry you lost a tube. That was my biggest fear. Google says bleeding can last up to 2 weeks. Thanks for your response and hope you heal quickly! Absolutely! Thank you I hope you heal quickly also! Having this place to come to with people who have suffered similar traumas has been so amazing for answering questions and giving me hope. I hope it can do the same for you. Yes! I completely agree. I feel like it is humbling as well bc someone has gone through worse. It is awful these things happen at all. I just want to become a mom and have a healthy baby but I am thankful I can relate these feeling with others wishing and wanting the same \u2764\ufe0f God is good and I am trusting our time will come I could not agree with you more \u2764\ufe0f we had tried unsuccessfully for two years and this was our first success that obviously ended in trauma, but I have to believe the time will come soon that the joy and excitement can stay long term. I wish all pregnancies could be easy and smooth Ugh \ud83d\ude29I can relate. We have tried for 17 months for this to be our outcome. I have never experienced such a high to a low so fast. Two surgeries in a year for me and one for my husband. We are determined but it is not easy! Our time is coming mama! Feel free to message me at any point! I am so sorry that our stories are so similar. It is torture to finally get a positive test, experience the joy you have waited so long for, and then the drop off to so much emotion. So many surgeries must be so hard for you let alone the mental trauma that comes with any surgery. I hope you get your next positive test soon \u2764\ufe0f and absolutely same to you! You will be in my thoughts and prayers Likewise darling! It will be worth the wait! Prayers for you as well \u2764\ufe0f", "Fluctuating HCG levels common with ectopic?? Hello, I am asking for some advice here if anyone could please help me through this. I had a confirmed pregnancy with a very low level positive 2 weeks ago with a HCG level at 12. My levels were tested again and results came back at 76. A few days later, the bleeding started and my levels went down to 36 and then 30. HOWEVER, this morning I had additional bloodwork done, my HCG test came back at 170. How would it fluctuate like that? I have had consistent bleeding over the last 4-5 days and just assumed it was a miscarriage. \n\nI am not in any pain (yet) but I will say I did have some rectal pressure and pains on the back of my neck a few days ago. Has this happened to anyone here with a confirmed ectopic? I have to wait until Wednesday to confirm what is going on and I am absolutely panicking. \n\nThanks for your help. Fluctuating/plateauing hcg is a common sign of ectopic unfortunately. Try to stay calm (way easier said than done) and if you have any more symptoms that are worrisome or pointing towards ectopic have a low threshold to go to ER.\nWhat did your doc think was going on? What is happening Wednesday , will they do an US? \nI am sorry you are in limbo. It is the worst place to be in. \ud83d\udc9c \nI did have rectal pain/pressure with my ectopics but it could be related to something else as well. On Wednesday I go back to the doctor for more bloodwork and an ultrasound to figure out what is going on. I am so scared that this could rupture or cause other medical issues between now and then. I would say at this point I am having more concentrated cramping on my left side than my right. It is a very scary situation to be in. Just be cautious and listen to your body. Even if something feels slightly off it is worth going to the ER to get checked just incase. That is what they are there for. \ud83d\udc95 try to rest and not do any lifting or intense activity until you get more info Wednesday just incase. Thanks, I appreciate the advice. This is just so incredibly hard. Not knowing what is going on and if it is serious. I am so tired of the trauma. I know. It is one of the most exhausting things emotionally. I had my first ectopic in 2018 and 3 more in the last 12 months and the waiting to find out what is going on is always a really difficult part. You will get through this and hopefully have definitive answers this week. \ud83d\udc9c I know how crippling the anxiety and fear can be. I am so sorry youve had to deal with this so many times. I just do not understand why things are so unfair. Why some women have to deal with trauma after trauma and others just float through life without any complications. It sucks. Thank you, I just lost my last tube in January and waiting on starting ivf. It certainly does suck having to go through one thing after the other. It is hard to stay strong and positive sometimes. If you ever need to talk I am here! Likewise, thank you. I am also struggling in the fertility department. Been trying for 2 years. I had 1 miscarriage last year at 6 weeks and now this. Still not sure what is going on, but I dont see how it could be good news honestly. Good luck on your journey with ivf. I truly hope you get a happy ending. I am sorry for all the struggles you have had to go through. Hopefully whatever is going on now can bring you closer to figure out the next steps in your fertility experience/journey.  Keep me posted on how everything goes. Will do. Thank you. Good luck to you on your journey as well. I am hoping for the best. The unknown is just so incredibly scary Thank you. \ud83d\udc95 How did you make out? Did you get any answers? Thanks for checking in. I got more bloodwork and an ultrasound. My final hcg level was 189. They did not find anything other than a very small amount of tissue right next to my ovary. So they are not positive that is where the hcg was coming from, but that is their best guess. So at this point they are calling it ectopic, but they were not 100% sure where the hcg hormone was being produced from. I have to get a bunch of injections in my butt and now have to wait 3 months until we can try again. I am sad about that, but it is probably for the best. No problem. \nMethotrexate treatment sucks :( and the waiting 3 months after hitting 0 also sucks. It all sucks!! I am sorry you have to go through it. I did the methotrexate injection once in 2018 and again in 2020 so if you have any questions let me know. \ud83d\udc95 Thank you, I really appreciate your help. So it is not 3 months after the injection? It is 3 months after you hit 0 until you can try again? I have bloodwork on Monday so I am curious how far my level will have dropped by then. It is 3 months once your levels reach 0. Yours should not take too long since your hcg is quite low \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb. Avoid foods with high folate and do not take prenatals. No sex and no heavy lifting either (idk if they told you any of this.) once your levels reach 0 start taking your folic acid / prenatal again for 12 weeks and then you can ttc again. Methotrexate depletes folate so taking folate can counteract what the medication is supposed to do. They say to wait those 12 weeks after levels hit 0 mainly to give you time to build your folate back up to avoid neural tube defects if you do become pregnant. I have also heard green tea can help drop levels quicker so drink lots of that if you like it!\nAlso note that on day 4 bloodwork after mtx your levels could go up, the important thing is that they drop 15% between day 4 and day 7 blood draw. Oh wow good to know. They did not tell me any of this. The highest my levels got was 189 so the nurse told me that she thinks it should be back to 0 within 2 weeks. But we will see. They told me no drinking, no prenatal, and I am to also stop taking my metformin (I have pcos). So that is kind sucky because I am worried my cycle is going to be sooo messed up because the metformin is the only thing that helped me to get periods back again \ud83d\ude15 The nurse is hopefully right! With my last treatment with mtx my levels got up to 11000 after my first shot on day 4 then on day 7 they went down to 5000. It only took 5-6 weeks for that to drop so I would imagine it will not take long for you. Hopefully you can get started right back on your metformin right when you get to 0 and get back to normal!", "Ectopic with no symptoms? I thought I had a miscarriage but my blood work is showing HCG levels that nearly doubled in two days. I would be 6w2d. Has anyone here had an ectopic pregnancy that did not have any symptoms? I have not had pain or excessive bleeding, just bleeding and cramping for one night that seemed consistent with a miscarriage. Seeing doctor first thing Monday morning to determine location of pregnancy. Thank you\u2026 feeling scared. You do not have symptoms unless it ruptures. The symptoms otherwise are just like those of a normal pregnancy. If you get methotrexate you bleed for a while. I had pains on my right side that felt like ovulating cramps which since I would never been pregnant before, I thought it was a normal pregnancy ache. I was having them for at least a couple of weeks before my tube ruptured. Thanks so much for responding and for this info. I am seeing the doc tomorrow and hopefully the US scan will determine location of pregnancy. Thanks for responding and sharing your story. I am so sorry you went through that it sounds really painful and scary. I am now hyper aware of any pain or sensation just in case it is ectopic and I need to go to ER. I am sorry but that is just absolutely not true.\nAll 4 of my ectopics I had symptoms around 5-6 weeks and never ruptured What are your hcg levels at and will you be getting a scan? \ud83d\udc97 fingers crossed. I am just repeating what my doctor told me. ( lists the early warning signs of an ectopic as such \n\n\u2018You may not notice any symptoms at first. However, some women who have an ectopic pregnancy have the usual early signs or symptoms of pregnancy \u2014 a missed period, breast tenderness and nausea.\n\nIf you take a pregnancy test, the result will be positive. Still, an ectopic pregnancy cannot continue as normal.\n\nAs the fertilized egg grows in the improper place, signs and symptoms become more noticeable.\n\nEarly warning of ectopic pregnancy\n\nOften, the first warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy are light vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain.\n\nIf blood leaks from the fallopian tube, you may feel shoulder pain or an urge to have a bowel movement. Your specific symptoms depend on where the blood collects and which nerves are irritated.\u2019 \n\nSo, the early warning symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, assuming the woman does not know if she is carrying an ectopic, are the same as a miscarriage. The last paragraph describes the early symptoms of a \nruptured ectopic pregnancy - you know, when it is still early enough to get to the ER before the blood loss becomes great.\n\nThat is part of the reason they can be so deadly. People will just take a pregnancy test around weeks, assume they have normal pregnancy symptoms and make an ob appointment for 8 weeks after getting some blood work from their normal doctor - because they are extremely similar - then have it rupture and attribute that pain to something else and delay the emergency treatment they need. \n\nThis is especially true if it is an ectopic with an iud. I did not get a period with mine and I did not have cramping until I ruptured at 13ish weeks, after two methotrexate treatments. My Mirena (who was perfectly in place when this all went down) made it so I did not even think about pregnancy at all. I am glad your experience gave you warning, but that is not a universal experience . The only symptoms I had were sore boobs.\n\nUnless you know what all the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are - I did not and my best friend\u2019s mom is an ob/gym and she made sure we were really educated about women\u2019s health - I do not know if many women would be fussed about minor cramping on one side or the other. Gas pains can be like that. Hell - My ectopic pregnancy did not even have localized cramping - it was all right in the center of my pelvic area exactly like a normal gas pains or a period until my shoulders and neck started to hurt from the blood irritating my diaphragm and I could not take a full breath. I almost died because the cramps then just felt like food poisoning. Previously, my symptoms were just exactly the same as typical of an early pregnancy Just got my scan this morning and sure enough, doc found it in my left Fallopian tube. My levels on Friday were 1226 so she is confident with the size and level of hormone it can be treated with the medication. I just got my first shot this morning and will monitor the results. Thank you for responding and for your support \u2764\ufe0f I am so sorry. \ud83d\udc97 I definitely have done all the same research. I am also a nurse in womens health. \n\nIt is just simply not true that people do not get symptoms. If you read through many experiences on the ectopic subs etc such as this one - there are SO many people who have symptoms without rupture and continue to have those symptoms after treatment. \n\nMy symptoms, for all 4, were severe. I had extreme stomach pain (to the point I lost consciousness), coffee ground bleeding, rectal pain. There was a huge difference between normal cramping and an ectopic and I feel many will agree. \n\nI do not disagree that not EVERYONE has pain or symptoms of an ectopic but your comment said that you absolutely will not have symptoms unless you rupture and it is just simply not the correct information, that is all. Some people have symptoms early and some do not which exactly as you said - it is very dangerous. \n\nOf course the best way to diagnose an ectopic is repeat betas and early monitoring but there are signs.", "Too Soon To Tell? Hi everyone. I believe I am pregnant even though it is too soon for a positive test. However, I am already experiencing horrible lower back pain, abdominal cramping comes and goes, more prominent of my left hip pain, arm aches, left leg aches, some bloating and peeing more often. I have already been checked for cysts, bloodwork and infections.\n\nI have had an ectopic pregnancy before and some of these symptoms feel very familiar.\n\nHas anyone gone through this so soon? Has anyone gone through this and their pregnancy come out fine?\n\nWe had intercourse April 7th. I will\nBe returning to get checked again in a week, but the lower left back pain is consistent.\n\nWhat could be going on? Honestly if you have not gotten a positive test yet, it is likely too early to tell. All 4 of mine have been caught very early but no signs have started until hcg is in my system as that is just not possible. Have you taken a test? Do you know when you ovulated?\n\nSymptoms of ectopics can be so similar to PMS so could it also be that?\n\nOf course - if you think this could be ectopic and similar to what you have had in the past, just be sure to get beta hcg tested every 48 hours to make sure it doubles in the right time frame and ask for an early ultrasound at 5.5 weeks. But if you have not gotten a positive test that means there is no hcg which means no pregnancy yet which means it could not be ectopic yet. Try not to stress until you actually get confirmation of pregnancy, if you can \ud83d\udc9c if your bloodwork came back not pregnant then it is pretty much impossible to know it is ectopic or having signs of one. My app says April 4 was ovulation day. We did the deed on 7 first time he is let loose in me since my ectopic in August 2020. \nI am hoping this is all pms and not a journey to another EP. Do you track with ovulation strips? Or just go by the app? And when did you get bloodwork? Did they check your pregnancy hormone? Blood tests can show pregnancy 6-8 days after you ovulate unlike urine pregnancy tests. And another thing just for piece of mind - if you did ovulate on the 4th you are due your period today basically. You get your period two weeks after ovulation (approx, generally you start your period 12-16 days after you ovulate) so you should have a positive test, love. Keep an eye to it but I think you may be starting your period. Got blood work in the 12th. They did check the HCG but she said come back when it is two weeks.\n\nYes I just use the app.\n\nI do not have strips but learning about them now and buying some, thank you. Fingers crossed it is pms. Yes my app says tomorrow well today now. So I am waiting the week out to see if I get it. Also I am taking a pregnancy text on the 21 that would be two weeks since sex. Yeah without knowing exactly when you ovulated it is hard to say! \n\nIf you do end up being pregnant I just be sure to request the repeat betas because of your history. Fingers crossed for you \ud83d\udc9c try to stay calm and if you are pregnant you will need to wait to be able to locate it anyways so there is not much you can do besides wait it out unfortunately but the repeat betas is a start to check viability, for sure. \n\nWith all of my ectopics they were found early but usually around the 5-6 week mark. Your hcg needs to be high enough to locate on a scan so it is a waiting game. Just watch for any signs of ectopic and head to the ER. A lot of early pregnancy symptoms are similar to pms which are also similar to ectopic signs so try not to read into it until you can confirm anything! Maybe my pms symptoms are just really intense now. It is never been this way before but all I can do is wait. Thank you! I will do my best to comeback and update. Thank you! I am buying a first response today. \n\nI hope it is just my body acting up and nothing serious.\n\nI appreciate your help, really\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb It could be. If you are in A LOT of pain do not hesitate to go to emergency \ud83d\udc9c How did you make out did you test after? \ud83d\udc95 keep me updated how everything turns out. It can be such a scary time but my fingers are crossed everything is okay. No test yet. Buying it later today. \n\nI just had brown spotting when I wiped and waiting to see if this turns to my period. \n\nI will definitely keep you updated. How ya doing girl? Just did and negative. Still going to the doctors for a check up because of painful cramping and other things. \nFeels worse than my usual period symptoms.\nReally appreciate it.\nThank you for all your help \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Definitely get checked out \ud83d\udc95 I hope everything works out love. Same. Still having severe cramps, so I have an appointment soon. Thanks again! Did you get to the doc after? Hi, so you got blood work 5 days after intercourse. That is a bit too soon to check. Maybe get a b-hcg blood test done about 2 weeks after unprotected sex. You will most likely know if you are pregnant or not. I hope you get your periods soon dear. Got my period. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nGoing in for a checkup next week to see why so much pain. Not until later this week coming up. Not sure what they are going to do but hopefully I will get answers for the pain. Did you get blood work again after two weeks? Yes I did. Not pregnant.\n\nStill do not u understand why I was having so much pain and symptoms that felt like I was going through another ectopic.\nIf it was just PMS... it was all entirely new for me. \n\nGetting my period in a week so I am watching my symptoms and writing them down. Hey, so how did it go ? Everything okay ? Hey there. Doing okay. They are sending me to a pelvic floor therapist... so hopefully it helps.", "2nd shot of methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy Hi all,\nI am so confused and reddit had helped me earlier so i have turned to you will again.\nI had a 5 day blastocyst on Jan 17th.My HcG results were abnormal and on Feb 8th they confirmed I had ectopic pregnancy.\nOn Feb 12th received 1st dose of methotrexate. My Hcg levels are:\nPre Metho:1600;\nDay 4 after metho (feb 15th):2784;\nDay 7 after metho (feb 18th):3081;\n\nI have received second dosage of metho on yesterday (feb 18).\nCan someone else share their experience?\nI am afraid that my tube may rupture. Hi! You are welcome to look through my history to see what I went through, but here is a recap:\n\nHCG started low and slow...400ish, 600ish, 800ish...after the metho shot they did not test me again til day 7 and it was about 1800 if I am remembering right. Doctor sent me to ER because I was also having worse pain. Ultrasound showed nothing this whole time until the 1800 number came back, and then the US  at the ER showed some fluid/blood around my tube, however my HCG had dropped to 1400. My doctor gave it a few days and we tested again, HCG had only gone down like 5 points and a repeat ultrasound at her office showed a 2cm \"mass\" that she said was either the pregnancy or a clot from my tube trying to get rid of it. She felt uncomfortable not knowing which it was because we did not want to risk me rupturing and highly recommended we do the surgery. My other doctor (he was the one that actually prescribed the metho shot) felt fine doing a second metho shot and just monitoring me closely but by that point my fianc\u00e9 and I were so tired and anxious from the process that we wanted it to be over with and went with the surgery. She removed my right tube and once pathology came back the mass was mostly just blood and some fetal tissue, so the metho had been working but extremely slowly. Surgery was really not bad and we were SO relieved to be done, my HCG immediately dropped to 33. However, she had to do one large cut instead of laparoscopic because I am so skinny and that has made recovery hell. But I think if the surgery did not have complications due to my size it would have been no big deal. I hope that helps!  Oh..I am sorry you had to go through all this...\nI am afraid of surgery and just praying my HCG levels just go down rapidly by itself. Thank you \ud83d\udc95\nI will be sending you no surgery vibes! An ectopic pregnancy is one of the scariest, weirdest things to go through and I believe we will come out stronger because of it. I would bet that this second shot will do the trick (a lot of women require a second shot and it almost always works) and if for some reason you end up needing surgery you will be totally fine and it will all be ok :) feel free to message me anytime! ", "Should I go to ER Hi all, thanks in advance for your advice! This is all TMI- I have had a hormonal IUD for about 5 years. I have not had a period that entire time. Friday I noticed really strange discharge I have never seen before, Saturday I had really heavy bleeding, Sunday was heavy bleeding with large chunks of flesh (took photos to show doc because I knew it would seem like I was exaggerating). Also shoulder pain which is why google searching my symptoms brought me here lol Honestly I have had heavy periods and even ovarian cysts resulting in emergency surgery but never seen anything like this- pain was about a 7. I have had ovarian cysts rupture and that was an off the charts pain that made me vomit and pass out- so this was really bad but manageable. By 9pm Sunday the pain went down to a 2 or 3 and by the morning the bleeding pretty much stopped. \n\nI have been on the phone all day trying to schedule an appointment with my doctor, thinking (naively) I could get in today. The soonest I can be seen is a few weeks. Pain is still at a 3 mostly at my right ovary. Should I bother with emergency room at this point? I have insurance but will still likely end up paying some out of pocket. \n\nI have read that you can randomly have a period with an IUD but this was unlike any period I have ever had. If it was an ectopic pregnancy it seems like it passed on it own. Is it worth going in? Lastly, I called several urgent cares and none of them have ultrasound capabilities so ER is my only option. \n\nAll of this is just to ask- should I bother going to an ER even though the worst has likely passed? Oh my god YES!!! Get there now!!! Never take anything like this lightly Asap. Hope you are ok. 1.\tAre you pregnant? \n2.\twhen in doubt go to the ER I am confused- are you pregnant? Step one is to actually take a test if you have not all ready done so. If you are not pregnant and your symptoms are settling down then I would just follow up with my doctor. I really hope you went to the ER!! Hope everything is ok! Hey OP, how are you doing?", "Questions about methotrexate I just got my methotrexate shot yesterday at 5 weeks 2 days. I still feel the pain in my right ovary area from time to time really bad, but overall, little period cramping and not a lot of blood. How long does the shot take to really start the bleeding? I never thought I would be praying for a fast miscarriage because I wanted this baby so badly, but I also just want this ectopic nightmare to be over. I honestly bled for like 2 months from the time I had a positive pregnancy test to like 2 weeks after the methotrexate shot then promptly got Nexplanon and bled for another 10 days soooo I would say probably expect some random bleeding until your body figures out what just happened! It took me about 5 days after to start bleeding with clots. It lasted about week and a half. I have had this achy side since the shot on right side of the pelvis and till this day I have it but it is subsiding. My levels went down with just one injection. Thanks for sharing your experience\u2014 I have been bleeding but it is not like A LOT, so I keep worrying that I am never actually going to pass what I need to. Knowing it can take a few days to pass clots helps. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f Yeah my body is super confused right now. I have also bled lightly for the past 4 weeks since implantation, so it is like\u2026 just a lot of light bleeding for a really long time and I do not know what is the methotrexate and what is the ectopic! Also to clarify, it was pretty light flow and I only had 1 clot probably like a month after the injection It took me 6 days to start bleeding, and I did not have any cramping beforehand. I am bleeding almost as much as a typical period for me, though its probably lighter because of how much I bled during pregnancy. I got my shot last Sunday, started bleeding today (sat. Morning), but I am getting pains in my right ovary more and more frequently, I am starting to wonder if I will need another dose of methotrexate Hi again! So it is been about 5 days and the bleeding is in full swing but this achiness in my right side keeps freaking me out that I am going to rupture. Did your doctor seem concerned about it? I see my doctor at 1:30 but I have been worried about it all night. It is not like severe pain but just this constant ache around my right ovary. I felt the same too thinking it ruptured or it was going to. But it had stopped now That is it is been 2 weeks. I have no gas pain or bloating. The only thing I am kind of worried is my digestive system is out of wack! I am still constipated, I am able to go but barely anything. But it is not severe that I am hurting it is just kind of like everything seems back to normal except my digestive system\u2026. I would ask your doctor for a ultrasound to make sure. My dr just told me to make sure I am not bleeding more than 2 pads or so and if I feel dizzy or faint to go to the ER. But I had the same thing, especially when I had gas pains and bloating I would feel it on that side too frequently. But it is gone now. Ughh that is so uncomfortable. Maybe try some stool softeners or Milk of Magnesia? I hope your digestive system comes back to normal soon! Ugh yes! Imma try milk of magnesia. Because the stool softener are not cutting it\ud83d\ude29", "Feeling heartbroken  Your babies are angels and you are an angel mama &lt;3 I pray God blesses you with your rainbow baby!! \ud83c\udf08 I am waiting to be blessed with ours.

", "Is this an ectopic pregnancy? I just found out i was pregnant today. My \u201cperiod\u201d was late around 3 days maybe and all of a sudden i had very light spotting. Then more blood came and it was dark brown. Now today my blood is red just like normal period blood is. I am bleeding like a period but i had 2 positive pregnancy tests. I am having cramping in my uterus. This pain comes and goes. I am so scared. And as for how long i have been pregnant, i do not know. I am assuming 6 weeks. Did you get a US? Hope you are fine! I am so sorry you are in this boat, my friend.\n\n&lt;EDIT: I did not read that you found out you are pregnant today! It is possible you are fine and this is normal bleeding but my encouragement to get medical care still applies. Below is my story for comparison as you proceed, in case it is helpful. Events for me unfolded over 2 weeks, since first BFP&gt;\n\nThis is not medical advice but I would say that this sounds identical to my situation and I was told it was high probability that I have an ectopic. I was 6 weeks yesterday. I started spotting at 4 weeks, 4 days, and then went from brown spotting to brown light bleeding to deep red light bleeding to red light bleeding over the past 1.5 weeks. I had mild cramps throughout and occasional pinches on either side of my abdo. Hcg was very low but has kept rising. Got a US and they couldnt find a sac in the uterus (tho it is early) but found an unknown \u201ccomplex system\u201d near my right ovary that is not the ovary itself or the corpus luteum which is a normal part of pregnancy. So long story short, even while nothing can be definitive at this stage, nearly all signs point to it being ectopic vs. miscarriage.\n\nPlease insist on getting an US and 3 beta tests to they can make the best educated guess about what is going on. Hopefully it is nothing and your sac is where it should be! Follow your gut if something feels off about the pregnancy. If I had not called these doctors proactively and annoyingly, and gotten multiple opinions, I would potentially be in grave danger right now.\n\nPS- I got a MX shot yesterday because the docs were extremely concerned that waiting too much longer would necessitate surgery. I need more distance before I can say this was the right call, but given my abnormal symptoms and the risk of rupture, I feel it was the right thing for us. Hi,\n\nI had the same thing on my report:  corpus luteum on the left ovary. I am certain the sex is a girl since they have this theory if left ovary = girl, so I am a bit upset and hoping that I ovulated later as my friend is keep telling me.\n\nDoes that mean I am going to have an ecoptic pregnancy as well? Getting my blood done on Monday so I am a bit nervous. I had the MX shot back in 2015 and it was to prevent any rupture like you. back then, my levels would go form 75 to 77 (in 2 days) so they decided it was best to do the MX shot. Hi, I am in the same boat as you -- I found out I was pregnant and then I started to bleed basically. I was at 5-6 weeks. I bled for 4 days and that was it. I used about 15 pads as it was similar to my period. I went back to get my levels checked and they went up very slowly. I should be in the 7k range but I am riding under 300s. I will have to get blood drawn on Monday so I am hoping to have results back my Tuesday because I am in this wait mode and it is literally killing me.   \nI would get your hcg levels checked and see where the results take you.\n\nout of curiosity: was your pregnancy lines faint? Mine were fainted and I just had a feeling it was not going to be a good outcome since the darker the line the more hcg in your levels. Here is the update. I went to the Er 2 days ago. I had a chemical pregnancy meaning i was pregnant but miscarried very early on. It is very sad but yeah no ectopic pregnancy here. I was pregnant and miscarried Thanks for sharing. I am sorry for your loss. I am not sure what I am having now, but that is my first thought was chemical pregnancy for me. It could be a chemical pregnancy if you are  bleeding as if u are on ur period. Ectopic pregnancies are rare. The annoying this is thay they have the same symptoms as a miscarriage which is why i went to the Er to check. If you are still bleeding while u are pregnant i would say go to the Er. They will do tests on u to see if it is ectopic or not and if it is a miscarriage they will let u know as well Hi, I had one back in 2015 so I thought it would be the same outcome but I was bleeding for like 1.5 weeks. With this pregnancy, it was only 4 days and I feel fine and no cramping but I have this high pain threshold. Like, I had several root canals and the dentist was surprise I felt nothing. like no pain. I went to the ER on 11.10 and they diagnosed me with a threatened miscarriage, so here I am waiting.... and it is just killing me. I will get blood drawn to see what my numbers are. I am just annoyed that my ob-gyn did nothing last week (just took a blood test). by then I was 6 weeks -- so they could have at least listened to see if there was a heartbeat. Corpus luteum cyst is completely normal...it produces progesterone for your pregnancy until the placenta takes over. It is only if another structure is also hanging around, then there is an issue I am so sorry for your loss. I had plans to tell my family about my pregnancy at Xmas but......yeah. This year is rough. Hugs. I am so sorry my love. It is really hard. Feeling guilty and also feeling as tho we lost someone who could have been our light. It is hard. We will get through this. Sending u a big hug \u2764\ufe0f", "Video sessions? I recently had an ectopic pregnancy in January and I am new to Reddit from a friends suggestion. I was wondering if there is any type of zoom calls or something for groups of women effected by ectopic pregnancies? I do not know of any but I would be very interested in something like this!  I am so sorry for your loss and what you went through. I also came to Reddit to find support after my ectopic and have found it to be incredibly helpful. There is a great support group on Facebook but that is the only resource I have been able to find besides Reddit", "Possible ectopic pregnancy? I am 25 days late. I have had no real pregnancy symptoms. I have done some tests and they were negative. I assumed skipped period but I have never done that before so I thought it was weird. \n\nWent to doc she told me it *may* be am ectopic pregnancy but most likely just a missed period. She sent me off to do a blood test to double check, she explained ectopic pregnancies do not always show up in urine tests.\nShe said to call back the next day as hopefully would have results.\nI called back and the receptionist has passed on a message that I need to book in appointment to discuss the results with her next week. \n\nSo now I have to wait 5 days!! If the results were negative surely they would just tell me? I have been given negative results over the phone before. \nOr is there something else they can pick up in one of these tests? \nThis is going to drive me nuts.\n\nI am just wondering if anyone else has had ectopic pregnancy with no pregnancy symptoms and negative tests.  \nDoes anyone know if doc would want me to come in if it was a simple negative result? If the doctor thought it were Ectopic they most likely would have done a vaginal ultrasound as well as the blood tests and they would have probably gotten you in for either the shot or surgery if the results were positive. She actually gave me a referral for ultrasound and blood test at same time but said to wait and see the result of blood test before having the ultrasound. That is odd\u2026 they did my ultrasound while waiting on the blood test to come back. They were able to see it was Ectopic before the blood test results were in. Yeh I am a bit confused. She was quite reassuring yesterday saying its probably just a missed period. She said do the blood test now and wait and see over the next few days if your next period comes (I was technically due yesterday). I just would have thought if it was negative they would just tell me that on phone. So you are period was due yesterday\u2026? Is this the first missed period or is this what would have been the second cycle missed? I would take an at home tests again while waiting to hear back about your blood results. If it is still negative then I do not think you have an ectopic but they might have noticed something else like low vitamin levels. Its the 2nd cycle missed/due \nYeh I will do another test. But she did a test in the office yesterday and it was negative. But she also said ectopic does not always show in urine tests . Gahhh.\n\nI thought perhaps it could have been something else picked up on blood test, but I distinctly remember on the form she only wrote \"missed period, pregnancy\" so they were not testing for anything else. Unless they do just pick other stuff up somehow? Typically they run a metabolic blood test as well as check HCG levels.. my ectopic showed up positive two weeks before my missed period. Maybe I am just low in iron or something \n\nArgh just do not know why they cannot tell me it is negative on the phone grrr \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude06 Did you go to your primary doctor, OBGYN, or ER? I went to the same medical practice I always go to but I usually see a couple different doctors there. If you are adamant about a pregnancy and you truly think it is ectopic you could always visit an Urgent Care or Emergency Room.. especially if you have pain in your lower back or abdomen. Na I do not really have pain and I am not adamant about it. Its more just me not understanding why she needs to see me to give a negative result :) Based off my own experience it is probably something to do with your vitamin levels Did you get your results for the blood test ? Did you get your result ? I would say if you had a positive test that was concerning the doctor would have reached you right away. Ectopics are medical emergencies so your doctor would not screw around with that (I would HOPE.)\n\nAs for the symptoms. I never had a whole lot of pregnancy symptoms besides kind of sore boobs. I did always get a positive test with all 4 of mine though. I would imagine if a blood test indicated that you were pregnant and your doctor was concerned about it being ectopic, she would have either had you go to the ED or come to see her right away as it can be life threatening. I did not have many symptoms with mine aside from sore breasts, but I got a very strong positive pregnancy test and my HCG was high. Update\nIt was not ectopic pregnancy. Just a missed period. \nThe reason for the appt was because the doctor had not received the results yet and asked reception to ring me and book me in pre-emptively for when they do come in. It was a bit of a miscommunication. \nShe ended up just ringing me to tell me they were negative as soon as they came in Friday.", "Had an ectopic pregnancy last year and I am pregnant again. Ultrasound next week. I had an ectopic pregnancy in October of last year. I did not know I was pregnant and only found out when I got my \u201cperiod\u201d again 2 weeks after I had just finished my cycle. I knew I felt weird but had no idea what it was. The cramps were horrible and I was in the hospital for a few days. Thankfully I did not end up needing surgery so they gave me the shot. Even though I had no idea I was pregnant it was definitely surreal to me to find out I was pregnant and yet losing the pregnancy on the same day. I am sure many of us have felt this way.\n\nI am pregnant again. I skipped my period this time. I just found out on Monday after a test came out positive. Obviously I am worried about having to go through another ectopic pregnancy again, but this time feels different. I have been feeling slight cramping/tugging and pulling sensations. I am wondering and hoping if this time the egg finally got to the right place.\n\nFor those of you that have been through a few ectopic pregnancies, how early/late did you find out? Did the pain differ from each ectopic pregnancy? My ultrasound is next Wednesday and I am so nervous. I really want this pregnancy to be true and last. Oh geez, I was about 5 weeks, 5 days along when I found out.  I had what I thought was my period the entire time.  I had some pain that I thought was cramps and one day they were SO bad so I went to the emergency room.  My ectopic ruptured.  I was rushed into emergency surgery, they gave me 2L of blood.  It was a crazy day.  \n\nNow I am undergoing IVF - I just did my fort transfer.  I am feeling the cramping/tugging you mentioned, \ud83e\udd1e Omg wishing you the best!! Thanks! You too \ud83d\ude42 Any updates on this? :) I had an ectopic around the same time last year. I had to get a salpinostomy and saved my tube. I want to try again..maybe in a few months. Yes!

Were they able to tell you if you ovulated on the same side you had the ectopic? No but i also did not ask! I was just so relieved the fetus was where it needed to be and there was a heartbeat \ud83d\udc93 thank you!!\ud83d\ude0a I found I was pregnant straight away with my ectopic as we had been trying since january and had suffered an early miscarriage in april so it was september infact may of been end of august and I discovered I was pregnant again and we were super happy a tad worried after the miscarriage but happy. I think within the first week I started having spotting and I thought not again and thought I was experiencing another miscarriage so I held off for a few days but kept my eye on the bleeding hoping it would go away, it did not it infact got much worse. \n\nSo I phoned our early pregnancy unit I am in the UK and had a very unsympathetic nurse on the other end of the phone who sent me for blood tests, had them got my results yep definitely pregnant need todo another one in 2 days to check if my hcg levels are doubling so I do, phone up get my results I think my 1st was 1000 and my 2nd was 2000 so I was super happy like yes they have doubled maybe it is another reason?? Like a haematoma in my uterus?? Anything else but a miscarriage?? \n\nThe nurse on the phone asked me how far I was I said 6 weeks she said no way your not 6 weeks I said yes I am shes like no not with your levels your more like 4 weeks I was confused as I had the positive pregnancy test 2 weeks before and she was insinuating that I must of had a positive test when I was 2 weeks pregnant which is obviously when you ovulate so I am like no I am 6 weeks and im still bleeding heavily, she just said lots of women experience bleeding during pregnancy and left me for 2 weeks before I could have an ultrasound.\n\nLongest 2 weeks of my life bleeding actually subsides a bit so I am thinking okay maybe I am alright. \n\nHad the ultrasound got the devastating news, I wasnt allowed home at this point I was 8 weeks pregnant, had to stay in hospital as they rushed me for surgery, alot of people say they have terrible pain with an ectopic I had non what so ever apart from around 5 weeks which I thought was bad gas pain I suffered with for about 2 days. \n\nMy husband had to leave me to get our son from school I was put in a ward had my own room which was okay, my husband arranged childcare for our son and came back to be with me, I stayed overnight didnt get surgery that night but had it in the morning, \n\nWas extremely upsetting being wheeled away for surgery watching my husband disappear into the distance, so I had surgery they removed my left tube, they tried using key hole surgery but apparently my bowel was stuck to something else due to internal bleeding it was a bit of a mess apparently, so they did a c section like incision and I had a drain in my stomach like a little tube to drain the remaining blood I guess which was excruciating when the nurse removed it a few days later. \n\nI was in hospital for I think 4 or 5 nights, was horrible i just wanted to be home, was in a lot of pain after surgery luckily i was given pain medication but it definitely took all my energy and emotional just could not believe it had happened to me. \n\nIts definitely in the top 5 worst moments of my life. \n\nBut i now would not change it ever as when i finally did get pregnant again 18months later it was a wonderful pregnancy although a bit worrisome at times due to previous experiences but she is here and 9 months old and she is wonderful. Awww Im so happy there is a happy ending to your story. \ud83d\udc95\n\nI definitely believe things happen for a reason.

It will get better. oh my goodness i am so sorry :( hang in there please!! if you do not mind me asking, which iud did you have? trying my best \ud83d\udc95 im using kyleena thank you! \ud83d\udc95 This happened to me a little over 2 months ago, they sent me home to see if I would miscarry naturally, it ended up rupturing and nearly killing me. Breaks my heart to know that I brought a life into this world that had no chance, and I am still torn up about it. I hope everything goes well for you and it does not require surgery \ud83d\udc95 i keep seeing so many stories similar to yours where the doctors dont treat these situations w urgency and im so sorry, that sounds terrifying. i feel you on that though, i keep feeling like i failed in a way, although i know its not the case. for now, things are going okay so far, although i am nervous. \ud83d\udc9a thank you for ur kind words I just found this sub and I am shocked by the number of people who have had this experience! It is quite frankly got me concerned about the healthcare system as a whole, and especially the lack of concern for us young women in college. I wish I was told this was something that could happen when I got the IUD. I am glad things are well with you so far and I am proud of you for being so strong, thank you for your support as well \ud83d\udc95 Hey I do not mean to ask too much of you but would you mind sharing your symptoms? Were you still getting your period? I also have a Kyleena and have been feeling really off, I am looking for a reason to calm my nerves but I am worried we could be in the same boat! I hope you are doing well! i havent had a period since around january, i didnt have too many symptoms besides some dizziness, fainting, and some stronger cramps Sorry you had to go through all of that, not a fun scenario :,( hope you are doing better now &lt;3 I hope you do not mind me responding this question. First of all, I regret what happened; I went through an ectopic pregnancy a month ago. My symptoms were feeling resolutions nauseous a lot of times throughout the day.  My breasts grew and hurt a little. I also gained a little weight, and I had A LOT of cravings. I had bleeding although it was not like I regularly have my period. My stomach ached but nothing unbearable, until it was too late. I will always recommend to go to a specialist at the very first symptom that bothers or worries you.  Mine ended in surgery; it was a curettage as I suffered internal bleeding and could have caused a heart attack. We are in this together, girls. (It should be clarified that my method of protection has always been a condom but the ectopic pregnancy was due to a pill of the day after)", "I recently just lost my child due to ectopic pregnancy and it is very emotional. for me as I feel like I am going through it alone. My partner is not there , he was not there I can say.  At his house they had a funeral the same time I needed him.  He could not be in two places at ones but I still needed him. \n\nHe would call but I felt like it was not enough so on Friday , I told him his selfish and he does not care for me. \n\nMy mom and sister are on my neck and planting ideas that he really does not care.  I am hurt he was not there but I know he cares for me but I also feel like he failed me and also it would be selfish of me to have him drop his family funeral arrangements to be with me especially since his the only person supporting them.  \n\nI honestly do not know what to do but I know he owes me an apology. Your hormones may be making you overly emotional. I would give it time, then think it through. My condolences to you both and to his family. My hormones are all over the place, yes\n\n\nBut I deeply need an apology from him.  I felt like he was not there.  He cannot come back and tell me he was there. I am really sorry for your loss. I understand needing your partners support during this time but I also can understand the situation he was in being at a family funeral and all. That is an unfortunate thing that was happening at the exact same time and it sucks but the important thing is he is with you and supporting you NOW. If he is not there for you when he can be present, I would definitely be upset. No he cannot say he was there then at that moment but I hope he can say he is with you now and you are open to that. Has he done that though? Has he acted like he was there for you when he was supporting his family and grieving at a funeral? Sorry for the bad timing and I hope that you feel better soon. ", "How long after surgery can I try again? I have just lost my first baby due to an ectopic pregnancy, I am only about two weeks after having surgery to remove my right Fallopian tube because of a rupture due to the ectopic.\n\nI am still healing both physically and mentally from this situation but was curious as to when it would be okay to try again because I still have hope this can happen for me (after trying for 4 years) , I have consulted my doctor and she said 2 cycles but I have irregular periods which makes this hard to track which she did not have any advice for \ud83d\ude44 , anyone have any input for me ? \n\nThanks :) At least 6 months, that is how much I have been told after my ectopic with fallopian tube removal. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f You are welcome, I hope that you are fine. I had surgery for mine (did not have my tube removed though) and my doctor told me to wait until one period cycle so we could date the next pregnancy correctly. I got my period one month to the day of my surgery so I was given the green light really fast. I have noticed it varies from doctor to doctor so at minimum I would follow your doctor's time-line and at most go with what feels comfortable to you.", "Got methotrexate injections yesterday..  I am not a woman but my wife has had this shot. I called her doc and they prescribed her ODANSETRON it is a pill that you let dissolve in your mouth (if you swallow the pill while it will not work) and it works absolute wonders for nausea. You will feel shitty for a little while maybe a few days to a week and then you may be really tired for 1-2 months after. Hope this helps. Sending love and vibes your way &lt;3 Seconding the other comment. Your level of nausea is beyond the normal symptoms of MTX and is worth asking your doctor for help with an anti nausea medication. I felt Terrible for weeks. My hair started falling and u felt so nauseous. \ud83d\ude23 things do get better thought. \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\ude14", "TTC after ectopic and tube removal Hey all. I am mostly looking for some of your experiences. I had my ectopic and fallopian tube removal surgery on July 23rd this year. My first cycle after was 2 weeks late and I just finished the second cycle since. They were both so much more painful than my previous periods as well as anovulatory. I am testing LH in hopes that maybe I will finally ovulate again. I just so badly want to be able to get pregnant again. What were cycles like for you all following ectopic? Were you ovulating? Anyone able to get pregnant after and if so how long did it take? Thanks in advance for sharing. I am still having such an incredibly hard time emotionally with all this. It took us a year to get pregnant with our first that ended in MC and another year to get pregnant with the ectopic pregnancy. I have been ready to be a mom for so long and it is so painful to be here. So sorry you had to experience this as well. I lost my right tube in December and a blighted ovum a few months before.  I have tempted and used Opks every cycle since and observed ovulation. I was getting desperate and booked an appointment to get the referral for an HSG to check my remaining tube. Three days later, before even booking the appointment, I got a BFP and am now just over 7 weeks and heard the heartbeat Monday. I wish you the best! Thank you so much for sharing your story. It gives me hope and heaven knows I need that right now \u2764\ufe0f congratulations on your pregnancy! I had an ectopic in November 2020\u2026now 34 weeks pregnant. I think it was 3 cycles after the ectopic that I conceived. Keep your head up. \ud83d\udc97 I cannot tell you how much it means to know others are getting through this and having healthy pregnancies \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f congratulations! Thank you! It will happen to you too \ud83d\udc95 Thank you \ud83d\udc95 I am trying to remain hopeful \u2764\ufe0f I cannot completely answer your question, but I had my left tube removed on July 20th. My first and second periods came about when expected. I am also hoping to get pregnant whenever possible. I am 35 so I do not really have time to spare. I wish you luck!", "Your symptoms? I have had an IUD for almost six months. At the beginning of January, I was on antibiotics. On my last day of antibiotics I had unprotected sex. \nI have had weird random cramps since getting my IUD. Sunday while at work, I had severe pain for about 2 minutes. I have been cramping on and off since then but nothing severe. \nTonight I started having shoulder pain. It is right when my shoulder muscle ends and does not feel like muscle pain. Has anyone else only had slight cramping and shoulder pain as their symptoms? I have not cramped at all today. It is the middle of the night where I am (and currently snowed in) so I cannot go buy a pregnancy test (I did take one last week that was negative). I do not want to go to the hospital and risk getting COVID if it is not absolutely necessary. I am also scared to try to sleep. \nI also have extremely bad anxiety. So I am not sure if this my anxiety manifesting because I am paranoid. I also had spotting from 2/4-2/6. But my periods have not regulated since getting the IUD. i was literally going to write a post v similar to this. I have had my IUD for about 18 months now (got it 8 weeks after my daughter was born). \n\nLast cycle after ovulation i had RAGING emotional ups and downs (not typical for me), I had very light spotting about 8DPO and my period was one day late. But once it came, I had cramping only on my left pelvic area! and when I would check my Diva cup i had the typical very brown old blood which is usually the entirety of my period, and VERY BRIGHT streaks of red which is super atypical for me. Took HPTs a few days before, and now day 5 of what I believe to be my period (although i stopped bleeding day 3). All negative, but still having these cramps on the left! Also have been having an elevated resting heart rate (which i also had with my daughter). \n\nI keep reminding myself that IUDs are very effective, but i cant help but worry about ectopic pregnancy. I would be devastated to lose a pregnancy, and an ovary as well. \n\nA note, I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis, so any number of autoimmune symptoms may get confused here in the aches and pains. Its infuriating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoping you have the best outcomes, and that we both get answers soon! If you are worried that you got pregnant from the unprotected sex in the first few weeks of January, the pregnancy test that you took last week would have definitely been positive if you are pregnant. With my ectopic pregnancies, pregnancy tests were positive as soon as 10 days post-ovulation (4 days before an expected period in a 28-day menstrual cycle). \n\nShoulder tip pain is also generally one of the last, and most serious, symptoms of a (generally) ruptured ectopic pregnancy. It occurs when the internal bleeding in your abdomen has started to irritate your diaphragm. It would be quite unusual to have shoulder tip pain without any of the accompanying symptoms of internal bleeding. From my personal experience (I have had 3 ectopic pregnancies), I only just started to have shoulder tip pain AFTER having prolonged intense pelvic/abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. \n\nI am not a doctor, but to me, it does not sound like you are having an ectopic pregnancy. If you are worried, take another pregnancy test or go to a doctor to have a blood test done. You can also use another method of contraception, like condoms, to lessen the chance of becoming pregnant. Wishing you the best of luck, and take care. I appreciate your response and sharing your experiences! I would have already gone to the doctor, but the area I live in is experiencing a snow/ice storm so essentially everything is closed except the ER. I think I am letting my anxiety get to me, but my cycle and body has been totally unpredictable since getting my IUD. The unprotected sex that occurred in January was also a situation in itself. I will be getting another pregnancy test as soon as I can get to the store. Thank you for sharing your experiences! My periods have not been regular at all since getting my IUD. I have a hormonal one. I had a period the first month after getting it, did not have anything for 2 months, had a very light period in January, and then the brown old blood at the beginning of this month. I have been telling myself the mild, random cramps are just my body adjusting to the IUD still. The few moments severe cramps I had at work really scared me though. I am trying to remind myself that IUDs are extremely effective as well, but I have severe anxiety and am a hypochondriac. I will be getting a pregnancy test as soon as I can get to a store. I am currently snowed in. \nI hope you also get answers soon! I just want to reiterate what the commenter above said about shoulder pain. I had severe shoulder pain with mine and it developed hours after my rupture. I had very intense abdominal pain and was near death when the shoulder pain started. I hope I am not freaking you out, but rather giving you some peace of mind that you would be doubled over in pain and so light headed from blood loss you would be passing out when feeling the shoulder pain. \n\nNow that is not to say you are in the clear, just hopefully help you feel less anxious about your pain. Also, my shoulder pain was more like the most intense Charlie horse and it was seizing up my arm so I could not even move it. \n\nI hope you get good news. I am one of the rare (very rare) cases of a failed IUD resulting in ectopic pregnancy. I am going through it now, and may need to have surgery, so I am afraid I do not have much words of comfort except listen to your gut. Get a pregnancy test as soon as you can. I caught mine very early because I took a test just out of caution and almost passed out I was so shocked. It is rare, but it happens. Do not ignore your instincts. Order some of the cheap tests from Amazon so you have them on hand. \n\nLike I said, my case is extremely rare, so I do not want to be an alarmist. I never thought I would be a statistic. But testing early will (hopefully) save my tube... Hi dear, did you get a pregnancy test done again or a blood work? Did it come out negative. I took a few pregnancy tests over the next couple of weeks from this post - all negative.", "Ectopic nightmare Hey guys... so I had an ectopic pregnancy July 4th 2019... they were not able to repair my Fallopian tube, it ruptured and the doctor decided to not reattach it. (He says sometimes it reattaches) since this happened I have been have THE WORST left lower back pain... I have tried to stretch, apply heat, massage etc and it is always with me and reminding me of this awful experience... anyone have the same issue? Advice? I have gone to the gyno, he says everything looks good on pelvic exam and it is probably a strain... but idk! This happened to me too after my ectopic in January and they removed my left Fallopian tube I had lower back pain on my left side! They just sent me to a chiropractor and summed it up to a sacroiliac joint issue and I took muscle relaxers for a while along with my weekly chiropractor appointments. It went away after a while but I was never quite sure what it was because I had not had any recent falls/trauma to explain a sacroiliac joint injury. Interesting! So good to know I am not the only one! Maybe my body is still healing after the traumatic event...thanks for your response!", "What is \u201cday 4\u201d for the HCG test? Day of medication day 0? Hello, last night I had two shots of methotrexate. The discharge paperwork said that day 1 was the day I took the medication. So I should do my HCG test on 26 and 29. \n\nHowever a OBGYN just told me that the day you take the medication is day 0. She said to get the tests done 27 and 30th. Anyone who did the HCG test after taking methotrexate, what was your \u201cday 4?\u201d", "Bladder pain after methotrexate? Hello, I got the methotrexate injections on Sunday dec 26th and today I started having pain in my abdomen when I urinate. It hurts the absolute most when my bladder is full. This morning I woke up and was in so much pain from my bladder that I had to pee while my husband was in the shower because it felt absolutely horrible.\n\nI called my doctor and she said it sounds like a uti and bladder pain is not a side effect of methotrexate. I have had uti\u2019s before and I have never had this pain in my abdomen.  \n\nI want to clarify that it is not an excruciating pain but it is painful and an uncomfortable \u201cfull\u201d feeling. It even hurts when I walk.\n\nAnyone else feel this? Should I be concerned?", "Feelings of Grief and Loss About a month ago I found out I was pregnant even though I had an IUD. After testing, we realized it was an ectopic pregnancy. I received the MTX injection to take care of it and it was emotionally and physically draining. This experience has been exhausting. The man who got me pregnant was just a \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d kind of guy and, thought he was supportive throughout this whole process, it pains me to consider what his reaction would have been had the pregnancy been viable. We have since stopped seeing each other which is for the best. \n\nI cannot help but feel a sense of loss and grief over this pregnancy though. It is confusing because I am pretty sure I found out I was pregnant 1-2 weeks after conception\u2014very early. I had almost no time to develop any sort of bond with this unborn baby...everything happened so quickly...so it is strange to me that I get these bouts of pretty severe sadness. I know the pregnancy could have never been successful but it still breaks my heart when I think about it too deeply. Can anyone else relate? I was not planning to get pregnant, I am not even ready to have a baby, so why does it feel like I am mourning this loss so much? Yeah I think it is totally fair to be feeling some grief and loss in that situation. I had a pretty similar situation, I got pregnant on the mini pill and only found out a week before it ruptured. Between the positive pregnancy test and the rupture I ran the full gamut of emotions and even though I was terrified at the idea of being pregnant of having a kid right now, I still felt a sense of loss when I got the test back and realized the bleeding I would been having was likely a miscarriage or ectopic and not a super heavy post vaccine period. \n\nAnd plus the situation forced you to reevaluate your casual relationship and decide to end it so it is totally valid to feel a loss there as well. Plus the hormones and the stress and pain of the whole thing will take time to process. \n\nI remember a week or so before I found out about my pregnancy I noticed that whenever I saw babies at work or anything my brain would go \u201coh how cute do not you want one?\u201d And I would have to be like what no not yet. To the point where a few days before finding out, I asked my partner if he wanted kids in the future cause I guess my hormones knew before I did, and then when I got the test back I was like oh damn that is why these thoughts are here. So if your brain can do shit like that due to hormones, it is probably also adding to your feelings of loss. You are not alone, it will just take some time to process You feel loss and grief because you had the life of a baby growing inside you. You started making plans. I am sorry you are going through this. I also forgot to say that rainbow babies are not ectopic. Rainbow babies are babies born after a loss like a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy because they are the miracle born after a tragic loss. Like a rainbow after a storm. And ectopic pregnancies are real pregnancies too. They are just not in the uterus to survive. It is incredibly rare for an ectopic pregnancy to come to full term and both the mother and baby live. I had a doctor who witnessed one where the pregnancy was in the abdomen and both the baby and mom lived and it was written down in the medical books. All pregnancies are real no matter what. Oh thank you for clearing that up! I definitely misunderstood that. Wow that is crazy how your brain started making you have baby fever in a way! But you are totally right\u2014this situation has been pretty eye opening and definitely shook up my reality\u2026so feeling sad is normal. I hope you are doing okay\u2026sending you love \ud83e\udd0d Thank you so much for your response \ud83e\udd0d I know you posted this awhile ago, but I hope you are doing well. I just went through the same thing, but I found out just an hour before I had to have my tube/pregnancy removed, I thought my appendix burst and when I got to the er they did a test and figured out what was happening. It all happened so fast and I feel the same, if I did not want this why cannot I stop crying? My heart aches and I only knew about the little bundle of cells for a very painful hour before they were gone Sending you so much love \ud83e\udd0d", "Seeking advice for my fianc\u00e9 and I I am the partner (M) looking for information on what just happened and affirmation that we are not alone. She does not use reddit but I find it helpful and will pass information along as appropriate. We had been trying for a year and were both extremely excited when it finally happened. \n\nYesterday was her 8 week check in and the docs told her it was ectopic. They ended up doing the most invasive version of removal and had to take one fallopian tube with it. She was okay after surgery, physically stable, emotions not quite setting in yet. I sat with her till about midnight, due to covid I could not sleep there. At about 3am she texted me and said she had several seizures and they found a hematoma. I talked with the nurse and they said the hematoma will be drained today. Really hoping for no more complications with that. She will probably have to stay in the hospital another night.\n\nFrom what I have read on other posts its going to be a long road. They told her that we cannot try again for another year which is going to be one of the hardest thing on us. And on top of that, if it does happen it will need to be delivered via c-section. We will together fight through anything we have to. \n\nI hope I dont sound like I am trying to take the attention, she is ultimately the one most affected and will be going through many more emotions than I will know or understand. I just want to be there for her, be her man, her rock, her shoulder, as I always strive to be. I love her more than anything in the whole world and want to take care of her in the most supportive way possible without being overbearing. She will not get over this quickly, I will not get over this quickly. \n\nAround the same time as conception (8 weeks ago), we lost our 2 dogs within 1 week of eachother, both due to unexpected and rare conditions. It broke us both down severely. After learning of her pregnancy shortly after, I thought it was a sign, with death brings life or something like that, but in this case we were dealt heartache again. \n\nI understand it is early to know how this will affect us, but writing this post has helped me slow my thoughts down and I want to thank you all in advance for letting me use this platform to share what we are going through. \n\nTo all of you who have gone through this before or are going through this currently, I am sorry for your loss and now feel your pain. Take care everyone \u2764 You are not alone. I know it can feel that way. My husband and I are just going through our loss right now, after two days of tests in the hospital to confirm ectopic. We are devastated because it had been such a joyful few weeks of pregnancy and we would made so many plans, already excited for an April baby. We imagined telling everyone the good news by the end of summer and bought Big Sister clothes for our toddler. This came out of nowhere, as it always does, and it will be a long road of grief. But I have learned from reading posts in this group that so many people go through it and we are not alone. I still do not understand why or how my ectopic happened or what it means for our future conception, and those questions are really hard ones. I got in touch with a mental health counselor while in the hospital, and from my past experience, counseling really helps with these awful situations. As for how to help your partner, I think just being there for each other and open to talking and crying about it is the best thing; finding a good Netflix show to binge together and ordering takeout is also helpful. Wishing you and your fianc\u00e9 some comfort in this time, and a healthy,boring pregnancy in the future if you choose to try again \u2764\ufe0f Thank you for the kind words. We are talking about getting counseling for sure. I think that would be good for the both of us, probably find a fertility specialists to talk about future conception too. We had a talk with the obgyn about IVF versus adoption as those will likely be our only options. Cost is a hard thing to make decisions about but we will cross that bridge in the future. For now she is doing well in the ICU and might even get released tomorrow. Thank you again and I wish you and your husband the best.", "Ectopic heartbreak Hey all. This is my first Reddit post ever, but I am looking for support from others that may have gone through what my husband and I just experienced. Two days ago I started having abnormal bleeding at 5 weeks 4 days pregnant. Yesterday I was rushed into emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy that resulted in a ruptured fallopian tube on the right. They could not save the tube. We are devastated and I could use any advice on how to get through all this grief. This feels so overwhelming and as if we will never get through this. I am so sorry. It is the worst experience. I know it feels overwhelming now. You have to process it however feels best for you. But you will be ok, remember you survived. Mine was in December and it was brutal. I eventually was able to talk about it. Some people were helpful, others I regret telling. \n\nIt sucks. It is going to suck. But then each day sucks a bit less. Good news is we still have one tube right? One fallopian tube can even grab an egg from the other ovary. Now when we get another bfp (fingers crossed) we do not have to wait til 8 weeks for a scan. At least that is what my doc says earlier monitoring. I am so sorry. Any ectopic pregnancy is traumatizing, but emergency surgery and losing a tube is another level of trauma. Mine was in March of this year. Allow yourself to grieve for as long as you need to. If you feel talking to others will help sort out your feelings, find a trusted friend. Be prepared for others to not understand and say or do the wrong thing. Or if you want to keep it between you and your husband- either is fine. During this time, do whatever you need to do to survive this grief. \n\nIt is been four months since my loss, and I am doing a lot better now. I still have bad days where the grief hits and I realize I should be so many weeks now, and I cry. We have suffered a loss most people will never experience, and it definitely takes a while to feel okay again. Thinking of you \ud83d\udc9c Thank you so much for the response. I do still have one tube thank goodness. I am so so sorry you have been through this as well. Thank you for the kind words and I am so sorry you have lived through this trauma also. It does get easier. My husband and I went through an ectopic pregnancy and tube removal three years ago this October. We eventually got pregnant, and my daughter's one-year-old birthday was yesterday. While the experience of an ectopic pregnancy is not good, it makes me appreciate every day with her and not take one hour for granted. \n\nBe aware of your feelings and experience them. Talk to someone: your husband, your doctor, friends, family, someone who went through it, anyone. Track how you feel every day (I used the Daylio app for a year to talk to my doctor as a record). Watch out for the baby due date, I was not prepared for it and was going through a hard time but I did not know why until that registered. Then I grieved again. And that is ok. And we are here for you. I am so sorry you are going through this. I just had the same thing happen to me on July 7th. It was terrifying at first but now being able to process everything has been a lot. Unfortunately, this is not my first loss but losing the tube after trying to conceive for so long really sucks. \n\nI am taking a year off and have decided the next step is IVF. I feel like this will be less mentally draining that trying to catch when I ovulate, BD on the right days, and hope I ovulated on the left. I have also booked some vacations I was putting off because I thought I would be pregnant and working on some goals. It is really tough to not want to continue to try but it is liberating. \n\nMy biggest advice is for you to do what will keep you sane. If you want to continue to try definitely do it. If you want a break, take it for as long as you need. \n\nMy first loss was the hardest and it took me so long to get over. Be kind to yourself. You have gone through so much and are so strong. It is ok to unfollow people who are pregnant and it is ok to not go to that baby shower or a child\u2019s birthday party. Protect your mental health and do what is best for you. Im so sorry for your loss. Im currently going through the same thing. 7.5 weeks and had to have my baby, my left tube, and liters and blood removed after the tube ruptured yesterday morning. Right now i just do not feel anything. I was sent lots of support group info if you would like me to forward you anything. I have not looked through it all yet. I hope you feel better. We will get through this (\u2018: Oh my goodness I am so so sorry you are going through this too. It is absolutely horrible, but I am grateful to not be alone. Stay strong and I hope you heal quickly. I would love to know some of the group information when you feel up to looking at them. Absolutely no hurry \u2764\ufe0f Same to you! They only had to do the small cuts so it should only be two/three weeks tops to heal physically.\nIt was an all women\u2019s hospital so luckily I had lots of nurses holding my hands and squeezing my knees until they put me to sleep.\nGood thing for us is that we still have another tube! So there is always a chance to try again. My doctor assured me it would only be slightly more difficult but that i could still have babies. I cannot even think about that right now, but I would love to hear your experience once you are ready to share. I am so glad you had such a good system of healthcare workers to get you through this \u2764\ufe0f I feel like my surgeon and nurse did a great job supporting us as well and even cried with us before and after everything. We were only 5 and a half weeks along so they were hopeful that they may save my tube, but when they got in there they realized it had ruptured and that it somehow was wrapped around my ovary as well. They had to take the right tube and drain the blood from my abdomen, but there were only 3 incisions. Honestly what hurts the most for me right now is the air that is trapped in my collar bone! I did not realize that was even something that could happen but my goodness it hurts. My doctor is saying we can try again in two months which terrifies me. I am grateful to be able to try again but I also feel so many other emotions surrounding it. What made you realize it was ectopic? Were you in pain and went to the ER or just in for your first ultrasound?\nI was starting having awful cramping/gas pains and pains in my shoulder so i went to the ER around midnight. The ultrasound tech took like 20 minutes so i had a feeling there was something very wrong. By the time i was transferred to the woman\u2019s hospital i was screaming in pain. I could barely sign the paperwork and the morphine hardly took the edge off. \nI am still having pain in my neck too, i wonder if that could be air? I slept with a heating pad on my neck last night it seemed to help.\nThis was my first pregnancy and it was definitely a surprise but I am still very distraught and i feel like that is okay. I am 24 and have lots of time left. Try to stay hopeful and I hope you get your baby the next go around (: For me, I woke up to some pinching in the lower belly and a LOT of bleeding. It started off as some spotting but then quickly turned into a lot of bright red blood, so we went to the ER. We were transferred to another facility that had ultrasound and the tech had the same thing. She took quite a while and said she saw something in my right tube. We were actually given the go ahead to go home and wait it out with a follow-up the next day. The bleeding continued and by the next day I was in some real pain. At the follow up, they scanned again and saw a lot more blood in the abdomen and when the OB pushed on my stomach it was unbearable, so we were immediately sent down for surgery. I was having some shoulder pain before as well so I guess I do not actually know for sure what is what but I hope it subsides soon. When I woke up I was so distraught that I immediately asked to go home and got dressed to leave pretty quickly. I should have asked more questions or considered following their advice to stay a little longer, but my post operative appointment is tomorrow so maybe I can ask then. :) This was our first known pregnancy also and I am 25 so I totally feel you! That is so crazy they sent you home! I had no bleeding at all and once i got to the women\u2019s hospital they were prepping me for surgery. Maybe because i was further along and the size? I read the should pain is due to the rupture and internal bleeding.\nMy post op appointment is not until 8/23? I felt like that was kind of a long time but i also do not have a regular obgyn and i was operated by the student doctor team from the college here. Oh wow that is super interesting! That does seem like a long ways away. I do have a regular OB, so maybe that is it, but I definitely feel like checking in on you should happen sooner! I am going through the same thing as you :*( I fainted in the ER triage and had emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy and ruptured left Fallopian tube (which was removed) and a ruptured cyst on my right ovary. They were able to save my ovaries and right tube. I had 2 liters of blood transfusions. I am still in so much pain when I move I thought it would be better by now. My incision looks just like a c-section. I cannot even process the loss (I was 6/7 weeks along) bc I am still dealing with the pain . I feel emotionally numb too and angry and scared for future- so I want to try again or not? Sorry you all are dealing with similar situations. It helps to talk to people that understand the trauma and pain this causes This is overwhelming!! I did not have any bleeding til after the surgery (except for bad internal bleeding and I need 2 liters of blood transfusions). My pain prior to the left tube rupturing was 3 nights of sharp pain in right upper abdomen, flank, and back pain. Which is not typical of ectopic. But the 4th day it went down to pelvic pain, vomiting, shaking, sweating intensely so I finally went to ER. And I passed out in triage. Next thing I knew they were doing ultrasounds and all I kept hearing was ectopic so I knew it was bad news. Then came the emergency salpingectomy for ruptured left tube. Now I am still in pain 6 almost 7 days after. It feels like a burning , pulling pain when I move or get up and down. Even just lying it bed now it is burning on the left and right side of the incision. I also have the clavicle and shoulder pain still too. :( anyone else have burning pain? What helps? They only gave me 3 days of Vicodin, so now I am taking 800 mg ibuprofen 3 times a day. I am so sorry you have to go through this too. I have not wanted to talk to any friends or family about this yet, just strangers online. Do you mind if i ask how old you are? And if you were trying to get pregnant or if it was a surprise? Me and my boyfriend had an accident and i took a Plan B and became pregnant anyway. Seriously thinking the Plan B had something to do with it becoming ectopic. But could just be my denial right now. Try a heating pad on your neck/shoulder that is helped me a lot. Doc told me as much as it hurts, moving around will help your muscles as well, so stay slightly active and not a couch potato. Keep up with the ibuprofen and pain meds religiously. Lots of water. We will get through this \ud83d\udc95 I am 35 that was the only one of the \u201ccauses of ectopic\u201d I have. We were kind of trying for another, so I was not surprised when I was pregnant. That is crazy I cannot believe plan b did not work! Never heard that! so sorry! I also just had an ectopic loss at 5 weeks and I am feeling the utter devastation. I cried it out for an entire day and night, and now feel a bit numb. I do not know how to get through the grief but I do have solidarity with you and just wrapping you in a big virtual hug. We will get through this \u2764\ufe0f I am so incredibly sorry you are having to feel this pain. Hugs being sent right back. I am realizing that the last two weeks I have cut off everyone I know in attempt to process in isolation but last night we went to a gathering and played board games with family and it actually made me feel a little less empty. Still difficult, but worth it \u2764\ufe0f stay strong and do what makes you feel even just a little better. Everything counts right now It is so hard to think of being around people right now because no one that I know has ever had an ectopic and would not truly understand the pain. But I know I need to eventually see friends and family and go to work. I made an appointment with my old postpartum therapist so I am hoping that helps. Sending you so many healing and comforting vibes right now \u2764\ufe0f Thank you for sharing your experience", "Possible ectopic? I am 8 weeks pregnant as of Wednesday. Last night at dinner I got very nauseous, which is normal for me, but it was accompanied by bad cramps. It almost felt like gas, but I am concerned because that pain is still happening. My hcg levels were at 130,000 when I got my blood drawn at 7 weeks. I am not spotting but I have weird pain in both of my shoulders that feel like I slept on them wrong. (That pain has been pretty consistent for the past 2-3 weeks) I have my first ultrasound on the 26th but I am really worried we are going to go and there will not be a baby where it should be. Have you been having consistent blood draws? The red flag for my ectopic was that my HCG was not doubling every 48 hours as expected. Hoping for the best for you \u2665\ufe0f I only had one blood draw. I hope I am just overthinking everything because I told my concerns to my obgyn and she did not see very concerned since I was not bleeding and did not order anymore blood work. Thank you for your input \ud83d\udc95 Your HCG numbers are really strong, which I think is unusual for an ectopic. At 7 weeks with that HCG I think you would be feeling intense discomfort on one side plus periodic pain in your pelvis. \n\nThe shoulder pain you have is not the same shoulder pain that ectopic ruptures are associated with. Ectopic rupture is associated with pain at the tip of the shoulder at the far end of the collarbone. Thankfully it sounds like your pain is some other less scary source.\n\nI think you are within your rights to call your doctor to ask for another blood draw or an earlier scan regardless! How did you make out? \ud83d\udc97 All is well, thank you \u263a\ufe0f I have a cyst on my right ovary, but they said it is one caused by pregnancy and should go away on its own.

Yes, it is normal for the levels at your first blood draw to increase as it takes the shot a few days to start being effective. HCG should be decreasing by your second blood draw (mine also went up at the first).

I just had a baby a year ago, so I was scared about being pregnant. I took a plan B just to be safe. I experienced what I thought was my period, so I thought I was in the clear. Needless to say, I have been spotting for three weeks! I called my GP, she told me to take a pregnancy test and call my OB. The test came back positive. I went in twice this week, my first hcg level was at 79, today I went back and she told me it had gone down. So I have to go back again on Saturday to see where my levels are. I am freaking out.

Currently going through similar. Was diagnosed with a possible ectopic they could not confirm or or deny it. Got two shots of the methotrexate. Levels went up on day 3.

Passed a clot the other day cramps are back to bearable.

My friend has recently recovered from it as I was frightened when I heard her story. She told me how ectopic pregnancies could not be diagnosed from a physical exam. However, she consulted Obstetrician and Gynecologist Dr. Anshu Syed, who has performed one to rule out other factors. My friend had undergone transvaginal ultrasound to find the problem. The doctor had also used a blood test to determine my friend's levels of progesterone and hCG; these are hormones present during pregnancy. If these hormone levels start to reduce or remain static over a few days, the pregnancy is likely ectopic.\n\nSuch severe symptoms include significant pain or bleeding and can lead to rupturing of the fallopian tube, causing internal bleeding. In this case, **Dr. Anshu Syed** has helped my friend effectively. You will learn more about the concern here- \n\n(", "Afraid of another one I had an ectopic pregnancy at the end of last year which resolved itself. It made me feel so sick and I was in so much pain.

First resulted in natural miscarriage. Went to doc, everything seemed fine up until 7 weeks? Experienced heavy bleeding and went to doc she informed me she no longer seen a yoke (I never seen it on screen tbh) long story short. She told me I miscarried and that she was sorry. Two weeks later tube burst while driving. WORST PAIN EVER! Anyways, had tube removed and was told I would only have 50 50 chance of pregnancy well I ended up pregnant AGAIN and went to same doc. Bleeding started again (not as bad) and she said again she was sorry no yoke. Another tubal and I ended up growing a mass and had that removed and they removed other tube as well because doc informed me it was no good. Unable to bear children now obviously and I do not know what to do or how to feel although I have learned to cope with it. How did my doc not know? If I had history of tubal why did not she go extra steps to make sure it was not in the tube the 2nd time? Wow that is a lot to deal with. The good news is you can always do Ivf though expensive. I am very sorry I think it is very rare to have it in separate tubes. It is higher chance of repeat ectopic in the same tube. But yea, the doc should have been a little more on top of things given your history. I am sorry. IVF is a (very expensive) option. I know some people go to Mexico or India to do it cheaper. The doctor seems incompetent, bearing your history in mind.

Hey,\n\nI am on a throwaway account that is kind of also not really a throwaway account. I am here today because of the trauma we both experienced as a result of this medical anomaly. \n\nRecently, I have had a family member pass out the same way my ex did when she was bleeding internally, which happened as the incident this past spring. I found out about this a week after I got back from visiting my grandma in the hospital, not far from where I am currently living. My cousins and their father (my uncle) were there. Her eyes were open and she was entirely vacant, unconscious. \n\nMy ex, whom I was with at the time, was passing out. She told me to not worry about her and let her be. I was an idiot to do that and, within a few minutes, realized she was not ok. I really had never experienced such an event before. However, I needed to do something regardless of how stupid I was in my overall confusion. I almost thought she died in my arms. I had to shake her to try and get her to stay with me, making sure that she was not being hurt or falling down. I went with her in the ambulance after calling 911. I was so scared. We did not find out until later that night that she was pregnant. They had to do emergency surgery on her and she was so scared. I just wanted to be with her but I knew I had to still work. I just wanted to provide for us because I knew she was not working. I finally resolved at a later time in the night, nearing the morning, that I had to call out of work for her, especially because she needed that. \n\nI was so glad that she would be alive. I stayed with her while also occasionally leaving to check on our pets. When it came time to drive her home, we got into a huge fight. I feel terrible because even though it was a small misunderstanding, I should have been much more grounded and calm in how I handled everything. I was stupid to let my emotions get the better of me in such a frazzled and exhausted state of mind. I wish I were better to her. She was my world. I could have lost her forever but I still do not have her now. \n\nEven though I am beginning therapy and reading \u201cthe four agreements\u201d, I am having a hard time buying this \u201cbeing abusive to yourself\u201d ideology. I feel like I need to be harder on myself if I want to be a better person. It does not matter what she did to upset me. I upset her and could have been a better partner than I was. There is so much to be said about how well someone handles a serious situation under pressure. I waivered so many times and just wanted to be her hero. Not in the white Knight way, but the way her champion should be. I am glad she is still alive, even if I do not have her. It was not me who saved her life. She saved mine. I will never forget that. \n\nIf someone is passing out, get them to a fucking hospital and help them NO MATTER WHAT.\n\n Do not be too hard on yourself. We went through that experience beginning of this year and it can be very hard on both partners. You were there for her and that matters a lot. My husband was scared and had to take care of our little girl while I was in surgery and the weeks of recovery. Today I am so proud of that and I love him even more. So to say, it is the little things that matter. I am sure she is very grateful and proud of you for having done that, even though you are not together anymore.

Talking about how I was feeling was very helpful for me so I talked to my mom, sister, and husband every day about how I was doing. \n\nIt is a horrible thing to go through.

I guess I am just looking for a little reassurance... \nI had my right fallopian tube removed 5days ago, it ruptured due to an etopic pregnancy. I had to stay in the hospital for 3days because I lost so much blood and could not get my vitals to level out.\nBesides the normal pain from surgery, my entire stomach is hard and I have been incredibly dizzy. Is this normal? I just want to make sure my body is doing it is job to recover while I try my best to mentally get myself back to a healthy place. I had no idea I was pregnant and my emotions are all over the place and I do not want to be dramatic about the physical part if this is all normal. Thanks for listening. The dizziness could be from the blood loss. I lost a lot of blood when my tube ruptured and I was severely anemic. One of the symptoms of that severe anemia was dizziness. Did you get any blood transfusions? You might have some anemia from your blood loss. \n\nI do not remember if my stomach felt hard or not. I tried not to touch it as much as possible since the surgery incisions hurt so much. \n\nI do not think you are over thinking your symptoms here. You just went through something really traumatic with your body so it is normal to be on high alert. Is there a nurse hotline you can call or maybe call your OB to see if they seem concerned? I called my dr a few times being worried about symptoms I felt during recovery and they were helpful in reassuring me and giving me advice to help alleviate my discomfort. \n\nI hope you heal well and I am so sorry you are going through this. Do not hesitate to reach out to your dr or to us here. I would definitely contact your surgeon. A hard stomach could mean internal bleeding. I want you to be on the safe side! Call your doctor. I called so many times last week during my recovery. It gives you peace of mind. So sorry to hear, can I ask what your symptoms were for the etopic pregnancy? How did you find out? So sorry to hear, can I ask what your symptoms were for the etopic pregnancy? How did you find out?

At first I thought I was being ridiculous and it was just wind/gas but it was unbearable! It was all in the left side and I did not think it would be anything worse. \nI went to my GP and she examined me, she did not think ectopic but could be a miscarriage. I was told if the pain got worse, I would need to go to the emergency department at the hospital. There was no bleeding at all.\n\nAround 4 hours later, my partner took me to the hospital and due to the pandemic he was not allowed in with me. \nFor anyone in the UK, wait times in accident and emergency are crazy (this is not me speaking bad of the NHS, they were amazing through this whole situation, I just believe they are overworked!) I waited 7 hours to be seen - at this point I had not eaten or drank anything as I could not keep it down. \nMy blood pressure was really low and heart rate was really high. I could not lie down to be examined without screaming in pain as the pain had now made its was up my body into my chest and shoulder. \n\nI finally got to the gynecology unit around 11 hours after getting into hospital and then another 4 hour wait before I was examined and scanned. That is where they found the pregnancy, a ruptured ectopic. \n\nThe next couple of hours were a whirlwind, with surgeons, nurses and consultants talking to me, asking me questions and signing forms. I was then taken down for surgery.\n\nAll this time my partner had been at home waiting to hear from me. (I sent him home about 11pm!) \n\nFinally made it back to the ward and contacted him and had a little cry that he was not there for a hug! \n\nI later found out that I lost 1.5 litres of blood :| \n\nI am now 4 weeks after surgery and I think I am nearly at peace with what happened. \nI cried for days after and then the guilt kicks in and everything else! But we are getting there. The physically scars heal but mentally, I do not think I will ever be the same and I will likely always worry at every twinge in my stomach! \n\nSending hugs to anyone that has had to experience this. Wow. I am so sorry you went through this.I had an ectopic pregnancy September 2020, I also thought it was gas pain. When none of the meds I was taking was working, and the pain in my left abdomen was't getting better, I knew I had to go to the hospital. Waited in the emergency room for over 3 hours, to find out my left fallopian tube had ruptured from an ectopic pregnancy. The pain was excruciating. The doc said more than once how dangerous it would have been if I came even a couple hours later. VERY scary, especially during a pandemic.But if this helps, I am one fallopian tube down and am currently 12 weeks pregnant! :)Hang in there, sis. Much love I had surgery for a ruptured ectopic pregancy 4 weeks ago too! I still feel like I am in a little bit of shock! Although I feel like as the physical pain has subsided I have been able to process more. \n\nWith you being scared of every twinge now too. Hugs back for your mental and physical healing!! Can I ask if you knew you were pregnant? And how many weeks along were you \u2026? I did not know I was pregnant, which I think helped my emotional healing. I was 9 weeks Did you have any bladder problems too, like diarrhea or constipation\u2026 nausea \u2026? \nDid the hospital take a b-hcg as soon as you went ? \nDid you have your period that made you assume you were not pregnant?\nSorry for all the questions \u2026 \ud83d\ude2d No bladder issues, just felt like severe gas pain. I had minimal spotting the week before, which in hindsight should have been a red flag, but nothing made me think twice until the day I went to emergency. I knew something was wrong because the pain was getting progressively more severe. It hurt SO bad I am so sorry to hear this :( \nWas your beta hcg positive in the hospital? Yeah it was, hearing that \u201cbut..\u201d after saying it was positive was \ud83d\udc94 I am so sorry ! \nI am also very happy to learn your 12 weeks along safe and healthy ! \u2764\ufe0f Thank you so much! So far so good \u2764\ufe0f I am sorry you went through it too! The pain is awful. That Is what scared me the most, if I went home like I wanted to instead of waiting to see a doctor, it could be a very different story! \nCongratulations! This fills me with hope! It is a huge shock, I would heard of ectopic but never thought it would happen to me and I was so unaware of the risks if it did rupture! \nLuckily for me, my scars are healing pretty quickly so day to day activities have been fine but it is hard to process things mentally! Especially when you go back to work and people in the office are announcing pregnancy! \n\nThank you so much, you too! I am glad I found this part of Reddit, it feels easy to open up when you know people around are going through it too! I am sorry you are going through this. I experienced an ectopic pregnancy in December,  also in the UK. I found out at 6 weeks exactly after having some bleeding. No severe pain. I was 'lucky' ( I hate saying that as no-one experiencing this in any way is lucky.) that my body rejected the pregnancy without medical or surgical intervention and after weeks of monitoring I was discharged. I had to do a lot of things alone but my husband was allowed in for the ultrasound scan. Emotionally, I am getting there. Thank you. I was also around 6 weeks. You are right, no-one is lucky in these situations, it is tough to find the right wording! \nI am glad that you could have your husband with you during the scan, that was tough to hear the words alone. \nI never felt prepared for the emotions after, I got given leaflets and guidance on how to recover physically but nothing in how to deal with the raging hormones and mental health! \nI am glad your getting there. I do not for a second think the feelings will dissappear for us but we can learn to cope. Sending hugs to you!", "3rd round of methotrexate Just curious if anyone here has successfully managed an ectopic with methotrexate after needing a 3rd round of shots? We caught my ectopic very early (hcg at 277) but after the first dose it increased to 693 and we did a second dose which only decreased hcg to 661. My doctor advised that we could try one more round, but is scheduling surgery for next week anticipating that it will likely fail to drop the minimum 15%... anyone else have an experience with failed methotrexate? Doctor could not explain why my body does not seem to be responding. I am so sorry you are going through this. I was in the same situation few months back but 3rd shot worked for me. Also after my second shot I strictly started following low folate diet literally potato diet and lots of green tea. I feel that helped the numbers go down but not by 15% so doc suggested to have another shot which was the last try before surgery. Thankfully it worked and hcg went down by arnd 30%. I kept following the low folate potato and sometimes chicken diet and number kept going down every week. Took me almost 8 weeks post last shot to get to negative results. Your numbers are low so should not take that long. Hope it works for you too. All the best \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Thank you so much for the encouragement... can you share any more about the diet you were on? I have been avoiding pretty much all produce (which is miserable) and having mostly meat, carbs and cheese. Now I am wondering if enriched flour in bread is stopping my progress... I had all kind of potatoes, mashed, fries , tater tots, hash brown patties and anything made with potatoes, cheese, roasted chicken, small portion of brown rice pasta, blueberries and I think 4-5 cups of green tea until numbers were significantly low. And yes I stopped eating any bread coz even plain whole wheat also contain ton of folate. It was very hard to find any healthier options. I feel green tea and following this diet helped me. Enriched flour should definitely be avoided, it was one of the very few things even my doctor suggested to avoid. Low folate diet is hard but definitely worth it. Thanks so much - this is so helpful, I had no idea green tea was a folate antagonist... making some now lol. Definitely will be cutting out all bread and wheat products also.. Good luck and Take care ! I am so sorry. \n\nI also did three rounds of methotrexate. My levels continued to rise. I was angry with the doctors for not knowing what to do. I initially wanted the surgery but my gynecologist advised against it and said the methotrexate would most likely work. Two weeks went by with two more rounds of shots. After the third round of shots I had to be admitted to the hospital because my tube ruptured. \n\nThe doctors told me that ectopics are so dangerous because not one is the same. Every body reacts differently.\n\nAll I can say is go with what you are most comfortable with. Your health is everything. Good luck. Update: my hcg levels finally dropped by the necessary 15% (barely) so no surgery for me at this point! Going to continue to be extra careful with diet while waiting for levels to drop. Thank you everyone for your encouragement through this process. Do any of you happen to recall how long it took for your levels to drop to 0?", "so much uncertainty I just found out I am pregnant and the sex in question happened on June 12th my last period started May 26th) - just to give you an idea on how far along I am. I wanted to find out the exact time and had a ultrasound today and they were not able to see anything. \nThe nurse let me know it might just be too early too see how far along I am but should be fine and just come back next week. For some reason though I just got very worried and have been worried all day. I am noticing a very mild cramp that comes and goes on the left side of my pelvis. (I am assuming that is around where my left ovary is) just above the mons pubis area adjacent to my upper thigh. I have a lot of emotions and I am very uncertain and having extreme anxiety about a possible ectopic. There has been no bleeding however. I have never had one before but this it possibly sound like one? Any support or advice would really help. Uncertainty is so tough to deal with- that sucks you have to wait for more answers. It sounds like you are about 5 weeks along, which is pretty early to visualize anything on an ultrasound. Have you had blood drawn at all to see HCG levels? That would give you/your OB some more information about how things are progressing. One sided pain is something to monitor- if it increases and you have any other ectopic symptoms (bleeding, lightheadedness, other abdominal/shoulder pain) definitely go to the ER. Otherwise, mild cramping/pain could be totally normal/from something like a cyst. Once your HCG levels are over 1500/2000, they should be able to see things on an ultrasound and locate where the pregnancy is; try to get betas drawn and your ultrasound moved up, if your levels are high enough. Best of luck! It is definitely natural to feel uncertain and anxious especially early in your pregnancy before you really know anything. But like what was already said, definitely getting your HCG levels checked will help give you some answers. \n\nI know that when I noticed things going wrong in my pregnancy was when I had severe cramping, like period cramps but even worse. About a week later is when I started to bleed.  I do not say that to scare you, just to make you aware. My sister carried her baby full term and told me she had cramps and stomach aches throughout her pregnancy too. Every pregnancy is different. \n\nI truly hope and pray that everything is okay with your pregnancy and that your baby is safe \u2764\ufe0f. Yes, I agree, it definitely would be good to get beta Hcg testing done. My doc looked at how quickly it increased to know if the pregnancy was viable. I am so sorry for you to be going through this. Hugs \u2764\ufe0f", "Is it normal to have swelling after ectopic pregnancy Hello All.. \nThis is my first post here. I was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy 15 days back and was given the injection to dissolve it. And I was doing great my Hcg levels kept decreasing but just 2 days back I had an unnerving pain and after an ultrasound found out that my tube had bursted and had to undergo a surgery. Now the internal pain is gone but I do have swelling on the right side, and my right fallopian tube was removed. So, is it fine to have swelling and slight abdominal pain and bleeding like menstruation. Thank You. I know that each body is different and maybe someone else already solved this question for you, but I bled like 4 days 2 days after I left the hospital. A month has passed and I still have small pains in my stomach and especially in my scar, like a burning sensation. Maybe it is swelling because you will have your period, sometimes I feel swollen too, it could be because we had a wound inside and it is still recovering, my right tube was removed too. But it is always better to corroborate with a specialist and keep our positivism in our mind. :)", "Anyone have bad nausea 5-6 days post op from ectopic surgery ? My paper says call dr right away for nausea ? I am quit embarrassed.  For me it was the pain meds that made me super nauseous. I would still call the Docs office. Hope you feel better.", "Birth control ok? Can I still take my birth control pills while being treated for an ectopic? The ER doc didnt tell me to quit taking them so idk My DR told me not to take mine. Well I originally went in to the gyno to just get on birth control and figure out why I kept bleeding which ended up being from my ectopic. The DR did prescribe me birth control during the whole thing but told me not to start taking it until my levels are down to 0 so I would assume you should wait on the birth control Yeah that is what im doing. I was taking it but i stopped today.  I hope the mxt works well for me. It is a bit stressful that i have to wait til monday to go get my blood levels checked. Im just glad i went in yesterday and trusted my gut. Did you just find out about your ectopic? I had to get two shots of MTX. The second one made me feel like shit which the DR told me that means it is working. Now my HCG is down to 30 from 561. Next week I should be done with this !!! I have had so many blood tests. The DRs said they want to keep checking until it gets to 0 Yep i just found out i was.  Im so sorry any of us are dealing with this bc my god this incredibly nerve wracking \ud83d\ude44 like i just hope and pray it works for all of us Yes that is what im hearing. I know i have to go in monday and then friday as well for sure Right??? Totally sucks. And the hormones messed me up, one day I would be happy then the next pissed off at every little thing. I felt so bad for my boyfriend. Lol he put up with me pretty good though Yeah im feeling like i want to cry like with no reason to, like im not an emotional person so im wondering if that is a sign my levels are dropping. My husband is annoyed. He angry cleaned this morning and never cleans unless he has too lol. He says he is not mad at me or anything i think he might just be flustered in general bc i cant do a lot of activity right now \ud83d\ude05", "Pregnant with IUD in correct place; possible ectopic. Scared &amp; seeking support! Hello all, this is my first post to reddit and I have no idea what I am doing. I will just explain what is happening right now.\n\nThe short version: tender breasts and mild nausea were weird, so even though I have an IUD I took two pregnancy tests that came back positive. Called OB, was sent to ER. There my beta HCG was 97, and ultrasounds found nothing. Had another draw today but no results yet. Am noticing a decline in pregnancy symptoms and am also noticing right-sided lower back and lower pelvic pain, extending to the right hip. \n\nI (29f) have had IUDs as birth control for seven years with no problems. The current IUD I have has been in for 2 years and five months, and has worked perfectly. I NEVER get periods. I may rarely get breast tenderness or very mild cramps, but this is such a rare occurrence it is not bothersome. I love having an IUD, because before this I had extremely heavy, extremely irregular, and extremely painful periods. \n\nAbout a week ago, I noticed my breasts were verrry tender, very sensitive. Moreso than any rare-but-within-the-norm breast tenderness that has ever happened with an IUD in the past. My partner mentioned pregnancy jokingly and we laughed it off as being impossible. I have never even had a pregnancy scare with an IUD. But the tender breasts continued for a few days. Then, on day four I noticed mild nausea after eating. By day 5, I convinced myself to take a pregnancy test for \u201cpeace of mind\u201d but was shocked and terrified to find a positive result. \n\nI called OB who sent me to the ER. At the ER, I had blood drawn, a urine test, a uterine ultrasound and a transvaginal ultrasound. Ultrasounds showed my IUD was still in its correct place. No evidence of where the embryo is though, they could not find it anywhere. They said there was something they saw that had a weird word like tumor or cyst with it that was evidence that the egg may have gone to the uterus, but really it was too early to tell where it was or what was happening. My beta HcG was 97. I had another blood draw today but will not know the results until next week. \n\nMy breasts are no longer tender. I am not experiencing nausea now. I have had one very slight incidence of spotting, brown blood. Otherwise, any discharge has been thick, sticky, and sort of an off white color. I am cramping, mostly on the right side, low down and both front and back, even extending into my hip sort of? The cramps seem to be slightly worsening, but Idk if that is because I am being hypervigilant in paying attention to my body or if it really is worsening. \n\nI am searching for support and advice. I am scared. I have had one previous pregnancy of spontaneous identical twins resulting in a C-section at 38 weeks. It was healthy. This time, I am terrified. If you have had an ectopic pregnancy, what were your symptoms? What could be happening? On July 8th, I took a pregnancy test, showed positive. Very soon after I started experiencing bleeding and went to the ER. My hormone levels were at 100, so similar to yours. They did a transvaginal ultrasound, but found nothing in my uterus. They said I probably miscarried, but that it could possibly be ectopic and too early to see on the ultrasound. 2 weeks have gone by and now 2 days ago I had an emergency ultrasound ordered by a doctor. Mass found on my right ovary, theyre now saying they do not know if it is a baby though and that it might be a cyst. Blood work was redrawn that day, My hormone levels were at 1200 (dangerously low if I were to be having a regular pregnancy). I am actually leaving right now to go get my blood redrawn again, if my hormone levels is around the same or has lowered I will probably be going into surgery for an ectopic pregnancy. Since your situation seems similar to mine, I will let you know how my day goes I am so sorry to hear about your situation. Thank you for responding. I got a call today saying my HcG levels have dropped to the low 80s. I have another blood test tomorrow. Its either ectopic or a miscarriage but they do not know which yet. I wish you the very best of luck and I am sending so much love and hope your way. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c We will get through this. I (22f) had the exact same thing happen to me a few months ago, IUD was perfectly placed, my breasts were superrrr tender and I took a pregnancy test just to make myself feel better and it was positive. Long story short, the multiple doctors and nurses than examined me had a lot of trouble figuring out what was going on. It took about a MONTH after the first positive pregnancy test for them to find the ectopic pregnancy in my left Fallopian tube. My hcg never went above 54. My best advice is advocate for yourself and continue to ask questions and get the care you deserve and need before the scary effects of the ectopic pregnancy start. It will be okay soon, you caught it very early \ud83e\udd0d message me if I can support you or answer any other questions! I am so sorry for what you have been through. Thank you so much for the support. I am scared and heartbroken and riddled with worry. Like, we were not trying for a baby, we do not want another child right now, but its fucking excruciating to know that this is happening and we have no control. I cannot explain it but its just so emotionally painful and exhausting right now. All of the unknowns happening, all of this. It fucking sucks. \ud83d\udc94 They decided I have an ectopic pregnancy. I will be getting a shot tonight to dissolve the pregnancy. I know you had an IUD so you were not planning your pregnancy, and I was not planning mine either, but I am sorry to hear your levels have gone down. Planned or not, and wanted or not, it can still be hard to deal with a pregnancy loss. Especially with the toll it can have on the body. I hope at the end of this you remain healthy and safe \ud83e\udde1 Oh gosh, I am so so sorry. I hope everything goes safely and well for you! It is very difficult to deal with. Even unplanned, I am completely heartbroken. If you need support please feel free to message me. We are going through similar things at the same time and I am more than happy to talk with you. This is hard, and it fucking sucks, and I am so so sorry for both of us. Lots of well wishes and healing vibes to you \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c Yes, it is really hard. Two weeks ago when they told me I had miscarried I was so distraught. Crying spells for hours, anger, feeling lonely. One woman sent me this course that is to help women cope with pregnancy loss &amp; the feelings associated with it. I will send you the info when I get home if you would like. It technically costs money but my bf just signed up for a month free trial so we could watch it and any other videos they have that we may find helpful Oh I would definitely appreciate that! I relate so much to what you are going through and telling me about. I have waves of heavy emotions &amp; crying for hours and hours followed by this very hollow feeling. Hollow turns to numb, and during the numb times I can distract myself for a while. But then hollow returns and soon after the emotions return and I am back to sobbing. Each round of news restarts the process, each pain in my side restarts the process, over and over. I have a friend who said she would send me the information for a therapist who specializes in fertility, pregnancy, and related grief. I can send you her information if you would like: even if she is not online or in your area she might be able to help find someone near you if desired. Ok, the video is from BrightCourse, and the class number SC-0255 and titled pregnancy loss. I will be honest, at first I did not find it helpful, and I had a long cry half way through, and after I resumed the video as well, but since then I have not had any other outbursts like that. I think it was good to get all of the feelings out. I would love the contact info your therapist though, cus I do not doubt that these feelings will eventually come back. Hi,I have been looking for a group to this particular topic and was diverted to this group.I know its weird since I am the husband(m,36).My wife have an IUD inserted 10years ago,and lately she has the same things happening to her,tender breast,feeling nausated,hunger,mood swings,so last night we check with pregnancy kit and it came out positive.This is unplanned though as we are due to replace the IUD this year but OB is not available though.She missed her period for a month and after 1 week she spotting but little only.today,we decided to go for blood works and see the result,I am scared as this subject of ectopic pregnancy,she is so fragile and I dont want her to be in this situation. I am so sorry you have found yourself in this situation. I wish you all the best, and am hoping for the safest outcome for each of you. Are they having her go back for repeated blood tests to monitor her HcG levels? \nWith my situation, my HcG levels declined on day 2 and on day 4, and the doctor believes I am having a miscarriage. I am going to have my levels checked weekly for the next month so that we can monitor the situation in case medical intervention is necessary. I had no idea that a miscarriage could take such a long time. It is very scary, very heartbreaking, and very difficult. I am here if either of you needs someone to talk to who is going through the same type of thing right now. My partner and I have been carving out time specifically dedicated to grieving and processing what is going on together. We just talk and hold each other and cry, but it is so helpful to just be there for each other right now. We have decided to seek therapy, though we are not sure if it is better to do that during this process or after. The way I have been trying to handle it is to just sit with my feelings when they come, process them as well as I can, allow them to happen without feeling guilty for them, and when they pass I try to distract myself. Funny movies, podcasts while I do housework, conversations about anything other than what is happening with friends. I have told close friends and family what is happening since the latest updates, but personally I have found that the more I talk about what is happening, the more I recount the details of the story, the more painful it is to do. I have also explained to my employer what is going on so they are aware that my health, and the future of my productivity, are up in the air and not within my control. I am in no way trying to tell you guys how to handle your situation, I am just trying to explain things that have helped and harmed the situation for me, in case it is at all helpful for you. Advocate for your wife and help her advocate for herself with the doctors, leave no stone unturned and ask as many questions as you need to to understand what is happening, what you can do, what the next steps are, etc. i know it is super hard when you are in the middle of it and trying to process yourself, never ever feel bad about calling the doctors back and asking as many questions as you need answered. I am sending healing vibes and lots of hope your way! \ud83d\udc9c Sorry for the delay, the last few days have been really difficult. I am sending you a link! \n\nI hope you are well, and I hope you find healing and peace soon. \ud83d\udc9c Always here if you need to talk.", "Drop Off Spots? ", "Ectopic pregnancy - did not know I was pregnant So I am currently recovering from an ectopic pregnancy. I did not know I was pregnant until going to ER with horrible pains! Had to have surgery that night to get my left tube removed. All went well so I am so happy with that- has not even been a week since it happening. I have an amazing boyfriend who has been so supportive. I am not really sure how to feel, it all happened so quickly. We are not ready for children yet, but finding all this out and then having surgery soon after was just a crazy experience. I am 23 (F) and my partner is 22 (M) - I have never been pregnant before this and now all I see is babies and people getting married. I know everything happens for a reason, and it is not my fault but I just wonder about if I knew I was pregnant maybe things would have been different. \nI guess I am just wondering how everyone has dealt with this and maybe if anyone\u2019s has been/is in a similar situation that I could relate to. None of my friends have gone through anything like this I would love to hear your stories \ud83d\udc9d I am so sorry that this was something you had to experience it is very scary. I too lost my left fallopian tube due to ectopic pregnancy in September they didnt get me into surgery for a long time because I needed to be transported and had lost a dangerous amount of blood by the time they finally got me in. I too did not even know I was pregnant, but it leaves one feeling a little confused and sad after still. It is like we were not really given a choice of weather we could have the baby or not because of the location being an impossible one to choose to keep the baby. However for me I came to the conclusion not long after that I want to have a baby and I got married to my husband, after I mostly recovered from the surgery. Before that incident I did not really know what I wanted out of life but now i do. (22 btw) Congratulations on getting married!! I am so sorry this happened to you too but atleast it seems to have helped you decide what you want to do in life! That would have been so scary but thankfully you are all okay! I definitely feel like this is going to push me onto the right path so that I can start aiming to have a family too, I think after this it puts things in perspective. Your message is actually really comforting, thank you so much!!\nWish you and your husband the best trying to have children etc \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70 I am so sorry you went though that. \nEctopic x 3 survivor, here so I know how hard this is. My first pregnancy was an accident as well that ended ectopic in 2018 and we have had two more since then - two in 2020 as we took a break from 2018-2019 as we got married in 2019. My last one in august resulted in removing my left tube.\nThe urge became so strong after my first ectopic it was unreal. I knew I wanted kids but after losing that baby it is been a deep need. \nIf you ever need to talk or vent, I am here! I basically know everything about ectopics (and what to do after ectopics) you could ever know so I am a book of knowledge. \nHugs. Thank you and I am happy if I could help in some way. I have also never talked to anyone else who had this happen to them either as it is not something common at all. I wish you the best in life though and I am glad in some way it is also helped you find the path you want to take. \u263a\ud83d\udc95 Three times is intense! I am sorry for your loss. I am wondering what your symptoms looked liked, I am early in my pregnancy now, but I am kind of worried, as I have been having crams every night at the same time Wow 3 is insane!! I am so sorry you had to go through all that!! \nI can relate to what you said so much, I have always wanted kids but now it is become a deeper need!! However I am just not ready yet for kids yet, I still want to save and buy a house first but I do think everything happens for a reason and i think the positive in this situation is it is made me realise I want to get the ball rolling as I do not think I can wait more than a few years for kids now!! \nThank you so much for sharing and I really appreciate the message!! It is all still so new to me and I am still processing everything but I will definitely reach out if I have any questions or anything like that! It is so nice to know (although horrible so many ladies have had to deal with this) that there is other people who have gone through the same thing!! \nGood luck with everything and I hope you are blessed soon with beautiful children \ud83d\udc9a If it helps for me I woke up one day with a strange pain, sharp crampy type of pain. I stood up and it was like I could not stand up straight if that makes sense? Mainly in the middle of my tummy but if anything to the left!\nIt seemed to get worse throughout the day and pain killers were not doing anything. I decided to go to the hospital after about 6 hrs as it was still there (it was not excruciating to me but very uncomfortable and still painful), I actually have another issue (stomach ulser possibly or something like that) which I was waiting to see a specialist for so I actually thought it was that- however thankfully I did go to the hospital as they soon figured out what it was!! \nIt seems strange that it comes and goes but if you are nervous go to your GP or emergency room just incase!! If it is an ectopic pregnancy you want to get it sorted ASAP to avoid a rupture (same with appendix) \nHope that helps and good luck xx Thank you so much!! I know right I am so glad I found this little community and decided to post!! Us girls got to stick together!! And yes, You too!! Im still processing it all but As they say Everything happens for a reason \ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d I am sorry to hear about your ectopic pregnancy and loss. I just wanted to say there is nothing you could have done even if you had known you were pregnant. This is sadly one of those things that we have no control over. \n\nWe had been trying for a baby and so found out immediately I was pregnant but started with light bleeding at just over 5 weeks. Other than this I had no other symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy and had to push to be referred to an early pregnancy unit for investigation. After a scan it was found to be ectopic. My only risk factor was my age (I am 39). It was found that my ectopic pregnancy was ending 'naturally' and so was managed 'expectantly': basically 'wait and see'. So that is what I am doing right now. Waiting. The last set of hCG blood tests i had the hCG was low so its nearly over for me. \n\nSo..you did nothing wrong. There is nothing you could have done to prevent it. Omg sorry I am just answering now! Found out I was pregnant again the weekend and it is been a wild ride of booking appointments. \nMy symptoms with all 3 ectopics \n- pink and brown blood, mostly brown with little tiny clots\n-severe stabbing type pain either near my ovaries or my entire stomach.\n- rectal pain (sounds weird but super common) it is unlike ANYTHING I have ever felt before.\n-extreme pain and just a feeling that something is not right, I have an extremely high pain tolerance and ectopic pain brings me to my knees in a sweat. \n- hcg rising all funny or slowly. Except for my 3rd ectopic my hcg rose normally, but usually it will not.\n\nAll ectopics are different. If you have any worry about it just go to the ER.\nIt is a life threatening thing and do not risk it!! I am especially cautious, now since I only have the one tube left. Can I ask when you began experiencing symptoms? I had severe abdominal/rectal cramps yesterday and have low, slow-rising hcg. I also just feel something is not right. This week should have been my period, I have been on femara + trigger shot for fertility. I start experiencing symptoms almost immediately. I am actually in hospital waiting for surgery to remove my only remaining tube :( this is my fourth ectopic. \nHonestly each time my gut just tells me \u201csomething is wrong\u201d and I go to the hospital. What are your hcg levels? Are you getting a scan done? Thank you for the response. My hcg yesterday was 97 yesterday (up from 64 on Tues). So too low for a scan, mostly likely non-viable, it is just a matter of where are the cells. They want me to check levels again tomorrow and Mon basically to determine miscarriage or ectopic. They said if I have any pain to go to the ER over the weekend. You are welcome. \nYou could still ask for a transvaginal exam to try to rule out an ectopic. Tubes are tiny and if something is growing in them a skilled tech may be able to locate it. My levels were super low with my second ectopic but they were able to find it on ultrasound immediately. But In saying that my third ectopic I was in hospital for a week looking for it and they never could find it on an ultrasound so eventually my hcg got to 10000 and there was nothing in uterus so they had to just go in surgically. When they did the doc said she does not know how it was not found cause it was hours away from rupturing. \nEctopics can hide but usually they are pretty obvious with the right tech and a good T/V ultrasound. \nIf your levels rise again - I would lean more to ectopic but it could be just a miscarriage and your levels would go down not rise and fall.\nAre you having any discharge or bleeding? Or pain? I remember now you said rectal pressure. If it is extreme like worst pain ever and nothing you have felt before I highly recommend going to the hospital. Also watch for shoulder pain as that is a sign of internal bleeding because the blood pools and hits a nerve. I had severe pain yesterday for about 15 mins in the morning, thought I was losing it then, but no bleeding. I have had some discharge since then, like my period is coming, but no color and still no blood. Dull lower back ache with a few sharp stabs that I feel like I could be imagining. Tender belly. I am half hoping that I will just start bleeding so it would be done. The waiting is so hard. Oh girl. I am sorry you are having so much pain. I really would recommend going in if you are that uncomfortable esp with the belly being tender. If it is ectopic which I REALLY hope it is not - you may have fluid in your abdomen and they would def see that on ultrasound. \nIs the discharge brown? My ectopics have never bled I just get brown mixed  gross discharge then as it progresses it turns to prune juice. It is quite gross. Sorry tmi. No, no color to discharge. I had some pink-ish discharge (I did not mention it earlier bc I thought tmi and gross as well, but now we are talking about it lol) right before missed period so I thought my period was coming for sure. Discharge stopped for a couple days, but now I have got some clear or milky discharge. But you are right. I have been really hesitant because I want it to be ok, but I do think I should go in. Thank you for sharing and for the advice! I really appreciate it. Go get checked just for piece of mind - it might all be perfectly fine and not show anything but they may locate something sinister. It is worth going.\nEctopics can be waiting games and you may need to go back multiple times but the most important thing is to listen to your body. My body each time has just been like \u201cthere is SOMETHING WRONG\u201d and unfortunately my body\u2019s always been right. It is like a feeling of dread. \n\nI hope everything turns out the best for you. Keep us updated! I have felt the entire time like something is wrong. I do have a 2 yr old, the only other time I have been pregnant, and did not have any of this last time. I will update and thank you! Ugh it is a terrible dreading feeling. \ud83d\udc95I will be thinking and hoping for you. Fingers and toes crossed. Hi ! How soon did you find out you were pregnant? Did you take a pregnancy test at home? Was it positive? If yes, when did you take it? Thank you Hi, I personally was doing fertility treatments so I took a home test exactly 2 weeks after ovulation and it was very faintly positive. Are you worried about an ectopic? So sorry that you had to go through this! I have some questions, did you have any missed periods ? Because you said you did not know you were pregnant? How far along were you when you found out ? I am also curious to know! Hey so sorry I have only just seen this.. but yes it was very strange!! I still had a period but it was a lot lighter than usual but I did not think much of it but when I was in hospital I said to them it cannot be right I litterally  just had my period and they were saying I was 6 weeks pregnant.. but turns out your body can still have a \u201cperiod\u201d because of the ectopic my body does not fully know it was pregnant or something along those lines but because there was not really anything to shed that is why it was so light! \nIt is good to be aware cause I had no idea and I nearly did not even go to the hospital cause I thought maybe it was just leftover period pains or something.. but yeah pretty crazy!! Let me know if you have more questions xx Only just seeing this- I was on hospital as I had an ongoing issue with my back getting these spasms so I thought it was related to that but turns out they came back and said I was pregnant.. and it was ectopic, I am not sure if an at home test would test positive or not because I would assume mine came from my blood tests!\nI think like they said above I would just go to the hospital and get checked if you are ever unsure because you have nothing to lose (except maybe some time haha) just getting some piece of mind.. if left untreated they can be very serious. I totally agree with the whole trust your gut thing because deep down I just knew something was wrong! Hope this helps!! I cannot believe how many people on here have gone through similar things!! Us girls got to stick together and I love how everyone is jumping on this thread supporting each other, wishing you all the best with everything \ud83d\udc9c", "Nausea during Expectant Management I am being monitored for possible ectopic.

They told me this could be due to an ectopic pregnancy but could not 100% confirm at that time. I proceeded with taking the abortion pills; cramps/nausea commenced within 15 minutes of the second pill, however, bleeding did not start until 4 days later. The bleeding was then and has still been minor, no soaking of pads, just panty liner amounts. I  had a follow up on July 20th and PP confirmed that my levels had lowered and sent me on my way. The past week I have noticed stabbing pains on my left, lower abdomen that radiates down my thigh, to my knee as well as on/off pain in my left shoulder. I have never felt this tired before and just do not feel right ever since. I left a message with the PP nurse but have not heard back. The pain is becoming more intense; should I get this check out by the ER? I do not have insurance for an OB appointment. I would honestly go get checked out at the ER. What were your levels when PP followed up? You will need to follow up with some clinician. I do not know if the pill you took would be effective depending on where the pregnancy was.

I have started working out lightly so I might be sore, but I had to ask for help. I am terrified of ectopic seeing what my SIL went through with hers. My pregnancy groups on apps have not been helpful so hopefully you ladies are. I thought I was having UTI. I feel some pressure when I pee. The pain radiates all the way in the back so I also felt some pressure when I poop. It hurts when I am having sex. Until one day I went get some pain meds and I realize that I could not even step on the gas. The pain was excruciating, stabbing like on my pelvic area. Left and right side. So I went to urgent care. Negative on UTI but Pt came back positive. I was 3 weeks pregnant and it was in my left Fallopian tube and it has started to rupture that is why I was in so much pain. When in doubt, go to urgent care right way. Hey OP. I would recommend seeking medical care.  My symptoms were not exactly like this, but everyone is different. At the very least, a doctor can take your worry away. Any pain that is severe should be checked out (I believe general aches are normal but severe cramping is not) Hopefully all was well with you I would def get it checked out. I had severe pain that lasted a few hours but did not think anything of it. The pain then became a dull pain (felt like I had done crutches or worked out my abs). Turned out it was as an ectopic. The pain is gone \ud83d\ude03 I think I was being a big wuss during RLP. Once I did research, I found that my exact location of pain is common ligament pain.

Fingers crossed!", "What were your early symptoms like? For anyone who had an ectopic pregnancy, what were your first symptoms like? Did you have excess gas? or neck pain? My first symptoms were bleeding and fatigue. I thought I had a period, then bleeding stopped,  and then started again. I was TTC so a little later I used the ovulation strips and it was darker than I had ever seen it.  Nothing made sense timing wise with my charting and period, and I read that the ovulation tests could be positive if you were pregnant so I switched to the HCG pregnancy tests and sure enough it was positive. Because of all the weird bleeding I immediately messaged my doc and she helped me navigate it. The blood tests showed low Hcg levels that were not doubling at the correct intervals so we knew it was not a healthy pregnancy. We were newly married and did not know we were pregnant. I thought I was not having my period because of stress (which has happened before - I once went several months without a period due to stress), but then I \"got my period\" for 14 days in a row (which has never happened to me before). I would get \"period cramps\" but they would be really sharp and intense. They would take my breath away for about 3 seconds and then completely go away, and they were on my left side only. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, plus I am a teacher, so I put mind over matter out of habit. One day the pain was so intense with no relief. It was the worst pain I would ever experienced, which ended up being my left tube rupturing and I had emergency surgery shortly after to remove the tube. I had over a pint of blood of internal bleeding.\n\nI do not know if you are looking for advice or just sharing stories, but my advice to anyone reading this is to listen to what your body is telling you. Do not be the hero, and if something does not seem right, get it checked out. It is better to be safe than sorry. Thank you so much for sharing your story, I appreciate it so much. I got a few questions if you do not mind me asking. Was your 14 day period heavy at any points? Also before/during the period did you have any noticeable symptoms? I got checked for pregnancy already but I still feel like something is very wrong and maybe I checked for pregnancy too soon? I just had the longest period - 12 days! Which I never have as well, with symptoms I never had before. My symptoms when I first knew something was wrong is when I had intercourse with my partner it was really painful and uncomfortable. The next day I went to the hospital because I found that it could be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy and sure enough they proceeded to surgery. If you have a feeling it is always best to be safe and go to the doctors office. Hope this helps. I am glad I could help! Here is my answers:\n\n\n1) I have been blessed with not too heavy periods. It felt like a normal period to me at first, but then it was like the last two days of the period would never end, just a light flow.\n\n\n2) The only noticeable symptoms were the sharp pains that would take my breath away but only last about 3 seconds. I would get them once or twice a day, sometimes would skip a day. They did feel different than normal period pains. \n\n\nIt does not hurt to talk to your obgyn and check things out. It might be a cyst or something else. I have had cysts before, and apparently I had so many that when they removed the left tube, it looked like a vine of grapes there were so many cysts.\n\n\nThere is hope: my husband and I became pregnant without the use of medications or other interventions a little over a year later.

Not sure if this is allowed but has anyone had pus coming out of their salpingectomy?", "\ud83d\udc94 ", "Ectopic pregnancy symptoms, causes, diagnosis and treatments Ectopic pregnancy is fatal to the mother and its symptoms are vaginal bleeding and pain on one side. Read more here\n", "Worried my pregnancy is ectopic?? For those of you who have had one what were your early signs?\n\nI had a positive pregnancy test on November 15th. My last period was october 15th. I went to the doctor and had an ultrasound and they said they did not see anything and that it may be too early or it may be an ectopic pregnancy. I have had no signs of an ectopic pregnancy. My symptoms include mild uterine cramping maybe twice a day, back pain around the time of my missed period, and one day of light spotting. The spotting was very light pink and only lasted a few hours but has not been back for about a week. \n\nIs it normal not to see anything on an ultrasound this early? I am really concerned because I am very young and I cannot afford any healthcare. When you went to the dr, did they draw any blood or plan to follow up with you? Judging by your last period date, you should be around 5 weeks pregnant. It is definitely still possible that it was just too early to have seen anything. They should be checking your blood to ensure your hormones are rising appropriately (with an ectopic, they tend to rise much more slowly) and/or following up with another ultrasound in a week to be sure. With both of my ectopics, I had brown spotting at about 5 or 6 weeks that turned to red and a pretty intense pinching pain on the side where the ectopic was. I was lucky that I never had a rupture, but I have read that there is a lot of intense pain and more bleeding with those. It must be scary facing this from a position of not being able to afford healthcare, but I would strongly urge you to get to the ER if you experience heavy bleeding and/or intense pain, especially on one side as a rupture could be life-threatening. If you are not experiencing symptoms, I would try not to worry too much. In either case, you really should still follow up with the dr to at least figure out what is going on and go from there. I am sorry you are in this scary position right now. It is not a great place to be. Sending internet hugs and wishing you the best! Yes the doctor did blood work and I am following up with more blood work in 2 days, and an ultrasound in a week. I am so worried I was not planning to be pregnant in the first place. Would I be experiencing bleeding and pain by now if it was ectopic? I cannot say 100% for sure because not everyone has symptoms start at the same time. With my second, I do not think I started having pain until closer to 7 weeks and had just had light spotting before then. I would advise being vigilant about symptoms and hopefully the results from your second blood draw will tell you more. I am sorry again you are going through this. It is got to be so stressful. I had some spotting but was assured by my OB that things would be okay. My hCG levels were climbing and I had an ultrasound at week 7, which is when I found out it was ectopic. \n\nYou need to have blood work done to make sure your hCG is increasing. How many weeks are you? If you are 5 it is prob too early. 7 you should see the gestational sac. \n\nHoping the best for you, girl! I would say do not stress but...I know that is impossible. Hugs. I missed my period on October 1. I had a positive test October 2nd. I went to the hospital for pain on October 3rd they were not able to see anything on ultrasound but my HCG levels were high enough that there should be something. They kept me over night and the next day I was treated with methotrexate. I was discharged and went home. Saturday October 10th I ended back at the hospital where they finally saw the pregnancy in my tube. I had emergency surgery and that was that. I was not in a lot of pain and I had no bleeding for that week. But I did not feel right if that makes sense? I hope it all goes smoothly for you! Did you have any implantation spotting or bleeding? I had spotting one day that seemed like implantation bleeding. I am wondering if that still happens in ectopic pregnancies My doctor told me that pain and bleeding (even light, red, consistent bleeding) can be normal within the early stages. I think you should be fine. But definitely get medical care if your bleeding turns red, gets heavier, pain gets intense, you get a fever, etc... even if your symptoms just do not feel right do not hesitate to go. You know your body. I never had one but I thought I did.\n\nI went to the ER for a sharp right side pain and light red bleeding. I thought it could be ectopic. They did scans and blood work. Looked like either a blighted ovum (there was no fetal pole or yolk sac) in my uterus or just a very early pregnancy. It measured at 5w0d.

I do not want to go to ER but I also do not want another ruptured ectopic!!!! Hi! I am 4 weeks pregnant after my ectopic that was treated with MTX.\n\nShoulder pain is only scary if it is at the far tip of the shoulder near where it meets the collar bone. If you want to google Kehr's sign you can see how it is a classic indicator of internal bleeding... That said I am also so tense that my shoulders and back are aching too.\n\nGood luck at your betas today. Mine are very early but so far it is looking better than my ectopic. Thank you!! Good luck to you, too! I only had shoulder pain after bleeding internally for like 5 hours and then laying down. It was super sharp and very different from joint pain. I ended up getting pregnant 10 months after my ruptured ectopic. Though we were not really trying again until about 7 months after. My first pregnancy symptoms both times were lower back pain, tender boobs and soreness, like a period but without the cramps and bleeding. I felt like this super early at 4 weeks with both pregnancies and the second time went to my doc right away to order HCGs. They then verified the pregnancy with an ultrasound after I did a couple HCGs at 5 weeks 6 days. My previous ectopic ruptured when I was 6 weeks and 6 days. So I was super adamant about verifying the location of the pregnancy as early as possible. I do not think you need to worry too much especially about the shoulder pain. I was bleeding internally for almost 11 hours before I had emergency surgery and the shoulder pain was the last symptom to show up. I had fainted, puked, and then tried to nap like an idiot instead of going to the hospital and when I tried to roll over the shoulder pain was insane, nothing like a small ache. You are right. When I ruptured it was excruciating shoulder pain for a week (that I ignored). Thanks for writing that out and putting me to ease a little! \ud83d\ude10 No problem, I hope you are able to relax some. When I got pregnant after the ectopic it was just anxiety and stress like crazy until the HCGs and ultrasound to verify. After the HCG test and seeing my levels were normal I felt a little better and then so much relief after the verification ultrasound. I hope it can help you too! I had an ectopic in April of 2020, ruptured tube so lost the tube and now only have one tube), got pregnant in September 2020 (actually had my positive pregnancy test today last year). Went for immediate ultrasound and blood tests to ensure everything was growing in the right place (it was) I now have an almost 4 month old daughter! Aww congrats on your daughter!! That is amazing! \u2764\ufe0f", "Dizziness without rupture I had an tubal ectopic in July that was ultimately resolved surgically (after a failed round of MTX). With that pregnancy, I was super dizzy as early as week 3-4. But even by the time of surgery (I think around 8 weeks) my tube never ruptured so it was not internal bleeding dizziness. At the time I wrote it off as a progesterone symptom but I did not have that with my first pregnancy (intrauterine) so I am wondering if actually that was an related to the ectopic after all? \n\nHard to Google since rupture causes blood loss which causes dizziness so wondering if people here can weigh in. Pain, and pregnancy in general can cause dizziness and vertigo. I have had some vertigo during my pregnancies, all of which ended in the 1st trimester. I think it is the hormone changes.", "Ectopic and Ultrasound Is it possible to have an ectopic pregnancy at 7 weeks and it not show up on the transvaginal or abdomen ultrasound?? We knew mine was ectopic bc my hcg was 11000 but my uterus was empty. When they did my repeat ultrasound a few days later it was still empty but I had lots of free fluid in my abdomen so they did surgery to see if they could find it and my tube had ruptured. I thought I was like 5w 3 days but they think I was closer to 7. Ah, that is what I am worried about - that I have an ectopic pregnancy but they cannot find it on ultrasound.  Waiting on my blood work results. Did they see anything? My ultrasounds (X3) between 5w and 6w showed nothing. Nothing in my uterus, nothing in my tubes, no free fluid, no masses. Once your HCG is over a certain number which it should be by 7 weeks they should be able to visualize something on the ultrasound in your uterus if the pregnancy is there. That said if there is any chance your dates could be wrong they might want to wait and check a little more. I had an IUI cycle so all my dates were precise which is why my RE acted quickly. In any other scenario my ectopic acted exactly like a normal pregnancy that was a week or so earlier than my dates suggested. (Low but doubling HCG, nothing on ultrasound etc.) Had two ultrasounds - one at 7 weeks (last week) and another 7w4d (yesterday)- uterus was empty and nothing in my tubes. Finally got my blood results back today and my hcg levels are at 94. I still feel such an odd/pressure, dull ache on my right side so I cannot shake the feeling that I still have an ectopic pregnancy it is just not showing on ultrasound. I think the hcg level is too low though for it to be considered ectopic? Not sure. Going back to the doctor tomorrow! An HCG of 5 or less is \"normal\" and an HCG over 25 is considered positive for pregnancy. Anything over 5 will at minimum likely be monitored weekly until it gets back to normal, but they may also recommend methotrexate. At this point you would be termed a \"pregnancy of unknown location\" or PUL. I am so sorry you are going through this! I hope you get some answers and a plan at your appointment tomorrow! And definitely follow-up if the discomfort is getting worse! Oh, ok - that makes sense. Thank you for the info! The wondering is driving my insane. Hope I get answers/plan tomorrow too! How did you make out? Hcg level dropped to 45 from 94! So it looks like a miscarriage. Going to do another blood draw next week. Doctor said my aches could be cyst related since that is all they saw on the ultrasound. Thank you for asking!", "Low slow hcg Hi ladies, so my levels are rising slow and the numbers are low. I was worried about an ectopic early on but the nurse said she did not think it was bc I had higher progesterone levels. Well my most recent blood draw my levels barely doubled in a week span at a whopping 3hundred something and now she is worried about ectopic. I have an ultrasound on Wednesday but I am worried they will not see anything bc the numbers are so low. Could it just be an emanate miscarriage or does it sound more like ectopic? I have had no spotting or bleeding thus far. I am 6w1d based off lmp. I do have aching and cramping but nothing I have not felt since before my bfp. Thanks for any advice or experience. Not doubling is a red flag! If hcg is dropping that is a sign of miscarriage. Creeping but not doubling is a symptom of ectopic. I for sure had aching and cramping before the spotting. Be your own advocate and good luck. That is my biggest fear. I have had cramping and aching since before my positive. It comes and goes now. Mostly experience it in the evening/night. My ultrasound is at 9am on Wednesday so I am praying no rupture happens if it is ectopic and we catch it Wednesday. Thanks for the advice I have low and slow rising hcg now too. \n\n4w 3d - hcg around 100\n4w 5d - hcg around 150\n\nI had ectopic last year and I have pretty similar symptoms now like very very mild cramping and spotting brown :( But I am not losing hope as there is a small chance that it might still be a healthy pregnancy. My next blood test will be tomorrow. Hope all goes well for us both. Did you catch it early last year and do the shot? Or did you have to do a lap to remove? When I started bleeding red (still no pain), I was admitted into the hospital and monitored (blood drawn every 48 hrs and ultrasound). Once the dr. saw a mass in my right tube, I was given the option to wait it out / mtx / lap. I chose mtx. \n\nMy hcg level was at 2300 when they finally saw the mass and it took 2 shots and 7 weeks to get the hcg down to less than 5. How long did you have to wait to try again? What did you experience after the shot? I was told that we can start trying again 3 months from the first shot. The injection process was very fast and I barely felt anything. I did feel fatigue and occasional mild cramping until my hcg level go down to less than 5. The hardest part for me was the anxiety of rupturing while recovering from MTX. That is the hardest part right now lol. My hcg is barely in the 300s. I am expecting the worse but hoping for the best. I do not want to have to wait 3 months to try again \ud83d\ude29 but what choice will I have. I am really hoping you are not going through it again. Thanks so much for replying and sharing your experience. Really wishing you the best! Thank you. Wishing you the best too. Hope you have a smooth and easy journey. Do drop me a message if you need someone to talk to \u2764\ufe0f I have had 4 Ectopics (3 last year alone) \n\nUnfortunately it is really hard to say right now. Low and slow hcg can be a sign of ectopic. If your levels are rising and not falling that is also more likely an ectopic sign than miscarriage. Unfortunately progesterone is not a good tool to diagnose ectopics as you can still have normal progesterone with Ectopics. You can also have normal rising hcg. They are very frustrating. I am so sorry you have gone through any at all. I had laparoscopic surgery to remove this morning. He thought it was in the tube right next to my left ovary on u/s but when he got in there he thinks it could have been intrauterine but not viable. He flushed my tubes and all was clear. I will find out exacts at my follow up. Thank you for sharing your story with me I am sorry that happened but glad you are tubes are clear. I am going through kind of the same thing. I had an ectopic in January and I had very high HCG levels. Started at 305 and doubled. I was bleeding almost every day for weeks before they were able to see it in ultrasound around 6-7 weeks. I am pregnant again now and caught pregnancy very early. I started bleeding around 3 \u00bd weeks but stopped after 4 days. My HCG was 11 then 64 the next week and last week it was 112. I have more blood work and ultrasound this week but am very nervous like you. I am not bleeding anymore but cannot tell if my cramps are pregnancy or anxiety related \ud83d\ude29 I will tell you that if you do have to get the shot I felt nauseous for about two weeks. The hardest toll I had was my mental health. This time I am trying to not think about it and focus on my mental state. Take care of yourself \ud83d\udc93 I am sorry for your loss and the anxiety of having to deal with it again I can imagine is unreal. I had my US and my doctor thought ectopic. We did a laparoscopy Thursday morning and after he was unsure if it was actually ectopic. He said when he flushed my tubes there was no blockage so it either flushed or it was intrauterine and not viable. We will know more when pathology comes back. I am hoping all turns out well for you. I am so sorry you are dealing with this again. It is the absolute worse. Hi. Any updates? I am going through the same thing right now and I am terrified it is going to be ectopic. Hope all is going well with you!", "Had my ectopic surgery today. Pain on left side. Well, that was the scariest operation of my life. \n\nI was about 6 weeks with my last hormone reading (on Friday) at 7,945. Could not find the baby in the ultrasound, numbers were doubling too rapidly to attempt the shot and patient monitoring. \n\nWent in to find it and remove it and unfortunately I lost my left tube, it was too swollen and damaged as it was the location of the ectopic. \n\nFortunately I am alive and well and my ovaries, uterus, and other tube are fine in case I want to have children later. \n\nI have been home from surgery for about 5 hours now; the pain is so bad! \n\nI have trouble standing up on my own because it is painful and scary to put pressure on the side I lost the tube. \n\nWill this pain subside? Is it normal I am having a hard time sitting down and getting up? I literally limp around the house or ask someone to help me get up.", "I still feel oregnant It is killing me\u2026 still feeling pregnant and knowing I am not.\n\nMy heart hurts.", "Maybe ectopic? Went to the ER for minor pelvic pain and spotting at 5 weeks they did a transvaginal ultrasound and they were able to find a gestational sac in my uterus, can it still be considered ectopic if they saw the gestational sac in my uterus? An ectopic pregnancy is one that implants *outside* the uterus. If they found the the gestational sac inside your uterus, that is not ectopic. \n\nThere are SUPER rare instances of people having heterotopic pregnancies, where there are two fertilized eggs that implant in different places, so I guess it is still *technically* possible that you have got one in your uterus and one somewhere else. But that is SUPER unlikely. It is most likely not Ectopic if they saw something in your uterus. You can have a pseudo sac with ectopics which is basically just a fake sac and the actual embryo is in the tube so just monitor your pain and if the doctors are not concerned then relax and go back if you need to. \n\nCongrats! They found a gestational sac for me at 5 weeks but it was still ectopic \u2013 it just ended up getting smaller and eventually passing. They did suspect heterotopic for a while, but pseudo sacs are definitely a thing.\n\nI would say the best indication of ectopics are the hcg patterns, actually. And of course, scans to see if there is a mass in your tube. No, I went at 4 weeks 5 days and they found the sac in the uterus, an ectopic is when it is outside of the uterus?", "3rd ectopic pregnancy, given Methotrexate last week, Dr wants to remove my remaining good tube if this 2nd dose of Methotrexate I was given last night doesnt work am currently going through my 3rd ectopic pregnancy and had a MC last year. In 2012, I had my first ectopic (did not even know I was pregnant) and my left fallopian tube ended up rupturing and I had to have emergency surgery and lost that tube. Last year, Feb 2020, I had my 2nd ectopic but caught it early because I track everything and my husband and I have been actively TTC for the past 2 years but know we have to be careful and track everything with my history. I was given 1 dose of Methotrexate last year and since my beta HCG levels were only around 300 it worked. I did have to follow a strict low folic acid diet . Last month I found out I was pregnant but it was too early to see anything on an ultrasound and my levels were only around 550. The next week, the found a mass on my right ovary adjacent to my tube but they could not tell if it was a cyst or the location of the ectopic and my levels were rising appropriately. Two weeks later, I thought I was miscarrying because I was bleeding heavily and cramping and my levels had dropped by 50% but after doing an ultrasound, my dr found that the mass ending up growing 1 cm so I was given methotrexate last Wednesday. My levels dropped from day 1 to 4 but went from 387 to 549 on days 4 to 7 so I was given a second round of methotrexate last night. I am praying this round works because my dr said that if it doesnt, I have to have surgery to completely remove my right tube which is the only one I have. I am not mentally prepared to handle that. Not being able to conceive on my own is slowly destroying me. I am severely struggling mentally this time around. I did not think I even had a blockage in my right tube because I just did an HSG test last year and the dye flowed through my right tube and no blockages were present. My Dr said that she cannot remove the ectopic in my right tube without damaging the tube so she would just have to completely remove it. I am so confused because the ectopic is not in my tube according to the ultrasound. It is on my ovary, next to my tube. Does anyone happen to know if it is possible to remove the ectopic without damaging the tube? I honestly do not have a lot of faith in this dr as she is young and just finished her residency last year and has only had 2 patients with ectopic pregnancies (I didnt ask for details on how those ectopics were handled, even though I probably should have) and I dont have a lot of trust in her as I just started seeing her last month. I am so sorry for the long post, I am just hurting, confused, terrified, and anxious. I am praying this dose works and we do not have to remove my last good tube. If anyone has had a similar experience, any knowledge is greatly appreciated! I would definitely seek a second opinion given how important having biological children without intervention is to you. I would be extremely uncomfortable having someone perform a surgery of that magnitude and making a life-altering decision like that without having the proper knowledge or background. Thank you. I think that is the part that is most frustrating is that I ask tons of questions and am never really given a straight forward answer. I am actively looking for another dr for a second opinion but I live in such a small town, it is a task trying to find a reputable OB and I am short on time. We know that IVF is our next step and only option as it has become too dangerous to try to conceive on our own and my husband values my life, probably more than I do my own at this point. There is a fertility specialist we have in mind to try to see about 2 hours away, we are just currently trying to get our finances together and save up because we know it is going to be very expensive.  Hey! \nSo I have had 4 ectopics.  I also had a clear hsg after my first one and still had 3 more so I get how frustrating that can be.\n\nMy first two were treated with mtx and my 3rd they took my left tube. During that surgery they checked my right tube and it was deemed patent. After that surgery my RE basically told me I had two choices.\n\nA) try again naturally and I would have a 50/50 chance of an ectopic.\n\nB) remove the remaining tube and do ivf as removing the tube before doing ivf treatments would prevent me from having an ectopic when doing ivf. \n\nI chose to try once more naturally which resulted in another ectopic. I took the tube out and am now waiting to do ivf in the next couple months. If you have any specific questions about anything - do not hesitate to ask. Hello! I am terribly sorry that you had to endure that. I have never met anyone that has had as many as us. I did know one person personally that an ectopic but her next pregnancy was perfectly normal, thankfully. She said that she understood how I felt but I dont truly think she did understand.\n\nI go for my day 4 beta hcg level test on Saturday and if my levels do not drop to my Drs satisfaction, she is doing surgery to remove that tube asap. It would just  make everything so final. She actually wanted to do the surgery yesterday but I begged her to let me take a second round of methotrexate to buy myself some time. I am praying they drop but I am trying to come to terms with the fact that I need to have it removed anyway. My husband and I had already talked about getting it ligated and trying IVF, I just didnt expect to have it done so soon. I honestly did not know that you could still have an ectopic while doing IVF. I hate that you had to go through all this too but I am wishing you all the best of luck with IVF!! Your words made me feel not so alone, so I greatly appreciate your response. How long is the recovery process after having a tube removed? Sent you a message! \ud83d\udc96", "Possible Pregnancy Post Ectopic So my wife had an ectopic in May of 2020. We have experienced numerous rounds of fertility treatments since then and actually took a few months off of treatments. \n\nThe start of her last period was March 29, she ovulated April 14-15. \n\nBased on her tracking, she should have started a meeting cycle on Tuesday (April, 27), so she is two days late. \n\nShe tested positive on multiple at home tests; however they have appeared very faint. She had a Quantitative HCG test done at noon and the results just came back at a level of 117 m/ml. \n\nWe are waiting on interpretation but based on the chart they gave us in the report it seems like that level is very low within the expected range. Unless I am reading it wrong. Do any of you have any information on this? \n\nGiven our history we are obviously very cautious and worried while also trying to remain positive and hopeful. Even low in the expected range is a good sign. Did they schedule you for more beta HCG draws? Really, that is what will give you the most info. If it is doubling every 48 hours, that is what you would see with a \u201ctypical\u201d pregnancy. I would remain positive and optimistic until someone tells you otherwise. Congratulations to the both of you. Yes, we are scheduled for Saturday and Monday as well. And thank you. \n\nI was so conflicted posting on here as I know the heartache and struggle associated with ectopic loss and other miscarriages. And I know the pain of even people you do not know potentially being pregnant adding to the hurt. \n\nI never want to be insensitive. Everyone here has been through an ectopic. We all understand that heartache and the hope and anxieties that come afterwards. There are a couple other subreddits that deal a lot with pregnancy after loss and the trials and tribulations that come with that. r/pregnancyafterloss is one I am a part of currently. Very good advice and better suited for these types of questions without the risk of hurting anyone cause they are simply there to answer questions and celebrate with you.

The important thing is doubling time. Many people start with low hcg with the first draw and go on to have perfectly healthy pregnancies. \n\nI know it is scary. Once you get your repeat betas you will have some reassurance. And ask your doctor for an early scan. \ud83d\udc95 just monitor for signs and symptoms and go get checked out if you are concerned at any point. \n\nCongratulations and I am sending good vibes your way!

I feel crazy for even having the thought but I got a Mirena put in back in October. I had a little bit of side effect problems to begin with, excruciating stomach pains and nonstop bleeding, but I thought those had since gone away. Back about 6 weeks ago my breasts got super swollen and grew a complete size, I thought it was normal because it was about two weeks before my period. My period did start but it was super light and has not stopped for the last three weeks. Yesterday I got incredibly dizzy and nauseous quite a few times and I decided to finally do a little looking into my symptoms. Should I be concerned and go see a doctor?

Naturally I was upset so I looked to my family for validation and comfort. Let me add that because of my loss I have been officially been diagnosed with PTSD.  \n\nHere is the important part. \n\nI went to family for validation and comfort. I did not get it from her, my brother sister or sister in law. They blew me off but my mom said the most poisonous things. The person I trust the most in the world. To quote my mother when I needed her the most \u201cIt was nothing but a dead embryo That is all it was.\u201d She also said that because it was stuck in my Fallopian tube that it was not a real baby. Furthermore, it was dead when they cut it out of me. Other gems were \u201cI lost both my parents and husband ( um he was my dad too. I also lost him ) and that is real loss. She reiterated that she is experienced real loss as if I have not. Some of her offensive statements include \u201cAnd how long has it been now?\u201d \u201cGet over it already.\u201d \u201cI am too old to deal with this. I just cannot.\u201d She was yelling and pointing her finger in my face at this point. Let me make it clear that I never contacted him. I just googled searched as she asked to see a pic of him so she would not run into him while shopping for paint.\n\nYesterday was very hard for me as I am sure it was for you too. I was especially hurt because it was brought to my attention my ex has been teaching these weird sermons (???) about me and my ectopic pregnancy in a religious blog he writes his sermons in. He speaks to and preaches to teenagers and young adults in a local church. Me stealing his virginity and having this life threatening pregnancy is used as a cautionary tale to them to abstain from it and was the \u2018best thing that ever happened\u2019 to him because \u2018God was not letting him settle for the lesser than the greater\u2019 god has in store for him. The prudent wife he is waiting for.\n\nHe quoted this verse: \u201cI am the true vine, and my father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bares no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be ever fruitful.\u201d \n\nWhen I read what he said about me and the lies he was spreading and backing up with bible verses online and to his youth group ( he keeps and writes his speeches online ) I felt a burning in my chest went numb. This is coming from a man ( and I use this term loosely ) who would verbally abuse me and refused to let me out of his apartment until he kicked me out.\n\nThe title of my ectopic pregnancy on this blog is called \u2018Sin and Regret.\u2019 If you guys are interested I may post it here.\n\nI wish I had my family to support me. I see my therapist tomorrow. Hopefully I can have peace in my mind, body heart and soul. Thanks for reading. I am sitting outside the OT reading this while my wife is getting her tubes removed.

My heart goes out to you and your wife. She is lucky to have you by her side. You have each other and I know you will get through this together. I am so sorry. It matters.

I can feel you, the most difficult part of the ectopic is no one understands what tou have been through, people, ptsd and stuff it is horrible, what I have learned from my journey is your loss is your loss it does not matter what others think.

I know I am not constipated since I have been able to successfully go, but I have this persistent urge. It makes me worry because this the same kind of feeling I had before I found out I had an ectopic pregnancy. Has anyone else experienced something similar?

This is such great news! I think the worry is totally understandable, I would feel the same way that you are.

They did the usual bloodwork for hCG (3,900 at the time) and ultrasounds and the OB doctor on call said it was an ectopic and that we would do surgery first thing in the morning. After surgery the doctor said that he did not find an ectopic pregnancy or a pregnancy at all for that matter. I was coming out of anesthesia and did not ask very many questions because I was drugged up. How is this possible? This happened to me as well, though my HCG was only at 186. My right tube was removed but the analysis of the tube did not have any fetal tissue. However, my tube was extremely scarred up due to scarring from a ruptured appendix I had as a kid, and they probably did not take all of the tube as it was hard fo tell what was tube and what was not. I ended up needing a shot of methotrexate afterward and that ended the pregnancy. I am so sorry, this whole experience is terrible, and to not have answers on top of it all sucks. Oh wow! So did they find where the fetus was in the first place? That is where I am confused the most. Like if you are in there looking around, how do you not see it? There is a chance it could be in the abdominal cavity or the ovary or cervix\u2026in my case it was probably too small to really pinpoint. Will you be getting a shot of methotrexate? They checked everything (ovaries, uterus, Fallopian tubes) with a camera when they did the surgery. Not sure about the Methotrexate. I go in for a follow up on Thursday and maybe he will recommend it then?", "I had my surgery June 6th but have yet to restart my period and my stomach is still incredibly bloated from the anesthesia as well as my breasts looking exactly as they did while pregnant. My tube was removed rather than having the shot. Should I be worried that I have not started yet?  Did you bleed after surgery? I had surgery the 20th of June, was told could bleed for a few weeks then to expect period anywhere between 2-6weeks if that helps. Bloating starting to go down. I have noticed now that all pregnancy symptoms had gone this week too. Maybe if concerned call the hospital, you could always have a blood test to see what your hormone levels are up to :) Yes I bled for about a week after surgery Did your doctor check your hcg levels? It took me approx 5 weeks with both surgeries for my hcg to get to 0 and get a period.", "Symptoms after an ectopic? Do I need to go back to ER? Hi!!! So I got diagnosed with an ectopic September fourth and it is now sept 16. So my last normal period was the beginning of last month. (I have never kept track of my periods because they were always normal and I knew around what time I would get them) Then this month I thought I had just started my period but it was lasting two weeks which is really odd so I went to my gyno to see what was up and get on birth control. They did a PAP and asked me some other questions but then also told me I was positive for a pregnancy test. \ud83d\ude10 Mind you, the boyfriend and I are not ready for a child at all financially. Not saying we do not want kids someday because I do but just not right now. So I went home freaking the hell out and called my mom (duh!!) and the boyfriend and I talked about it too. We told his mom as well. So fast forward I had to get the methotrexate shot and all the doctors told me was no folic acid (leafy greens) and a clear liquids diet for the next few hours after I got out of the ER. I felt totally fine after the first shot and even went back to work and was completely fine. Got a call when I was at work recently and they said my HCG level is at 620 so I am going to have to go back to the ER for a second shot and the first night after the second shot I felt like shit. Abdominal pain, pain when I use the restroom, crampy upset stomach, diarrhea off and on. Sorry TMI but I am just wondering if I should go back to the ER or if anyone else has had these side affects after getting the shot. Also the doctor just told me I was good to go after I got the second shot. No directions or anything and not even on the paper work when I got released. Only thing was to follow up with my gyno in 2-3 days. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks in advance!!! \ud83d\ude42 \n\nAlso just throwing this out there, this is my first time dealing with this. I have also been reading other posts about this topic and I am glad I am not the only one!!

My wife and I have an ectopic pregnancy. She received her first and hopefully last methotrexate shot yesterday afternoon. She feels really shitty mainly with nausea.  I had her doctor call in zofran for it and it helps but I am just wondering if you guys can help me make this whole process easier on my wife. What can we do to help with the side effects? How long does this usually last? What does it feel like? Anything helps. Thanks! I felt the same way for about a week after my second shot. I lived off of lots of water, crackers, and soup. I was not able to stomach anything. Good luck to her and you during this time. Thank you so much for responding! She is doing better today!", "Breast pain after ectopic I got the thrilling news this morning that after 6 weeks and 3 rounds of methotrexate, my bloodwork finally came back with a negative test results for HCG. \n\nI would love to think that we can put this behind us at this point, but this morning my breast tenderness has returned - it had pretty much subsided over the last week. I also have been having slight pain on my right side over the past 2 days (ectopic was in my right tube).\n\nCan anyone share if they had a similar experience following hcg reaching 0? I am just so anxious about everything going on in my body, and anxious about getting pregnant again (though we have been very cautious \u2014 triple covered with condom/phexxi/withdrawal).

I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday to  go pee and then go soothe my 15 month old daughter and I experienced the worst pain I ever had in my life!  Left shoulder, chest pain, and severe abdominal pain, I could not even pick up my daughter to soothe her It was terrible. Even worse my husband just had an emergency appendix surgery five days prior so he could not even help.  \n\nOnce I  got to the hospital I had a bunch of tests done, once they came back they told me I was pregnant I felt excited and scared because we never really talked much about when to try again. But I was also confused to why, I just had a period, and why I was still bleeding plus we used protection except that one time. Things did not add up in my head. So some further testing they seen it was an ectopic pregnancy and my fallopian tube has ruptured. I cannot explain the mixed emotions I experienced, going from such a high to a low in a matter of an hour sucked. I have not cried that much in years.\n\nThe nurses were so supportive, but I was still so alone, especially with covid,my local hospital has no visitation so I was even more alone.  Once the gynecologist came in to talk about options I  was even more lost in my emotions. My opinions were surgery well who is going to pick up my daughter and help her because my husband cant! or the methotrexate shot. So I took the shot. \n\nI have to do blood work 3 times after receiving it, first one no change, the second my HCG has increased  by double, and I go for my third Tuesday, So far its not looking good. looks like surgery is in my future. I  think the worst of all this is I am pregnant  but actually I am not! I am trying to be strong but its hard, not only did I lose a baby I lost part of me to potentially produce another opportunity for another. \n\nSorry I just needed someone to read my story, I feel like people do not understand what I am going through. Sorry my grammar and spelling sucks, I do not really need a troll right now. \n\nThanks for listening xoxo I am sorry for your pain and loss. It really is a horrible situation to be in. I can understand wanting to feel that excitement and also attachment but knowing it is not going to end favorably is very difficult. I can understand it would be difficult to process and try and make clear decisions during this heavy situation. \n\nBe kind to yourself as it is going to take time to heal.  \n\nI  am available to talk via private message if you would like to. \n\nDo not worry about your spelling and grammar. No one is judging that.

Hello everyone. I recently found out that I am pregnant. Me (20) and my boyfriend (21) are not ready for kids so I booked an abortion. During the ultrasound they could not find anything and after my first blood test ny hcg levels are super low so they suspect ectopical. Me and my boyfriend have still be having sex normally and unprotected as I did not think it mattered rn since I was already pregnant. Now that I know it is a possible ectopic pregnancy is it possible that I can get pregnant while still carrying the ectopic one? Do not think so. Once the egg implants and the hCG is getting into your bloodstream the cervix closes up. No you cannot get pregnant. But you should not be having sex if you are having a suspected ectopic. You can rupture your tube if it is ectopic by having sex or orgasming. Like other posters said - you cannot get pregnant while already pregnant but an ectopic pregnancy is a serious medical issue and having sex puts you at risk of rupturing which can be fatal to you and your future fertility. Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of maternal death in the first trimester. Not to scare you but please stop having sex, heavy lifting etc until this is confirmed and/or resolved. Thank you for your response. After a buncha tests and ultrasounds we found that I have a regular pregnancy but I was extremely early wen I got my first ultrasound so they could not see any sack yet.", "GAS PAIN I had a salpingostomy and removal of a cyst last night.  I am so so so sore, but even more so, the gas pains can be near unbearable.  What did you do to manage the gas pains?\n\nI was screaming and crying from the pain earlier.  Anytime I would breathe, it would radiate a little further across my chest and shoulders, down my arms and back and side.  It was unbearable for about 2-3 minutes and then it stopped.  I have been taking TUMS and it seems to get things moving a little.\n\nAt what time in recovery were you able to walk? sounds like the gas was causing diaphragm spasms, I had this same pain when I had internal bleeding and the MD said the blood was aggravating the nerve that innervates the diaphragm. \nUpdate on how you are doing now? Completely healed and healthy now!", "2nd Ectopic Emergency Surgery My husband and I have been TTC since July 2020, I finally got a positive test on March 23rd and we were elated! We had an unexpected ectopic pregnancy 6 years ago while I was on progestin only BC and was told the reason it happened was due to the BC. I had to have emergency surgery for that ectopic, it was in my left tube and they were able to save my tube. I recovered fine physically and emotionally because that baby was not planned and we were not in a place to care for a baby at the time. \n\nThis pregnancy was planned and wanted, due to my history my doctor had been monitoring my hCG and I had an early ultrasound scheduled for 4/5. Everything seemed to be fine but then I had severe pain on my right side and lower back like the last ectopic and ended up in the ER on 4/5 and had to have emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy in my right tube. During the surgery my OB also removed blockage from my left tube that was from the last surgery and did a dye test to see if my tubes were blocked and it seems both of them are blocked. My OB recommends having both my tubes removed and using IVF moving forward. \n\nI am absolutely gutted. I will start to feel okay but then I will feel so sad and feel like not only was a pregnancy taken from me but also my fertility. I also feel extremely frustrated, the chances of having ectopics it is so low and I have now had one in each tube and I do not have any answers as to why. I have to go back to work on Monday and I just do not know how I am going to face work or even my friends. I feel extremely alone and the only person I feel comfortable around is my husband. \n\nHas anyone had 2 ectopics and ever gotten an answer as to why or know what questions to ask my OB at my follow up? Has anyone had success getting pregnant naturally after 2 ectopics? I am so so sorry. \nYou can link to my profile and my story is there. But I have had 4 of them and just got my final tube removed in January.\nIt is honestly fucking devastating losing your ability to conceive naturally. I did not have any blockages or any reason for my ectopics that they could find, unfortunately. I had an hsg after my first one and checked my right tube when taking my left and everything was normal. \n\nIf your tubes are blocked it is really a personal decision and a decision to make with your doctor and husband. \ud83d\udc9c you are definitely at a high risk to have more and taking the tubes before ivf would be eliminating the possibility of an ectopic through ivf. \nWe kept trying naturally despite the high risk because we were told my tubes appeared to be open so we just kept trying until we could not. I had to feel I did all I could. Had they told me my tubes were blocked I may have personally made a different decision and moved on to ivf but who knows.\n\nAsk your gyne or women\u2019s health unit if they have a specialized psychologist for women\u2019s health issues. You may benefit from having someone to talk to (it helped me a lot)\n\nI took a min of 6 weeks off with each of mine so if you feel you cannot be at work, take care of yourself and if you can take the time you need. Be gentle with yourself. You have been through a traumatic terrible thing.\n\nI am so sorry \ud83d\udc9c sending so much love and so many apologies from an internet stranger", "Should I be concerned? I am 7 weeks pregnant and am getting lower abdominal pain on the right side. On and off and sometimes sharp. Have also had pale pink discharge on and off over the last day or so. My breasts are still sore, but do not have other pregnancy symptoms. Have an appointment with GP tomorrow so not too stressed, but wondered based on others experiences if I should be concerned? So, my experience with my ectopic was having sharp cramping on one side, sometimes the pain would spread outward to the rest of the stomach. I had shoulder pain that was on one side, that was because my tube was so dilated that I had internal bleeding that was irritating the nerves. I felt a lot of really normal pregnancy symptoms, I had nausea, cravings, mood swings (I am bipolar though, so that is pretty normal for me). I had sore breasts that grew a cup size in the time I was pregnant, which was only 6 weeks. By the time I hit 6 weeks, they realized it was ectopic and ended it at 3pm that day. By 11pm the same day, I was driving myself to the emergency room with pain so bad I was throwing up. My 5am the next morning, I had surgery and my tube had ruptured by the time I made it to surgery. I lost my child, and my fallopian tube. I do not say this to scare you, but please, please have your doctor keep a close eye on you. If I had not pushed for further monitoring, I may have ended up in a completely different situation. I had the same light pink bleeding 2 days before my tubal rupture. In your case, it may just be some residual implantation bleeding, but please be very cautious. Bed rest may be the best thing you can do for yourself if you can. Whether ectopic or not, any bleeding should not be taken lightly. \nHope this helps, stay safe and let us know how things go \u2665\ufe0f I am sorry you are feeling concerned. Have you had hcg checked? My symptoms were very mild. I had a slight ache on my left side. Not even enough to be called cramps. And I had bleeding at 5 weeks. Very light for 2 days: barely even spotting. Then it stopped and started 2 days later heavier like a period but no clotting or tissue. When I went to hospital they scanned and found it to be ectopic. My ectopic pregnancy ended by itself but I was closely monitored by the hospital. If you have any concerns you must advocate for yourself to be checked over. My GP was going to send me away saying it could be 'just' an early miscarriage and there was nothing anyone could do. It could have gone much worse for me. So definitely bring it up and get checked out. But I had pain like that with my healthy pregnancy that turned out to be a burst cyst. My pain when I had my ectopic was a sharp pain (on the opposite side of my ectopic, not sure why that was) that would radiate down my hip flexor and it would go away when I rested.\n\nI hope everything goes well for you tomorrow. How did you make out at the doctor \ud83d\udc95 Thanks so much for all the comments. So, I told the GP my symptoms and ended up going to ED to rule out ectopic. Had bloods and ultrasound which ruled out ectopic, which was positive. Unfortunately fetus was measuring 5 weeks (instead of 7 weeks) with a low heart rate of 49bpm. Going to have another scan in 10 days, but not feeling positive given I have lost most pregnancy symptoms too. Had a miscarriage in November and almost just waiting for it to happen again.

It is been a whirlwind of physical and emotional pain. But I have some maybe dumb questions:\n\nWhen on earth can I lay on my side? I am only one day after my operation, so everything still hurts like a motherfucker, I just do not known if I am making it worse by trying to move more or if I am \"engaging my muscles\" like the doctor said I should to help the healing process. I am so sorry! I had to sleep on my back with my back propped up and pillows under my knees for a while after surgery. Do not try to lay in your side if it is painful or not comfortable. Every time I pushed myself after surgery I was in a ton more pain. Go easy on yourself. I hope your recovery goes smoothly! I could not sleep on my side for about 5 days post op. I slept on my back with a pillow on my stomach and used that to help me turn in the bed and get up. I had a mini meltdown one day bc I hate sleeping on my back and could not get comfortable- the hormonal changes are crazy too. Just be easy on yourself these first few days, walk around the house to get rid of the gas bubbles from surgery. I hope you start feeling better soon, and I am so sorry this happened to you too. Sleep with pillows propped around you and be sure to take the pain medication on time\nTo stay ahead of the pain.\n\nI personally slept on my side after my surgery but it was more comfortable for me than my back so everyone is different. I just held a body pillow to my stomach. If you are moving around and using your abs - holding a small lumbar pillow hard against your stomach will help. \n\nMoving around is so important after surgery but do not over do it. Move around once every hour at least and do deep breathing exercises to prevent pneumonia and other complications. If you are bloated from the gas - try peppermint tea and gas pills. They saved me after my surgeries. The gas pills are such a goddamn relief. Thank you for all the advice! You are very welcome! \nAdd the peppermint tea with it and it will be like omfg \ud83d\ude06 I am one day post op too!! Having a bolster on my side to put my leg over really helped, I was able to lay my weight on it when I slept on my side because I am the type to always have to sleep on my side.

Curious to know, I am currently at 365 but I know I am not in the clear for rupture even if it is considered low\u2026 Did you get two HCG draws? I had my MTX shot on Sunday and was at 345 and now I am at 365 How many weeks since you are last period? \n\nMine creeped like that which is a red flag (instead of doubling or dropping) but they thought it was still a womb pregnancy since they saw a blood clot in my uterus. It was indeed an ectopic and it ruptured at 6 weeks I believe. I had surgery at 7 weeks for it \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd2a I am not sure what my HCG was but definitely be an advocate for your health! Mine ruptured right before I went into surgery to remove it. It was in the 1000s. I was 5 weeks pregnant exactly. I am so sorry you even have to ask this. Mine was 4,500. Tube ruptured the morning after that result. 750 night before my surgery. Mine was 3400 a few days before I ruptured. I would have been about 7 weeks. Mine was 900 when I got methotrexate.

I have been taking it easy and having mostly chilled days but I do get out and about going to the post office etc and taking my child to school 18,000 eroded but not ruptured, had emergency surgery. Mine was 90, which feels shockingly low. I had had what seemed for all the world like a normal period like a week earlier, so I just thought I would had a chemical pregnancy and no idea I was still pregnant. Omg that must have been so scary.. im sorry you had to go through that Yes, it caught me totally off guard!! Thanks :)  Fortunately it all ended up relatively okay in the end. I wish you the best! If you do the HSG, I hope your experience is fairly pain-free! Interesting to see the responses! I was at 16,000 and got the methotrexate last week. No rupture. Now in the waiting game. I had really low hcg when I got surgery. It went between 170 and 270 for a week. I was at 9 weeks when I first found out I was pregnant. And 11 when I finally got my surgery. Tried MTX but it failed and when they did the surgery they discovered my tube had already burst. Im super glad I had the surgery as I honestly do not remember having any pain before the surgery and I had been bleeding for over a month so I had no clue I was pregnant. I was very inactive at the time of mine and it ruptured and I had no clue. I was at 383 HCG when my tube tore and I had emergency surgery. I was around 6w pregnant when it was diagnosed at 2,400 HCG. When it ruptured, I was 4 weeks out from my methotrexate shot that was working well. Doctor was stumped why it ruptured this far out from treatment (the risk gets lower further out from treatment) but has a theory that has more to do with a complication with the pregnancy tissue breaking down and bleeding/inflammation being the culprit for the tear. I was extremely careful the whole month after diagnosis: no exercise, no sex; I took it really easy and rested a lot. I am 6 days post laparoscopic surgery that removed my left tube. Curious how things are going now. In the same boat, cannot find much info on this particular topic. So the methotrexate was working for me, but as the pregnancy was shrinking, about a week and a half after the mtx, it caused a major bleed. I lost a ton of blood and had to get emergency surgery. Apparently there is always a risk of that happening when you get it, I did not really understand that. I hope this does not freak you out, from what I understand it had nothing to do with my HCG levels! How did you know you were bleeding? Was it vaginal? Like soaking pads one an hour? Or did you feel anything that indicated the bleeding? I am bleeding now, but it seems to be a normal amount..sorry if I am being annoying..just so curious No worries, I am happy to share my experience if it helps other ppl who are going through it! \n\nSo for me, I actually did not have any vaginal bleeding. I only had a little brown spotting. I do not want to generalize from my experience, but like, I \\*knew\\*. I had this weird, deep pain in my left side where the ectopic was and I got really nauseous, dizzy, sweaty, and super pale. I knew something major was happening in my body and it was the most uncomfortable I have ever felt. I literally could not wait until surgery so I could be knocked out. Thankfully I am a nurse and I happened to be at work, so I got brought right down to the ED and got things going. \n\nI have heard that when it ruptures it will be pain that gets progressively worse as blood begins to accumulate. I had some cramping in the days before that was normal and nothing like the pain when it actually ruptures. But I want to make sure I say that I am **NOT** a doctor nor an expert on ectopic pregnancies so you should definitely talk to your provider if you have any concerns that you might be rupturing! I am definitely not looking for \"medical advice\" so do not worry about that. I am just curious how things went for you, as a comparison that is all. Unfortunately for me, I am not having a lot of luck in terms of getting actual medical advice. All answers are wishy-washy. I am not having pain, just moderate bleeding, and clotting. Wish i knew what was normal and what was not as far as that goes... I have had 2 doses of methotrexate. Last one was 10 days ago. \n   No one explained to me that is i could still rupture, even if my levels are decreasing. I started in the low 6,000s. And now im in the 3,700 range..no clue if that is a good sign or not.. because again, I can not get a solid answer from any health professionals. Its the mental game that is messing with me.", "Personal experiences with ectopic ", "When could you exercise again? I ruptured 6 weeks ago. 5 weeks ago I had surgery to remove my ovary and tube.

I did not go with her to her appointment because of the COVID situation, but she called me a few hours later, and said they could not proceed with the surgery because we had a suprise pregnancy. As much as we love eachother we are not financially ready to have a child, and we both came to the conclusion to take a trip to Planned Parenthood. We got our appointment at PP, two hours later she came back out visibly upset and told me they took two ultrasounds, a pregnancy test, and determined it was an ectopic pregnancy. I have been doing my research to help console her because shes a very anxious person, and this is something to definetly be anxious about.\n\nMy questions are; is it possible for the ultrasound to not detect anything? Shes 4 weeks pregnant with an HgC level of 88, and it seems odd that nothing could be traced what so ever. \n\nWhat are some more noticeable symptoms, and if you have any good tips to help ease the burden on her physically or mentally I would love that advice very much because I hate that she has to go through it alone.\n\nI understand it is a very serious situation, and in no way do I want to make light of what all of you have or are going through I am trying to grasp the situation myself so I can be there for her and help her in anyway. It is hard for me to help because I did not even know this was an outcome, and I dont have to go through the stress that is child birth, but like I said I really want to have ways to help her cope.\n\nThank you everyone sorry it is long I am just at a loss right now and I would appreciate any feedback I can get Her hgc level is kind of low...maybe she is having a miscarriage?

I had this happen 2 years ago. Just lots of rest, gentle walks, and patience. There is not just a physical component there is also a mental and emotional one. We lit a candle for our little one we lost even though it was only 6 weeks along. A loss is a loss. \n\nIt is going to take a while to feel better even if the surgery was laparoscopic \n\nBig hugs to both of you.", "Does this sound similar to anyone?21F w/ Mirena iud I am 21 with a Mirena Iud about 3 1/2 years in.  The last weekend of November was when I had heavy bleeding after intercourse with my partner. I brushed it off as it could have been from deep penetration which happens sometimes (it is the only time I bleed with the iud). Until about 3 weeks after, I had this small spot of pressure on my lower left abdomen that was uncomfortable when I pressed down it lasted a few days until I had a quick 10 min otp dr appt and she said it could be a cyst and told me to make an ultrasound appt. The week after I had cramping and random heavy bleeding with some dark discharge, i do not bleed at all with my iud so it was out of the ordinary. Along with dense sore breasts, frequent urinating, nausea and headaches (I very rarely get headaches). I only was able to eat a small amount of pho earlier and even right now I feel nauseous and wanting to throw it up. I took a pregnancy test 4weeks after sex, negative. I waited until 6 weeks after sex for another test, negative. I know ectopic preg. can sometimes have very low hcg levels. I have an ultrasound appt next week and I am not sure if I should ask them to check or if the negative tests are proof enough. I was wondering if anyone had experienced anything similar?", "Light Bleeding I posted recently, prior to my wife\u2019s second HCG test. She has since had 2 more and they have each doubled (and then some) as hoped. \n\nHowever, as previously stated, she had an ectopic in May of 2020. Now, she just called and said she had light bleeding when she went to the restroom. \n\nThe first day of her last period was March 12 and ovulation April 14-15. \n\nShe currently has no pain; however, with our past experience this is obviously nerve wracking. We are t trying to stay calm and optimistic. Obviously she will continue to monitor it; however, I was curious if any of you had any insight into if this type of bleeding is normal? I believe we are past the timeline for implantation bleeding, but I could be wrong. What is her hcg now if you do not mind me asking? Initial test (2 days after missed period) was 117.\n\nSecond test was Saturday and approximately 310. \n\nThird and final test (to date) was yesterday at 728. I would head into see someone with any bleeding even without pain! Based on history it is just better to be safe than sorry \ud83d\udc9c you are definitely long past implantation, though. Yeah, that is what I assumed. \n\nAnd we have been in contact with the Dr. and based on her numbers, they are not expecting to be able to see anything until at least Friday. \n\nShe is having another HCG done tomorrow evening with results likely available Thursday morning to have more data before the ultrasound Friday. Fingers crossed and so many good thoughts and vibes sent your guys\u2019 way \ud83d\udc96 So , what is the update ? Unfortunately it was a second ectopic. Due to having been through it before we were very in tune to her body and how things were progressing and very aggressive with monitoring.\n\nLong story short. After a bad experience in the ER in which they sent us home. The very next day out Reproductive Endocrinologist found the ectopic in her one good tube. Resulting in methotrexate treatment.\n\nGlad we avoided surgery, obviously devastated with the outcome. Based on her history the most likely result is a birth defect that has impacted the function of the cilia within the fallopian tube. Therefore from here on out IVF is our only option.\n\nWe know it does not completely Eliminate the possibility of another ectopic, but hoping it is successful.\n\nBeen a very hard few weeks considering it coincided with the one year anniversary of our first ectopic.", "Worried about another ectopic Hi guys. So I suffered an ectopic pregnancy this last February which resulted in the loss of my right tube. My OB said she cleared out the left during surgery. \n\nI recently found out I am pregnant and I am about 5 weeks. My current hcg is 4500 and they have been doubling, but today at my first US appt she said she really could not see anything and to come back this Friday. Has this ever happened to anyone and gone on to have a healthy baby? \n\nThank you Not yet had a chance to re-try. However, try not to worry too much - there is very little (if anything) that can be seen even on an Transvaginal US at 5 weeks. In the UK the earliest to check for an ectopic and placement is 6w for this reason. With my daughter I had an ultrasound at 5 weeks and they saw what was described as 'the tiniest sac ever, if it even is a sac'. And the technician had to really search for it. I made another appointment for a week later and there was much more to see. \n\n5 weeks is really early to see anything. Your numbers sound good though. I hope you get to see a little jelly bean in your uterus at your next scan. Update:\n\nAfter posting this, I was sent to radiology to have another US done! The results showed a gestational sac with a yolk inside!! Thank you for the responses they were very reassuring :) Congratulations!! I hope you have an easy pregnancy, great delivery, and a very healthy baby!", "The pain I have a call into a gynecologist but we just moved and I am not established with anyone yet. Sooooo just waiting right now but fortunately an ectopic pregnancy is not the most likely explanation for me.\n\nDid you have mild pain before the sharp/severe pain listed as a symptom of an ectopic pregnancy? So you think it may be possible? Have you got any symptoms?\n\nEctopic symptoms vary from person to person. My first ectopic, just spotting. I was sidelined three times by medical professionals because I did not have pain. Second ectopic, some mild pain along with spotting on the right side but that was either the ectopic or due to a mildly inflamed appendix (which they found on removal of the tube). Some people have very few symptoms, some have none and some have lots. I think that I have to say it is possible but not likely. I had a tubal ligation in 2012, so if I knew I were pregnant it would mean a greater chance of any given pregnancy would be tubal but as far as I know I am not pregnant. I am experiencing abnormal bleeding, mild abdominal pain, some mild dizziness and lightheadedness earlier that has mostly subsided, moderate back pain, mood swings. No fever. I guess that could be a number of things. But I cannot really rule out ectopic since it can be just mild pain.\n\nETA: now that it is day I can probably just go get a pregnancy test to feel more confident about ruling it out. Ectopic pregnancies can also give a false negative pregnancy test result. So keep that in mind too, if you have been sexually active. I had mild sharp pain on my right side that felt just like my ovulating cramps which I thought was weird but I also knew being pregnant you would have aches and pains so I did not do anything about it. It was my first pregnancy so I thought that was normal. It was not until my tube ruptured that I had severe pain with vomiting and diarrhea, shortness of breath, sweating, bloating, dizziness, loss of hearing and vision, and high blood sugar of 353. Like false negative urine tests at home ? Or you mean the beta hcg blood test? Negative urine tests. I do not know either way about blood tests. Did the doctors tell you how many weeks along you were before the tube ruptured? I am very sorry you had to go through this. The doctor told me that based on the ultrasound in the ER that the baby would have been due March 19th but according to my period I was due March 7, 2018. They said it is possible that the baby was smaller because it was growing in a tiny space. I believe that the March 7th would have been accurate had it not been ectopic. So you found at 7 week pregnancy? No, I knew I was pregnant when I was 4 weeks and 6 days along. I knew that I was pregnant for exactly 3 weeks before I went in for my emergency surgery. I just did not know that it was ectopic until my tube ruptured.", "Emergency surgery due to ectopic rupture and insurance. I had to have emergency surgery to remove my ectopic pregnancy and my left tube. I had already been treated with methotrexate and unfortunately it did not work. As all of us know this is scary and so stressful. Did anyone have problems with their insurance not covering the surgery? I have good insurance but I am still panicking at the total amount. Assuming you are in the US, it is emergency surgery to save your life, they will definitely cover it. For me, I had to pay my outrageously *huge* deductible which was devastating because it was still thousands of dollars that I was not anticipating having to pay at that time. However, the fact that my insurance paid for the other $80k I owed was indeed a huge relief, as you can imagine lol Thank you, I am in the US this made me feel much better. I was assuming I would hit my deductible or out of pocket max but that is way better than the whole thing. Thanks very much for your response! I am no insurance expert and know everyone is coverage is different, but I only had to pay around $300 for the ambulance ride.  I had to be taken to an out of network hospital because it was an emergency situation so I was worried I would be charged more, but my insurance covered it all (and it was a huge amount) without any problem. Fingers crossed for you! Yes, you will definitely max that deductible and OOP but the hospital will also let you organize a payment plan on the portion that you owe (if you wish or need), making it totally doable.\n\nI know it is hard not to, but try not to stress. Just focus on getting better for now :) Wishing you the best of luck and speediest of recoveries. \u2764\ufe0f", "Does precum around inner thigh cause ectopic pregnancy?

I expected to be able to TTC again in three months (that is what many sources say online) but my doctor wants me to wait six months. It seems like forever. At the hospital ER they only told me I would have to wait til my HCG was zero.\n\nDoes six months sound like a long time, or did your doctors recommend a similar waiting period?\n\nI do not want to have another ectopic, so I am scared to go against medical advice when it comes to TTC. Do you know how many doses you had? I had one dose and was told 3 months I only received one dose. My doctor is extremely cautious about my health and safety, but I may need to bring up the 3-month thing to her. 6 months seems like a crazy-long time. Yeah as far as I understand, three months is the amount of time it takes Mtx to leave your system (the Red Cross lists that you cannot give blood for three months after a dose of it). It could be that your doctor wants to make sure your periods have regulated properly before you try again? Worth asking for sure! I was told 3 months by my doctor. Has anyone found any scientific literature about 6 months, 3 months etc? I am scouring the internet for science and so far what I have found only shows negative effects to fetuses when methotrexate is administered *during* a pregnancy (which makes sense, that is kind of the point of methotrexate). ((\n\n(\n\nEdit: ( (at lower doses than for an ectopic) within 3 months of becoming pregnant showing that there was no increased incidence of miscarriage or fetal abnormalities.\n\nEdit: The are a few European studies ( (which is probably double what a typical prenatal vitamin has in the US) to achieve the optimal folate levels. Since folate depletion is the main reason to wait.... this could cut down the timeline considerably.\n\nIf you find more articles with same or different conclusions I would be so appreciative! I appreciate that you have attached scholarly articles here! My doctor gave no sources, just said 6 months. But everything I see online says 3. It really sucks because I ended up having my tube removed anyway so the methotrexate did not even work and that is why I have to wait to TTC\u2026 Ugh that is the worst of both worlds. If your HCG is zero it looks like the best thing to do is to get your folate levels up thru supplementation. That will give you the option to start trying as soon as you choose to. I like that option because it is something I can control, you know? I hate the thought of just idly waiting when I could be packing in the folate! My doc said 3 months \u2764\ufe0f \u2026 and that felt like an eternity to me since we have been trying 2 years now and three losses already.

So it is been 2 weeks since I got the injection and only needed one. My hcg has been lowering tremendously since I got it. I already went through the bloody cycle and gas pain. Seems like I have healed okay but now I feel like my digestive system is not like it use to be. I have constipation mostly everyday, my appetite is not there then it is. I will be hungry but then feel nauseous. I am not sleepy or anything it is just a digestive problem now. When I do go it is not a lot and it do not hurt but I know my body and it is just not the same like before. Is it because the methodoxate is still in my system? And it will take time?

Also, the Squatty Potty has changed my digestive life\u2026 I got it two years ago when I was constipated in pregnancy and it makes it so much easier to go. I have not tried colace.

This is my first pregnancy and I am unable to see my ob until nov 12, the only thing I have to go off of is my home tests, one with a faint line followed but a couple definite positives. I am already at a higher risk for having an ectopic, I have been having what feels like severe period cramps on my right side for weeks off and on which I assumed were just me getting ready to start but now that I have had a positive test I find it a bit more concerning.

If you are concerned it is ectopic I would err on the side of caution and go into the ER. I had hardly any symptoms until my rupture, but the one I had with only my ectopic pregnancy was intense cramping a week before my missed period. The only time I got shoulder pain was hours after my rupture and it felt like the most intense Charlie horse. It did not radiate down my arm but it was so intense it made my whole body sort of spasm. \n\nIf you are at a higher risk for ectopic you should be seen sooner than November. If your doctor will not see you find another one. I had to search around to find one who would monitor me right away when I got pregnant after the ectopic. Seriously, do not wait. Thank you! Pain that starts around the far edge of the shoulder where it meets the collarbone is a sign of life threatening internal bleeding. If this is your pain, go to the ER and explain you suspect an ectopic pregnancy and that you are experiencing Kehr\u2019s sign and need a pelvic ultrasound. Better safe than sorry.

Please get checked out. \nI had bleeding, severe abdominal pains and shoulder pain. I mean bent over crying in agony. I went to hospital at 5weeks 5days they could not scan until 6weeks. I went back and they told me it was ectopic. When they operated an hour after telling me, they found a litre of blood and wondered why I had not collapsed.

I had never heard of a link between appendicitis and ectopic pregnancy, and I am trying not to be despondent about my chances in the future. Thank you!

Not only was it statistically impossible, but it is started out entirely unlike my last two in every way (NO symptoms this time at all whatsoever) and began while my IUD was still in place, so I cannot help but worry a little.\n\nThanks for any insight! I was checking mine out of TTC habit in the beginning. Mine was medium and hard in the beginning (it is still pretty hard but high and I am at 9 weeks now.) Then I had a little spotting at about 5 weeks and my doctor told me that the cervix can be more sensitive due to increased blood flow and things like an exam or vaginal ultrasound, a self-exam, or sex can make it get a little irritated and bleed. She advised I stop checking because it changes throughout the day and everyone is different anyway, plus the stress of spotting for any reason after having a previous loss was not worth the trouble.

Can anyone offer advice I will probably go to the doctor tomorrow but I am very scared. I also am 21, my mom does not know I am sexually active and I am terrified. There are a few things it could probably be. If the bleeding was light, there is a chance it could be implantation bleeding, which happens when a fertilized egg implants into the uterus.\n\nI would also take a home pregnancy test if you have not already, however it might be too early for it to pick up HCG levels (HCG is the pregnancy hormone).\n\nWhen you go to the doctor, you can ask if they would do a blood draw which would be more sensitive to the HCG hormone. In a healthy pregnancy, this level doubles every 48 hours (part of the reason they caught my ectopic pregnancy is because my HCG remained very low and was not doubling as expected).\n\nI am sorry about your predicament re: telling your mom.

I was also diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy at 5 weeks 2 days in June this year and took methotextrate to bring my hcg levels down from 2100.

Hopefully this helps but everyone is experience is different. Hi I just had my shot on 7/31. I had bleeding that was like a regular period and felt some discomfort (dr said it was the shot targeting the tissue) and I did feel pretty nauseous.

I was pretty low to begin with.. highest I ever got was 203 and I think my body was taking care of it before I even got the shot bc my levels were 99 before the shot was given. Hope this helps and hope you feel better soon! This so horrible to go through!! Xo Thanks so much! I had mine two days ago (it will be three days in about 12 hours) and have had no bleeding or pain or anything. I am concerned that means it is not working. Did you doctor let you know when you can stop looking at folic acid in everything you eat and when you can start having a glass of wine again? Mine did not mention. I am waiting to hear back from him but I am curious as to other people\u2019s experience (ie not taking it as medical advice). It is so hard bc my sister in law is pregnant and due when I would have been. My heart breaks! I was bleeding before I even got the shot (I am pretty sure i would have miscarried completely without the shot but it would have taken longer!) my dr never told me to watch folic acid in food only to not take any prenatal or any vitamin with folic acid. I honestly had no appetite from the shot and did not eat for probably 2-3 days. By day 4 my hcg was 14 and on day 7 I was negative! I am sure the shot is working your body is most likely just absorbing the cells which it is supposed to! I am so sorry about your due date and it is heartbreaking the hardest part about all this is EP is really treated more like a medical condition than a loss which i get it is but the loss part is kind of disregarded along the way! Now that I am negative I am starting to deal w the loss and the fear of how it may happen again or I may never have another normal pregnancy, it is scary! Trying to take it one day and step at a time!!! Xox  I am sorry to hear about your ectopic pregnancy. The majority of the ectopic pregnancies occur in a fallopian tube, which carries eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. This would be considered as a tubal pregnancy, but it could also occur in an ovary, abdominal cavity, or in the lower part of the uterus. Some of the early warning signs would be apparent between 4 to 12 weeks like light vaginal bleeding, sharp abdominal cramps, and unilateral pelvic pain. This pain could radiate to the shoulder, neck, or rectum. If not treated on time it may lead to tubal rupture. Leading to heavy bleeding inside the abdomen cavity and causing severe symptoms like extreme lightheadedness, fainting, and shock, call your healthcare provider if any of these occur. Some risk factors to consider are having a previous ectopic pregnancy, inflammation, infection, tubal surgery, choice of birth control, advanced maternal age, and smoking. There really is not a way to prevent this from happening but ways to decrease the risk is by limiting the number of sexual partners and using protection to prevent STDs and that would reduce the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Do not smoke and if you do try to quit before planning a pregnancy. Hi! How are you feeling? I just took methotrexate yesterday but my levels were at 6000hcg and I was about 6 weeks. I have not felt too much discomfort and still have an appetite but my fianc\u00e9 is home with me just in case. I am super nervous for pain! I had a miscarriage before and I had to go to ER because the pain was so intense. I got the shot friday at 730pm , it is  now sunday morning and i woke up sweating a bit and spotting so I am thinking my levels are falling. I was 2800 friday night .

I am wondering if natural vaginal delivery is possible after having a previous ectopic that ended with laparoscopic surgery. I am curious if anyone here has done it or heard that it is safe from their doctor. Thank you! Yes I had my left tube rupture and ended up pregnant a few years later with my now 3 year old. I had a normal vaginal delivery :) The concern would be if the surgery was on your uterus or cervix. I think most ectopic surgeries, like for a tubal ectopic, (or endometriosis surgeries) do not actually touch the uterus or cervix.\n\nEdit: I am not sure people with cervical or uterine surgeries cannot do vaginal deliveries, just that uterine and cervical scars can sometimes be a concern for vaginal delivery. Awesome to hear, and congrats! Thank you for the response :) Gotcha, that makes sense. Thank you for this! Yes 100% can. I had an ectopic in April of 2020 and in June 2021 laboured naturally and got to 10cm and pushed and everything. Would have had a natural delivery if my LO was facing the right way (was Sunnyside up), unfortunately was a csection in the end. Sorry to hear it did not go as planned, csections sound hard! But I am glad you and LO are ok!", "Could this be an ectopic pregnancy? Hi everyone, I do not even know how to start this because I am terrified and sad. I had MC in June and CP last month. Now I am 5w2d, since yesterday I woke up with a sharp pain on one side of my stomach which I feel is more towards the lower part of my abdomen. I thought it was gas (sorry for the TMI) but today I woke up with an even more severe pain. I can barely walk, when I pee the sharp pain is there hurting. No bleeding so far but from what I read I could be having an ectopic pregnancy. Im waiting for my doctor to open to see if she can see me or I might go to the ER. Does an ectopic pregnancy feel like this? The pain seems to come from my side of my stomach sometimes and other times is lower, and the pain is sharp. To me, besides bleeding, ectopic had the symptoms of indigestion (5w6d), it seemed like I wanted to defecate but could not. What I have learned from that experience is not to wait and wonder and go to the ER as soon as possible before any complications might occur. It is better to be in the hospital with a false alarm than at home with a medical emergency. You can barely walk? Have someone drive you to the ER My doctor told me to contact them if I had any of the following: severe cramping (one sided specifically), nausea, vomitting, back or shoulder pain, as they are signs of ectopic pregnancy. \n\n(In my case I am also bleeding and have low HCG levels, if you have those as well)", "1st pregnancy...ER visit &amp; Ectopic diagnosis...boyfriend disappeared after hearing positive.. (long story warning) ", "Why it is harder to get pregnant after ectopic pregnancy  Probably bc some women have to have one of their tubes removed", "How to cope It was my birthday today and 3 weeks ago I was in the hospital, alone, finding out I was pregnant. My fiance and I tried 5 years to get pregnant. Then I was told it was an ectopic and I needed to be transferred to another hospital for emergency surgery. I am so mad, so heartbroken, and I think depressed. I cry at the most random times and I feel alone. I wondered what today would have been like had the baby been in the right spot. Would have I found out in my own way and surprised my man like ive dreamed of doing. Would I be puking with morning sickness or craving strawberries with pickles? I am mad at myself and I do not know how to grieve. Ive been told it wasnt even a baby yet and that killed me. Idk why I am posting. I just feel helpless and do not know what to do or if I am over reacting like everyone acts like I am. I am so sorry this happened to you.  My only advice that helped me with my EP would be to give yourself grace and time to mourn.   You have suffered a loss (along with physical trauma) and you are allowed to feel mad, heartbroken, incredibly sad.  Sending you good thoughts \u2764\ufe0f Do not be mad at yourself. This is not your fault and there is nothing you can do to prevent the ectopic. I am sorry for your loss. I also had my tube taken out and was depressed for a bit of time. It is been almost 4 months and I still think about it but I feel grateful that I was able to recover well and we can start trying soon again. We will have our healthy baby when it is our time. Sending positive vibes! Something I found helpful was to think of it as this: your baby just could not wait to meet you so much that they implanted too soon. There is nothing that you could do to prevent this. And unfortunately there is nothing you can do to save them once they are there. Give yourself time to heal, both mentally and physically. I will pray for you for success in trying again should you choose. I have been down this road you are on. It took me 5 years with my ex and one year with my current fianc\u00e9 before our ectopic (my first pregnancy, first loss.) Now that we have gone through our second of both, I know the pain all to well. If you need someone to talk to, message me here. You are not alone. Thank you so much for the kind words. They mean so much", "Getting the shot, any tips? I just found out today from a pelvic ultrasound that I have an ectopic pregnancy. I am going into my doctor's office tomorrow morning to get the shot and blood work and have to go for blood work over the weekend and again early next week to monitor my HCG levels and ensure they are declining. \n\nI am really nervous to get the shot and I do not even know what to expect in terms of side effects. Any tips/suggestions? My anxiety is through the roof and I cannot sleep at all. Thanks all in advance. The shot itself is not so bad. If you can have a support person, I would recommend it as you cannot really predict how you will be emotionally. For the same reason, maybe take an extra couple days off work than you thought you might need. I took 3 with my first and regretted it, but had a week after my second, which was much better. As far as side effects and recovery, with my first one, I started to bleed pretty heavily after about a week or so. It was heavier and more painful than a period. It was heavy for about a week, but then I still bled for like 3 or 4 weeks straight. I also had a lot of painful bloating for several weeks after for which I went to the ER only to be told it was normal. I also needed help getting my period to start back up after 3 months. After my second one, recovery was much smoother. I did not bleed for as long, my period came back after about 6 weeks, and I did not have nearly as much pain and bloating, but I was tired a lot. I think side effects and recovery can vary to some degree. I mean, I had one horrible experience and one that was just kind of meh. Expect to at least feel tired and crummy for a little while. You may need to take it easy. Be gentle with yourself and really try to take some time for quality self care. Make sure you have good support systems in place and do not be afraid to try therapy. It was literally life-changing for me. I wish I could take this from you and you did not have to do it, but you will get through. I am wishing you well and sending lots of internet hugs. \ud83d\udc9c\n\n\nAlso, edited to add, do not hesitate to ask your doc about any and all questions you might have!  Thank you so much for your insight and sharing your story. I am so sorry to hear about what you had to go through but I did manage to get the shot taken care of this morning and at this point I am not feeling much. But I am sure once the meds have time to kick in I will start to feel tired, etc. Hoping for the best here, and that this in fact takes care of it and I do not need to get surgery. I actually so see a therapist weekly and definitely need the extra help to process this all. It is been a lot. **hugs** im sorry you are going through this. \n\nI got the shot for my ectopic in 2017. The first day or two I felt low-key sick but I think I was in a little bit of a shock.  i was pretty sick when bleeding started. I had cramps and nausea. My abdomen was also really tender for about a week or so. I definitely also recommend having a support person if possible and taking some time to heal mentally amd physically. \n\nIm at my doctors office but wanted to respond with something. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat or have any questions Thanks so much for your response. I am starting to feel really tired at this point and I am currently just waiting to give my blood and will go home and rest for the rest of the day. I am nervous as to what is to come in terms of pain. I did notice my bleeding getting heavier. I have been bleeding for the past 3 weeks Yes, once you get past the first week and confirm it is working, that is a huge relief. I am so sorry, again, that you are going through this. Ectopic pregnancy is definitely its own kind of trauma because even with the best recovery, it is long and uncomfortable at best, and there is still that underlying knowledge that had it not been caught, you could easily have died. It is extra fucked up, as if losing a pregnancy is not fucked up enough. It is a lot to process. I am glad you have good support and I wish you healing and an easy recovery! Hi OP, how are you doing? I was thinking about you and wanted to check in. Hey, thanks for checking in. I am feeling pretty tired and probably am going to just stay in bed today. Around the afternoon time yesterday, I got extremely tired and had a slight headache and took a nap. No other symptoms besides just not feeling like eating.", "Some women, or most of them around the world, do not know what the proper procedures are during pregnancy ", "Hello everyone\u2026 In late 2019, I had a suspected ectopic pregnancy that never got looked into. I ended up in the ER, fainted, had dizziness and an insane amount of blood + clots. I was given medication and sent home\u2026 no further testing was done. As someone who was just 21, I felt I was treated as just a number or just another miscarriage story but now I am concerned that it was infect an ectopic pregnancy and that my Fallopian tube might have been damaged. I did get ultrasounds and they never saw anything even before the miscarriage. Is it possible to have an ectopic pregnancy and have an un damaged tube? I cannot speak for all cases, but in my case, my OB told me that all ectopic pregnancies cause damage to the tube. She also said that it is not always an immense amount, especially when the medication was effective. In my case they had to surgically removed the pregnancy and the fallopian tube because it had ruptured so it was beyond repair. I am so sorry you were overlooked so easily with such a serious condition and I am glad you were alright. A quick way to check to health of your tubes would be to set up what is called a dye test with your OB. They inject colorful dye through the tubes to see how functional they are and look for damage. I hope this helps! Thank you so much! This helped lots", "Period after methotrexate injection. How long after your shot you got your period? Was your period different? It is been about 3 weeks since I got my shot and about 5 days later bled with blood clots for 5 days or so. It is been a week and a half since I bled and now it feels like I am going to get my period? I have cramps and I had some (tmi) mucus like fertile mucus with brown blood yesterday but no blood. Today I thought I was going to start my period since the cramps feel a bit more stronger and I just have very light brown spotting with watery mucus but not pink or blood yet. Is that normal? I do not know the answer to this because I just got my shot last week, but I am following this in case someone else has an answer!", "Possible Ectopic So this is my 4th pregnancy, I have has 2 miscarriages and 1 live birth. \nLast Saturday I ended up going to the er due to spotting. On that Saturday I should have been 6 weeks, knowing for sure due to tracking ovulation. My hcg levels that day were 342 and ultrasound (transvaginal) showed no fetus but showed free fluid in pelis. They checked both ovaries and saw no cysts and said both had blood flow. On my paperwork they put possible ectopic, threated miscarriage. Yesterday I saw my obgyn and she did a blood draw and I got the results last night and my hcg went up to 378. Did not double, barely went uo, not a good sign. \n\nI have not heard back from my doctor, I only knew lab results because I checked my patient portal. She did say at my appointment to not go to my ultrasound on Tuesday that she was going to do blood draws until my hcg was in the 2000s. \n\nSo I guess my question is has anyone gone through this. I keep researching online about ectopic pregnancies and keep finding situations that match what I am going through. I have been bleeding (only when I wipe) brown discharge/blood for a week now, since my hospital visit. I am confused. My body seems like a stranger to me. I am looking for possible answers and maybe support. Thanks if you read this. Im so sorry. Unfortunately I did. I had brownish spotting mostly just when I wipped. My hcg was around 600 (estimated week 6.5 definitely implanted late)..didnt double in time and they couldnt find a sac. I did have a cyst but on the opposite side of my pain so it did not matter. Blood flow on imaging was good. But I did implant in my tube just next to my ovary. Unfortunately mine ruptured. If you get faint or lightheaded please go to the ER. Not to freak you out, but please just be careful and pay attention to your body. Days after my sever pain I felt aches and like I couldnt empty my bladder. Turns out it was internal bleeding. when i first had my hcg checked it was only at 189 (i was estimated to be 5weeks), at that time my dr recommended i do ultrasound right away instead of waiting for my week 7, to check if i am having miscarriage or ectopic.. but due to low hcg nothing was seen on ultrasound, which is expected since according to studies you will only see something if hcg is around 1500-1800.. also did another hcg test that day, and it went down to 86.. they ended up thinking i am having miscarriage so they forwarded my files to early pregnancy loss program.\n\nEPL program instructed me to do hcg test every 2-3days to make sure it goes back down to 0... but it did not, it started going up then doubling, i started to get excited and happy... they arranged another ultrasound for me on April 22nd since my hcg went up to 14xx on the 20th..\n\nwent for my 2nd ultrasound on 22nd, but i was told that there is no gestational sac found in my uterus (transvaginal ultrasound) but they saw something on my right side that could be ectopic, but it is not clear.. so that afternoon epl phoned me and asked me to do another hcg, it went up to 2323...\n\nnext day, 23rd, they phoned and said that it is actually really concerning since my hcg is that high but there is no gestational sac. they told me to go to emergency right away to get re-evaluated by dr in person and get treated asap if it is ectopic..\n\n\nprior to all of this i was barely in pain nor have any symptoms.. i did feel dull pain in my right side that come and go but i was thinking it is just a normal pregnancy thing. i felt it as well on the left side and middle but not as often as right.. i was not sure since this is my first.. i lightly spotted for a week after the first ultrasound, it stopped, then had it again for a day after second ultrasound. i thought all of these symptoms are normal..\n\nbut last night, as i was instructed, we went to emergency and was there for 5hrs.. they kept checking my bp, temperature, did more blood work.. then another obgyn on duty checked again my ultrasound from the 23rd.. and she said it is most likely ectopic, and she recommended that i do medical intervention before it is too late..\n\nso i was injected with 4 needles of methotrexate.. that is my experienced.. hope you will have a good news at the end I am sorry you are in limbo. My story is pretty long (ectopic 4 times) but if you wanted to read it - it is on my page.\nBrown / coffee ground type bleeding when I wipe was one of the main signs in each one of my ectopics. \ud83d\ude14 hopefully you get answers soon and know you are not alone. \ud83d\udc9c", "When did you feel ok again? Hi everyone firstly I am so sorry anyone is here and I wish you all the hope in the world in your future fertility journeys.\n\nIt has been 2 months now since I was rushed into emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy. They removed my left Fallopian tube and found endometriosis and I was signed off work for 4 weeks. \n\nI am in my fourth week back to work now and I am majorly struggling. I seemed to have had a couple of weeks of feeling steady and back to normal. But the last week has hit me like a freight train. It is like I have just had to go through all the motions all over again and I just cannot stop crying. I manage a team of people and every time one of them complains about having to do *anything* I just wanted to scream. I cannot deal with people right now and I feel like I am being beaten down from all directions. I am exhausted.\n\nWhen does it start to feel ok again? I am so sorry you had to go through this. I had my surgery 6 months ago and honestly it does get easier. I lost my left tube and it was my first pregnancy after trying for a year and a half. The pain does not go away but it gets easier to deal with it. I remember having a really hard time as soon as I went back to work. I thought things would never get better and I would never feel okay, but it got easier as time passed. Therapy helped a lot and I highly recommend it. I hope you get some relief soon \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 My ectopic was 6 months ago \nI am still struggling , I cannot forget what happened  same as you i have endometriosis And I do not have the brave to try again because I do not think i will be able to handle this again\nUsually having one ectopic without risk factors means it is highly will not happen again\nBut as i have endometriosis and damaged tubes that does not support me at all I am 7 weeks from ruptured ectopic surgery (lost tube + ovary). Physically I still feel very achy and still cannot go for walks without pain and tire pretty easily. I am sorry you still feel so physically and emotionally crappy :( I had my ectopic surgery in April. I felt awful about myself because my doctor cleared me to go back to work after two weeks, but my body still did not feel right. I felt like I was taking too long to recover. But now I realize I was being hard on myself. Every body is different. My body physically started feeling better barely a month ago, two months after surgery, but I feel pains once in a while on my ectopic side even now.\n\nMentally, I am a lot better now than I was a month ago. Like you, I had a period of maybe a week where I felt like I was steady, but I fell into deep sadness after that and realized I needed to start therapy because the thoughts of the ectopic and pregnancy consumed my thoughts every day and I could not even see pregnant women without feeling bad. Some days I still feel SO SAD, but I let myself feel that for the time I need to and remember that I WILL be a mom one day.", "When will I finally start to feel okay again?! Hey all, \nJust needing to vent a little. I am almost two weeks post ectopic pregnancy surgery and feeling more defeated than ever. I am suddenly having incision pain again when I thought I was better, just from going on a short walk. Having physical pain makes the emotional pain feel that much more difficult to process. It is especially frustrating because hiking, walking, and being in nature all help me feel better with most things, but I cannot do any of them. My husband's family tries to be supportive by saying they are sure we will have a baby soon.... But that does not remotely help. My family has never been helpful or supportive and cannot understand why I am so sad if I still have one fallopian tube left. I have so many moments of breaking down and not being able to collect myself for hours. My days are blurring together at this point and I am not back at work for another week and a half. Not that I think I would be remotely useful right now, but it feels like distraction is the only thing that can keep me together. I just want some of this to get easier and I feel like I am drowning. How in the world do I ever get to be okay again after this? I am so sorry for your loss and what you are going through! It is still so soon after your surgery, your body needs more time to heal. The emotions will take a long time to process, too. Try to give yourself time and space to heal in both respects, and be patient. Ask for help if you need it, write out how you are feeling, participate in this group, be in nature as much as is comfortable, whatever feels good to you. For me, it took a few months to feel better physically (some of that was anemia, not surgery pain) and about a year to feel pretty good emotionally again, though there are still some days that are hard. Sending big hugs. I am so sorry you are feeling like this but you are not alone! I am a little over a week post surgery and i go back to work Friday. (I bartend so i cannot afford to take any more days off). Maybe talking to your family and letting them know that you need time to not be okay will help. My boyfriend the first few days post surgery was just frustrated, hurtful, and honestly just continued on like i just a tooth pulled. He was not for me keeping the baby and i just felt so much resentment that he just got what he wanted and i was left the emotional and physical aftermath. Then we had a long talk about how I am just not okay right now and i cannot be best for him right now and he needs to be okay with that and patient with me or not be in my life. It helped and he is been here for me a lot more emotionally. At the end of the day no one else can truly sympathize with you unless they have gone through the same things. I still look in the mirror and feel like I am in a stranger\u2019s body. We did not just lose our babies, we lost a very intimate part of our body and it is totally okay to be upset and confused about that. That is cool that they are trying to be optimistic about still having a functional tube, but that is something to think about in the future once you have healed and feel comfortable trying again. So be sad, breakdown, cry and do whatever it is you do when you are not okay until you are again. I had two really good days and then the next i broke down in the kitchen while i was making lunch. This is time you need to take to not be okay. I have no idea when we will start to feel okay again, but i hope this helped a little. DM me if you ever need to talk Thank you so much for all the kind words and advice. I appreciate it so much. And makes me feel better that it is taken others more time as well and maybe I am pushing myself to be okay again too quickly. Thank you so much for sharing all that and I am so sorry your boyfriend has had trouble being supportive that makes things so much harder. :( I hope you heal quickly. And I think you are right. Being patient with myself emotionally and physically is probably best it is just so hard! Your words helped a lot. Thank you for sharing your story. I hope that by doing so you have felt a little more above water. It helps me to write my thoughts down and even more to get feedback from other genuine people. I have read your post several times today as I feel absolutely heartbroken for you, as well as for my partner and everyone else who has to go though this nightmare of a situation. I hope that with each day you will continue to feel better and know that if you ever are having a bad day you can find someone to talk to here. Best wishes! Sorry for you loss, I can relate. Had my second ectopic 2 weeks ago\u2026 but the first one is where I had surgery and lost my right tube. Took me a month to get better but mentally I have not, and still had another ectopic and had  injection. But that first ectopic really made me feel depressed and till this day I feel not good enough to just ever have a normal pregnancy. I lost a part of me by losing my right tube. Part of my womanhood. I know you are pain. And all we can do is just lean on those that support us and just try get through it. I might not be a lot of help in this but for me, work has helped so I am not just home thinking and be around the ppl that support me through times like these. It is like waves it comes and goes. I am sorry, but we will get through it. I just lost my right tube on Saturday in emergency surgery (rupture a week after the methotrexate shot). I feel so hollow. And so frustrated that I cannot do the things that make me feel better like yoga and walking and playing with my daughter. No one understands the loss unless they have lost a part of their reproductive system too. \n\nI do not know when I am supposed to go back to work. No one gave me any direction in the hospital about it. This feels like a really isolating experience and I have no answers for you, only solidarity \u2764\ufe0f I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. I wish you did not have to feel this pain. I go back to work tomorrow but still do not feel emotionally ready. This process is the worst thing I think we can go through in life. It feels so hopeless and painful on every level possible. But know that you are not alone. Please feel free to message me any time to talk. I had mine in February and have only started to feel okay in the last two months. I still get emotional and break down randomly, overwhelmed by the emotions again. It gets better. It really does. But it is slow. Thank you for sharing. \u2764\ufe0f Your story brings back some hope. I am so sorry you have been through this too.", "My experience with my first pregnancy that turned out to be ectopic... Hi girls. I know it is not a portal very active right now, but I am new to reddit and this can work as virtual therapy until I can find a good psychologist. On April 10, I was urgently admitted to a hospital for an ectopic pregnancy of which I was not aware; I have had never spent a night in a hospital or had surgeries.  I am 22 years old and I am a pretty social person, I love to party and make new friends, the clothes that I usually wear are tight clothes or feminine clothes which shows my stomach, so my scar has been causing me a lot of anxiety because of my body insecurities. I have a love relationship since almost 8 years, my boyfriend was very supportive in my experience of losing a pregnancy, he did things for me that I never thought I would see him do. I sometimes still have pain in my abdomen, discomfort when sleeping or wearing panties and leggings, I prefer to continue wearing baggy pants and big shirts. I cannot understand why this had to happen to me, I did not want to hit rock bottom to change my perspective on life. I had my period normally and I took the morning after pill, the last option in my mind was a pregnancy, I had suspicions of gastritis or colitis and even when I made the urine test and it came out positive, I did not believed it was a chance. I was not ready to be a mother in this right moment, but I would like to experience this process in a future, and my doctor assured me that even if I wait 5 to 10 years, I will have complications regarding my ovarian cysts and the hormones that does not get along in my system for cancer risk in my family. I am glad I survived to be writing this but there have been difficult nights of insomnia and existential questions in my head, I have felt in a bad mood since then and without any sexual appetite. I understand this requires effort, positivity and time, and this portal can pushes me to recover sooner. Hello! I am so sorry to hear about your experience. I am 25 years old and I also experienced an ectopic pregnancy. I am actually going through it right now. May 8th I found out I was pregnant, and was supposed to have my ultrasound June 3rd. May 27th I started bleeding and I knew something was wrong, so I went to the emergency room. They diagnosed me with a \"threatened miscarriage\", and I waited for my ultrasound June 3rd. Went to my ultrasound yesterday and they told me they did not see anything in my uterus, but saw something suspicious near my ovary. So after bloodwork, they determined that I did not have a miscarriage, and they said they were highly suspicious that it is an ectopic pregnancy but do not know for sure. Today, I am getting an infusion done to try to stop the pregnancy from furthering. After today, I have to continue to get bloodwork done and more ultrasounds until they say everything is okay. I do not know what this means for future pregnancies for me...\nWhat I found strange with our stories is that I also took the morning after pill.\nIf you ever want to talk, follow me on Instagram,  . I would love to talk to someone else about this who experienced a similar thing. I feel like ectopic pregnancies are not really talked about.. I am so sorry for your loss. Ectopic pregnancy is a traumatic experience. I am 28, and I had my ectopic surgery in Sept. 2019. I am now thankfully pregnant with our rainbow (16 weeks today!) and am dreading wearing a two-piece bathing suit ever again because I am self-conscious about my scars, too. We are all here to support you in your healing. I suggest seeing a therapist since mine has really helped me. I go every two weeks even now, and it is nice to be able to vocalize my anxieties without feeling like a burden to everyone around me. I wish you the best!", "How to you start trying again? I am only a week post op from our ectopic pregnancy and fallopian tube removal, but I am already terrified of trying again. It took us two years to get pregnant and then this happened. How in the world do you try again without the fear of this happening all over again and taking the last chance we have at having children? We will never be able to afford IVF. This has stripped me of my joy, excitement, and hope for the future and I do not know how to not drown in it. Having a child is all I have ever wanted and now all I feel is fear. Any advice or stories would be hugely appreciated I am just feeling over overwhelmed and crushed. I am so sorry that you have gone through this.. and I completely understand your fears, I have been there too. I do not have great advice on how to calm the fears, but know that you are not alone. \n\nMy husband and I had been trying for years when we finally got pregnant - I ended up losing my tube in November of 2020. The physical and emotional pain were real - my husband and I decided we would start trying again next cycle because we both felt it was what we wanted.. and ended up conceiving just 3 weeks after my surgery (happened much quicker than expected). I am now sitting here 36 weeks pregnant with our healthy baby girl. \n\nTake your time to feel ready. I will not lie, the first weeks after finding out were hell. I had pain, I was terrified, but because of my history I was in for betas right away and my first scan less than 2 weeks after getting my positive. Once we saw our little nugget the fears slowly began to dissipate and I have gotten to experience the joy and happiness. \n\nI wish you all the best in your journey. Wish I had some advice but I can say you are not alone(not that it helps). I am also 6 days out from ectopic removal. Thankfully I did not lose a tube but it took us 17 months 5 medicated cycles since our laparoscopy to remove endometriosis in January. I do not know how to start over and I feel stripped of the joy of seeing two pink lines again bc of this and all I have read. I am sorry you/we have to feel this. My prayers are with you and all who are struggling with infertility. Thank you so much for all the kind words. Your story brings back some hope for me and I am so glad you were able to conceive again so quickly. I hope everything from here out how is smoothly for you. I am so sorry you have lived through this horrible reality. I am so sorry to hear that you are in the same situation. It is a pain I would not wish on anyone. I am also six days post op so we are in the same place in terms of physical healing. I hope you are able to conceive again soon and that you can deliver a healthy baby. Likewise darling! I deleted all the ttc forums I follow on social media which has helped tone down some anxiety. Scrolling and seeing so many miscarriage posts I just could not stay positive in my own head. Reddit only comes up if I look so it is less in my face. I am just going to stay in a day to day mindset. I am looking forward to be able to live on my husband again and just try and find the joy in ttc. I am thankful I now know I can get pregnant so I am praying my body knows what to do next time. Hope yours does the same. They say our bodies are more fertile after so fingers crossed it works well in our favor lol I am so glad you asked because I wonder the same thing every day. I had my right tube removed 3 weeks ago. The fact that even if we do get pregnant again, it will never be the pure joy without the terror of what can go wrong, terrifies me. I am very worried that we will eventually only be left with IVF as an option, because we cannot really afford it and I do not think I would be able to handle the emotional stresses of it to begin with. Some days it feels so hopeless to even consider trying again, but we really wanted our baby and it would be such a blessing to have a rainbow \ud83c\udf08 I could not agree with you more. I am so sorry you lost a tube as well. It feels so much scarier knowing that now there is only one left. I hope you get your rainbow \ud83c\udf08 Hi, I am so sorry you had to go through this. I am 4 weeks post op and I am still very traumatized by the chain of events that took place. Looking forward, in order to try again I have to wait 6 months due to the methotrexate in my system, which failed to prevent a rupture, and the surgeon discovered a sizable fibroid that would need to be removed by surgery. All of these increase my risk of further complications and I am truly terrified at the simple thought of trying again. I have found some comfort in hearing stories from others who have went on to have children and that brings me so much hope and joy. If you need to seek out someone to help you process the fear and trauma around this, please do so. It is helping me a great deal. Thank you for all the kind words and I am so sorry you understand this pain. I am also so sorry you have to wait so long before trying again that must feel so frustrating. :( Same here.. 2nd ectopic for me. First one I lost right tube, this time I had the injection.. Day 7 on it. And now I am really really traumatized to ever try again \ud83e\udd7a I am so incredibly sorry to hear that. I cannot imagine going through this trauma twice. Have you had any dye testing done in the remaining tube? \ud83e\udd7a. No I never heard of that? My dr told me she would suggest for me to first maybe try get genetic testing just to make sure everything is okay, like my cells and all that. That totally makes sense as well. For me, I had a dye test done to see if there was obvious blockage in my remaining tube. They inject a colorful dye into the tube and see if it comes through the other side quickly or pools in the tube. Mine was done during the ectopic surgery, but I know it can be done as an office visit as well. Wow I never knew that I wish I would known or else I would have told them if they can do that. Well I wish the best for you and you get through this. \u2764\ufe0f Thank you so much and same to you \u2764\ufe0f", "Possible ectopic? Suggestions? \nSo i am 7 weeks, 6 days based off my last period.. i went to doctor, nothing was seen other than possibly a small sac. I have had cramping, nausea, bloating, no bleeding though. My HCG levels were almost 2500. They have not ruled this an ectopic yet, but called it an unknown location pregnancy. Any suggestions on what i should do? I go back tomorrow for HCG levels &amp; Friday for ultrasound. Just keep an eye out for any one sided pain or even a dull ache that does not go away. I did not have any bleeding with my ectopic, just the dull ache which then turned into worse pain and eventual rupture. My HCG got as high as 3400 but nothing was ever seen on ultrasound. If you have shoulder pain, immediately go to the ER. That is a sign of internal bleeding. Basically any abnormal pains, call your OB or go to the ER. I hope your levels rise and you are able to see something on ultrasound this week! What was the outcome? I had the samething.. I am 6 weeks or so\u2026 but OB did an ultrasound she said she did not really see anything and looked at my ovaries and tube for any mass or whatever she said she didnt.. that my dates can be off since I am irregular. But in 2 days we will do another ultrasound. And I also had a ectopic before and had surgery and lost my right side tube.. My HCG levels were 10500 but i go back for ultrasound Tuesday, i had to reschedule Fridays appointment. So we will see. \ud83e\udd1e Good luck :) I will be having my ultrasound in the next 2-3 days. My second beta results should be coming in tomorrow. Keep ya updated as well. Good luck!\u2764\ufe0f You get your ultrasound? I ended up getting my injection yesterday at the hospital.

Dr. Anshu in this video had explained the signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy along with its risk factors and treatment process. (", "Methotrexate side effects? I have recently been diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy 2 weeks after having my HCG taken every 48 hours and 2 scans. My HCG is currently around 4000. I had the methotrexate shot on Thursday so today is day 4 and I have started with a really high temperature around 39 degrees and feel like crap. My pelvis feels like an elephant has sat on it. Is this normal ? I know they say methotrexate is often all you need to dissolve the pregnancy, but after days of pain in my pelvis after methotrexate, I was sent back to the ER and they found I had a rupture that had to be fixed in surgery. So I would say pain with a fever is enough to call your doctor and see if it could be something more serious. I was angry that I had to go back to the ER but it may have saved my life. Before this, I was under the impression that pain was normal after the shot, and maybe it is. I have no medical training, just my own experience. Wishing you all the best \u2764\ufe0f I would definitely contact your doctor with your temp that high (whether you had Mtx or not). It could indicate an infection or other issues. I am sorry you are going through this. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79 Thank you I went today and I have a urine infection. Just what I needed I am sure my body hates me \ud83d\ude02 Thank you so much. I went to see them they today and they said I had a urine infection and the pain can be normal from the shot but I am not convinced. My HCG has also risen from 3100 to 5500 since Friday. I really hope it falls it is so scary. I am sorry you have been through this it is awful and so unfair. That is really scary when the HCG goes up :( but from what I heard, it is fairly normal to go up before going down. My HCG plummeted from 900 to 282 and still ruptured so it is all about paying attention to your pain levels, fever, and in my case, vomiting. I am hoping as they treat you for the urinary infection, it helps your pelvic pain!! I know how much it sucks to have to listen to your symptoms when your body feels so \u201coff\u201d anyway. I had to get methotrexate a couple years ago and I had the weirdest pains/aches all over and felt awful in so many ways it did not even make sense. I think it is normal. Hang in there! Sorry you are going through this! Thank you so much. I wish they would of warned me I guess because I am worried about a rupture that every pain I get I am over thinking. Hopefully it is all over soon \ud83e\udd1e I really hope they come down by Thursday they do not even know where my pregnancy is either they cannot see anything on ultrasound it is such a confusing time thank you for taking the time to comment it is such a lonely place too and not alot of people seem to understand. Just cannot wait to see the light at the end of the tunnel x They could not see where my pregnancy was either until the laparoscopic surgery and it felt so uncertain and scary :( I am sure your levels will go down soon \u2764\ufe0f Please feel free to DM me if you need to talk about it, I know how lonely it can feel \ud83d\ude1e I did the same thing. Every time I felt anything I though t a rupture was going to happen but after I think like 2-3 days I was feeling much normal! Ugh. So frustrating.

", "Pregnant after ectopic Hello, so I had an ectopic back in February of 2020. Had my right tube removed. And now I am pregnant, I found out Monday after a trip to the er, me and my husband were doing the do, and I had horrible pain from what I assumed was him hitting my cervix. No bleeding just pain, so they test my urine and I test positive for pregnancy, and they do an ultra sound to check for a baby and make sure baby is in the right place. They find no baby, and my tube is clear and my ovary look fine. Also my hcg is 127 I go tomorrow to have it retested. I am just wondering if I am just very early in pregnancy. And if anyone has experienced similar pain during intercourse when pregnant. The pain has subsided and I overall feel fine. I am currently 12 weeks pregnant (also had a previous ectopic) and I have pain with intercourse every single time. Pretty intense pain in the beginning and now just mild pain. If you are very early seeing baby on an ultrasound can challenging I have heard. My doc would not see me for an US until 8 weeks to be sure we would or would not see something. Fingers crossed for you at your next appointment! Thank you for your reassurance! I thought I was crazy. Because after my surgery and al sex was pretty fine, no pain or barely any, and now it is like I am being stabbed in my cervix. So I am on bed rest and no sex until they say it is safe. \u2665\ufe0f thank you I remember having some discomfort after but nothing close to this pregnancy sex discomfort. Come back and let us know after your next appointment! I will be thinking of you! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb Glad to hear you are not having another ectopic. I will thank you babes. Also! If you are comfortable joining the private bumpers group for your estimated due date (august, September, October) was great for me early on when I was scared and worried. Those ladies have good advice and seemingly you can find someone who has experienced everything you have! If you search for \u201cSeptember2021bumpers\u201d or whatever your due date month is you should find it. hCG level of 127 should put you around the 4 weeks pregnant mark so it would be extremely unlikely to see anything on a scan. Right now they are probably classing you as a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) and so will monitor your hCG levels until they are sure. \n\nI am sending you love and best wishes and hope you have the very best outcome. Thank you \u2665\ufe0f Keep an eye to the pain and if it gets worse go to hospital again. \nAlthough you do not typically see anything on ultrasound in uterus with that low of hcg - they may be able to locate a mass in tubes as they are tiny so anything growing in them can be obvious (not always though). They are only been able to locate 2 of 4 of my ectopics the other two they had to find while in surgery. \nYou very well may be early and I am not saying what I said to scare you but if you are concerned definitely try to demand a scan. On Tuesday night I ended up in hospital where they \u201cfound nothing anywhere\u201d the following day I went back to hospital and they confirmed a gestational sac and yolk sac in my right tube and that was only like 24 hours later. \n\nI hope your hcg level comes back amazing and you can have some comfort but if you keep having pain (even if levels are rising) go right back in. Have a low threshold to go to ER as ectopics as you know can cause very serious consequences. My hcg rose every 30 hours (5 blood draws total)  and the doctors were \u201cso sure\u201d with the rising levels it was not ectopic, but yet - here I am \ud83d\ude44 with my fourth.

Baby is in my uterus and the pain was from a cyst on my left tube the size of 6cm almost big enough for surgery but it has shrank so that is good. Also I am sorry that happened to you! I could not imagine losing both tubes.

Im hearing a lot of people who were told to avoid folic acid until their numbers were back down to normal but my primary doctor (btw i was not even trying to get pregnant this just happened so my primary had no idea) but my primary told me that it is not usually recommended to eat a low folic diet bc it can make you deficient while being treated with methotrexate.  Idk if she is just not educated on the subject or what since shes just a primary and not like an obgyn or what\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n Im afraid if i go back to eating normally that my numbers will go back up and i Definitely dont want that. Any advice or insight is appreciated Eating folate can hinder the methotrexate. See that is what i thought too A diet lower in folic acid helps methotrexate be most effective. You are right that afterwards you may be deficient, if you switched to trying to conceive your doc would likely recommend waiting a few months to build up your folic acid stores.

Could my pregnancy be ectopic if I had implantation spotting around the time of my missed period? Was very light pink and did not get on underwear only toilet paper when wiping. It also was only a few hours.\n\nThanks You could be pregnant. Have you taken a pregnancy test? If so, was it positive with a faint line? \n\nI had an ectopic pregnancy a few years ago and I bled for 1.5 weeks. It was like normal period blood with some clots. \n\nThis time around (still waiting for blood results) I bled for 4 days, normal period blood (used 15 pads) with some clots. Hcg levels were moving up slowly and will find out later tomorrow hopefully.\n\nIf you are not bleeding like your period - I would not be concerned at all. Some women spot when they get pregnant (pink) and that could pretty much be what is happening to you.\n\nIf you start to bleed, red like your period - please go to the hospital (after you check to see if you are pregnant with test). \n\nGood luck. &lt;3 Yes I have taken a positive pregnancy test. But I went to the doctor and they did not see anything on the ultrasound and said it may be too early or it may be ectopic pregnancy. So I am just wondering if I would see that implantation bleeding if my pregnancy was ectopic since it does not implant in the uterus? Yep. Same with me. I am certain I am going through an ectopic now and I will find out tomorrow if my results are in. I went 2 weeks ago and I was at about 5 weeks. My levels went to 2-digital to 3-digit in one week so I am assuming it is. I am not certain about the implantation bleeding and the uterus part. They diagnosed me with a threatened miscarriage. Are you going to go back and get tested to see if your levels are improving? Are you having any bleeding or pain? I went and had labs done two days apart. And have an ultrasound scheduled again the 30th. I am not having any bleeding or pain. I have a high pain threshold so I would not know if anything bad is happening. /: yeah, I wanted an ultrasound my ob-gyn is not with it. I wanted blood work done every 2 days but they say wait a week. It is like okay... well thanks. What is making you think it is ectopic? At first, I thought it was a chemical pregnancy, but since my levels did not drop quickly, I toss that out the window. \n\n***from Google:  Time Frame for hCG to Return to Normal***  \n***It can take around a week to return to zero with a chemical pregnancy (a very early pregnancy loss) and up to a month, or even more, with a miscarriage that occurs later in pregnancy. After that, a pregnancy test will not be positive.*** \n\nSince I was early, I feel as if it would have dropped to zero in a week. I think it is an ectopic because of the number increased slowly. My friend thinks I could have ovulated late but if so, it would have been 2 weeks later to match my levels. My report is ready but I cannot view it on the site yet which stinks.... so I will be calling in a few hours to see the levels. Well keep me updated! I know these times are stressful for us but we will make it! Keeping my thoughts with you! thanks so much. my levels did increase to 1500. so I have no idea what is going on now. :/ kind of nervous and such.  I go to the ob-gyn tomorrow so I guess they will do an ultrasound then (I hope).\n\nmy thoughts are with you as well - let me know how it goes in the 30th. I just got my results back from my levels. My first test was 713 on November 21, and on November 23 it was 1315. I do not really know if that is a good sign or not but I think so. I have been having some cramping but I am not sure if that is normal or not. What were your levels before 1500? I think that is good! It is supposed to double every 2 days I believe, right? it almost doubled so I think that is a good sign. when was your last period?\n\nhere is mine:10/4: first day of period11/10: 18 (this pregnancy test was so FAINT in which I thought was a chemical pregnancy). this is when I started bleeding11/10-11/13: bled like my period11/16: 28011/23: 1500\n\nMy levels are slowly creeping so I am not sure what is going on.according to the calculator, I am:You are 7 weeks and 2 days pregnant.(link: (\n\nweek 7 hcg levels should be:  7,650\u2013229,000 mIU/mL(link: ( friend thinks I may have ovulated late, if that is the case, then I would be okay with being in week 6. my levels would match up so I could very much be a week late. but I am not sure how that works. I track my period so I know I am not late with that. \n\nso that is why I am super concerned. Honestly, I read that everyone is levels vary so much that I even if your levels are low, but doubling then you should be fine! Please keep me updated and let me know how it goes! I have just found out my pregnancy is ectopic. I am week 5 of pregnancy (so a week and a half from my missed period and first pregnancy test). \n\nI was having very light spotting (pink blood when wiping) and light cramping. \n\nI went to have a scan and they initially could not see it at all and said its possible that it is too early to tell. Thankfully the second pair of eyes was able to find it and confirm it was ectopic.\n\nHopefully my hcg levels will balance off and I will have a tubal miscarriage otherwise if my hcg levels continue to rise I will need to have an injection which will help the process along. Worst case scenario is surgery.\n\nI hope you are doing OK. It is a scary time but remember that the body will generally do what it needs to do and if not doctors are there to help. I am so sorry that you are going through that. I wish you the best of luck in your journey and I am here if you ever want to chat just message me! I am wondering for reference, what were your hcg levels? Mine did not quite double so that is causing me a little bit of worry. Thank you so much. It was very sad when I first found out, but I am really glad that I know and that I did not find out by it rupturing at week 10 and having to have a fallopian tube removed. \n\nI have not really been monitoring my hcg levels, my nurse told me today but it went over my head. I am going for another blood test on Thursday and will hopefully have more clarity then.\n\nI hope you are OK. Not knowing is so stressful. Are you going to go back in for another scan? What has your doctors told you to do? I have not been told much other than my pregnancy could be too early, or it could be ectopic. She said they would monitor my hcg and I have another scan on November 30th. Hoping to see something on the scan this time! Im hoping I got my dates a little mixed up or something because my ovulation was way later than normal! Fingers crossed everything is OK!! Try not to put yourself under too much stress \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Hi! So they scheduled me for an ultrasound on the 30th too. So we are ultrasound twins. Hoping we both get good results.\n\nThe PA (not doctor) said the levels are increasing at a good rate and the blood they took today should be 3000. If not, then it is not healthy. So now I am freaking out about that. I will not know the results until Monday so it is like great. I should have went to labcorp instead since I would know by Friday. Since its the holiday, the office is closed on Friday. \n\nPA said I could have ovulated late and numbers are not an exact science. \n\nSo here is to waiting until Monday. \n\nEnjoy your Thanksgiving if you are in the states. Cheers to waiting! best of luck to you and I hope everything works out! Happy holidays! Keep me updated on how it goes. I am thinking of you! Hi. Checking to see how your appointment was? I am still waiting on my results but the tech said it was hard to see the sac because of shadowing from my scar tissue. I am at this point, assuming the worse since she did not see the yolk. I am 8 weeks and the sac was so small it took her awhile to find it. Let me tell you how difficult it was for me to hold that bladder. :/ Hoping you had a good turnout. &lt;3 Hello. I am sorry to hear your appointment did not go as planned. I am still praying for you and keep me updated! I went to my appointment yesterday with some pretty fierce lower back pain. But they were able to see the fetal pole (I think that is what it was) and said I was just around 5 weeks. So it turns out I was way earlier than expected. Any update? I am being monitored for suspicion of ectopic pregnancy, but I also had implantation bleeding the day before my period would have been due, similar to what you described. The doctors just keep telling me they do not have any answers for me yet. I just commented and asked if there was any update and then saw this comment! I am glad they were able to see something I wish you all of the best with your pregnancy!!! \u2764\ufe0f Hi there! I know this is so stressful for you, I went through the same thing. I know it is so hard waiting and not having answers. Are you having any pain or other bleeding? Also how far along are you? The doctors told me mostly you will not see anything till 5.5-6 weeks. Even mine at 5.5 weeks was BARELY visible! I hope this helps", "1st ectopic Hey guys so im having an ectopic pregnancy  and luckily they caught it in time and im getting methotrexate.

Ended up with a dose of MTX, then a D&amp;C, and another dose of MTX.\n\nI had exhaustion and some nausea but other than that it was not too bad. I was told to stay out of the sun (ie no sunbathing etc...I was in a beach town at the time), stay away from alcohol and Tylenol etc, as well as to avoid foods rich in folate. \n\nI am not a doctor, that is just what I was told and I obliged.\n\nDo not worry. It was not bad at all, just prepare to be sleepy and lethargic, and perhaps some mild stomach upset. I wish you well. Feel free to DM any time as I had two doses :)\n\nETA: I had a D&amp;C and a second dose of MTX bc the first dose did not work but I am told this is extremely rare. Ok good to know. I will definitely hit you up after i get it done. Still at the ER waiting. How far along were you when you got it? Do you know what your hcg levels were? Mine are around 2800 I was about 5 weeks along and HCG only peaked at 770. But again, do not worry about the 2 dose thing. I was an extremely rare case. Reach out any time! Here OR dm. I know how hard and scary this is! Oh ok gotcha. Yeah i just got the shot and honestly that wasnt bad at all. Im pleasantly surprised and thankful for that lol.

It is been 2 months since my ectopic and I am depressed Hi everyone, I had to go through a really traumatic ectopic experience on my own this April, with my boyfriend and my family unable to come to me since they were stuck on another country due to covid-19 travel restrictions. I was in really severe pain from the ectopic struggling with even walking a few steps or turning to my sides while in bed with nobody to help me for a whole month till they removed the ectopic by surgery in April. I am in a better place now, and have completely healed physically. \n\nHowever, I am still really emotionally damaged, and feel like crying every night even 2 months on. I used to be a really happy person, but I have been feeling worthless for weeks now. I cannot focus on my college work (I have exams coming up), and am really really sad - I do not want to do anything except lay in bed and wallow in my own sadness. I wish I could cuddle up with my bf and tell him how I have been feeling, but I had to go through the whole process alone and now will not see him for months in his home country due to the virus situation. I also feel like my friends, bf, and family were empathetic at first while I was recovering, but now I feel like a burden on everyone because I do not feel like doing anything or even laughing at jokes anymore. \n\nI have just been laying in bed, reading books, and crying. I almost feel mad at the world for putting me through so much pain and suffering on my own, and hate how I am struggling to recover from it. How do I start getting back to normal life? I have exams coming up and while this traumatic experience has ruined my past, I do not want it to ruin my future too :( I am so sorry for your loss. Ectopic pregnancy is a very traumatic experience. I had ectopic surgery in Sept. 2019 at 8 weeks (my first pregnancy), and I still have signs of depression and PTSD from what I experienced. I had depressive episodes and anxiety prior to even getting pregnant. I am thankfully pregnant with our rainbow (16 weeks today!), and when I think about what I went through before, I still cry and feel scared sometimes. It is totally normal to feel depressed. What helped me is continuing to go to see my therapist every 2 weeks, and I still do. It is important to be able to open up to friends and family about what you went through, so you do not have to bottle it up. It was extra hard for me because my sister-in-law and cousin's wife were pregnant around me at the same and now both have their babies. I am not sure if you are having to deal with a similar situation. It is a long healing process and each day you should focus on journaling, meditation, or any other positive self-help techniques to get you through the hard times. Wishing you the best. I have been there and know how hard it is. Hi there, I am really really sorry for your loss. I just went through ectopic last week and while my body is mostly healed (I was able to get it out with the methotrexate, and did not have to have surgery beyond a D+C, which I had to hopefully rule out ectopic) I am riddled with anxiety. \n\nSo, I do not have any advice as I am behind you in timing, but I think what you are going through is normal. I, too, feel like my family and partner are kind of like, \"Well, you are out of the woods now, can we get back to normal?\" \n\nI used to be a college instructor for over a decade. Can you tell your professors what is going on and get an incomplete or postpone the exams? All my friends and former colleagues are making all sorts of allowances for Covid. I wonder if you could catch a break? \n\nIf you have the money for things like therapy, that might be helpful? \n\nJust try to be kind to yourself every day.

I have taken 6 pregnancy tests which were all negtative. I am 43 and use the copper coil / IUD so it seems unlikely that I am pregnant.. \n\nIn the past month I have had some symptoms a bit of bloating and nausea at first then some hot flushes which have now past, however I suspect these are just as likely to be the start of peri menopause. Over the 10 days I have had some discomfort in my left side, hip,left pelvic area and for the past 3 days I have had constant diarrhea. I have had the odd twinge of pain but its mostly just discomfort. My breasts are a bit bigger but its how they are before I am due on my period and if I have just skipped a cycle then I should start my period again within a few days. \n\nI keep swinging between thinking I am perimenopausal or that I am pregnant but of course the negative tests. I have never been pregnant so have no experiance to go on.\n\nShould I be concerned about an ectopic pregnancy or do the negative pregnancy tests rule that out? Typically you would get a positive test whether it is ectopic or not. I would suggest just getting a beta done to be sure and ease the anxiety! \ud83d\udc9c I guess it should be ok then. It may just be I have missed a cycle and now have a period coming and its triggering ibs or something, not typical for me though.\n\nThanks for answering! No problem! If you do not get your period and are still having trouble just get blood drawn \ud83d\udc96 I had an ectopic pregnancy last year. With ectopic you would have a positive test but it is good to rule it out as ectopic pregnancy is the #1 cause of death of women in the first trimester. It could be a cyst. The only way to truly know is to get a scan done. If the pain has been going on that long I would go get checked out. If you are concerned then get it checked out. I believe (but not 100% sure) that sometimes it can be ectopic and not get a positive result on a home pregnancy test (because sometimes the hCG is so slow building it never reaches a level to trigger a test) it would show in the blood test though.  Be confident enough to insist on the blood test  if you want peace of mind and they want to fob you off with 'it is just peri-menopause' without checking.", "Period after surgery Wondering if it is normal to miss your period the month after surgery and removal of my tube/if possible to get pregnant right away?", "Announcing ectopic pregnancy I have been diagnosed of ectopic pregnancy yesterday and my doctor told me I will have to terminate the baby eventually.

How should I explain the situation to them?\n\nThanks in advance!! An ectopic pregnancy is not and never will be a viable pregnancy. It is not considered an abortion to terminate the pregnancy. Your tube can rupture and you can die so this is actually a very dangerous situation where you need to make medical decisions quickly. Your life and your fertility are at stake.

Fertilization in the fallopian tube is dangerous because it can rupture the tube and cause a fatal hemorrhage. Some common symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include unilateral pelvic or abdominal pain, missed menses (period) followed by abnormal bleeding, and signs and symptoms of hemorrhage and shock such as vomiting/nausea, vertigo, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and sharp and severe pain. Pregnancy test result may be positive, but fetus is not identifiable in the uterus via ultrasound (because it is not in the uterus). Superficial swelling and bruising around the umbilicus, also known as the Cullen\u2019s sign, indicates retroperitoneal or intraabdominal bleeding. Medical management such as Methotrexate medication or surgical removal is performed. Methotrexate medication works by inhibiting the cell division and embryo enlargement. This allows prevention of fallopian tube (and other location where ectopic fertilization occurred) by dissolving the pregnancy. Surgical management of salpingostomy can be done is the fallopian tube is not ruptured. If it is ruptured, laparoscopic salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube) is performed. Even if you wish not to go through any procedure, because the fetus is nonviable, it will not be able to grow appropriately due to lack of space and placenta. \n\nUnfortunately, the fetus is nonviable if ectopic pregnancy occurs. As the fetus cannot survive naturally, I believe that it is best to explain to your family member as a category of inevitable spontaneous abortion (inevitable miscarriage) rather than referred to as therapeutic abortion. I do want to address that experiencing ectopic pregnancy is nothing to be ashamed of\u2014it is not your fault. You do not have to feel guilty to announce this to your family member!\n\nReference\n\nCenter for Young Women\u2019s Health.

Retrieved from ( My husband and I are devout Christians, and both my family and my husband\u2019s family are devout Christians as well. I am currently recovering from an ectopic pregnancy. This pregnancy was planned, this baby was wanted, and we were devastated by the situation. Everyone we told understood this for what it was: a pregnancy loss, not an elective termination/abortion. The baby cannot survive outside the uterus (whether you receive treatment or not), and tubal pregnancies are life-threatening for the mother if the tube bursts (which can happen at any time without warning). So the treatment is intended to save the mother\u2019s life in a case where both the mother and child would die otherwise.\n\nStill, I wrestled with having to make a decision in this circumstance. I actually considered refusing treatment, praying for a miracle, and waiting to see what would happen, but I knew of course that my life would be at risk because my tube could rupture at any time. At the end of day, I went ahead with methotrexate, and no one I have spoken with has questioned that decision. They all expressed their sympathy for our loss and concern for my health and well-being.\n\nPrayerfully, your family will understand as well. Best wishes to you. \u2764\ufe0f First of all I am sorry this is happening to you. It is not easy. \n\nTerminating an ectopic pregnancy is to save your life. It can kill you. It is the leading cause of maternal death in first trimester. You are not having an abortion. This is not a choice. You are treating an abnormal pregnancy that is implanted in the wrong place. It can not and will not ever be able to be kept so unless your family wants you to rupture and you also not be alive as well as your pregnancy - they should understand. You are doing the right thing and the only thing. \nI had a true abortion at a very young age and have now gone through 3 ectopic pregnancies in two years. I in NO WAY could ever compare an ectopic pregnancy treatment to an abortion. It is just not apples to apples.", "Hcg levels after methotrexate Hi all!

At the ER they prescribed me UTIs medicines. Today at the scan they said they could not see anything in the uterus, but ovaries and tubes look good? HcG are very low (130 i think).

You need action steps. This sounds like a Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) which is what they call an ectopic when they cannot actually visually find it.\n\nIf they are asking for a repeat blood draw, I think are confirming that your HCG is abnormal for early pregnancy. (They do not believe that you are 6 weeks basically). \nWhen they see the second HCG number (which will probably be low and not double your previous result) that is when I think they will move on to diagnosing it a PUL.\n\nI would guess that you will be prescribed methotrexate.

I am very concerned about whether I am experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. At 10 DPO I tested for pregnancy and got an extremely faint line. For the past few days it has remained extremely faint and maybe increasing just a tad bit. Today at 15 DPO the line is darker than that of 10 DPO but it is still very faint. I also took a digital test which now says yes I am pregnant when about 4 days ago it said I was not. I have had an early miscarriage before and also a chemical pregnancy last month. So i am confused as whether i am having a chemical or ectopic. I have no spotting or bleeding and no pain. My breasts are sore and I feel very tired. But other than that I feel ok. I am mostly worried about the slow line progression. I am away on vacation and cannot go to see my doctor. I am really just hoping to catch an ectopic pregnancy as quickly as possible before I have to lose a Fallopian tube. Is there a way to catch ectopic dearly before there is a rupture. Or is that something that will inevitably happen. Thank you so much for any insight! Get to a doctor and get your bloodwork done. Your OB can advise you are the second blood draw. You cannot solve this yourself without a doctor. Yeah you really need to see your OB because you will never know.. they have to check your blood (hcg) and ultrasound as well. You cannot go based off the color of a line on a test. At home pregnancy tests are not quantitative. They cannot tell you if your HCG is increasing with any amount of certainty because there are many variables that can affect them. Please go to an OBGYN and ask to get a blood test and follow up betas. It is the only true way to know. To me, it sounds like your just regular old pregnant. (I am not a doctor) Slowly rising hCG levels can indicate an ectopic pregnancy. I had a quite definite line at 10DPO (in hindsight darker than it should have been) but it did not change over the next couple of weeks. I had no pain but went to the hospital when I experienced light bleeding at 5 weeks+4. Long story short.. get a blood test. Check your hCG level are rising. If you get seen sooner and get treated sooner and you have a better chance of not needing surgery. I hope you are not and everything is fine. Sending love and best wishes. Thank you so much. Do you mind if I asked if yours resolved on its own? Or did you need medication? I was already naturally miscarrying the ectopic pregnancy by the time I went to the hospital. My hCG levels were closely monitored for several weeks until they reached pre-pregnancy levels. It was a horrible few weeks waiting to miscarry a very much wanted pregnancy but knowing that it was the best medical option..least intervention possible is always best. They call this Expectant Management or wait and see.. again I hope you are not experiencing this but IF you are and you need more advise and support   is a charity which supports people experiencing ectopic pregnancy called the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust and helps people outside the UK too. Wow thank you so much for this info. I did not know you can naturally miscarriage an ectopic! My first miscarriage was at 6 weeks and they could never find anything so at first they thought it was an ectopic but my number eventually decreased so they called it a miscarriage. But now I am suspecting it was an ectopic and I just naturally miscarried. The only thing they said they found was a tiny little empty sac. But it was so tiny in my uterus. This is very hard for me to go through because it is my third miscarriage in 8 months! I am 31 and devastated I will never have babies! Thank you so much for listening and I am sorry you went through that as well! If they found the sac in the uterus then it would have been uterine rather than ectopic. In my case they found the sac in the fallopian tube near the ovary (but as in your case very small). It is certainly possible to miscarry an ectopic pregnancy. I happened to have a fall while getting into a bath the day before bleeding started so I am not sure if that caused my body to reject an already precarious implantation. Who knows. It did resolve by itself physically I have been emotionally dealing with it since because although it was the best outcome medically it is still very difficult emotionally.", "Symptoms? Hi. \n\nI am 28 and accidentally got pregnant. I did not know I could even have children, but was playing it safe while getting back into dating and taking birth control (which, I discovered after that it was expired). \n\nBefore I knew I was pregnant I had some weird symptoms. I had a normal period April 9. Then another not normal period April 28. I had no cramps or other symptoms, I recall only needing to use a pad once or twice and then liners the rest of the time because it was so light. \n\nAround the time I expected my usual period the next month I woke up in the middle of the night with a very severe lower back pain on my right side. I had been having UTI like symptoms and was taking a probiotic. I got up to pee and nearly passed out. I did not have any ibuprofen or other pain relievers on hand so I just rode it out. I think the next weekend I purchased a UTI test and a pregnancy test just to rule things out. I took them both at the same time. UTI test negative, pregnancy positive. I have taken 6 other tests since then and all positive. \n\nMy symptoms remain as SEVERE boob pain (like the only way they do not hurt is if I wear a bra 24/7\u2026 I am a member of the itty bitty titty committee so this is a struggle), mild to severe cramping just on my right side, very little nausea, and my pee smells horrid to me. I bled pretty bad during sex one evening, but that was the only time. I woke up at 5:30am last night to an intense pain on the same right side that felt like something was trying to claw its way out of my abdomen. I had to wake my (now) boyfriend up and have him get me Tylenol and a heating pad. It eventually went away but I woke up this morning feeling like I got hit by a bus. The cramping still continues on and off on the right side today. \n\nI have my first prenatal appointment in the next 2 weeks. I am currently 5 weeks. I just do not feel like the right things are happening in my body, like it is not normal. But then again I do not really know anything. I have never been pregnant before. Should I be concerned? I know I am 28 but doctors scare the shit out of me because I am afraid of bad diagnoses. Stupid, I know. Hey!\nHave you gone to the ER or gotten any bloodwork done? No not yet. I am kind of terrified lol If you are having severe pain and just feeling like something is not right - I would go to the emergency room just to be checked out. Especially since you are not scheduled for an ultrasound for another 2 weeks. I have only had ectopic pregnancies and cramping can be normal in early pregnancy but if anything feels off, you are better off going to get checked out than not. \n\nCall your obgyn or go to the emergency room. They can do a beta hcg test and a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm placement. Any bleeding or pain in pregnancy should be checked out! I made an emergency appointment with my ob because I knew something was not right I started bleeding I thankfully did not have severe pain near my tubes but I had what I would call a twinge it felt weird and wrong I would suggest getting seen ASAP and they can locate the pregnancy Did you get in touch with anyone about what is going on? \ud83d\udc9c", "Did your cramps get worse after eating?

My doc says this is normal after surgery but it is all just very traumatizing and I want to see if others felt this too.

I hope your recovery goes well and you are feeling better soon \u2764\ufe0f I would say I felt a lot of weird feelings internally for 2 weeks. Sometimes it was pain, sometimes uneasiness, sometimes while peeing, sometimes after walking, but it was never long lasting, usually up until a couple of hours, more often at the end of the day. After 2 weeks the weird feelings started subsiding (that is when I was able to go back to work, even it is also just sitting in front of a computer), at 3 weeks I felt almost normal and could walk without feeling weird and now 5 weeks in I would say phyically I am back to how I was feeling before the surgery.\nWishing you a speedy recovery! The actual pain only lasted a couple days for me, but I definitely still feel very twinge-y on the side of the removed tube, even four months later. I would not say it affects my quality of life or anything, but it kind of sucks that it is an ever present reminder lol I am so sorry you have been through this. :( I had my tube rupture and surgery on July 23rd this year. The post op pain primarily faded for me be week 4 but honestly I still notice aching where the tube once was. Not sure what causes it for me. I did not feel fully recovered for a few months!

I am so sorry we are all in this group, but happy we have a place to go for support and info. \ud83d\udc93 Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f I hope you heal quickly!! I had the same issue myself. I wanted to be normal and expected more of myself than was realistic! It is hard not to when you have been through this. I could not agree more about the support of this group! Thank you for sharing your story, it is so helpful to get first-hand experiences versus the general \u201cwhat the doc says\u201d. I think the trauma of everything makes the small pain seem more scary because ultimately that is what landed me in the ER. I feel like I have to be hyper vigilant now \ud83e\udd75 I am glad to hear you are fully healed and that a dull ache (maybe around ovulation?) is very normal. Hope it eventually fades of course. Thanks for your advice, I decided to scale back on work hours until I am feeling better \ud83d\udc9a Sorry you are going through this!! I am on week 3 post op, my tube was saved however, I am having all of these same symptoms. My doc said it can take some people 4 to 6 weeks to recover. However, the past couple days I have had twinges and dull aches as well. Sorry for the TMI but today I had what looked like a mucus plug(per research) after because it shocked me it was so large.  Not sure if that is normal either? I have a docs app on Thursday and plan to ask him then if my symptoms are to be be expected. I am still off work and do not feel mentally to go back yet or physically for that matter. I think everyone recovers differently but it is frustrating \ud83d\ude12. Thanks so much for responding \ud83d\udc9a I am glad your tube was saved! What a relief! Sorry you are still having pain though, it seems to never end. It is good to hear that your doc acknowledged that for some people it takes longer to heal. I think docs always want to tell you the speediest recovery which can be misleading. I really am now thinking I went back to work too soon, but at least I was able to scale back my hours to give more time to rest physically and mentally. I hope your doctor can confirm the mucus plug and let you know if your symptoms are as expected. Keep resting and wishing you comfort during your recovery \ud83d\udc9e Thank you!! It is also so weird because I have pain on my opposite side too which makes no sense \ud83d\ude29 I reached out to doc and waiting to hear back. I am just trying to take it real easy and listen to my body. Sending a hug back!! Oh my goodness same! I had and still even sometimes have pain on the opposite side as well. I called my OB and he told me it was likely my body's hormones freaking out causing the pain, but I cannot say for sure!! Oh my gosh I feel so relieved to hear this is not just me! I know I have a small, functional cyst in the right ovary that is decreasing, but I was terrified something was wrong and causing pain (clearly so traumatized) but my doc also did not seem worried about it. What your doctor says makes sense too. It is probably really hard for that whole system to balance out after losing a tube! Thank you again for responding!! Hoping your pain goes away soon! Oh I totally get it!! I was certain I had another ectopic going on our something. I have also had one painful hemorrhagic cyst since surgery (thanks PCOS) and I was absolutely terrified I was about to lose my other tube. It is so hard not to assume the worst after this trauma. I am still terrified to physically go back to the OB at all. And I hope the same for you!! \u2764\ufe0f Yes, I think taking it easy for a couple of weeks, if circumstances allow, is the best decision. Even though it leaves time for worry and overthinking, overall the body just needs the rest and hopefully it will be ready to move on soon:) I agree, health comes first!! Thank you \ud83d\udc9a Oh my gosh so scary!! I hope your cyst resolved and you are feeling better now! It really is impossible to not be traumatized after all of this.

I hope it will resolve :/ I do not know if this helps but I was told last week that the EP would take another 6 weeks to break down once I hit 0. My hormone level is now 23. Sorry you are going through this. Hope you are doing okay! It is so hard Thanks for your response. I hope it will dissolve bc it is hard to sit for a long time :/ Did your doctor tell you this or someone you know who had been through this told you ?", "It is been 2 months since removal of my tube and I am experiencing the same pain I was feeling when I found out it was ectopic\u2026 it is scaring me. I am \u201covulating\u201d but it feels the same as my ectopic pain :( anyone else have this issue?  100%, yes. Ovulation has been much more painful since surgery. I never noticed it before. It is likely due to scar tissue mixed with a bit of hyper awareness of the area due to trauma. \ud83d\udc97 Yes! Seconding this! Yes I have the same, I never felt ovulation until after my surgery. I do not think it is anything to be concerned about, if anything it feels like being more in tune with my body :)", "Incase this can help Someone someday ", "Period after mtx (ectopic) Hi everyone, I was treated for PUL earlier this month with two shots. Over the course, I have bled heavily twice - once before my first shot, and the second time 2 days after my second shot. My HCG last Wednesday dropped to 15. I have been testing on pregnancy strips daily since then to see if my lines are getting lighter, and today is the first day with no line; yesterday the line was very faint. I am going back on Wednesday for (hopefully) my final blood HCG draw, and I have a feeling (based on progress on my test strips) HCG will be under 5, if not 0. Over the last few days my breasts have started to feel tender, and today I started feeling light period cramps, AND I JUST started spotting, which are symptoms that usually happen just before I get my period. Is it possible that I might be getting my first period this soon?", "Trouble with cycles after ectopic? Has anyone else had trouble with their cycles after ectopic? I am 3 months post ectopic treated with methotrexate. I had my first official cycle after my ectopic in December, and it lasted 45 days. I am on my second cycle and I am currently on CD 19 and have still not ovulated. I have no idea when I am supposed to ovulate since my cycles are so messed up now. I currently have cramps and a little pink spotting today, but my OPKs are still very negative. I am getting so worried I am not going to ovulate. I am just so frustrated because my cycles were so regular before my ectopic and I always ovulated on CD 14/15. I also have never had ovulation cramping or spotting before, so I have no idea if that is what it is or not. I just want to know if anyone else has had long cycles, and weird ovulation symptoms after their ectopic?", "My ectopic pregnancy I had been on what i thought was my period for two weeks and i had made an appointment with an obgyn for all this as my co-worker had told me this sounded exactly like her miscarriage. so i made the appointment and was told that if i was to fill a pad within an hour i would have to go to the emergency room but i was not so i was not worried quite yet. i got off work at 6:00 and it started to really hurt and bleed quite a bit more. my boyfriend insisted he take me to the hospital but i got very anxious and did not want to go yet. i called my mom and she said that i should head in when getting checked in i was winded and felt very faint so we sat down and it got worse i tried to puke and nothing came up and then i felt i was about to pass out so they took me back and took everything the doctors and nurses were very kind but the doc dropped a bomb on us saying i was pregnant i am (19f) and he is (20m) we were immediately freaked out and then they came back saying it was an ectopic pregnancy and that i would need to have surgery right away. this was my first surgery and i has never been put under so i was very scared and nervous. my boyfriend was the most perfect person to have through this and even though we did not want children right now we still were just saddened by it. not only did all of this happen in one night the next day i got fired for requesting time off after having this surgery. overall bad experience. I am so sorry for your experience. Grief is normal and understandable even if you were not trying to conceive. Please allow yourself time to heal and really reach out to your support network. I initially was reluctant but friends really helped me through the tough times. Sending tons of hugs from an internet stranger This is so terrible, and losing your job. I am so sorry you are going through this, but so many of us have. Here for you", "ectopic pregnancy I need help! so last month I had a very faint positive pregnancy test but the next day I started my period and I had this INTENSE severe pain in my left ovary which felt like it was going to explode. it is was so unbearable. and it lasted for 3 days of my period. then 1 month later I find out I am really pregnant and this week should be my period but it never came but the same left side pain CAME BACK it feels like something is going to explode. like my ovary is being squished. the pain does not last for not even a minute and it comes every hour or even 4 hours. I went to the er and they hcg levels are 549 at 4 weeks but no gestational sac was seen. can this be an ectopic pregnancy. and what about last month on my period? the pain the same except it was worse last month It might be too small to see on a scan but if you are in this much pain please keep going to the hospital. With mine they took my blood every day for several days to see a trend. \nHope you get answers soon and hope it is good news the thing is the pain comes every couples of hours and only last like less than 30 seconds.. and I am wondering why I had the same pain last month on my period?\ntomorrow I have an appointment for more blood work to see if the levels rose or not My ectopic was similar. Faint positive followed the next day by period. Then I had one terrible night of intense pain. We the next day barely any pain could not see a sac hcg was 500ish. 2 days later a dull pain they saw something by my ovary but was not sure. Following day I passed out twice from the internal bleeding and was in surgery by 4pm. I cannot stress enough to advocate for yourself. I hope you have a better outcome and good luck. but after my period the pain went away and everything went back to normal. and one month later I am pregnant and the pain is back....so I am like what is going on?? I had a period in January and then I found out I had an ectopic pregnancy since January I took a pregnancy test in February just before my period would start and then I went in for an ultrasound and no gestational sac was found (oddly no pain). I went back 3 days later and they checked my tubes and found it. it was ectopic in my left Fallopian tube and I had to get the tube removed. Go in and have then check your tubes and ovaries to see if you are ectopic.\n\nGo get it looked at I had no pain and just some feeling of twinges in my left side. My hcg levels were in the 800 mark. It did not make sense that I had no pain. But i was in emergency surgery. Go get it checked if they do not find the sac in the uterus it is SOMEWHERE. And if it is somewhere where it is not supposed to be that is dangerous for you.", "I had to have emergency surgery last night to remove an ectopic pregnancy on my left tube. Does the pain (mentally and physically) ever go away?  Yeah it do Hi! First time ever commenting on a Reddit post but this struck a chord. I am 20 and had an ectopic at the age of 18 (was on birth control and served as a complete surprise). \nI am phobic of hospitals and my lifelong fear is surgery, so as you can imagine it was a traumatising day. \n\nThis is all relevant because I am telling you that whilst the memory of what happened will never leave you, and on reflection it can be rather upsetting, you will recover and you will be able to look back feeling a lot stronger as a person. \n\nPhysically my scars healed to a point where they are completely invisible (I had keyhole surgery so they were not big anyway, but still) and while I suffered with nightmares and a severe feeling of guilt and pain for quite a long time, the acknowledgement that it is NOT your fault at all and sometimes bad things happen to people who do not deserve it, and there is nothing you could have done to ever prevent what happened, is  what kept me going. \n\nI hope your recovery process is going okay. Always here for support This was my second pregnancy. I had made the difficult and traumatizing decision to have an abortion with my first and when I found out I was pregnant this time I was so excited. I was only 5 weeks and 2 days so thankfully I caught it soon enough before major complications arose. They were able to save both my ovaries but had to remove my left Fallopian tube. Whilst they tell you that it obviously affects your fertility, please do not do what I did and think that you are now forever doomed. I am currently 8 months pregnant and everything has been incredibly healthy and normal.\nI also had my left Fallopian tube removed and completely empathise with what you are probably going through right now. I am glad you caught it in time and just know that the pain you are feeling right now will not last forever and better times are ahead. Yes. Omg. Can I ask how you found you were pregnant? How many weeks along were you ? I had severe stomach cramps that lasted around 3 days, I was in university at the time and I literally was unable to move from my dorm bed for 3 days to get food or water because I was in so much pain (but I admittedly have a ridiculously low pain threshold). \n\nI did a test after ringing the NHS non-emergency line, first came back negative, second was inconclusive. Lady on the phone said it was very unlikely I was pregnant and the issue may just be food poisoning. Later that night I fainted after trying to get a glass of water and was found by a room-mate. \n\nLong story short, I would been internally bleeding for like 3 days and they found the ectopic after doing an ultrasound. I was 5 weeks and around 5 days. If you are having any kind of doubt please please book an appointment with your GP. If I had done that three days prior it would have saved me a lot of heartache. Wishing you all the best x Did they take a urine test which came back negative ? I told the doctors at A&amp;E about my negative tests and because they were worried it was appendicitis after I first arrived they did not do a urine and instead sent off for a blood test. They found out through that that I was pregnant. Oh so do you remember how much your hcg was in that blood test ? No sorry! It was around 2 years ago now so I would not be able to say I understand. 5 weeks is pretty early on ! Did you have your period or bleeding that made you assume it was not anything pregnancy related ? Or did you miss your period ? I have always had irregular periods so it did not strike me as particularly off, but I would had very light spotting the week prior so I think I just chalked it up to a light period and moved on Sept 2020 I lost my left Fallopian tube to an ectopic pregnancy.   I felt so lost  and mourned the loss of my baby for months and still do.  The pain physically will get better before the pain of your lost baby and tube.   Things will get better though.  Stay positive.   There is lots of hope for you to get pregnant again. And you will.   I am now 6.5 months pregnant expecting a baby boy, due in September 2021.   This was while also having PCOS ,also effecting my fertility so while you think the odds are against you... believe me you will have your child. Prayers.  And love your way.  I had two ectopic pregnancies many years ago.   I would easily tell you 'it is fine' 'it was for the best' blah blah blah.   And then now, all these years later, I am attempting to deal with them.  Deal with the loss of two babies, additions to my family, siblings to my daughter.    And it is hard.   Because there is a solid block of denied emotion I am having to chip at.   And I do not know where to begin.    But what I do know, is I should have let myself feel my sorrow back then......because denying it was not and has not been healthy.  And I do not know how to do that at this point.  But I am going to try.  They were scary.  I was told if they had gone on I could have died.   I was not believed the second time.   If you feel a need to get counseling, please do.   None was offered to me, I was just expected to 'buck up'.   I did not even know that it was something I might need.   It would have been better all around if I had tried to find a support group I think.     I wish for you peace and joy and I hope my experience makes yours better.  I am going to write a letter i think to those two babies and let them know they were missed.", "When did you figure out that you had ectopic pregnancy? I am 7week pregnant and tbh i did medical abortion but it was not successful but had light brown discharge and slight bleeding which is already making me worried, i recently heard of ectopic pregnancy which made me more worried as i am having weird ache in the abdomen the more i read the more i get anxious if i have ectopic pregnancy.. I figured it out in the beginning of the 5th week because of ultrasounds \u2013 I would highly recommend that you do one! Doing some blood tests to measure hcg levels would also help, get to a doctor! I went to do my ultrasound when i was 4w6d and doctor did not mention anything, after i took the MA that was not successful i just started having brownish light discharge and few slight bleeding When I was rushed to the ER due to internal bleeding. Ha! At which hour i wast did rush to the er due to internal bleeding.  Ha!\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` what symptoms did you feel tho that you were rushed to the ER? :/ I figured it out at 4 weeks, probably almost 5. Did you get an ultrasound before getting prescribed the medicine for your abortion? Usually doctors do that to confirm that the embryo implanted in your uterus. Extreme pressure and pain in my abdomen that worsened with time. I passed out due to blood loss at one point before going to the hospital. what happened then? did you needed surgery? i am sorry to hear about all this, i am having abdomen pain from time to time that comes and go but thought it\n's normal pregnancy symptoms because when i went for my first ultrasound doctor said it is normal to have abdomen pain I got an ultrasound sound at 4w6d and doctor didnt say anything and no i was not prescribed as they refused to help prevent the pregnancy, in where i live they will not help prevent pregnancy but we managed to get those set of pills and just took it unfortunately then it was not successful so we trying to get another set but we are having hard time finding one again I did. I had emergency laparoscopic surgery (sometimes called keyhole surgery) to remove the ectopic pregnancy. The doctors were able to save my fallopian tube, however. Trust your gut and your body. If you feel like something is not quite right, definitely talk to your doctor! Oof  \ud83d\ude23 thank youu. and i am sorry to hear this experience and hope all is well now I found out mine was ectopic when I was in the emergency room. It was my first pregnancy and my first appointment was not supposed to be until I was 10 weeks along. I was 7 weeks and 6 days along. Just after midnight I had a sharp pain and could not stand up straight. I thought it was gas and needed to poop, I did not feel better after that. 2:30am I took antacids thinking I had a bad belly ache and I was pale. 3:30am more antacids and I looked like I was 5 months pregnant, then I was throwing up. We thought it was morning sickness. 4:00am diarrhea and still vomiting. I thought it was food poisoning. Or diarrhea with morning sickness. 6:30 still vomiting and diarrhea. Then short, shallow breathing and profuse sweating all over my entire body that smelled like vinegar. One of those symptoms came first but I do not remember which one. I thought that the sweating was a fever from food poisoning and I could not find a thermometer anywhere to check my temperature. By 7:30am I was getting light headed by 8:30am I lost my hearing then vision for about 30 seconds, and that is when we knew that I needed to go to the hospital. We know now that we should have called for an ambulance. 9:30am I was at the hospital and my blood sugar was 353, I was so cold and shivering almost uncontrollably. My blood pressure would drop when I would stand which made me dizzy. By 10:30-11:00 they found on the ultrasound that I had an ectopic pregnancy and needed emergency surgery. They had to transport me to another hospital location for surgery so by 12-12:30pm I was in surgery and had lost 2 1/2 liters of blood and would have only had one hour left to live if I did not get into surgery when I did. Omg i am so sorry you had to go thro that horrible experience, i am getting scared now because i am about 7w5d and suddenly awhile ago i had a sharp pain in my stomach or abdomen and a lil back ache that goes and come tho i booked an appointment asap for today hopefully clinic will be available... i am getting so worried now \ud83d\ude2d Did you know you were pregnant? I did not. Well, I sort of did. I got a positive test but the numbers were not doubling in blood tests. I had what I thought was a regular period. Pregnancy was in my left Fallopian tube. Tues 6/8, at 8 weeks. I called the on-call doctor because I was having severe cramps and started bleeding. The cramps started first, but I was a bit constipated that day and it felt like that could be the cause. The pressure from sitting down made it worse. I started bleeding right after dinner and knew those two symptoms warranted medical attention. On-call doctor advised I go to their UC. I got my first prenatal ultrasound, transvag ultrasound, pelvic exam, and my first blood work since confirming I was pregnant. My HCG was low, between 1,800 and 1,900. They did not find anything in my uterus. UC doctor gave us the news and urged we go to their ER. I was luckily able to go on methotrexate instead of emergency surgery. I have been cramping, spotting, and bleeding intermittently ever since..", "mixed emotions hello! i (20) just received my dosages of methotrexate and am home from the ER. \n\ni found out i was pregnant on june 4, found out it was ectopic june 16th, finally pulled the trigger and let them fix the issue this morning, june 23rd.\n\ni had an IUD, kyleena to be exact. for almost 2.5 years. it caused me all sorts of hell.\n\nmissed periods- no cycles for up to 6 months, severe and worsening/stubborn acne, severe bloating that triggered my BDD, just all around not good.\n\ni did not want a child. i am 20. i do not have an apartment, or a husband, or more than $5,000 to my name. i have many mental illnesses and am not ready to be a mother. having my pregnancy turn out to be ectopic gave me a sense of relief. having the drug administered and now about to \u2018miscarry\u2019 feels like i have my life back in my hands.\n\nso,,,, why am i.... sad (?) \n\ni feel this kind of sunken-ness in my chest. a heaviness in my shoulders. maybe i did want to be a mother, i know i could not have been given my circumstances- but who knows, right?\n\non one hand, i am able to have my top surgery next month, i do not have to waste any money on more doctor visits, i do not have to worry about providing for someone else- i just got to focus on me.\n\nbut putting my hands on my stomach and singing, made me feel less shitty about the world. i liked having to put \u201cpregnant\u201d on medical papers. i liked the thought of raising a really awesome, progressive, cool as fuck little vegan- but i guess that was just a dream, at least for now. \n\nwho knows, i do not know why i am even typing this out. i just know that i am in store for a lot of pain and blood today, and probably a lot of tears. I had an ectopic 2 years ago, I was not trying to get pregnant either.  But I did feel the same heaviness and sadness.  I think a lot of it was hormones, trauma of the whole situation (I was absolutely shocked plus it was ruptured so I went into emergency surgery) and this feeling of loss.  It does get better.\n\nTake care of yourself.  Find someone non judgemental to talk to and give yourself sometime to grieve.  Hugs from Montreal.", "Should I get checked? I am 6weeks pregnant and have started to feel off\u2026.who knows I have never been pregnant before so maybe it is in my head but, I googled it and apparently you may not get some of the symptoms. I have got all the major symptoms except pain in my left arm and no bleeding\u2026.should I go get checked or wait to see if I bleed? It is worth going to make sure everything is okay if you are having symptoms. By 6 weeks, the doctor should be able to see something in the uterus which will confirm everything is okay or confirm your suspicions.\n\nEither way, you should know. With my ectopic, I also did not have bleeding or shoulder pain. Mainly had aching in my lower abdomen and groin area. Best of luck! I just had my second pregnancy, both were ectopic. Go and get blood work, it is easy and can save your life. Definitely get checked ASAP if you feel off. I am currently going through ectopic pregnancy now, and the last 2 weeks have been hell. And i thought something was off, and i waited too long. Catch it early if its something wrong. Blood work is fine, but have an ultrasound ASAP. No harm in getting checked! If you do not get checked and something is not right it could end up being really bad. All my love \u2764\ufe0f"]
